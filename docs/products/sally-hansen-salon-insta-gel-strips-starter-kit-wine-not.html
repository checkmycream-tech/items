            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>NOT SO AWESOME!.</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>I prepared my nails per the directions, followed the application directions, and they seemed to set beautifully.</li>
            <li>Worked great.</li>
            <li>Great quality for the price.</li>
            <li>, I am great at painting my own nails so the strips are great for me!</li>
            <li>Work great... got it for the mini led light and works perfect...</li>
            <li>They came out good and lasted about five days before I got board with them.</li>
            <li>The price is great and after reading the instructions I was able to apply the strips and gel polish easily with awesome results.  </li>
            <li>This kit is a glorified TOP COAT!</li>
            <li>It looked great and the process was just as easy.</li>
            <li>i have found that they go on smoother when the weather is warm, but they also tear easier.someone else suggested putting tape around the mouth of the gel</li>
            <li>Looks nice while it lasts.</li>
            <li>I actually love the idea of this, and felt that it gave me a good manicure (I&#x27;ve used it with both the strips and the gel polish...</li>
            <li>then i tried using it 2 more times</li>
            <li>I love Sally Hansen nail strips, I use them all the time.</li>
            <li>Just apply the top coat to one finger and put it under the lamp.</li>
            <li>think you can use whatever you like and just treat it like a gel top coat kit.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It just cost me more.</li>
            <li>And they sure don&#x27;t wear even 1/10th as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was very excited to try it as I love to do my nails.</li>
            <li>but I love how easy they are</li>
            <li>Works great for an at home professional manicure.</li>
            <li>The most important thing to keep in mind is gel is not like reg nail polish.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and comes out looking very pretty.</li>
            <li>Details: 2 easy steps to put Insta Gel Strips on your nails.  </li>
            <li>For best results cure after each coat of top coat polish and 3 coats is a good number for long lasting Chip resistant.</li>
            <li>such  a great idea that i will keep trying...</li>
            <li>To me it is worth the money just to get the top coat.</li>
            <li>This was a perfect waste of money and time.</li>
            <li>Worth the $13 for sure.</li>
            <li>I was able to stop it from progressing by applying a fresh coat of gel topcoat and re-curing under the lamp.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I really like this kit very easy to use for anybody.</li>
            <li>: Easy to do, especially if you aren&#x27;t good with clean lines.</li>
            <li>There is nothing special here.</li>
            <li>I made sure to buff my nails really well and clean them thoroughly with the alcohol wipes.</li>
            <li>If this won&#x27;t hold up to light work, it surely won&#x27;t hold up under my normal working conditions.</li>
            <li>So, I expected great things from this</li>
            <li>Just not as good as her regular nail strips.</li>
            <li>And I really like it. :)</li>
            <li>The lamp is easy to use, just plug it in and when you are ready, put 1 finger under the light and press the button.</li>
            <li>kit comes with the mini LED lamp, 16 gel polish strips (more on this later), a bottle of the gel top coat and the nail cleanser pads.</li>
            <li>the Stage\\&quot; which is a sparkly gunmetal grey (funky &amp; gorgeous), and used the kit to apply that color instead of the one it came with.</li>
            <li>Hansen also has different colors of these, super cute!</li>
            <li>Liked how it looked the first couple of days, like a professional manicure.</li>
            <li>This is worth the buy because it works will.</li>
            <li>looked nice enough when i finished</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the buy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Lots of fun nail polish colors in reds and pinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it if you are willing to take the time to do it right.</li>
            <li>These are pretty easy to apply but aren&#x27;t very rugged.</li>
            <li>The color is great on all skin shades I think but you need to make sure you file off any extra strip around the nail and apply thin coats of the top coat polish.</li>
            <li>It does not stay on and was hard to get a good fit with the material provided.</li>
            <li>i have yet to get these strips to last more than 6 days, but im working on it.</li>
            <li>I would have given them 3 stars (maybe even 4), but the lamp doesn&#x27;t stay on consistently.</li>
            <li>So I tried the top coat that comes with it with regular nail polish.</li>
            <li>Make sure you read the instructions first, especially if you&#x27;ve never used gel polish before.  </li>
            <li>I also need to add that the gel refills for this kit sell for five dollars more than the regular Sally Hansen polish strips.</li>
            <li>got me thinking, I wonder if I can use the regular Sally Hansen nail strips with this LED lamp, which I already love and are five dollars cheaper than these \\&quot;gel\\&quot; strips.</li>
            <li>By using regular polish that gives you a better variety of color options.</li>
            <li>I followed he directions exactly.</li>
            <li>Liked not dealing with wet or &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; nails</li>
            <li>so mine didn&#x27;t last more than a couple days.</li>
            <li>I tried Sally Hansen Insta-gel strips for the first time, and I followed the directions explicitly.  </li>
            <li>They are a little extra work but super shiney and look great.  </li>
            <li>The process was easy enough, and they do dry instantly after using the UV light, which is nice.</li>
            <li>First time I used it, surprisingly it really works.  </li>
            <li>i used it for the first time with regular nail polish and it was fine.</li>
            <li>Easier to remove than a real gel manicure.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t done much since I put this stuff on</li>
            <li>In fact, the kit has a very involved process of soaking your nails in remover to get them off.</li>
            <li>I guess if you don&#x27;t need your hands at all they might stay on a whole day..</li>
            <li>I must admit that the process is very labor-intensive.</li>
            <li>#3- they really need to sell the gel strips alone without thewhole \\&quot;refill kit\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>There is enough gel polish in the started kit to use more than once (which is weird b/c if you buy the refill pack which is good for 1 use [again, more on this later] there is a whole new bottle of the gel polish).</li>
            <li>I also found Sally Hansen&#x27;s tip to leave your thumbs bare until last very important.</li>
            <li>I also do not like that you basically have to soak your fingernails in acetone nail polish remover to take the polish off, which I understand is true of all gel polishes, but its just not what I feel like doing since I just did my nails last night.  </li>
            <li>After the light, the gel polish is dry, though if you touch it you will feel a stickiness.</li>
            <li>For the price these are decent.</li>
            <li>I love the designs but its just sooooooooo not worth it!</li>
            <li>Also, I had major chips after the first day of normal wear.</li>
            <li>CAN chip, even with a few top</li>
            <li>I had plenty of the normal strips laying about, so I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>All you really need is extra strips, not a whole new bottle of top coat, file, etc</li>
            <li>I layer the top coat over my normal nail polish and it lasts for weeks and is far less hassle than applying the gel strips which come with it.</li>
            <li>Tip let regular nail polish dry before applying the top coat and wipe the sticky residue with rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>With as awesome as these little strips are, a 1 time use per kit is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li>No chips and looks brand new for up to 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be purchasing a box here pretty soon.</li>
            <li>did the exact same process with the lamp.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using polish strips and I am definitely hooked!</li>
            <li>And instead of using the lamp for 30 sec I did a full minute.  </li>
            <li>When I apply the first strip, I file it off, peel off the silver tab from the top part, TURN IT AROUND and apply the other side of the same strip to the same nail on the opposite hand.</li>
            <li>You can fix the peeling by filing it a bit and applying another clear coat.</li>
            <li>you get the whole kit even though it says gel polish only</li>
            <li>Not messy.</li>
            <li>This is a real problem since you can only put one finger in at a time.</li>
            <li>However, the chipping (which isn&#x27;t terribly frequent) just is what it is.</li>
            <li>The strips are pretty long.</li>
            <li>The light broke after just a few uses.  </li>
            <li>Within 1 day, the strips peeled completely off 3 nails while I was washing my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe people aren&#x27;t using them right or following the instructions because a week later and I still have a salon quality looking manicure.</li>
            <li>Review: there are 6 main steps each with smaller steps to follow.  </li>
            <li>This does include a small light, the description states not included but it was.</li>
            <li>the light is small than it</li>
            <li>If you have ever used polish strips, you apply these in the same way you normally would.</li>
            <li>I tended to choose a strip that was just slightly wider than my nail, and then used my thumbnails (which are pretty thin and sharp) to kind of tuck-in the edges around my nail bed, severing off any extra strip and making a perfectly clean edge.</li>
            <li>OK the strips were a slight pain to use but other than that</li>
            <li>I did not like this, and sure enough, being too thick they start to come up at the edges after a couple days.</li>
            <li>I only stretched each strip minimally and kind of patted it down on my nail as I moved upward.</li>
            <li>The strips included don&#x27;t adhere nearly as well as the standard ones.</li>
            <li>The stickers were terribly frustrating to apply, and I thought, perhaps, proper gel polish might work better.</li>
            <li>Hey, no dry time, No chip-</li>
            <li>So far I am on day 5 and have only one minor chip.</li>
            <li>Overall impression: Lasts slightly longer than a regular mani, but nothing like a real gel one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>

            <li> The strips are pretty long.</li>
            <li> The light broke after just a few uses.  </li>
            <li> Within 1 day, the strips peeled completely off 3 nails while I was washing my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> the light is small than it</li>
            <li> If you have ever used polish strips, you apply these in the same way you normally would.</li>
            <li> I tended to choose a strip that was just slightly wider than my nail, and then used my thumbnails (which are pretty thin and sharp) to kind of tuck-in the edges around my nail bed, severing off any extra strip and making a perfectly clean edge.</li>
            <li> OK the strips were a slight pain to use but other than that</li>
            <li> I did not like this, and sure enough, being too thick they start to come up at the edges after a couple days.</li>
            <li> I only stretched each strip minimally and kind of patted it down on my nail as I moved upward.</li>
            <li> The strips included don&#x27;t adhere nearly as well as the standard ones.</li>
            <li> The stickers were terribly frustrating to apply, and I thought, perhaps, proper gel polish might work better.</li>

            <li> If your nails aren&#x27;t too long, you can actually use 1 strip on two nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>

            <li> Over all, the process was easy as pie, but I was still unhappy with the overall results.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> When applying the strips they tell you to stretch each one towards the tip, and I noticed several other reviews mentioning that the strips broke off when they did this.</li>
            <li> the other starter kits, you can only do one nail at a time.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i have yet to get these strips to last more than 6 days, but im working on it. i hope its just my application skills that need improving, because this will be a lifesaver if i can get it to last 10 - 14 days. i have found that they go on smoother when the weather is warm, but they also tear easier.someone else suggested putting tape around the mouth of the gel and you probably should do that. the gel seems to build up or something around the rim and it becomes hard to close completely. such  a great idea that i will keep trying...</li>
            <li> It worked just as it said when the directions are followed. It does take a bit of time to do. But my nails looks like I went to the salon for a gel manicure.</li>
            <li> Work great... got it for the mini led light and works perfect...you get the whole kit even though it says gel polish only</li>
            <li> Overall impression: Lasts slightly longer than a regular mani, but nothing like a real gel one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Easy to do, especially if you aren&#x27;t good with clean lines. Looks nice while it lasts. Easier to remove than a real gel manicure. Not messy. Price. If your nails aren&#x27;t too long, you can actually use 1 strip on two nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: LED has a short and doesn&#x27;t stay on. When I say short, I mean it doesn&#x27;t stay on for the normal 30 second period. It goes on for 3 seconds, then flickers out. You restart it and it stays on for 5 seconds, etc. Peels slightly about a week in. CAN chip, even with a few top coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is an instance of \\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot;. I would have given them 3 stars (maybe even 4), but the lamp doesn&#x27;t stay on consistently. This is a real problem since you can only put one finger in at a time. You can fix the peeling by filing it a bit and applying another clear coat. However, the chipping (which isn&#x27;t terribly frequent) just is what it is.</li>
            <li> Such a joke. Doesn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had my fingers under this thing for at least 30 minutes apiece, and it still didn&#x27;t harden the gel polish. Also, the black part you lay your finger on inside will dye your fingertips black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this and used it as the directions indicate. They came out good and lasted about five days before I got board with them. So I tried the top coat that comes with it with regular nail polish. Worked great. Tip let regular nail polish dry before applying the top coat and wipe the sticky residue with rubbing alcohol. I also used the led lamp to help my regular nail polish dry faster.  And instead of using the lamp for 30 sec I did a full minute.  The regular nail polish lasted over a week. To me it is worth the money just to get the top coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a big fan of the regular nail strips so I decided to give this kit a try.  The price is great and after reading the instructions I was able to apply the strips and gel polish easily with awesome results.  Make sure you read the instructions first, especially if you&#x27;ve never used gel polish before.  I thought I&#x27;d done something wrong at first, because my nails felt tacky.  In reality I&#x27;d forgotten a step after curing my nails, and had to re-read the instructions to remember to use the cleansing pads to remove the tacky finish.  They are a little extra work but super shiney and look great.  I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  You can only do one nail at a time.  Strips were totally useless.  Thank God, it was only $8.44 but I should have sent it back because it is no Salon anything.  .</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to getting my nails done in the salon.  It does not stay on and was hard to get a good fit with the material provided.</li>
            <li> This is worth the buy because it works will. The color is great on all skin shades I think but you need to make sure you file off any extra strip around the nail and apply thin coats of the top coat polish. For best results cure after each coat of top coat polish and 3 coats is a good number for long lasting Chip resistant. Mirror shine look. My nail has lasted going on 3 weeks and I can see them lasting for a month but I love how easy they are I have changed them twice</li>
            <li> I just purchased this kit in a retail store today. It was on clearance for $13.99, and I thought I would give it a try. I prepared my nails per the directions, followed the application directions, and they seemed to set beautifully. Except that now, three hours later, they are peeling off and chipping all over the place. I haven&#x27;t done much since I put this stuff on (I washed my hands once, ran the vacuum in one room, and did some typing). I am extremely disappointed. If this won&#x27;t hold up to light work, it surely won&#x27;t hold up under my normal working conditions. This was a perfect waste of money and time. The stickers were terribly frustrating to apply, and I thought, perhaps, proper gel polish might work better. I doubt I&#x27;ll give this a second try.</li>
            <li> My lamp didn&#x27;t work and since it was taken outside of the us (I bought it as a gift) the warranty doesn&#x27;t apply anymore.</li>
            <li> I actually love the idea of this, and felt that it gave me a good manicure (I&#x27;ve used it with both the strips and the gel polish... I find the strips a bit difficult to apply unless you have a VERY steady hand).&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve given it only 2 stars because the LED lamp broke after 2 manis! The connector for the power on the back of the unit disconnected inside. It was possible to get it open, but the piece that should be attached to the motherboard inside could NOT be reattached / maintain a connection.&lt;br /&gt;Very shoddily made in my opinion - especially considering the cost.</li>
            <li> Just not as good as her regular nail strips.</li>
            <li> OK the strips were a slight pain to use but other than that I don&#x27;t know what all the negative reviews are about. Maybe people aren&#x27;t using them right or following the instructions because a week later and I still have a salon quality looking manicure. Worth the $13 for sure.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift and my mother couldn&#x27;t have been happier.  You can also choose different colors if you choose.</li>
            <li> i used it for the first time with regular nail polish and it was fine. then i tried using it 2 more times and it just was not drying. mabe theres something to the cleansing whipes. im not sure but it doesnt make it salon quality</li>
            <li> I had this before. It&#x27;s as expected.</li>
            <li> I believe it is all about how you put on this product for it to last! I was reading the other 2 reviews and that has not happened to me. I had a nail promo girl put this on me while she was doing a demo at Walgreens. The strips last forever!! No chips and looks brand new for up to 2 weeks. The girl also had strips and she works at a hospital and she says it stays on despite all the handwashing and alcohol and all that. I am also a nursing student so I need something that will last. Hospitals says no acrylics so these are perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sally Hansen also has different colors of these, super cute! Will definitely be purchasing a box here pretty soon.</li>
            <li> Let me just say, I work at the store that sells these and I was very excited to try it as I love to do my nails. I love Sally Hansen nail strips, I use them all the time. When the GEL strips came out with this little LED lamp, I was intrigued. Let me also point out, the store I work at sells this item for quite a bit less than what I see here on Amazon. I also need to add that the gel refills for this kit sell for five dollars more than the regular Sally Hansen polish strips. Onto the actual review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with the mini LED lamp, 16 gel polish strips (more on this later), a bottle of the gel top coat and the nail cleanser pads. If you have ever used polish strips, you apply these in the same way you normally would. Apply them all to your fingers then begin with the gel polish. Just apply the top coat to one finger and put it under the lamp. The lamp is easy to use, just plug it in and when you are ready, put 1 finger under the light and press the button. It stays on 30 seconds, turns off when the 30 seconds are up. Do this for each finger. After the light, the gel polish is dry, though if you touch it you will feel a stickiness. Wipe your nail with the cleanser pads to remove the stickiness and you are done. It is very easy to use and comes out looking very pretty. I did notice the strips for this kit are thicker than are the non-\\&quot;gel\\&quot; strips Sally Hansen makes. I did not like this, and sure enough, being too thick they start to come up at the edges after a couple days. In fact, the kit has a very involved process of soaking your nails in remover to get them off. All I had to do was get my fingernail under the raised edges and peel each off in one go. Very odd. Also, I had major chips after the first day of normal wear. Over all, the process was easy as pie, but I was still unhappy with the overall results.&lt;br /&gt;This got me thinking, I wonder if I can use the regular Sally Hansen nail strips with this LED lamp, which I already love and are five dollars cheaper than these \\&quot;gel\\&quot; strips. Both strips seem identical except how I mentioned the gel strips were thicker. I had plenty of the normal strips laying about, so I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the exact same process with the lamp. There is enough gel polish in the started kit to use more than once (which is weird b/c if you buy the refill pack which is good for 1 use [again, more on this later] there is a whole new bottle of the gel polish). To get rid of that stickiness that I mentioned I just wiped each finger with a wet wipe. You can also use an alcohol pad if you have them b/c that&#x27;s all the nail cleanser pads are, essentially. It looked great and the process was just as easy. I am on day 4 of this manicure and NO CHIPS and only slight wear at the tips. I have gotten multiple compliments at work. My overall impression? This kit is a glorified TOP COAT! And I really like it. :)&lt;br /&gt;I think you can use whatever you like and just treat it like a gel top coat kit. Don&#x27;t buy the more expensive refill kits. Use the regular strips. My next experiment? Regular nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto my little secret about these strip kits. Each kit comes with 16 strips, and with 10 fingers, that is a 1 time use. With as awesome as these little strips are, a 1 time use per kit is pretty expensive. I keep my nails short. The strips are pretty long. When I apply the first strip, I file it off, peel off the silver tab from the top part, TURN IT AROUND and apply the other side of the same strip to the same nail on the opposite hand. If that makes sense, you can use HALF the strips this way, and get two uses out of each refill kit. :) Good luck! I hope you all give this kit a try!</li>
            <li> Works great for an at home professional manicure. I use regular nail polish with the gel coat over that and it works the same as when I had my nails done at a shop. By using regular polish that gives you a better variety of color options.</li>
            <li> I followed he directions exactly. looked nice enough when i finished but hours later my nails chipped and peeled. Strips did not adhere at all! i am so disappointed, I thought this would save me the money of going to the salon. It just cost me more.</li>
            <li> As a mom I thought ..Hey, no dry time, No chip- Awesome. NOT SO AWESOME!. Within an hour 2 had chipped...within 3 hours 2 other ones had peeled off. I guess if you don&#x27;t need your hands at all they might stay on a whole day..but I&#x27;m not betting on it. Save your money. There is nothing special here.</li>
            <li> Time consuming to put on and especially to remove.  Does Not last 2 weeks.  Chips after a few days. Liked how it looked the first couple of days, like a professional manicure. Liked not dealing with wet or &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; nails</li>
            <li> This is not a good product. The light broke after just a few uses.  The gel strips did not work. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use.  I layer the top coat over my normal nail polish and it lasts for weeks and is far less hassle than applying the gel strips which come with it.</li>
            <li> For the price these are decent. I bought them to compare to a pricier product (jamberry) which I was highly disappointed with. These are pretty easy to apply but aren&#x27;t very rugged. For someone that doesn&#x27;t do a lot of manual labor these would last a while. However, I am the opposite so mine didn&#x27;t last more than a couple days. I also found the gel to be sticky and didn&#x27;t set as it was supposed to. Judging the product by itself it&#x27;s worth the buy. Comparing it to jamberry nail wraps it&#x27;s definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy!  its not worth it, 2 fell off within 2 hours... I love the designs but its just sooooooooo not worth it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this starter kit at CVS. I also bought a refill pack of gel strips called \\&quot;Take the Stage\\&quot; which is a sparkly gunmetal grey (funky &amp; gorgeous), and used the kit to apply that color instead of the one it came with. This was my first time using polish strips and I am definitely hooked! I must admit that the process is very labor-intensive. You cannot skip any steps or rush the process, and I think the reviews that report the strips peeling off or chipping prematurely  may have something to do with that. Technique is essential. The online tutorial on the Sally Hansen site is helpful to watch before hand. I made sure to buff my nails really well and clean them thoroughly with the alcohol wipes. When applying the strips they tell you to stretch each one towards the tip, and I noticed several other reviews mentioning that the strips broke off when they did this. I only had one instance of a strip breaking on me, and then learned not to pull so hard or so far. I only stretched each strip minimally and kind of patted it down on my nail as I moved upward. I also found Sally Hansen&#x27;s tip to leave your thumbs bare until last very important. I tended to choose a strip that was just slightly wider than my nail, and then used my thumbnails (which are pretty thin and sharp) to kind of tuck-in the edges around my nail bed, severing off any extra strip and making a perfectly clean edge. So far I am on day 5 and have only one minor chip. I was able to stop it from progressing by applying a fresh coat of gel topcoat and re-curing under the lamp. For me, this is amazing, as I work with my hands constantly and have never managed to get my nails through even one day without looking awful!  Overall I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it if you are willing to take the time to do it right. My only negative comments are #1- very expensive compared to traditional polish, #2- limited color selection, #3- they really need to sell the gel strips alone without thewhole \\&quot;refill kit\\&quot;. All you really need is extra strips, not a whole new bottle of top coat, file, etc each time you want to do your nails.</li>
            <li> This does include a small light, the description states not included but it was. the light is small than it the other starter kits, you can only do one nail at a time.  Seems to be holding up well, I am great at painting my own nails so the strips are great for me!</li>
            <li> I tried Sally Hansen Insta-gel strips for the first time, and I followed the directions explicitly.  The process was easy enough, and they do dry instantly after using the UV light, which is nice. However, less than 24 hours later two of my nails have already chipped.  For this reason, this system is not worth the $14 it costs for the strips each time you want to do your nails.  For that price you might as well go to the salon and get a manicure done.  I also do not like that you basically have to soak your fingernails in acetone nail polish remover to take the polish off, which I understand is true of all gel polishes, but its just not what I feel like doing since I just did my nails last night.  I do not recommend this and I will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Details: 2 easy steps to put Insta Gel Strips on your nails.  $20-$50 depending on where you buy them.  Lots of fun nail polish colors in reds and pinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Review: there are 6 main steps each with smaller steps to follow.  The cleaning pads dry up before you are done using them.  The strips peel off within hours, and they chip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To see our full review go to our website:[...]</li>
            <li> First time I used it, surprisingly it really works.  Second time I used it, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. Seems like a disposable lamp. I contacted Seller but the return postage is just not worth it. Even thought its just $7.37, save your $7.37 and use it toward another. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!</li>
            <li> The strips did not stick well.  They were difficult to use.  The worst product that I ever bought online. Only lasted 2 days on some nails.</li>
            <li> I do acrylic nails and gel nails. I really like this kit very easy to use for anybody. Great quality for the price. The most important thing to keep in mind is gel is not like reg nail polish. If you apply too much it rund down the side of yur nails making it peel of in a few days. Apply a thin amount to nail then immediately put under light. If you want you can add another coat. Its better to put two thin coat than one thick one. Will last longer. Hope this info helps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the standard Sally Hansen Salon Effects strips. I use them all the time and routinely get 10 days of wear from a set. So, I expected great things from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very, very wrong. The strips included don&#x27;t adhere nearly as well as the standard ones. And they sure don&#x27;t wear even 1/10th as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions to the letter. Within hours, 2 nails had chips--and all I did was sit on the sofa and read. Within 1 day, the strips peeled completely off 3 nails while I was washing my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What an utter waste of time and money. If Amazon had allowed, I&#x27;d have given this product 0 stars.</li>
