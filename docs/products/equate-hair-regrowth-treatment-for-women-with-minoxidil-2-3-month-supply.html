            <li>so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I think it is a good idea to check your blood pressure twice a day at the beginning.....</li>
            <li>am delighted with the results of using this product.</li>
            <li>Particularly good for hormonal conditions that affect hair loss</li>
            <li>It still worked as good as the name brand.</li>
            <li>Hair has been really good since I have been taking this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price is good and if you need it, give it a try</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and great product!</li>
            <li>Am very pleased with the product, the price and the results.</li>
            <li>now my wife get more hair really works!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It really really works!!!!!  </li>
            <li>&#x27;s kind have.  </li>
            <li>Most of the reviews are good and encouraging.</li>
            <li>Minoxidil is the effective ingredient in all of the brands.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product really works got for my mom for her thinning hair</li>
            <li>then I can give a more informed review--- I have been using it for almost three months and it not working, so I cannot in good conscience recommend this product.</li>
            <li>nice for my hair would buy again from seller</li>
            <li>but  some downy hair is appearing, so that is nice.</li>
            <li>and I am happy with the purchase, the price and the quick shipment.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m seeing great results!</li>
            <li>I find the eyedropper to be a more effective disbursal tool as more reaches the scalp.</li>
            <li>, hair grows more.</li>
            <li>but this brand is great bang for your buck and works very well.</li>
            <li>Okay people the instructions say it takes about 8, yes 8 months to see a difference in hair growth.</li>
            <li>Most people need to use it for life for continued benefit.  </li>
            <li>but I find more of the foam ends up on my hair than on the scalp which isn&#x27;t desirable as it contains drying alcohol.  </li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll know more as time passes.</li>
            <li>I  love this product....</li>
            <li>but sure is a lot thicker than it was before I started using Equate</li>
            <li>My scalp seemed to burn somewhat and the hairloss became more severe.</li>
            <li>arrived on time and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Make sure the description says 3 month supply.  </li>
            <li>I was almost sure it would be the thyroid#</li>
            <li>The others seem a more all over hair loss</li>
            <li>Rogaine is really expensive and this is the perfect price for the perfect amount.</li>
            <li>I wish they had this product in a foam, I would have used it more</li>
            <li>This product may work for others but I am glad I stopped using it.</li>
            <li>Loss was on the top of my head</li>
            <li>I am going to continue to use the reminder of what I have but am not feeling too confident at this point.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>No need to spend more for this product or brand name - it works just like the &amp;#34;other brand&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a lot more cofident.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Equate for making a difference in so many lives.</li>
            <li>My hair is receding and thinning on top and at the temples.  </li>
            <li>I MAY try the name brand, but my husband says he&#x27;ll love me even if I go bald :-)</li>
            <li>It was as if was on chemo; each time I washed my hair, more and more came</li>
            <li>satisfied, indeed.</li>
            <li>Had I been able to read the label beforehand, I would not have made this purchase.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, no scent, so easy to use.</li>
            <li>At one time, I had a huge bald spot in the top of my head created by too many chemicals in my hair.  </li>
            <li>It went very well, very grateful, excellent product, received on time, a very good experience, I will be back to buy the product</li>
            <li>If the name on a bottle that no one but family will see is important to you, go ahead and spend more.  </li>
            <li>I did light research before buying this and felt satisfied with what I had read.</li>
            <li>He told me the most cost effective route would be to try 2% minoxidil first</li>
            <li>If you can buy from Walmart, they do have the 3 month supply for $19 with free shipping with $45 or more</li>
            <li>Shipping was right on time though !!</li>
            <li>easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I began using it along the part on top of my head, and my hair stylist commented that my hair was thicker &amp;#34;and there</li>
            <li>/&gt;they are easy to tip over.</li>
            <li>Its easy to apply</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is strongly recommended, the price is affordable.</li>
            <li>My hair is baby fine though</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any bald spots, just fine hair, so</li>
            <li>I applied it twice a day for 2 years and have switched to once a day for 6 months and it is working fine</li>
            <li>This works just fine</li>
            <li>No doubt it opened the follicle to let the hair grow, but as my follices were fine, the hair fell out.  </li>
            <li>No doubt when used for it&#x27;s intended purpose, it will work just fine.</li>
            <li>and if your hair is as important to you as mine is to me,</li>
            <li>this have the important ones.</li>
            <li>Two months after using this product, the spot was almost completely filled in - and</li>
            <li>There is free shipping at Walmarts with a $50 purchase.</li>
            <li>Great value, three times cheaper than Regaine and does the same job.  </li>
            <li>Equate is the most economical brand.  </li>
            <li>I would love for this treatment to be a more \\&quot;all over\\&quot; treatment, but I think, at that point, you would get too much minoxidil in your system.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this and get started regrowing some hair.</li>
            <li>I was beyond excited.</li>
            <li>and I have not seen any significant hair growth</li>
            <li>Technically, I suppose you may be able to dilute the men&#x27;s product to the women&#x27;s potency, but I am glad I don&#x27;t have to deal with that or worry about that with this product and the price offered!</li>
            <li>The price is very right.  </li>
            <li>I take many supplements for hair:  A bald spot disappeared, and my hair is still pretty full.  </li>
            <li>This is true for my family when it comes to the women.  </li>
            <li>If the instructions describe how much to use, for example &amp;#34;squeeze out anamount the size of a pea&amp;#34;, you won&#x27;t use more than you should.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that they came so fast also.</li>
            <li>not even sure if the liquid in the bottles is the real stuff</li>
            <li>I had lost so much hair on the top of my head that I was all but bald.</li>
            <li>The product is helping in stopping the hair loss and maintaining a full head of hair.</li>
            <li>I procured more of this same product (supposedly) from WalMart and after a couple of weeks I&#x27;m glad to report my hair</li>
            <li>and I have mild but noticable hair loss.</li>
            <li>and I still have seen a tremendous change.</li>
            <li>I would order from here again as it came in quick and there was no damage.</li>
            <li>I contacted the merchant and was given quick assistance in the matter.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>I am one of the lucky ones -- I can style my hair any way I want now</li>
            <li>I will continue to use the product and I am optimistic that there may be more improvement, although I have to be realistic.  </li>
            <li>I am very interested in trying this product.</li>
            <li>This has filled in some pretty sparse spots and helped my widened part as well.</li>
            <li>This stuff REALLY works!!</li>
            <li>Have used it for a while now (3 years) and new hair is constantly growing, nice :)</li>
            <li>So it was a success using this product.</li>
            <li>Worth a try?  </li>
            <li>but at this price, it is totally worth it to continue using</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year with much success.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth the risk.</li>
            <li>I experienced visible results in less than a month!  </li>
            <li>Also, I did not vote for \\&quot;myself\\&quot; as what good would that do for me or any other reviewer(?)</li>
            <li>My mother has NEVER had hair  on her right side.</li>
            <li>I have never seen hair on her right side.</li>
            <li>so I have no idea what it is doing on Amazon, or even if the seller has the right to sell this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>right now (4/2/12).  </li>
            <li>the shedding phase is what Im in right now, which I read means the product is working.</li>
            <li>Price is just right.</li>
            <li>and I can see new growth so that is good enough for me.</li>
            <li>It is more watery than greasy and I barely notice that I put it on.  </li>
            <li>Not the temple and general thinning that I and most of my friends are experiencing with menopause.</li>
            <li>This is my last resort as I&#x27;ll never be able to afford hair plugs/laser.</li>
            <li>I really hope this works!</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly,  using 1 mL twice a day.</li>
            <li>Follow the instruction exactly and your hair will grow.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>I went to Walmart&#x27;s, and sure enough they had this Equate.  </li>
            <li>first search I did on the side effects answered all of my questions.</li>
            <li>I actually like this product better than Rogaine for women.  </li>
            <li>First, this is the \\&quot;Equate\\&quot; brand which is exclusive to Walmart</li>
            <li>only 2 places I am sure of are patchy loss.</li>
            <li>Buying the product for men you have a greater risk of growing facial hair and other things most women would not appreciate!</li>
            <li>have tried Rogaine at a much higher price</li>
            <li>Just be aware, you have to keep using the minoxidil</li>
            <li>It actually caused significantly MORE HAIR LOSS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I waste of good money.</li>
            <li>My favorites there are the conditioner (most leave my hair flat) and the hair thickening spray.</li>
            <li>Better to  lose 1/4&lt;br /&gt;or less than a full bottle.</li>
            <li>I suppose they didn&#x27;t want returns from people who didn&#x27;t have this positive</li>
            <li>You should always check with your doctor to make sure there are no other problems that are causing hair loss, but I find so far the product to be working for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You will need to continue using any minoxidil product indefinitely, or all the new growth will fall out in a number of months, but at ~$22 (~$18 at Walmart) for a 3 month supply, I think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for awhile and my thining spots have disapeared and also My hair is full again, the only thing about this product, you need to continue to use it for awhile longer, its worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is possible I do have some hair growth, but it is so fine, I can&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li>dermatology said the 5% solution was fine, although the label says for men only</li>
            <li>I do have a very high stress level in my life &amp; this</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product, based on other reviews and because I didn&#x27;t really want to spend the money on the name-brand version unless I was sure it would have a positive effect.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for 7 weeks and already see a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>and it is really helping.</li>
            <li>My hair loss has stopped and it is growing much faster.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works over time.</li>
            <li>I have just started using it so cannot say much.</li>
            <li>What I really like is that it doesn&#x27;t have a smell.  </li>
            <li>So I really want to keep as much hair on my head.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It really does work like a dream.</li>
            <li>I then read as much as I could.</li>
            <li>really works!!&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li>It really works and I use it every day.</li>
            <li>The dropper is very convenient for delivering the medication.</li>
            <li>it make my hair very itchi</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see any difference.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I have to inspect really well to assure that I have put it on that day or not.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really been a blessing for me.</li>
            <li>It was very noticeable when I washed my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I think that I am not losing as much hair.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t pay much attention at the time.  </li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>My part is much thinner and my hair looks so much fuller.  </li>
            <li>I  bought this product because the name brand one cost too much..</li>
            <li>and it is then only effective on the male pattern areas (the part and top center).</li>
            <li>The product has worked very well for me</li>
            <li>I will use it every other day to see if that&#x27;s better for me in conjunction with my nioxin shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Only used for about a month now...don&#x27;t see any hair growth yet, but significant reduction in hair loss.</li>
            <li>there seems to be some re-growth, although the hairs are very, very fine and do not really have much length, so far.  </li>
            <li>Its only been 1 month so its early on for me but product is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It takes at least 2-3 Months to see the results and some of the new hair is my original dark auburn instead of white, but it looks great!!</li>
            <li>Finally you stop finding a hairbrush full of hair.</li>
            <li>it smelled different and after a year of using similar products (same brand, same ingredients) and achieving very good results, with this, all my new hair fell out and just in time for the</li>
            <li>My hair has thinned as I&#x27;ve gotten older, so I thought it would encourage growth.  </li>
            <li>I am a middle-aged woman with thinning hair, particularly in front.  </li>
            <li>Confirmation that I didn&#x27;t really need, because it very clearly works.  </li>
            <li>It took around three months of steady use, but the thin hair at my temples is growing back and my hair has never looked so good!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to any woman with hair loss</li>
            <li>One thing I highly recommend in conjunction with this product is DermMatch.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products, but this has such a strong alcohol smell that people 10 - 15 feet away were asking what the alcohol smell in the room was at least 20 minutes after I put it on.</li>
            <li>I have thyroid issues and my hair was coming out massively until my medication kicked in, this helped to grow my hair back fast and strong.</li>
            <li>But if you think getting old means thinning hair, think again!!  </li>
            <li>Im very hopeful so far.</li>
            <li>My thyroid was normal</li>
            <li>Other generics I&#x27;ve used are fine.</li>
            <li>I can honestly state, &amp;#34;my hair loss is a lot less; it is normal, about 50 hairs daily.</li>
            <li>I do see what looks like new growth.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser said she saw some new growth on my head.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for several months- didn&#x27;t do much too much for regrowth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am not sure if this truly works, but I do have many new strands of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beth</li>
            <li>but I did think that it was important for anyone who buys this to know that this is a potential effect and that if you begin to notice subtle changes in your face that there is a good chance it is due to the regrowth product.w to regain my &amp;#</li>
            <li>but I did think that it was important for anyone who buys this to know that this is a potential effect and that if you begin to notice subtle changes in your face that there is a good chance it is due to the regrowth product.</li>
            <li>such lovely customer service, I highly recommend this product and any other product offered to any young woman in need of assistance with hair regrowth problems.</li>
            <li>My normally sparse and thin eyebrows and eyelashes also began to thicken and grow back, which was amazing!</li>
            <li>Her hair has filled in completely all over because it was thinning due to her being in her 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>First, the three bottles of Rogaine or Equate do not last three months as advertised.</li>
            <li>I had to begin Vitamin D supplements to be able to assure I would get enough but it took about a month before it actually built up in my system enough to see a difference #ie not having to go out in the sun</li>
            <li>You can buy this at WalMart for $18 &amp; change ... but believe it or not, not everyone lives near a WalMart!</li>
            <li>I am so excited about having a three month supply for such a low price.</li>
            <li>For the price of one on Keratinique, you get 3 here, and the ingredients are exactly the same.</li>
            <li>Flakey dry itchy scalp isn&#x27;t fun.</li>
            <li>Easy application, no strong odor, thickening the hair (re-grow) after suffering hair loss.</li>
            <li>Within 20 minutes I had large bags again under my eyes which hadn&#x27;t been there earlier</li>
            <li>I have also always had a very greasy scalp even when I wash daily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thirty three years old</li>
            <li>Price was reasonable compare to outside prices.</li>
            <li>such that if my hair was straight they&#x27;d show.  </li>
            <li>and I developed bags underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li>All you mature women that have thinning hair, this</li>
            <li>then part my hair from forehead to crown, one row at the time, about 1/4 inch apart, and dab the tip of the eyedropper along the part lines (using much the same technique as when I dab stencil paint on a project).  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am grateful that Walmart (I guess Amazon, in this case) offers this item for this price.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use if you have a sensitive scalp</li>
            <li>My thinning was mostly near the front of my crown. .</li>
            <li>Now, I am a mature woman and questioned whether it would work at all on me.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel self conscious about my hair anymore.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than Kerinique and same ingredients.</li>
            <li>It is only visible when you look very close.&lt;br</li>
            <li>moral is, unless you really have a baldness/thinning issue, don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>I am 80 years old.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful, less expensive generic form of Rogaine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years- after following the recommended twice daily application for the first year</li>
            <li>Does the same job as the high price stuff,&lt;br /&gt;but found it cheaper at WalMart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li>only been 3 months and already see results new hair is growing and old hair is getting thicker and fuller</li>
            <li>On the side of this box, a drawing indicates who it will work for, and that it won&#x27;t work for bald spots, however, I had one nickel-sized spot near my forehead that is no longer bare.  </li>
            <li>Since using this, the bare side has completely grown in.</li>
            <li>and I am almost back to a normal (for me) scalp.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the generic equivalent to Rogaine- works just as well, same active ingredient at the same dosage but more affordable.  </li>
            <li>Rogaine is so much more expensive and other store brands aren&#x27;t too cheap either.</li>
            <li>After using this product for a month, I concentrated at the temple areas only, and found new hair growth within a month.  </li>
            <li>I just finally decided to live with my hair like it is.</li>
            <li>New growth is coming back.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised the results were the same I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li>I havenoticed a major difference.</li>
            <li>There are other side effects that are not as noticeable and very much tolerable, but since facial swelling is not something that can be hid and directly affects your appearance, it is vital that you know this is a POTENTIAL side effect you may endure.&lt;br</li>
            <li>What you are not told is it will only work on certain minor types of hair loss.  </li>
            <li>The Keranique shampoo and other products actually made my hair look thicker right away.  </li>
            <li>No strong odors like most of the other hair treatments have.  </li>
            <li>Am only 15 days into and see no difference so far.</li>
            <li>It is too early to tell if it is going to work, however I have been using it for almost a month and am starting to notice a bit of a difference in thickness already.</li>
            <li>But around my curly bangs are bare spots</li>
            <li>I went so far as to buy eye masks and totally changed me routine.</li>
            <li>Now, a year later, my hair has completely grown in and is stronger and fuller than before.</li>
            <li>Both my mom and grandma (and maybe more) both have hair so thin you can see scalp.</li>
            <li>MANY women are vitamin D deficient or insufficient and don&#x27;t even know it.</li>
            <li>The choice for a three month supply comes down to the price you are willing to pay:  </li>
            <li>I have always had fine thin hair and noticed more thinning at the back of my head lately</li>
            <li>I started using it in November 2014 and in February 2015 I have new hairs that are about an inch long.</li>
            <li>Each generic or brand name has exactly the same chemical and strength (for the women&#x27;s formula -- the men&#x27;s formula has an extra strength minoxidil also), so the low cost Equate version is the only one that makes sense to me.  </li>
            <li>After a few months, I started to get compliments from my sisters, friends and even customers about my thick, nice eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too keen on having to do this for the rest of my life since I&#x27;m only 30, but I really don&#x27;t see any other way.</li>
            <li>There were no negative side effects, but no positive ones either.</li>
            <li>My hair was so thin, you could easily see my scalp.  </li>
            <li>A single purchase at a local drug store is nearly the same price as the 3-pack.  </li>
            <li>The product seemed to help a little, but it really was a hassle to use.  </li>
            <li>I have wispy new hairs all along the hairline and other areas</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It did also have a side effect, but it was a good one.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I think it is a good idea to check your blood pressure twice a day at the beginning.....</li>
            <li> am delighted with the results of using this product.</li>
            <li> Particularly good for hormonal conditions that affect hair loss</li>
            <li> It still worked as good as the name brand.</li>
            <li> Hair has been really good since I have been taking this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price is good and if you need it, give it a try</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and great product!</li>
            <li> Am very pleased with the product, the price and the results.</li>
            <li> now my wife get more hair really works!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It really really works!!!!!  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s kind have.  </li>
            <li> Most of the reviews are good and encouraging.</li>
            <li> Minoxidil is the effective ingredient in all of the brands.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product really works got for my mom for her thinning hair</li>
            <li> then I can give a more informed review--- I have been using it for almost three months and it not working, so I cannot in good conscience recommend this product.</li>
            <li> nice for my hair would buy again from seller</li>
            <li> but  some downy hair is appearing, so that is nice.</li>
            <li> and I am happy with the purchase, the price and the quick shipment.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m seeing great results!</li>
            <li> I find the eyedropper to be a more effective disbursal tool as more reaches the scalp.</li>
            <li> , hair grows more.</li>
            <li> but this brand is great bang for your buck and works very well.</li>
            <li> Okay people the instructions say it takes about 8, yes 8 months to see a difference in hair growth.</li>
            <li> Most people need to use it for life for continued benefit.  </li>
            <li> but I find more of the foam ends up on my hair than on the scalp which isn&#x27;t desirable as it contains drying alcohol.  </li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll know more as time passes.</li>
            <li> I  love this product....</li>
            <li> but sure is a lot thicker than it was before I started using Equate</li>
            <li> My scalp seemed to burn somewhat and the hairloss became more severe.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Make sure the description says 3 month supply.  </li>
            <li> I was almost sure it would be the thyroid#</li>
            <li> The others seem a more all over hair loss</li>
            <li> Rogaine is really expensive and this is the perfect price for the perfect amount.</li>
            <li> I wish they had this product in a foam, I would have used it more</li>
            <li> This product may work for others but I am glad I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Loss was on the top of my head</li>
            <li> I am going to continue to use the reminder of what I have but am not feeling too confident at this point.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> No need to spend more for this product or brand name - it works just like the &amp;#34;other brand&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lot more cofident.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Equate for making a difference in so many lives.</li>
            <li> My hair is receding and thinning on top and at the temples.  </li>
            <li> I MAY try the name brand, but my husband says he&#x27;ll love me even if I go bald :-)</li>
            <li> It was as if was on chemo; each time I washed my hair, more and more came</li>
            <li> satisfied, indeed.</li>
            <li> Had I been able to read the label beforehand, I would not have made this purchase.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, no scent, so easy to use.</li>
            <li> At one time, I had a huge bald spot in the top of my head created by too many chemicals in my hair.  </li>
            <li> It went very well, very grateful, excellent product, received on time, a very good experience, I will be back to buy the product</li>
            <li> If the name on a bottle that no one but family will see is important to you, go ahead and spend more.  </li>
            <li> I did light research before buying this and felt satisfied with what I had read.</li>
            <li> He told me the most cost effective route would be to try 2% minoxidil first</li>
            <li> If you can buy from Walmart, they do have the 3 month supply for $19 with free shipping with $45 or more</li>
            <li> Shipping was right on time though !!</li>
            <li> easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I began using it along the part on top of my head, and my hair stylist commented that my hair was thicker &amp;#34;and there</li>
            <li> /&gt;they are easy to tip over.</li>
            <li> Its easy to apply</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is strongly recommended, the price is affordable.</li>
            <li> My hair is baby fine though</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any bald spots, just fine hair, so</li>
            <li> I applied it twice a day for 2 years and have switched to once a day for 6 months and it is working fine</li>
            <li> This works just fine</li>
            <li> No doubt it opened the follicle to let the hair grow, but as my follices were fine, the hair fell out.  </li>
            <li> No doubt when used for it&#x27;s intended purpose, it will work just fine.</li>
            <li> and if your hair is as important to you as mine is to me,</li>
            <li> this have the important ones.</li>
            <li> Two months after using this product, the spot was almost completely filled in - and</li>
            <li> There is free shipping at Walmarts with a $50 purchase.</li>
            <li> Great value, three times cheaper than Regaine and does the same job.  </li>
            <li> Equate is the most economical brand.  </li>
            <li> I would love for this treatment to be a more \\&quot;all over\\&quot; treatment, but I think, at that point, you would get too much minoxidil in your system.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this and get started regrowing some hair.</li>
            <li> I was beyond excited.</li>
            <li> and I have not seen any significant hair growth</li>
            <li> Technically, I suppose you may be able to dilute the men&#x27;s product to the women&#x27;s potency, but I am glad I don&#x27;t have to deal with that or worry about that with this product and the price offered!</li>
            <li> The price is very right.  </li>
            <li> I take many supplements for hair:  A bald spot disappeared, and my hair is still pretty full.  </li>
            <li> This is true for my family when it comes to the women.  </li>
            <li> If the instructions describe how much to use, for example &amp;#34;squeeze out anamount the size of a pea&amp;#34;, you won&#x27;t use more than you should.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that they came so fast also.</li>
            <li> not even sure if the liquid in the bottles is the real stuff</li>
            <li> I had lost so much hair on the top of my head that I was all but bald.</li>
            <li> The product is helping in stopping the hair loss and maintaining a full head of hair.</li>
            <li> I procured more of this same product (supposedly) from WalMart and after a couple of weeks I&#x27;m glad to report my hair</li>
            <li> and I have mild but noticable hair loss.</li>
            <li> and I still have seen a tremendous change.</li>
            <li> I would order from here again as it came in quick and there was no damage.</li>
            <li> I contacted the merchant and was given quick assistance in the matter.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> I am one of the lucky ones -- I can style my hair any way I want now</li>
            <li> I will continue to use the product and I am optimistic that there may be more improvement, although I have to be realistic.  </li>
            <li> I am very interested in trying this product.</li>
            <li> This has filled in some pretty sparse spots and helped my widened part as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff REALLY works!!</li>
            <li> Have used it for a while now (3 years) and new hair is constantly growing, nice :)</li>
            <li> So it was a success using this product.</li>
            <li> Worth a try?  </li>
            <li> but at this price, it is totally worth it to continue using</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year with much success.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t worth the risk.</li>
            <li> I experienced visible results in less than a month!  </li>
            <li> Also, I did not vote for \\&quot;myself\\&quot; as what good would that do for me or any other reviewer(?)</li>
            <li> My mother has NEVER had hair  on her right side.</li>
            <li> I have never seen hair on her right side.</li>
            <li> so I have no idea what it is doing on Amazon, or even if the seller has the right to sell this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> right now (4/2/12).  </li>
            <li> the shedding phase is what Im in right now, which I read means the product is working.</li>
            <li> Price is just right.</li>
            <li> and I can see new growth so that is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> It is more watery than greasy and I barely notice that I put it on.  </li>
            <li> Not the temple and general thinning that I and most of my friends are experiencing with menopause.</li>
            <li> This is my last resort as I&#x27;ll never be able to afford hair plugs/laser.</li>
            <li> I really hope this works!</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly,  using 1 mL twice a day.</li>
            <li> Follow the instruction exactly and your hair will grow.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> I went to Walmart&#x27;s, and sure enough they had this Equate.  </li>
            <li> first search I did on the side effects answered all of my questions.</li>
            <li> I actually like this product better than Rogaine for women.  </li>
            <li> First, this is the \\&quot;Equate\\&quot; brand which is exclusive to Walmart</li>
            <li> only 2 places I am sure of are patchy loss.</li>
            <li> Buying the product for men you have a greater risk of growing facial hair and other things most women would not appreciate!</li>
            <li> have tried Rogaine at a much higher price</li>
            <li> Just be aware, you have to keep using the minoxidil</li>
            <li> It actually caused significantly MORE HAIR LOSS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I waste of good money.</li>
            <li> My favorites there are the conditioner (most leave my hair flat) and the hair thickening spray.</li>
            <li> Better to  lose 1/4&lt;br /&gt;or less than a full bottle.</li>
            <li> I suppose they didn&#x27;t want returns from people who didn&#x27;t have this positive</li>
            <li> You should always check with your doctor to make sure there are no other problems that are causing hair loss, but I find so far the product to be working for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You will need to continue using any minoxidil product indefinitely, or all the new growth will fall out in a number of months, but at ~$22 (~$18 at Walmart) for a 3 month supply, I think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for awhile and my thining spots have disapeared and also My hair is full again, the only thing about this product, you need to continue to use it for awhile longer, its worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is possible I do have some hair growth, but it is so fine, I can&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li> dermatology said the 5% solution was fine, although the label says for men only</li>
            <li> I do have a very high stress level in my life &amp; this</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product, based on other reviews and because I didn&#x27;t really want to spend the money on the name-brand version unless I was sure it would have a positive effect.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 7 weeks and already see a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> and it is really helping.</li>
            <li> My hair loss has stopped and it is growing much faster.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works over time.</li>
            <li> I have just started using it so cannot say much.</li>
            <li> What I really like is that it doesn&#x27;t have a smell.  </li>
            <li> So I really want to keep as much hair on my head.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It really does work like a dream.</li>
            <li> I then read as much as I could.</li>
            <li> really works!!&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li> It really works and I use it every day.</li>
            <li> The dropper is very convenient for delivering the medication.</li>
            <li> it make my hair very itchi</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see any difference.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I have to inspect really well to assure that I have put it on that day or not.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really been a blessing for me.</li>
            <li> It was very noticeable when I washed my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I think that I am not losing as much hair.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t pay much attention at the time.  </li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> My part is much thinner and my hair looks so much fuller.  </li>
            <li> I  bought this product because the name brand one cost too much..</li>
            <li> and it is then only effective on the male pattern areas (the part and top center).</li>
            <li> The product has worked very well for me</li>
            <li> I will use it every other day to see if that&#x27;s better for me in conjunction with my nioxin shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Only used for about a month now...don&#x27;t see any hair growth yet, but significant reduction in hair loss.</li>
            <li> there seems to be some re-growth, although the hairs are very, very fine and do not really have much length, so far.  </li>
            <li> Its only been 1 month so its early on for me but product is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It takes at least 2-3 Months to see the results and some of the new hair is my original dark auburn instead of white, but it looks great!!</li>
            <li> Finally you stop finding a hairbrush full of hair.</li>
            <li> it smelled different and after a year of using similar products (same brand, same ingredients) and achieving very good results, with this, all my new hair fell out and just in time for the</li>
            <li> My hair has thinned as I&#x27;ve gotten older, so I thought it would encourage growth.  </li>
            <li> I am a middle-aged woman with thinning hair, particularly in front.  </li>
            <li> Confirmation that I didn&#x27;t really need, because it very clearly works.  </li>
            <li> It took around three months of steady use, but the thin hair at my temples is growing back and my hair has never looked so good!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to any woman with hair loss</li>
            <li> One thing I highly recommend in conjunction with this product is DermMatch.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products, but this has such a strong alcohol smell that people 10 - 15 feet away were asking what the alcohol smell in the room was at least 20 minutes after I put it on.</li>
            <li> I have thyroid issues and my hair was coming out massively until my medication kicked in, this helped to grow my hair back fast and strong.</li>
            <li> But if you think getting old means thinning hair, think again!!  </li>
            <li> Im very hopeful so far.</li>
            <li> My thyroid was normal</li>
            <li> Other generics I&#x27;ve used are fine.</li>
            <li> I can honestly state, &amp;#34;my hair loss is a lot less; it is normal, about 50 hairs daily.</li>
            <li> I do see what looks like new growth.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser said she saw some new growth on my head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several months- didn&#x27;t do much too much for regrowth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure if this truly works, but I do have many new strands of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beth</li>
            <li> but I did think that it was important for anyone who buys this to know that this is a potential effect and that if you begin to notice subtle changes in your face that there is a good chance it is due to the regrowth product.w to regain my &amp;#</li>
            <li> but I did think that it was important for anyone who buys this to know that this is a potential effect and that if you begin to notice subtle changes in your face that there is a good chance it is due to the regrowth product.</li>
            <li> such lovely customer service, I highly recommend this product and any other product offered to any young woman in need of assistance with hair regrowth problems.</li>
            <li> My normally sparse and thin eyebrows and eyelashes also began to thicken and grow back, which was amazing!</li>
            <li> Her hair has filled in completely all over because it was thinning due to her being in her 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> First, the three bottles of Rogaine or Equate do not last three months as advertised.</li>
            <li> I had to begin Vitamin D supplements to be able to assure I would get enough but it took about a month before it actually built up in my system enough to see a difference #ie not having to go out in the sun</li>
            <li> You can buy this at WalMart for $18 &amp; change ... but believe it or not, not everyone lives near a WalMart!</li>
            <li> I am so excited about having a three month supply for such a low price.</li>
            <li> For the price of one on Keratinique, you get 3 here, and the ingredients are exactly the same.</li>
            <li> Flakey dry itchy scalp isn&#x27;t fun.</li>
            <li> Easy application, no strong odor, thickening the hair (re-grow) after suffering hair loss.</li>
            <li> Within 20 minutes I had large bags again under my eyes which hadn&#x27;t been there earlier</li>
            <li> I have also always had a very greasy scalp even when I wash daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thirty three years old</li>
            <li> Price was reasonable compare to outside prices.</li>
            <li> such that if my hair was straight they&#x27;d show.  </li>
            <li> and I developed bags underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> All you mature women that have thinning hair, this</li>
            <li> then part my hair from forehead to crown, one row at the time, about 1/4 inch apart, and dab the tip of the eyedropper along the part lines (using much the same technique as when I dab stencil paint on a project).  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am grateful that Walmart (I guess Amazon, in this case) offers this item for this price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use if you have a sensitive scalp</li>
            <li> My thinning was mostly near the front of my crown. .</li>
            <li> Now, I am a mature woman and questioned whether it would work at all on me.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel self conscious about my hair anymore.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than Kerinique and same ingredients.</li>
            <li> It is only visible when you look very close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> moral is, unless you really have a baldness/thinning issue, don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> I am 80 years old.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, less expensive generic form of Rogaine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years- after following the recommended twice daily application for the first year</li>
            <li> Does the same job as the high price stuff,&lt;br /&gt;but found it cheaper at WalMart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> only been 3 months and already see results new hair is growing and old hair is getting thicker and fuller</li>
            <li> On the side of this box, a drawing indicates who it will work for, and that it won&#x27;t work for bald spots, however, I had one nickel-sized spot near my forehead that is no longer bare.  </li>
            <li> Since using this, the bare side has completely grown in.</li>
            <li> and I am almost back to a normal (for me) scalp.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the generic equivalent to Rogaine- works just as well, same active ingredient at the same dosage but more affordable.  </li>
            <li> Rogaine is so much more expensive and other store brands aren&#x27;t too cheap either.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a month, I concentrated at the temple areas only, and found new hair growth within a month.  </li>
            <li> I just finally decided to live with my hair like it is.</li>
            <li> New growth is coming back.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised the results were the same I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I havenoticed a major difference.</li>
            <li> There are other side effects that are not as noticeable and very much tolerable, but since facial swelling is not something that can be hid and directly affects your appearance, it is vital that you know this is a POTENTIAL side effect you may endure.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What you are not told is it will only work on certain minor types of hair loss.  </li>
            <li> The Keranique shampoo and other products actually made my hair look thicker right away.  </li>
            <li> No strong odors like most of the other hair treatments have.  </li>
            <li> Am only 15 days into and see no difference so far.</li>
            <li> It is too early to tell if it is going to work, however I have been using it for almost a month and am starting to notice a bit of a difference in thickness already.</li>
            <li> But around my curly bangs are bare spots</li>
            <li> I went so far as to buy eye masks and totally changed me routine.</li>
            <li> Now, a year later, my hair has completely grown in and is stronger and fuller than before.</li>
            <li> Both my mom and grandma (and maybe more) both have hair so thin you can see scalp.</li>
            <li> MANY women are vitamin D deficient or insufficient and don&#x27;t even know it.</li>
            <li> The choice for a three month supply comes down to the price you are willing to pay:  </li>
            <li> I have always had fine thin hair and noticed more thinning at the back of my head lately</li>
            <li> I started using it in November 2014 and in February 2015 I have new hairs that are about an inch long.</li>
            <li> Each generic or brand name has exactly the same chemical and strength (for the women&#x27;s formula -- the men&#x27;s formula has an extra strength minoxidil also), so the low cost Equate version is the only one that makes sense to me.  </li>
            <li> After a few months, I started to get compliments from my sisters, friends and even customers about my thick, nice eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too keen on having to do this for the rest of my life since I&#x27;m only 30, but I really don&#x27;t see any other way.</li>
            <li> There were no negative side effects, but no positive ones either.</li>
            <li> My hair was so thin, you could easily see my scalp.  </li>
            <li> A single purchase at a local drug store is nearly the same price as the 3-pack.  </li>
            <li> The product seemed to help a little, but it really was a hassle to use.  </li>
            <li> I have wispy new hairs all along the hairline and other areas</li>
            <li> she was a little concerned when she saw how much I lost with each brushing#, but I had explained I had stopped a month previously, plus I had never lost so much with my other babies.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really worried though because it was really, a small handful when I combed it.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to confirm hair growth.</li>
            <li> I can only imagine it will dry out the scalp.</li>
            <li> It does slowly deliver hair regrowth which is a Godsent for women with thinning hair at a relatively low cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am however experiencing psoriasis on my scalp which can be very itchy at times.  </li>
            <li> but it dried my scalp completely out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for roughly 5-6 months now, although I do NOT use it twice a day; only at bedtime.</li>
            <li> Does seem to arrest some hair loss in my case.</li>
            <li> This really works, my hair was thinning, and after use my hair is thick again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my thyroids (and other possible things) checked as well,</li>
            <li> I reduced usage to once daily or every other day</li>
            <li> I part my hair with the pointed end of a rattail comb and use the back of the comb on the other end to massage the liquid into my scalp.</li>
            <li> The product is not thick or gunky, but it is not suitable for me to use in the mornings before going to work..</li>
            <li> It does grow hair but the hair that grows is wispy and doesn&#x27;t seem to get very long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read this complaint from other users and thought they were probably using too much product, so I made a point of carefully filling the included eyedropper to slightly below the line marked on the eyedropper.  </li>
            <li> If you already have even a slightly dry scalp problem,  leave this stuff alone.</li>
            <li> Theres a few white short strands appearing and</li>
            <li> All the while, my hair was falling out, and there was no new growth of hair.  </li>
            <li> At first my hair fell out worse ...</li>
            <li> You definitely can see little hairs on my sculp, and I am not sure if it&#x27;s growth from breakage or new hair.</li>
            <li> the large dark bags/circles have started to diminish but it is slow to regain my &amp;#</li>
            <li> I wipe my finger on the outside of the dropper and apply that to my eyebrows (which have also become slightly thicker)</li>
            <li> I typically use it only once a day unless I remember to do it twice.</li>
            <li> No more,  no less.  </li>
            <li> The active ingredient MINOXIDIL has been known to cause facial swelling, puffiness, dark circles under the eye, as well as bags under the eyes.</li>
            <li> Because it is liquid that flows as freely as water, it can be difficult to apply because it can run down your forehead or to other parts of the scalp where it isn&#x27;t wanted.</li>
            <li> I ordered around three months ago &amp; about 6 weeks ago I noticed sprouts, my hair is about an inch long where I was thinning!!!</li>
            <li> The top of my hair had thinned out extremely bad.  </li>
            <li> ;  Well my hair is thinning but not how the picture shows, so I am out the money I spent for something I am told by the box not to use.  </li>
            <li> I used this rating because I haven&#x27;t seen the results I expected to get just yet.</li>
            <li> Be CAREFUL.  </li>
            <li> Several years ago I noticed a heavy thinning of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 30 year old female with thin hair in the family.</li>
            <li> I think that I can say I have seen some positive results, although not anything dramatic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same product for half the price!</li>
            <li> So, portions of my hair are 7 inches long and other are little nubs.  </li>
            <li> My hair loss was due to plain old aging (53), so I am not sure how would work on other hair loss issues.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried salon hair/scalp treatments, vitamins, biotin, viviscal hair pills, and other thinning hair shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of  minoxidil over the heard and this brand has worked well for me.</li>
            <li> I lost a lot of hair due to thyroid/hormone issues.  </li>
            <li> After losing hair, I researched on what other people were saying on the internet and found that others had this shedding experience as well.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product due to some balding areas</li>
            <li> I lost hair due to a the use of hair dye with ammonia.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Not too expensive comparing to medical treatments which can fail too - for way more money</li>
            <li> But my biggest annoyance was the aerosol behind the foam usually quit working shortly after opening a new can.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thin but this product has helped very much in making my hair thicker.  </li>
            <li> Do not expect major results for at least 3 months, but I can see progress already in less than on3 month.</li>
            <li> Other than this product can run down my forehead after it is applied...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen moderate hair regrowth and have no issue with that because I didn&#x27;t expect for my hair to be as thick as it once was.</li>
            <li> After about 3 weeks, the hair loss slowed down.  </li>
            <li> It takes about three months to see the results which I have, however, you can see little thin hairs growing on your face near the cheek area.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month an a half.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about 1 and a half months.</li>
            <li> I started using this product, along with Revita shampoo and Hairomega less than 3 months ago.  </li>
            <li> Even though I measure the product, I seem to go through a bottle in less than a month.</li>
            <li> I decided that I could either choose pretty hats or scarves, or I could solve the problem, and for a crazy variety of prices.  </li>
            <li> no significant improvement on using this product.</li>
            <li> It scratched so bad like right down under all the skin layers....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had flat thin hair, but in the past 2 years it&#x27;s been falling out at an alarming rate.</li>
            <li> I do wish reviews that contain spelling errors would be considered not credible and would not be posted.</li>
            <li> Tried it a few times but just makes my hair grease.  </li>
            <li> Finally one night, tired of a lengthy routine to prevent my face from swelling</li>
            <li> So you can choose to shave it off every few weeks.</li>
            <li> It is a hair loss concealer that not only conceals the thin spots, but also makes your hair fuller.</li>
            <li> It messes up your hair and you have to wash it everyday if you use the product everyday.  </li>
            <li> I finally threw the rest of what I had away because the nuisance was worse than the cure was helpful.  </li>
            <li> The price was ok but was disappointed in the product itselfIit made my hair feel very hard no improvement noted would not purchase again</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be warned though, unwanted hair may start to grow in random areas, when this happen, just stop using it for a few weeks and the soft small hairs will fall off.</li>
            <li> but it really isn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure if it works since I had to stop treatment after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> and I can notice small improvement</li>
            <li> Its hard to tell if it is working because it takes awhile to show results.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;ve noticed my temples looking a little thin.</li>
            <li> I received the product on time but none of the 3 bottles were sealed ... and they were in a clear plastic bad without the box or an instruction leaflet ..</li>
            <li> all negative</li>
            <li> Mine was under my eyes but nobody noticed even when I complained about them.</li>
            <li> have two negative issues with this product.  </li>
            <li> I started using Minoxidil and by the end of the 3 months noticed that I had regrown at least some of the hair.</li>
            <li> my face has slowly started to shed the puffiness features and</li>
            <li> The results from use of this product is quite slow and I am still evaluating.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by no means thick, but at least I have some hair in that spot again.</li>
            <li> However, due to health issues that arose, I was unable to take the product.</li>
            <li> This product gave me terrible dandruff (I was expecting some, but not that much), but I stuck with it for a month and a half.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest you try a very small patch to see if you get blisters.  </li>
            <li> I seriously advise you against using this product.</li>
            <li> It is less expensive and works just as well.</li>
            <li> Going through menopause was having a bad effect on my hairline, but I definitely recommend this product to women.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 28 and started thinning really bad about a year ago.</li>
            <li> It also turned my hair an ugly red.</li>
            <li> My evaluation therefor, is not entirely fair.  </li>
            <li> NOT A GOOD IDEA.  </li>
            <li> Using this product for five years, I have NEVER experienced a negative side effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the &#x27;push-down&#x27; &amp; turn cap function on the 6 months supply (6 bottles) are impossible to open.  </li>
            <li> I have thin patches all along my part and crown</li>
            <li> probably makes things worse.</li>
            <li> In some parts, my hair is so thin you can see the acne.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately one year and it does work.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how thin my hair was until I pulled out my passport.</li>
            <li> second issue is the liquid base of the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had baby-fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> My mother has really thin hair.</li>
            <li> began this treatment to replace the hair which I had lost when I was vitamin D deficient</li>
            <li> Rogaine is way too expensive</li>
            <li> unfortunately I develop a rash whenever I try to use it now.  </li>
            <li> However, they are expensive.  </li>
            <li> Did not use...the side effects are too scary.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I have to use it when the cats are not in the room because they jump up on the vanity in the bathroom when I apply it, and I&#x27;m afraid they would knock over the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too tedious to use!</li>
            <li> 2 weeks after day 1, my dandruff had gotten so bad that I decided I would rather have thinning hair than have tons of visible flakes.  </li>
            <li> I had really bad thinning edges from braids and weaves.</li>
            <li> must be a bad batch.....</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t horrible but co-workers began to ask me if I was tired or they would comment that I didn&#x27;t look rested.</li>
            <li> disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I time disappointed!</li>
            <li> Made my hairloss worse!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I&#x27;ve used on my scalp.</li>
            <li> My scalp now itches terribly and scabs coming off.</li>
            <li> Gave me terrible eye bags and puffy eyes.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can&#x27;t quite give 5 stars yet as I&#x27;ve just ordered the product, but I&#x27;ll come back an adjust if needed. I&#x27;m a 30 year old female with thin hair in the family. Both my mom and grandma (and maybe more) both have hair so thin you can see scalp. I&#x27;ve always had flat thin hair, but in the past 2 years it&#x27;s been falling out at an alarming rate. We&#x27;re talking 25 hairs every time I run my hand through my hair. I have thin patches all along my part and crown and now I&#x27;ve noticed my temples looking a little thin. I&#x27;ve tried salon hair/scalp treatments, vitamins, biotin, viviscal hair pills, and other thinning hair shampoos. Nothing has seemed to work! I do have a very high stress level in my life &amp; this probably makes things worse. I&#x27;ve tried improving my diet to see if that has an effect, but it&#x27;s too soon to tell. I&#x27;ve had my thyroids (and other possible things) checked as well, all negative (I guess that&#x27;s a good thing!) I have also always had a very greasy scalp even when I wash daily. I have scalp acne to go along with it. In some parts, my hair is so thin you can see the acne. This is my last resort as I&#x27;ll never be able to afford hair plugs/laser. I&#x27;m not too keen on having to do this for the rest of my life since I&#x27;m only 30, but I really don&#x27;t see any other way. I really hope this works!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work as the others of it&#x27;s kind have.  My scalp reacted differently it smelled different and after a year of using similar products (same brand, same ingredients) and achieving very good results, with this, all my new hair fell out and just in time for the holidays.&lt;br /&gt;  I procured more of this same product (supposedly) from WalMart and after a couple of weeks I&#x27;m glad to report my hair has started growing in again.  I will never again purchase this product online and if your hair is as important to you as mine is to me, neither will you.  Buy from the source.</li>
            <li> Am only 15 days into and see no difference so far. One bottle is suppose to last one month but my bottle has only enough left for about 3 days.  So, don&#x27;t count on a 3 month supply.  Will review again after 3 months when I can see if any renewed hair growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thirty three years old and I have mild but noticable hair loss. I have been using this product for 3.5 weeks. I had some shedding but now I am starting to see hair grow back. I know this product works and should definitely be tried.</li>
            <li> excellent results, hair grows more. easy to apply. good price for the amount of product. good brand, good result. i love it !!!</li>
            <li> I started using Rogaine with a doctors recommendation. She said the Minoxidol  in the rogaine helps stop hair loss. Sfter checking the ingredients I bought this product and it is really helping. A couple of the ingredients are different put this have the important ones. My hair has stopped falling out ! I use this one time a day at night and I still have seen a tremendous change. My hair loss has stopped and it is growing much faster. I am happy!!!</li>
            <li> I am very interested in trying this product. Most of the reviews are good and encouraging. It sounds like this product causes hair growth and is as advertised. It sounds like Equate brand is offered at an excellent price and many plan to reorder. I do wish reviews that contain spelling errors would be considered not credible and would not be posted. Why would I \\&quot;listen\\&quot; to a review on a product written by someone who cannot even spell correctly?</li>
            <li> It is not what I thought the description said it was.  When I received it, it shows a picture and says &amp;#34;if this is not how your hair thinning looks like do not use&amp;#34;  Well my hair is thinning but not how the picture shows, so I am out the money I spent for something I am told by the box not to use.  I feel it was mis-represented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I&#x27;ve used on my scalp. Ever. I&#x27;ve tried many products, but this has such a strong alcohol smell that people 10 - 15 feet away were asking what the alcohol smell in the room was at least 20 minutes after I put it on. I can only imagine it will dry out the scalp. I seriously advise you against using this product. Other generics I&#x27;ve used are fine.</li>
            <li> This was a great deal and I got it on time. Price was reasonable compare to outside prices. And I got it in the mail in good time.</li>
            <li> I had a spot on the crown of my head that was balding - literally, I had to brush my hair over the spot and spray it in place so that my scalp wouldn&#x27;t show through.  Two months after using this product, the spot was almost completely filled in - and four months later, it is as though the spot never existed.  I liked it so much that I began using it along the part on top of my head, and my hair stylist commented that my hair was thicker &amp;#34;and there hairs all over your  head that are 3 inches longer than the rest&amp;#34;!  Confirmation that I didn&#x27;t really need, because it very clearly works.  My hair loss was due to plain old aging (53), so I am not sure how would work on other hair loss issues.  But if you think getting old means thinning hair, think again!!  I am a customer for life.</li>
            <li> It works but takes about 3 months. Finally you stop finding a hairbrush full of hair. You have to keep using it or go back to losing hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month an a half. My hair has grown back.</li>
            <li> It is too early to tell if it is going to work, however I have been using it for almost a month and am starting to notice a bit of a difference in thickness already. I would order from here again as it came in quick and there was no damage.</li>
            <li> This product gave me terrible dandruff (I was expecting some, but not that much), but I stuck with it for a month and a half.  All the while, my hair was falling out, and there was no new growth of hair.  So I&#x27;ve stopped using this product, and will never use it again.  It&#x27;s a shame I can&#x27;t get my money back at this point.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my hair. I waste of good money. I I think it&#x27;s basically water. I should have sent it back</li>
            <li> This stuff really works over time.</li>
            <li> Will buy more excellent product</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best!!!! rigth now my wife get more hair really works!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. Rogaine is way too expensive so I don&#x27;t bother with that but this brand is great bang for your buck and works very well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me.  I time disappointed!</li>
            <li> After only 5 days my scalp had tiny blisters all over it.  I would suggest you try a very small patch to see if you get blisters.  My scalp now itches terribly and scabs coming off.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for awhile and my thining spots have disapeared and also My hair is full again, the only thing about this product, you need to continue to use it for awhile longer, its worth the money.</li>
            <li> Does the same job as the high price stuff,&lt;br /&gt;but found it cheaper at WalMart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep the bottle you are using about 1/4 full,&lt;br /&gt;they are easy to tip over. Better to  lose 1/4&lt;br /&gt;or less than a full bottle.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair grease.  Tried it a few times but just makes my hair grease.  My hair is baby fine though</li>
            <li> Okay people the instructions say it takes about 8, yes 8 months to see a difference in hair growth. I am seeing reviews from people who have tried this for under two months and complaining. I have been using this product for about ten weeks. I don&#x27;t always use it twice a day. You definitely can see little hairs on my sculp, and I am not sure if it&#x27;s growth from breakage or new hair. I will update in August after my eight months are up.                                                                                                                                                                                                1/15/2016 I have been using this product for approximately one year and it does work.I didn&#x27;t realize how thin my hair was until I pulled out my passport. I don&#x27;t always remember to use it twice a day, but will need to continue use if I want to maintain my hair growth.</li>
            <li> I use this faithfully and have gotten wonderful results.  The price is wonderful and I&#x27;d purchase this before I&#x27;d go with the Rogaine.  It&#x27;s the same product for half the price!</li>
            <li> I have just started using it so cannot say much. But m looking forward for good results. Hope it works</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the generic equivalent to Rogaine- works just as well, same active ingredient at the same dosage but more affordable.  Most people need to use it for life for continued benefit.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years- after following the recommended twice daily application for the first year I reduced usage to once daily or every other day and it seems to still be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some prefer the foam but I find more of the foam ends up on my hair than on the scalp which isn&#x27;t desirable as it contains drying alcohol.  I find the eyedropper to be a more effective disbursal tool as more reaches the scalp.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference yet only used it for 3 weeks but it dried my scalp completely out. Flakey dry itchy scalp isn&#x27;t fun. I will use it every other day to see if that&#x27;s better for me in conjunction with my nioxin shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> The price was ok but was disappointed in the product itselfIit made my hair feel very hard no improvement noted would not purchase again</li>
            <li> I can honestly state, &amp;#34;my hair loss is a lot less; it is normal, about 50 hairs daily. I have not used it long enough to confirm hair growth. You start seeing hair growth between 2 and 4 months. I have used it for almost 2 months. It is possible I do have some hair growth, but it is so fine, I can&#x27;t see it. I recommend this hair regrow treatment for women.</li>
            <li> If you already have even a slightly dry scalp problem,  leave this stuff alone. I was so excited to receive this and get started regrowing some hair. I followed the instructions exactly,  using 1 mL twice a day. No more,  no less.  A week in, I started seeing some flakes but continued on with the applications.  2 weeks after day 1, my dandruff had gotten so bad that I decided I would rather have thinning hair than have tons of visible flakes.  I stopped using it over 2 weeks ago and I am almost back to a normal (for me) scalp.  I am happy that this works for others,  because I know the angst associated with hair loss.  It&#x27;s not returnable, so Buyer Beware.</li>
            <li> As per the directions: &amp;#34;If you have no history of family hair loss&amp;#34; (do not use).  This is true for my family when it comes to the women.  My hair has thinned as I&#x27;ve gotten older, so I thought it would encourage growth.  I don&#x27;t have any bald spots, just fine hair, so I guess I&#x27;m back to my Nioxin routine:  I use their shampoo, conditioner, spray gel and hair thickening spray.  My favorites there are the conditioner (most leave my hair flat) and the hair thickening spray.</li>
            <li> The only thing that happened to me is the monster scratching. It scratched so bad like right down under all the skin layers....omg</li>
            <li> Its a great product. Follow the instruction exactly and your hair will grow.  Very good price. Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> This may not be a miracle, but it is helping.  What I really like is that it doesn&#x27;t have a smell.  No strong odors like most of the other hair treatments have.  I do see what looks like new growth.</li>
            <li> After reading a review about buying Equate at Walmarts, I checked it out on-line and they carry the 3 month supply for $18.76 for those wanting to try this product and also save some money.  There is free shipping at Walmarts with a $50 purchase. I went to Walmart&#x27;s, and sure enough they had this Equate.  Update: December 12, 2013  After using this product for a month, I concentrated at the temple areas only, and found new hair growth within a month.  You should always check with your doctor to make sure there are no other problems that are causing hair loss, but I find so far the product to be working for me.  Also, I did not vote for \\&quot;myself\\&quot; as what good would that do for me or any other reviewer(?)</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of  minoxidil over the heard and this brand has worked well for me. I will keep buying.</li>
            <li> Using it every day and believe that it is working for me. I guess I&#x27;ll know more as time passes.</li>
            <li> It took around three months of steady use, but the thin hair at my temples is growing back and my hair has never looked so good! Going through menopause was having a bad effect on my hairline, but I definitely recommend this product to women. It did also have a side effect, but it was a good one. My normally sparse and thin eyebrows and eyelashes also began to thicken and grow back, which was amazing! The product is affordable and works, even if it is kind of inconvenient to have to apply it twice a day.</li>
            <li> i almost died of a heart attack.......with thicker hair</li>
            <li> I used this for a couple months.  I have very thin hair.  So I really want to keep as much hair on my head.&lt;br /&gt;This product worked well.  My hairdresser said she saw some new growth on my head.  So it was a success using this product.</li>
            <li> My hair was so thin, you could easily see my scalp.  I decided that I could either choose pretty hats or scarves, or I could solve the problem, and for a crazy variety of prices.  On the side of this box, a drawing indicates who it will work for, and that it won&#x27;t work for bald spots, however, I had one nickel-sized spot near my forehead that is no longer bare.  I suppose they didn&#x27;t want returns from people who didn&#x27;t have this positive effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need to continue using any minoxidil product indefinitely, or all the new growth will fall out in a number of months, but at ~$22 (~$18 at Walmart) for a 3 month supply, I think it&#x27;s well worth it. Minoxidil is the effective ingredient in all of the brands.  The prices quoted herein, I found online today (4/2014), and they are as follows:  ~$39 for the Walgreens generic; Pantene&#x27;s version costs  ~$44 at Walgreens, and the Rogaine brand name at Walgreens will cost you ~$52 for 3 months.  Each generic or brand name has exactly the same chemical and strength (for the women&#x27;s formula -- the men&#x27;s formula has an extra strength minoxidil also), so the low cost Equate version is the only one that makes sense to me.  The choice for a three month supply comes down to the price you are willing to pay:  $18/$22, $44, or $52.  If the name on a bottle that no one but family will see is important to you, go ahead and spend more.  I&#x27;ll stick with $18 at Walmart (and $22 this time because I couldn&#x27;t get to Walmart).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[NOTE:  Definition of a tilde, \\&quot;~\\&quot; -- in chemistry and math, it means \\&quot;approximately\\&quot;]</li>
            <li> I used this rating because I haven&#x27;t seen the results I expected to get just yet. I&#x27;v been using for about 6 months. My hair hasn&#x27;t gotten any thinner on the sides of my head so that&#x27;s good. I&#x27;m going to give it awhile longer. Plus I do take vitamins for skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered around three months ago &amp; about 6 weeks ago I noticed sprouts, my hair is about an inch long where I was thinning!!! They claim its a three months supply but it lasted me about 6 weeks as I cover my entire head. It really does work like a dream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright I suppose but my hair is still falling out using the 2% . When I was using the 5% Rogain my hair had stopped falling out . For my next order I&#x27;ll try the Equate 5% and see if that makes the difference . Shipping was right on time though !!</li>
            <li> This stuff works so well. I send this to all of the women in my family. Great price. My mother has NEVER had hair  on her right side. Since using this, the bare side has completely grown in. I have never seen hair on her right side. Her hair has filled in completely all over because it was thinning due to her being in her 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I bought this to grow my eyebrows back. Through years of plucking, some of my eyebrows refused to grow, so I&#x27;d use a Q-Tip and applyed it to my eyebrows once in the morning and once at night. After a few months, I started to get compliments from my sisters, friends and even customers about my thick, nice eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned though, unwanted hair may start to grow in random areas, when this happen, just stop using it for a few weeks and the soft small hairs will fall off. Nothing to sweat over! Only you&#x27;ll notice them anyways. Mine was under my eyes but nobody noticed even when I complained about them. They&#x27;re now gone however, whew!</li>
            <li> I take many supplements for hair:  A bald spot disappeared, and my hair is still pretty full.  But around my curly bangs are bare spots such that if my hair was straight they&#x27;d show.  So I&#x27;ve used this on those bald stops morning and night and I have victory!  My hair is filling in!</li>
            <li> I  love this product....I am 77 and have used Equate for over 2 years......my hair is not like I was 20 but sure is a lot thicker than it was before I started using Equate.........I applied it twice a day for 2 years and have switched to once a day for 6 months and it is working fine...........I think it is a good idea to check your blood pressure twice a day at the beginning.....try it you will like it</li>
            <li> What you are not told is it will only work on certain minor types of hair loss.  If your loss is in areas all over your head, it will not work.  Why do they not share this information before you purchase - oh so they get your money!</li>
            <li> WARNING! Please read up on the side effects before buying this. I did light research before buying this and felt satisfied with what I had read. After two months of using this I did indeed notice tiny hairs along my crown starting to sprout. I was beyond excited. During this time I started to notice that my face looked like it was retaining water and I developed bags underneath my eyes. I changed my coffee intake, started to go to bed earlier, I even started to sleep with the heater on at night because my face was swollen every morning. It wasn&#x27;t horrible but co-workers began to ask me if I was tired or they would comment that I didn&#x27;t look rested. I went so far as to buy eye masks and totally changed me routine. I assumed it was stress. Finally one night, tired of a lengthy routine to prevent my face from swelling I started to think about what was the only difference in my routine. In between reading up on anti-inflammatory supplements I washed my face, brushed my teeth, and applied the hair treatment. Within 20 minutes I had large bags again under my eyes which hadn&#x27;t been there earlier (I had iced my eyes with my mask). It was enough for me to look into the side effects of Rogaine and its generic products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first search I did on the side effects answered all of my questions. I then read as much as I could. The active ingredient MINOXIDIL has been known to cause facial swelling, puffiness, dark circles under the eye, as well as bags under the eyes. There are other side effects that are not as noticeable and very much tolerable, but since facial swelling is not something that can be hid and directly affects your appearance, it is vital that you know this is a POTENTIAL side effect you may endure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I have chosen not to use this any longer even though I was starting to see regrowth. Since I stopped using this my face has slowly started to shed the puffiness features and the large dark bags/circles have started to diminish but it is slow to regain my &amp;#34;old face.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think that this will or would effect everyone who uses it but I did think that it was important for anyone who buys this to know that this is a potential effect and that if you begin to notice subtle changes in your face that there is a good chance it is due to the regrowth product.w to regain my &amp;#34;old face.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think that this will or would effect everyone who uses it but I did think that it was important for anyone who buys this to know that this is a potential effect and that if you begin to notice subtle changes in your face that there is a good chance it is due to the regrowth product.</li>
            <li> Minoxidil does work great....unfortunately I develop a rash whenever I try to use it now.  This didn&#x27;t happen until I&#x27;d used it for 3 months.  sigh.</li>
            <li> All you mature women that have thinning hair, this really works!!&lt;br /&gt;Been using it 8 months and my hair growth is amazing&lt;br /&gt;My dermatology said the 5% solution was fine, although the label says for men only</li>
            <li> Made my hairloss worse!!!! My mom and I both tried it faithfully. My scalp seemed to burn somewhat and the hairloss became more severe.</li>
            <li> Excellent product really works got for my mom for her thinning hair only been 3 months and already see results new hair is growing and old hair is getting thicker and fuller</li>
            <li> This is comparable to Rogaine for Women; 2% minoxidil is 2% minoxidil regardless of the brand.  I&#x27;ve used both Rogaine for Women and Equate and see no difference at all.  I&#x27;ve seen moderate hair regrowth and have no issue with that because I didn&#x27;t expect for my hair to be as thick as it once was. The texture of  my hair has improved, too, so that I no longer use mousse when I style it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two negative issues with this product.  First, the three bottles of Rogaine or Equate do not last three months as advertised. I&#x27;ve read this complaint from other users and thought they were probably using too much product, so I made a point of carefully filling the included eyedropper to slightly below the line marked on the eyedropper.  I wipe my finger on the outside of the dropper and apply that to my eyebrows (which have also become slightly thicker) then part my hair from forehead to crown, one row at the time, about 1/4 inch apart, and dab the tip of the eyedropper along the part lines (using much the same technique as when I dab stencil paint on a project).  I part my hair with the pointed end of a rattail comb and use the back of the comb on the other end to massage the liquid into my scalp. I know some people wear gloves when applying the liquid, but I don&#x27;t because I wash my hands thoroughly after applying it.  Besides, hair won&#x27;t grow where there have been no follicles, i.e. hair might grow on the back of the fingers between the knuckles but not on the finger tips because there never was any hair on the finger tips. And hair won&#x27;t grow on the back of the fingers if your hands are washed after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second issue is the liquid base of the product.  Because it is liquid that flows as freely as water, it can be difficult to apply because it can run down your forehead or to other parts of the scalp where it isn&#x27;t wanted. Why can&#x27;t they put it in a gel or cream? If the instructions describe how much to use, for example &amp;#34;squeeze out anamount the size of a pea&amp;#34;, you won&#x27;t use more than you should. The liquid is easier to spill than gel or cream would be. I have to use it when the cats are not in the room because they jump up on the vanity in the bathroom when I apply it, and I&#x27;m afraid they would knock over the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If pharmaceutical companies can put this in liquid form, I don&#x27;t see why they can&#x27;t find a medium that is easier to apply.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to any woman with hair loss I have thyroid issues and my hair was coming out massively until my medication kicked in, this helped to grow my hair back fast and strong.</li>
            <li> It really works and I use it every day. It makes my hair thicker and fuller. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for one month its too soon to tell, ask me again later. then I can give a more informed review--- I have been using it for almost three months and it not working, so I cannot in good conscience recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m seeing great results!</li>
            <li> Only used for about a month now...don&#x27;t see any hair growth yet, but significant reduction in hair loss. The dropper is very convenient for delivering the medication.</li>
            <li> It does grow hair but the hair that grows is wispy and doesn&#x27;t seem to get very long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several months- didn&#x27;t do much too much for regrowth. It also turned my hair an ugly red.</li>
            <li> Its hard to tell if it is working because it takes awhile to show results. Its easy to apply and I hope it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Equate hair regrowth treatment for 6months and I have not seen any significant hair growth, I thinking maybe I might have a underlying medical condition that might be affected my hair loss.</li>
            <li> Do not like it it make my hair very itchi</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both the name brand and the Equate brand.  I really don&#x27;t see any difference.  I lost a lot of hair due to thyroid/hormone issues.  I have seen doctors and take medications to correct the problem.  But my hair did not grow back!  I had actual bald spots and thought I would have a lifetime of hats and/or wigs. I saw a dermatologist that specializes in women&#x27;s issues, including hair loss.  He told me the most cost effective route would be to try 2% minoxidil first and if it did not work we would go further.  I experienced visible results in less than a month!  Now, a year later, my hair has completely grown in and is stronger and fuller than before. I&#x27;ve always had baby-fine, thin hair and I still do. But  my hair is fuller, thicker and stronger (and longer!) than it was in my 20&#x27;s (I&#x27;m now 52).  Worth a try?  Absolutely.</li>
            <li> I am on my second order now. I have been using this product for four months now and as directed, so twice a day I put it on my hair. I have seen a difference in my hair. I took before and after pictures and there is definitely an increase in the thickness in my hair. Friends have also noticed that my hair has improved. So I would definitely recommend this product if you have thinning hair. Be patient though, I noticed a difference after two months.</li>
            <li> am delighted with the results of using this product. While it doesn&#x27; regrow hair, it helps by slowing the loss. Am very pleased with the product, the price and the results.</li>
            <li> I like it.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It takes about three months to see the results which I have, however, you can see little thin hairs growing on your face near the cheek area.  So you can choose to shave it off every few weeks.</li>
            <li> Easy application, no strong odor, thickening the hair (re-grow) after suffering hair loss.It is strongly recommended, the price is affordable.</li>
            <li> I used it as directed for 4 months and it had no effect</li>
            <li> I actually like this product better than Rogaine for women.  It is less expensive and works just as well.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m ordering another 3 months supply and if then I have no regrowth I&#x27;ll give up on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any side effects, no stickiness, no odor.</li>
            <li> First, this is the \\&quot;Equate\\&quot; brand which is exclusive to Walmart so I have no idea what it is doing on Amazon, or even if the seller has the right to sell this on Amazon.  This is the same review I put up on Walmart.  If you can buy from Walmart, they do have the 3 month supply for $19 with free shipping with $45 or more right now (4/2/12).  Make sure the description says 3 month supply.  Plus, with Walmart I always receive mine in a box that is sealed and instructions are included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I must say, when you are a woman and losing your hair please, go get some blood tests done. My mother has really thin hair. I told her I was losing it by the handfuls. She said it was in the genes. I was really worried though because it was really, a small handful when I combed it. It got to the point that I didn&#x27;t even want to comb it. I had just had a baby and had been nursing (but things were too stressful and I quit#. My mom said maybe it was the nursing #she was a little concerned when she saw how much I lost with each brushing#, but I had explained I had stopped a month previously, plus I had never lost so much with my other babies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to get a blood test. My thyroid was normal #I was almost sure it would be the thyroid# but my vitamin D was low. MANY women are vitamin D deficient or insufficient and don&#x27;t even know it. I then made it a point to go out and get 15 minutes of sunlight #without sunblock# daily and I noticed a difference. I had to begin Vitamin D supplements to be able to assure I would get enough but it took about a month before it actually built up in my system enough to see a difference #ie not having to go out in the sun so my hair wouldn&#x27;t fall out#. You can OD on vitamin D so please, go to a doctor to make sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began this treatment to replace the hair which I had lost when I was vitamin D deficient and also some I had lost years ago taking a medicine that caused me to have a bald patch toward the front hairline. I havenoticed a major difference. I have used this for about 1 and a half months. I have wispy new hairs all along the hairline and other areas I applied this. I am not as embarassed to pull my hair back in a ponytail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This medicine is applied using the enclosed 1 ml dropper. You apply it twice a day to the patches you have lost. I think that is the biggest downfall because I know I have lost a lot of hair but only 2 places I am sure of are patchy loss. The others seem a more all over hair loss but I am unsure because I can&#x27;t see well. I would love for this treatment to be a more \\&quot;all over\\&quot; treatment, but I think, at that point, you would get too much minoxidil in your system. You need to apply this after showering and can&#x27;t wash it off within 4 hours if you want it to work. You can wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner and then apply the medicine.  I was worried that it would be way too greasy but it really isn&#x27;t too bad.  It is more watery than greasy and I barely notice that I put it on.  Sometimes I have to inspect really well to assure that I have put it on that day or not.  You also run the risk of losing the hair you grew back if you stop using it...but at this price, it is totally worth it to continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am grateful that Walmart (I guess Amazon, in this case) offers this item for this price. Rogaine is so much more expensive and other store brands aren&#x27;t too cheap either. I looked into buying the rogaine for men to help with cost, before I found this product from walmart. Buying the product for men you have a greater risk of growing facial hair and other things most women would not appreciate! Technically, I suppose you may be able to dilute the men&#x27;s product to the women&#x27;s potency, but I am glad I don&#x27;t have to deal with that or worry about that with this product and the price offered!</li>
            <li> have been using this product for about a year. My hair is very thin but this product has helped very much in making my hair thicker.  Very good product... :)</li>
            <li> no significant improvement on using this product.</li>
            <li> Great Transaction Thank you!</li>
            <li> Gave me terrible eye bags and puffy eyes.  I had to stop it and thank god it&#x27;s reversed.  Be CAREFUL.  Oh and the shedding.  The dreadful shedding.</li>
            <li> Great value, three times cheaper than Regaine and does the same job.  Not an instant cure - needs regular use, but does improve thickness and texture of hair.  Particularly good for hormonal conditions that affect hair loss eg. menstruation link, after childbirth and menopause.</li>
            <li> I did not try the product.  I was somewhat hesitant to apply it to my hair.  I did not like the &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; form.  Being an aftican american with no relaxer in my hair, I thought it may make my hair draw up.</li>
            <li> This has worked well for me. I started using it in November 2014 and in February 2015 I have new hairs that are about an inch long. At first my hair fell out worse ... then it stopped. You can buy this at WalMart for $18 &amp; change ... but believe it or not, not everyone lives near a WalMart! I know I will have to use this twice a day for the rest of my life ... if you stop using it, you will lose the hair you have grown. One thing I highly recommend in conjunction with this product is DermMatch. It is a hair loss concealer that not only conceals the thin spots, but also makes your hair fuller. It doesn&#x27;t rub off on pillows either. Look it up for yourself ... there is a money back guarantee. It&#x27;s really been a blessing for me. http://www.dermmatch.com/?gclid&#x3D;Cj0KEQiAvKunBRCfsum9z6fu_5IBEiQAu4lg4k7LFxd2bnTBbofEhIf4Jc2meZytFjPfv7ZCpMBXQ04aAlBb8P8HAQ</li>
            <li> This product is the truth. I wish that I can upload a picture of my hair growth. I had really bad thinning edges from braids and weaves. I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last couple of months and it&#x27;s been a miracle. You have to be patient. It can take anywhere from 3-6 months to see results.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if it works since I had to stop treatment after a couple of weeks. Makes my scalp itchy and unbearable. Don&#x27;t use if you have a sensitive scalp</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s been about 3 months but I can finally say with certainty that my hair has improved. I&#x27;m only 28 and started thinning really bad about a year ago. My thinning was mostly near the front of my crown. . Almost like a female pattern hair loss thing. This has filled in some pretty sparse spots and helped my widened part as well. I have also noticed that I no longer have a ton of shedding in the shower.  I&#x27;d say about a 75% decrease in hair loss. I&#x27;m very happy with this product. I typically use it only once a day unless I remember to do it twice.</li>
            <li> I have used rogaine before but it was gone before I knew it. Rogaine is really expensive and this is the perfect price for the perfect amount. I am so excited about having a three month supply for such a low price. I&#x27;m so glad that they came so fast also.</li>
            <li> Its only been 1 month so its early on for me but product is easy to apply. Theres a few white short strands appearing and the shedding phase is what Im in right now, which I read means the product is working. Im very hopeful so far.</li>
            <li> I wish they had this product in a foam, I would have used it more</li>
            <li> I want to return this item.  It is not advertised.  I WAS LOOKING FOR a hair thickener  I would like to return this item</li>
            <li> This works well to KEEP the hair u have IF used 2 x each day on a regular basis. I have been using it for years with great results...make sue to use enough around the front hairline.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about 6 weeks when I began to lose lots of hair.  It was very noticeable when I washed my hair.  I had the product for quite sometime before I started to use it but I still used it within the expiration date.  When I realized that the hair loss must be related to the product, I stopped using it.  I haven&#x27;t used it for a month now and I think that I am not losing as much hair.  Hopefully my hair will grow back.  I have always had fine thin hair and noticed more thinning at the back of my head lately so that is why I started using it.  Now I hope that my hair will grow back in and am thankful for what I had before I starting using this product and wished I hadn&#x27;t used it.  I read all the directions and &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; was not listed as a side effect.  After losing hair, I researched on what other people were saying on the internet and found that others had this shedding experience as well.  This product may work for others but I am glad I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I received the product on time but none of the 3 bottles were sealed ... and they were in a clear plastic bad without the box or an instruction leaflet ..so im not even sure if the liquid in the bottles is the real stuff</li>
            <li> Works very well. Have used it for a while now (3 years) and new hair is constantly growing, nice :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 months after my hair dresser stated I had hair loss call the \\&quot;Christmas Tree\\&quot;.  Loss was on the top of my head and I really didn&#x27;t pay much attention at the time.  But I did research and tried this product.  It really works.  Now, I am a mature woman and questioned whether it would work at all on me. But it did. In addition, the directions stated that \\&quot;hair growth takes time\\&quot;. And it does! I have purchased my second box.  Am very happy with the product and suprised with the results. I would happily recommend this product.  The price is very right.  Thank you Minoxidil.....I&#x27;ll be back.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any improvement after a month! I am going to continue to use the reminder of what I have but am not feeling too confident at this point.</li>
            <li> I was not able to consistently stay with the program of treatment.  My evaluation therefor, is not entirely fair.  I just finally decided to live with my hair like it is. I tossed what was left of the product.</li>
            <li> My part is much thinner and my hair looks so much fuller.  My friends even noticed the difference and I don&#x27;t feel self conscious about my hair anymore.  Love it.  I just ordered and received my second batch.  Will continue to order.  Great price too.  Much cheaper than Kerinique and same ingredients.</li>
            <li> This stuff REALLY works!! It takes at least 2-3 Months to see the results and some of the new hair is my original dark auburn instead of white, but it looks great!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year with much success. Unfortunately, the &#x27;push-down&#x27; &amp; turn cap function on the 6 months supply (6 bottles) are impossible to open.  I&#x27;m using a screw driver- must be a bad batch.....if it happens again, I will return the order.</li>
            <li> No need to buy Rogaine.  This works just fine and you don&#x27;t need to spend the extra money for the sake of a brand name.</li>
            <li> It does slowly deliver hair regrowth which is a Godsent for women with thinning hair at a relatively low cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am however experiencing psoriasis on my scalp which can be very itchy at times.  It is only visible when you look very close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried Rogaine at a much higher price and I find that they both deliver about the same results.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product due to some balding areas I, as well as my sister noticed on my scalp. However, due to health issues that arose, I was unable to take the product. I contacted the merchant and was given quick assistance in the matter.&lt;br /&gt;With such lovely customer service, I highly recommend this product and any other product offered to any young woman in need of assistance with hair regrowth problems.</li>
            <li> I have been using Keranique products for over a year.  When I started, you could see my scalp through my hair no matter how I styled it.  The Keranique shampoo and other products actually made my hair look thicker right away.  However, they are expensive.  About a month ago, when I was getting low on the minoxidil, I decided to see if I could find it cheaper online.  I found this offer for the Equate -- and it was a 3-month supply for the same price as the Keranique for 1 month.  I can see no difference in results with the Equate vs. the Keranique.  Just be aware, you have to keep using the minoxidil or you will start to lose your hair again.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t work on everyone.  The literature that comes with it says it works best for people that baldness runs in their family.  I am one of the lucky ones -- I can style my hair any way I want now and my scalp does not show through!!</li>
            <li> I am a middle-aged woman with thinning hair, particularly in front.  I decided to try this product, based on other reviews and because I didn&#x27;t really want to spend the money on the name-brand version unless I was sure it would have a positive effect.  I&#x27;ve used it for roughly 5-6 months now, although I do NOT use it twice a day; only at bedtime. The product is not thick or gunky, but it is not suitable for me to use in the mornings before going to work.. I think that I can say I have seen some positive results, although not anything dramatic.  I think it has slowed the thinning some and there seems to be some re-growth, although the hairs are very, very fine and do not really have much length, so far.  I will continue to use the product and I am optimistic that there may be more improvement, although I have to be realistic.  I don&#x27;t think my hair will go back to the way it was when I was younger.  I suggest trying this product.</li>
            <li> I  bought this product because the name brand one cost too much.. It still worked as good as the name brand.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help with loss of hair, and after three months there was the same amount of hair. I suppose it does not work for everybody. There were no negative side effects, but no positive ones either.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Same as name brand. Makes me feel like I&#x27;m doing something proactive. Does seem to arrest some hair loss in my case.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and great product!</li>
            <li> I started using this product, along with Revita shampoo and Hairomega less than 3 months ago.  I am just starting to see some 1 inch hairs sprouting up on my scalp.  Hope that the improvement continues! Even though I measure the product, I seem to go through a bottle in less than a month.</li>
            <li> Too tedious to use! Twice a day forever -- and it is then only effective on the male pattern areas (the part and top center). Not the temple and general thinning that I and most of my friends are experiencing with menopause.</li>
            <li> The results from use of this product is quite slow and I am still evaluating.  Do not expect major results for at least 3 months, but I can see progress already in less than on3 month.</li>
            <li> No need to spend more for this product or brand name - it works just like the &amp;#34;other brand&amp;#34;. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Equate Hair Regrowth Treatment did not regrow hair. It actually caused significantly MORE HAIR LOSS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed in this product. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used Minoxidil for about 6 years.  At one time, I had a huge bald spot in the top of my head created by too many chemicals in my hair.  Once I started using Minoxidil, my hair started growing back.  This is something that I will probably have to use forever, however, it is has become part of my daily routine...When I wash up in the morning, I use it.  Before I go to bed at night, I use it.  No hassle at all.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it and likes it.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Even on eyebrows.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Price is just right. For the price of one on Keratinique, you get 3 here, and the ingredients are exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I had lost so much hair on the top of my head that I was all but bald. I started using Minoxidil and by the end of the 3 months noticed that I had regrown at least some of the hair. It&#x27;s by no means thick, but at least I have some hair in that spot again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I have been using it as directed for several years now.  It definitely has kept my hair from thinning.  Equate is the most economical brand.  I recommend it!</li>
            <li> It really really works!!!!!  I&#x27;ve only been using it for 7 weeks and already see a huge difference.  I&#x27;m so happy. I&#x27;m no longer depressed about my hair loss.  I&#x27;m a lot more cofident.  Thank you Equate for making a difference in so many lives.</li>
            <li> The top of my hair had thinned out extremely bad.  I started to use this product along with a laser comb.  My hair has now thicken back up and the sides and the back of my hair has continued to grow.  I highly recommend this product.  I just reordered another three month supply.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the Minoxidil name brand, but have used the Equate brand.  My hair is receding and thinning on top and at the temples.  The product seemed to help a little, but it really was a hassle to use.  It messes up your hair and you have to wash it everyday if you use the product everyday.  But my biggest annoyance was the aerosol behind the foam usually quit working shortly after opening a new can.  I finally threw the rest of what I had away because the nuisance was worse than the cure was helpful.  I MAY try the name brand, but my husband says he&#x27;ll love me even if I go bald :-) so I may just accept whatever comes.  (I&#x27;m 70 y/o and he&#x27;s 80, so I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s going anywhere.  It just robs me of my self-esteem.)</li>
            <li> I lost hair due to a the use of hair dye with ammonia.  I have relaxed hair and that is a no-no.  Now I know.  I decided to use this product to deal with the hair loss.  NOT A GOOD IDEA.  I now have bald spots where I used the product.  No doubt it opened the follicle to let the hair grow, but as my follices were fine, the hair fell out.  I only applied it to the areas that were thinning and that is where the hair came out.  It was as if was on chemo; each time I washed my hair, more and more came out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it as I noticed my hair line was \\&quot;gone.\\&quot;  In the following weeks is when the hair loss intensified as a described above.  After about 3 weeks, the hair loss slowed down.  New growth is coming back. I only applied the solution to the areas impacted by the dye mishap. So, portions of my hair are 7 inches long and other are little nubs.  Well, it&#x27;s just hair and it&#x27;s growing back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moral is, unless you really have a baldness/thinning issue, don&#x27;t use it.  No doubt when used for it&#x27;s intended purpose, it will work just fine.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t like it but my hairdresser said one of her customers used it for a year with no results, then her hair started to fall out after she quit using it.  It isn&#x27;t worth the risk.</li>
            <li> It works for my mother, the result appeared after two months of use, and I ordered another one.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied, indeed.</li>
            <li> All my research says this is the stuff and I can see new growth so that is good enough for me. Hardest part is remembering to use it twice a day so I keep it with my toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Did not want to use every day!</li>
            <li> I decided to try the store brand as it was cheaper. I was very surprised the results were the same I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Hair has been really good since I have been taking this. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I am 80 years old. Several years ago I noticed a heavy thinning of my hair. Since using  Equate I am very happy with the result. The product is helping in stopping the hair loss and maintaining a full head of hair.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> nice for my hair would buy again from seller</li>
            <li> It went very well, very grateful, excellent product, received on time, a very good experience, I will be back to buy the product</li>
            <li> Did not use...the side effects are too scary. Had I been able to read the label beforehand, I would not have made this purchase.</li>
            <li> This economy package is a great way to keep the treatment on hand!  A single purchase at a local drug store is nearly the same price as the 3-pack.  The product has worked very well for me and I am happy with the purchase, the price and the quick shipment.</li>
            <li> I am using this product with vivscial hair supplement. And within 2 weeks I have seen improvement. But when I use the equate it leave my hair looking oily. I am thinking of trying the foam type next.</li>
            <li> Been using it for over a month, working for me, happy with the product</li>
            <li> This really works, my hair was thinning, and after use my hair is thick again. My hairdresser is so impressed. Very easy to apply, no scent, so easy to use. Great product!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, less expensive generic form of Rogaine.  Using this product for five years, I have NEVER experienced a negative side effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if this truly works, but I do have many new strands of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beth</li>
            <li> I like this  product, I think it works just as well as the name brands out their.</li>
            <li> Other than this product can run down my forehead after it is applied...it is actually watery...and have to tilt my head back&lt;br /&gt;so it doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes...but  some downy hair is appearing, so that is nice. Will continue using product.</li>
            <li> I am not in the group this is intended for - but still I am using it and I can notice small improvement althugh I am not the target group for this product&lt;br /&gt;Price is good and if you need it, give it a try&lt;br /&gt;Not too expensive comparing to medical treatments which can fail too - for way more money</li>
    </ol>
