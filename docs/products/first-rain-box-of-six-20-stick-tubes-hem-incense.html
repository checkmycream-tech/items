            <li>Lovely scent!</li>
            <li>Nice refreshing scent!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I ordered these and even happier that they came in a good quantity.</li>
            <li>Great price, fast shipping</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>Great incense but burns fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a cologne than a nature scent.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>they was ok kinda strong</li>
            <li>These are so nice and such a mild and beautiful scent.  </li>
            <li>nice, clean, fresh-smelling, I found the sticks to burn too quickly.  </li>
            <li>This smell is really strong.  </li>
            <li>perfect for the bedroom where you don&#x27;t want a heavy scent.</li>
            <li>, I guess it wasn&#x27;t quite what I was expecting, but I grew to really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>, it gives fresh air, ty :)</li>
            <li>this is a fresh clean scent I love</li>
            <li>First time with this scent I love it during the day</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would have a fresh clean smell but instead, it smells like cheap Men&#x27;s Cologne.</li>
            <li>It does remind me of a 1920&#x27;s lady&#x27;s scent: bright citrus balanced by sweet white flowers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had incense that I&#x27;v purchased from sellers on eBay that were handmade, and they burned a good 40 minutes or so for about the same price.  </li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s probably why it lights quickly and burns quickly.</li>
            <li>THE NORTH WEST RIGHT</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the scent of this incense, I was expecting a more earthy,  fresh smell, but I do actually really like the scent.</li>
            <li>I think it smells good; the sticks aren&#x27;t all the same width,  and some of the rolled paste isn&#x27;t really even, but they burn well and don&#x27;t smoke too much.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the fragrance at first</li>
            <li>Too musty, smoky for my tastes, though it burns and last well, as do most HEM incense products&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I agree with everyone who is saying the scent of First Rain is perfumey.</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve rated it higher if not for that.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could find someone to gift this whole box of First Rain</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean, and a little reminiscent of my grandmother&#x27;s home, but a good smell.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>However I will say the smell is pure, no smoke, and the sticks themselves well-crafted.</li>
            <li>The incense on these is very &amp;#34;thinly applied.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering some more in the future.  </li>
            <li>Reminds me of a Catholic Church (has that Really smokey smell)</li>
            <li>So this kinda has a masculine scent to it</li>
            <li>First raid smell awful while Forest is WONDERFUL.  </li>
            <li>The circumference varies a little stick to stick, but every stick so far (I&#x27;ve used 2 boxes) burns at least 5 minutes and smells good for a few hours.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Hem is the best incense this is a fresh clean scent I love</li>
            <li> Great price, fast shipping and they smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> It does have a Irish Spring smell to it. This brand is really good for my taste.</li>
            <li> Nice bargain and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of a Catholic Church (has that Really smokey smell) but I do like it</li>
            <li> Not very good. Wont buy again</li>
            <li> Smells a little like Irish Spring so when you burn it they make your house smell like it just took a shower</li>
            <li> good product and very nice packing</li>
            <li> SMELLS LIKE THE NORTH WEST RIGHT BEFORE IT RAINS OMG I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> These are so nice and such a mild and beautiful scent.  I am so glad I ordered these and even happier that they came in a good quantity.</li>
            <li> These smell awesome. I&#x27;ve been a big fan of the Nag Champa and sandle wood incense for a while. These are a bit sweeter smelling than those brands, and have somewhat of a lighter smell. perfect for the bedroom where you don&#x27;t want a heavy scent.</li>
            <li> they was ok kinda strong</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t try to describe the smell, because smell is subjective and varies for everyone. However I will say the smell is pure, no smoke, and the sticks themselves well-crafted. The circumference varies a little stick to stick, but every stick so far (I&#x27;ve used 2 boxes) burns at least 5 minutes and smells good for a few hours. I didn&#x27;t like the fragrance at first, I guess it wasn&#x27;t quite what I was expecting, but I grew to really enjoy it. When I run out, I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> this is wonderful incense--good price as well</li>
            <li> Love the scent. No damage and timely delivery!</li>
            <li> Good Incense by HEM. Burns clean and smells natural not chemical or fake</li>
            <li> Not that big of a fan of these. They smell cheap, like something you&#x27;d buy at the dollar store to cover up a worse smell in your dorm room.&lt;br /&gt;I like the other incense this company makes, but this was a swing and a miss.</li>
            <li> First time with this scent I love it during the day but it&#x27;s not my go to relaxation scent.</li>
            <li> This smell is really strong.  Smells like soap and was too overpowering.</li>
            <li> this stuff is soooooo wonderful....!!!</li>
            <li> Smells good, and you get a ton of them for the price.</li>
            <li> Rain smell, I like it, it gives fresh air, ty :)</li>
            <li> Too musty, smoky for my tastes, though it burns and last well, as do most HEM incense products&lt;br /&gt;I had hoped for a crisper, fresher scent</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Lovely scent!</li>
            <li> This product is of good quality</li>
            <li> Just great and I love it</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Burn them almost every day.</li>
            <li> Great incense but burns fast. So I use body oils to prolong.</li>
            <li> It smells nothing of any earthy, rain smell. It does however, smell like a mens soap store. Don&#x27;t buy. If you want to smell rain, open your windows.</li>
            <li> So this kinda has a masculine scent to it but I like it. Reminds me of mens bar of soap but I mean that as a compliment haha. The scent sticks around for a while and the incense burns long as well. One of my favorites I keep in rotation.</li>
            <li> I agree with everyone who is saying the scent of First Rain is perfumey. It does remind me of a 1920&#x27;s lady&#x27;s scent: bright citrus balanced by sweet white flowers. It&#x27;s more like a cologne than a nature scent. I do like it though.</li>
            <li> Although the scent is great...nice, clean, fresh-smelling, I found the sticks to burn too quickly.  I would&#x27;ve rated it higher if not for that.  I&#x27;ve had incense that I&#x27;v purchased from sellers on eBay that were handmade, and they burned a good 40 minutes or so for about the same price.  I think I&#x27;ll go back to that. The incense on these is very &amp;#34;thinly applied.&amp;#34;  And that&#x27;s probably why it lights quickly and burns quickly.</li>
            <li> Burning this incense now and it smells so good.  I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering some more in the future.  The lingering smell does give off that &amp;#34;Just had a rainstorm&amp;#34; vibe.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for one called forest. First raid smell awful while Forest is WONDERFUL.  I wish I could find someone to gift this whole box of First Rain to because I can&#x27;t stand the smell.  ugh ugh..</li>
            <li> Every thing went well</li>
            <li> Most wonderful smelling incense ever!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the scent of this incense, I was expecting a more earthy,  fresh smell, but I do actually really like the scent. It&#x27;s clean, and a little reminiscent of my grandmother&#x27;s home, but a good smell.&lt;br /&gt;Not that you should buy this cause I think it smells good; the sticks aren&#x27;t all the same width,  and some of the rolled paste isn&#x27;t really even, but they burn well and don&#x27;t smoke too much.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the way this incense smells. If I had known how these smelled, I would not have bought them.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would have a fresh clean smell but instead, it smells like cheap Men&#x27;s Cologne. I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> Nice refreshing scent!</li>
