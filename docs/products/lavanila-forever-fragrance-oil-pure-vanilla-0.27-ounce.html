    <ol>
            <li>Beautiful product!</li>
            <li>This scented oil is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I buy the spray and it is wonderful</li>
            <li>Figured the oil would be just as great.</li>
            <li>The applicator and size of the bottle is great too.</li>
            <li>took a chance on the great reviews of this product and suckered up the $25 to purchase it.</li>
            <li>I love this, Fragrance!!</li>
            <li>Very nice flight  frangrance for day time</li>
            <li>Perfect for traveling and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Very nice fragrance and fits easily in your purse.  </li>
            <li>And thank you, Amazon, for helping girls like me shop for amazing products that aren&#x27;t offered in our hometowns.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sort of like a warm vanilla chai tea w/ a touch of powdered sugar on the side.</li>
            <li>I really liked this design, as it allowed for me to control the amount of product</li>
            <li>Loving this brand, wish I had been turned on to this years ago when l&#x27;occitane discontinued its vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>Ok, ok I&#x27;m getting carried away, but I can&#x27;t help it!</li>
            <li>although I always have favored any kind of vanilla scent (which is why I wanted to try this product even without smelling it first), I found that it was just too musky for me.  </li>
            <li>, why bother when Lavanilla has such a great product, beautifully packaged?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>carrier oil for this blend is sweet almond, which has a lovely light fragrance of its own and great properties for the skin.</li>
            <li>more flower-like</li>
            <li>Men love the scent and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also lovely to know that you aren&#x27;t loading yourself up w/ chemicals every time you use this line of perfumes.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this smell (yummy), and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I love vanilla, and this exceeded all of my expectations.</li>
            <li>This is a thicker oil that you rub onto your skin in the desired locations with the rollerball dispenser at the top of the product (under the cap).  </li>
            <li>I have found that the Vanilla Lavender, Vanilla Coconut and Vanilla Grapefruit scents are better suited for what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>The lotion I received as a sample was much better smelling.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love this, and it lasts forever on my skin.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li>This does smell sweet but its a rich sweet more musky and warm.</li>
            <li>Not too strong of a smell but stays with you all day.</li>
            <li>Not too strong  or overbearing...</li>
            <li>that anything else that I have tried - lasting all day which was great.  </li>
            <li>It smells so divine, I love myself more when I smell fabulous, and this product definitely makes me feel like I am falling in love with myself. :)</li>
            <li>Thanks, Lavanilla!!!</li>
            <li>it is very clean and fresh...</li>
            <li>I think the sweet almond helps balance the heavier vanilla notes.</li>
            <li>Love this product so much...</li>
            <li>Smells great does not seem to last a whole lot longer.</li>
            <li>My personal, favorite!</li>
            <li>I have purchased mostly vanilla fragrance oils sold at head shops throughout the years, and although I liked these fragrances somewhat, I didn&#x27;t like that they often stung my skin, didn&#x27;t last long, and smelled overwhelmingly like cookie dough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite fragrance ever.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Real vanilla oil is expensive, and while I am sure if I wanted to become crafty enough to make my own body oils I could produce a good oil blend cheaper</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, which was appreciated.</li>
            <li>Beautiful scent, long lasting</li>
            <li>I tried this without smelling it first</li>
            <li>It was however not packaged well and was already leaking out of the glass bottle when first opened.</li>
            <li>I keep going back for more.</li>
            <li>I am a long time fan of vanilla and this is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried, defiantly long lasting.</li>
            <li>I love it, highly recommend it for vanilla lovers, and will be coming back for more....forever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just pure vanilla.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells and love the regular lavanila rollerball perfume.</li>
            <li>My husband really loves this one.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>However thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li>YMMV, of course.&lt;br /&gt;Product always shipped fast and well-packed.</li>
            <li>or maybe it is older stock and</li>
            <li>Smells like older woman musk perfume.</li>
            <li>The scent lasts a decent amount of time on my skin as well.</li>
            <li>I have read comments that it smells too musky, however I have found that the musky smell dissipates  within ten minutes and you are left with a lovely vanilla fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not just straight &#x27;vanilla&#x27;, there are other musky notes that really make it a rich smell.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product if you like the smell of vanilla.</li>
            <li>so I had high hopes for this as a purse scent.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite vanilla perfume oils, and that says a lot b/c I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.</li>
            <li>,  since it was an oil, the scent was much more long lasting</li>
            <li>Initially rolling it on from a new container it smelled a bit funny</li>
            <li>I wear it alone or as the top note over other natural/organic essential oil blends or spray fragrances and always get compliments.</li>
            <li>Pure vanilla is a very dark, sleepy smell, and this blend adds enough lighter notes that I don&#x27;t think the fragrance would bother even those who are sensitive to strong, heavy vanilla</li>
            <li>I am a 43 year old female who has asthma, and as a result, I never wear fragrance as it irritates my asthma.  </li>
            <li>It barely has a scent and it leaked out in the package.</li>
            <li>-but an hour later now that I&#x27;m wearing it, its developed that delicate sweet vanilla scent like the deodorant.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am not sure but it isn&#x27;t exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> wear and tt lasts long into the day.  </li>

            <li> In the past, when I have tried to wear a fragrance, I either put so little on that I can&#x27;t smell anything or too much that I am gaggling.  </li>
            <li> Yummy long lasting fragrance without the harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly straight up</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s a spicy, slightly powdery vanilla.</li>
            <li> did purchase the Lavinalla 4 piece mini set at the same time, which contains this exact set as part of that set in addition to three other scents with a vanilla base.  </li>
            <li> Just a little too musky for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product is a small glass bottle which contains the perfumed oil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed in my purchase especially since I can&#x27;t get a refund at all.</li>
            <li> Really not a great product.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this.  </li>
            <li> Like the others it is not laden with unhealthy chemicals and poisons to make you sick.  </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed!</li>
            <li> Really disappointed!</li>
            <li> The bottle leaks oil everywhere as well and the customer service was awful!  </li>

            <li> I tried this without smelling it first and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed! This does smell sweet but its a rich sweet more musky and warm. My husband really loves this one. It&#x27;s not flowery smelling at all. I am a long time fan of vanilla and this is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried, defiantly long lasting. It doesn&#x27;t list all of the ingredients but I know whats not in this one!</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, which was appreciated. It was however not packaged well and was already leaking out of the glass bottle when first opened. Also, I have been buying this oil for a few years and this one smells different not as much like vanilla musk but more flower-like or maybe it is older stock and the oil is changing. I am not sure but it isn&#x27;t exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Yummy long lasting fragrance without the harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> Very nice flight  frangrance for day time wear and tt lasts long into the day.  Men love the scent and</li>
            <li> doesnt smell at all like vanilla. I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells and love the regular lavanila rollerball perfume. Figured the oil would be just as great. Smells like older woman musk perfume. I&#x27;m so disappointed in my purchase especially since I can&#x27;t get a refund at all.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite vanilla perfume oils, and that says a lot b/c I&#x27;ve tried quite a few. It&#x27;s not exactly straight up vanilla - it&#x27;s a spicy, slightly powdery vanilla. It&#x27;s sort of like a warm vanilla chai tea w/ a touch of powdered sugar on the side. Ok, ok I&#x27;m getting carried away, but I can&#x27;t help it! It&#x27;s also lovely to know that you aren&#x27;t loading yourself up w/ chemicals every time you use this line of perfumes. The scent lasts a decent amount of time on my skin as well. Beautiful product!</li>
            <li> This scented oil is wonderful.  Not too strong of a smell but stays with you all day. Highly recommend this product if you like the smell of vanilla.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this product.  Like the others it is not laden with unhealthy chemicals and poisons to make you sick.  Very nice fragrance and fits easily in your purse.  It is long lasting as well.  Not too strong  or overbearing...it is very clean and fresh...I look forward to having it on.</li>
            <li> I love it. Beautiful scent, long lasting</li>
            <li> I love this smell (yummy), and it lasts all day. The applicator and size of the bottle is great too.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite fragrance ever. I love vanilla, and this exceeded all of my expectations. It&#x27;s just pure vanilla. I have read comments that it smells too musky, however I have found that the musky smell dissipates  within ten minutes and you are left with a lovely vanilla fragrance.</li>
            <li> I am a 43 year old female who has asthma, and as a result, I never wear fragrance as it irritates my asthma.  In the past, when I have tried to wear a fragrance, I either put so little on that I can&#x27;t smell anything or too much that I am gaggling.  I gave up on trying to find a fragrance that worked for me years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, in searching for another product here on Amazon, this product came up in my recommendations.  After reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a small glass bottle which contains the perfumed oil.  This is a thicker oil that you rub onto your skin in the desired locations with the rollerball dispenser at the top of the product (under the cap).  I really liked this design, as it allowed for me to control the amount of product very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also,  since it was an oil, the scent was much more long lasting that anything else that I have tried - lasting all day which was great.  Since it&#x27;s small, it&#x27;s very portable - I could take it with me in my purse if desired - but since the scent lasted all day, I didn&#x27;t even need to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to the smell, although I always have favored any kind of vanilla scent (which is why I wanted to try this product even without smelling it first), I found that it was just too musky for me.  The scent reminded me of my grandmother.  Just a little too musky for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did purchase the Lavinalla 4 piece mini set at the same time, which contains this exact set as part of that set in addition to three other scents with a vanilla base.  I have found that the Vanilla Lavender, Vanilla Coconut and Vanilla Grapefruit scents are better suited for what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Initially rolling it on from a new container it smelled a bit funny -but an hour later now that I&#x27;m wearing it, its developed that delicate sweet vanilla scent like the deodorant. Loving this brand, wish I had been turned on to this years ago when l&#x27;occitane discontinued its vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this.  It smells like a man.  The lotion I received as a sample was much better smelling.  The bottle leaks oil everywhere as well and the customer service was awful!  However thanks to Amazon I got my money back.</li>
            <li> I have purchased mostly vanilla fragrance oils sold at head shops throughout the years, and although I liked these fragrances somewhat, I didn&#x27;t like that they often stung my skin, didn&#x27;t last long, and smelled overwhelmingly like cookie dough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a chance on the great reviews of this product and suckered up the $25 to purchase it. It is well worth the price. Real vanilla oil is expensive, and while I am sure if I wanted to become crafty enough to make my own body oils I could produce a good oil blend cheaper, why bother when Lavanilla has such a great product, beautifully packaged?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil blend is genuine, it does not aggravate the skin, I put a couple of dabs on my wrists, and then swipe it behind my ears upward into my hair. It smells so divine, I love myself more when I smell fabulous, and this product definitely makes me feel like I am falling in love with myself. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The carrier oil for this blend is sweet almond, which has a lovely light fragrance of its own and great properties for the skin. I think the sweet almond helps balance the heavier vanilla notes. Pure vanilla is a very dark, sleepy smell, and this blend adds enough lighter notes that I don&#x27;t think the fragrance would bother even those who are sensitive to strong, heavy vanilla smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I love it, highly recommend it for vanilla lovers, and will be coming back for more....forever. :) Thanks, Lavanilla!!! And thank you, Amazon, for helping girls like me shop for amazing products that aren&#x27;t offered in our hometowns.</li>
            <li> Smells great does not seem to last a whole lot longer.</li>
            <li> Love this product so much...I keep going back for more.</li>
            <li> Really not a great product. It barely has a scent and it leaked out in the package. I buy the spray and it is wonderful so I had high hopes for this as a purse scent. Really disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love this, Fragrance!! My personal, favorite!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Perfect for traveling and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> My &#x27;signature&#x27; fragrance. Love this, and it lasts forever on my skin. Wish it lasted as long in the vial! I get so many compliments. It&#x27;s not just straight &#x27;vanilla&#x27;, there are other musky notes that really make it a rich smell.</li>
            <li> This is another must-have for my dressing table. I wear it alone or as the top note over other natural/organic essential oil blends or spray fragrances and always get compliments. It can be a bit cloying if over-applied, so let the roller ball track be your guide. YMMV, of course.&lt;br /&gt;Product always shipped fast and well-packed.</li>
