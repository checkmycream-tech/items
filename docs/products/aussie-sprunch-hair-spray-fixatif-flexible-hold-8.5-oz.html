            <li> I don&#x27;t have curly or even wavy hair, but received this product from Influenster for testing purposes. It worked really well for my flyaways. It also has a really nice smell.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Sprunch! I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of other curl-defining products (most of them a lot more expensive) and this is by far my favorite. I&#x27;ve used it with my medium length hair for years, always with great results. When my hair was longer, I&#x27;d flip it upside down and spray it, then blow it dry with a diffuser. Now that my hair is shorter (more a wavy bob) I wait until it&#x27;s about 70% dry, spritz this on, scrunch the curls and then just let it air dry. The only time it gets crunchy is if I accidently over-spray one area. If that happens, just wait until it dries and then break it up with your fingers, it should smooth right out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big Aussie fan. I use this product a lot. It holds my hair. If you wear your hair scrunched up you would like this. It does have a sticky feel to it.</li>
            <li> Let me start out by saying that I have extremely thick long hair. I have tried ALOT of products in order to achieve the &amp;#34;scrunched&amp;#34; look. I cannot give it all 5 stars only for the fact it didn&#x27;t give me the look I desired (not sure any product can at this point). When it was damp and for about an hour after it dried it was great. The smell was great, not sticky...but after that hour my hair started to go a little limp. I blame this on the heaviness of my hair. But I will say it left my hair smelling great and with a nice non frizzy wavy. I received this complementary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair! Quick and easy styling with minimal crunch.</li>
            <li> I recently received this product for complimentary testing from Influenster and I was so excited because I&#x27;ve always used it. I love the way it curls and hold my style all day and gives you that flexible hold. For me, it also tames the frizz with a BIG plus! I recommend this product to everyone and anyone!</li>
            <li> This product is great!!!! I have very thick naturally curly hair and this product kept it from drizzling and getting out of control! First time I haven&#x27;t straightened it in a long time!</li>
            <li> looks like you&#x27;re putting alcohol in your hair!</li>
            <li> I received this product to test and review. I have naturally wavy hair and would either a) let my hair air dry then use this to scrunch up the curls along with some anti-frizz serum or b) apply this immediately after showering while my hair was still wet and use a diffuser to pump up my curls! I also love this product for refreshing curls that are a day or two old!!!!</li>

I naturally have slight wavy hair, and this sprunch spray is the ticket for getting a super cute casual wavy beach look to your hair.

            <li> The Aussie Sprunch Spray makes my hair look casual, effortless, and gives it a little shine. It&#x27;s very lightweight. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; or have that hard feel to it. It also gives flexibility. As much as I love the Aussie Sprunch Spray, I love the Aussie Mousse and Leave in Conditioner even more!   I tested this product at no cost, this is just my opinion!</li>
