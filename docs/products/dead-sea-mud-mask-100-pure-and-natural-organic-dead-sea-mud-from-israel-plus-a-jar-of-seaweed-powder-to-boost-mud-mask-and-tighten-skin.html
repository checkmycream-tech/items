            <li> Product is good, delivery was quick. Very satisfied .</li>
            <li> WOW is all I have to say! You see, I&#x27;m no stranger to &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; Dead Sea Products....but this one takes the cake. It&#x27;s smooth, creamy, luxurious and It Works! This product refreshed my 30 year old face after one use. It even minimized my newly found laugh lines!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you mix the two products together you will swear you are sitting along the rocks on the beach. It reaks of the sea,in a good way. This product is Spa quality and I highly suggest you buy it before I empty their stock. Lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I forgot to mention that I use it on my body to rejuvenate scar tissue. The mud removes dead skins cells speeding up the healing process. Just beware if you have a white bathroom/shower......the beautiful black mud with leave marks......just rinse it away</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. My skin felt so great after using it.</li>
            <li> I really like it, my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> Great products! Does the job well when used in a combination mask.</li>
            <li> Using the powdered sea weed to help control thyroid. The other is being used to help with my husband&#x27;s eczema</li>
            <li> I will order this product again and again  - I have used it three times in the past week since I received my order and after my second use, I could almost swear (but I wasn&#x27;t quite sure) that my face looked ten years younger.  The overall condition of my skin seemed to have improved.  Unless something in my skin changes, I will continue to use the product - thank you!!! I am very pleased with your product.  I hope the Dead Sea never runs out of mineral filled mud!!</li>
            <li> Though I can do with out the smell, it really leaves my face looking and feeling so wonderful!!  Soooo worth it!</li>
            <li> loveeeee this stuff!! need to order more!!</li>
            <li> Tried it last night. Tingled and tightened. Pores actually appeared tighter and clearer. Time will tell.</li>
            <li> I love it. Tones and tightens  effectively.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. While I was not crazy about the smell (may be the seaweed powder I mixed in with the mud) it did leave my face feeling and looking amazing! My skin glowed. I absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> make my skin smooth. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love it! My face felt smooth and pampered.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I usually add a little bit of lavender essential oil to the mix when I use the seaweed powder as it does have the smell of the ocean. But, it works wonders! Skin is firm and very clean. Just recently added it to some soap and am excited to see the finished product after it dries.</li>
            <li> Did NOT come with seeweed enhancer. Only mud mask showed up!</li>
            <li> Skin felt refreshed. Really smooth feeling, the smell is pretty intense when it&#x27;s still wet (like low tide) but great product!</li>
            <li> Both of these products are awesome! I have used the mud mask alone and mixed with the seaweed powder and was happy with both versions.  When initially applying the mud mask alone my face felt completely refreshed and as it dried I could feel my skin tightening.  Removing with warm water, the mask left my face feeling fresh, clean and toned.  I was delighted to find that my skin did not feel at all dry and with other products I need to rush to apply moisturizer. I also love the mud mask and seaweed powder mixed, found similar results and the extra seaweed powder can only make it better for your skin.  It&#x27;s great knowing that I can nurture my skin with these pure natural organic ingredients and at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> I love the Dead Sea Mud. It makes my skin tight and smooth. I highly recommend it.</li>
