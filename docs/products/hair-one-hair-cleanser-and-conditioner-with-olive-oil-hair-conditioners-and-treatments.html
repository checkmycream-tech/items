    <ol>
            <li>have since discovered a product that is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>Happy Shopping!</li>
            <li>Worked great!  </li>
            <li>once my scalp and hair got used to it, it performed perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It is lighter weight and perfect for my wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s what you like, or what works best for you, but I didn&#x27;t see the &amp;#34;rave&amp;#34; over this product.</li>
            <li>The price is awesome.  </li>
            <li>I suggest trying it and add a post-wash moisterizer for best results.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy I did.</li>
            <li>LOL!!</li>

            <li>and it smells great.</li>
            <li>my hair looks GREAT.</li>
            <li>and this makes it feel and look great.</li>
            <li>This combo works great if I keep my hair washing to a 3 x per week</li>
            <li>and it smells great too.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been hearing all these great things about WEN and planned on buying it.  </li>
            <li>And decided to give it a go, I&#x27;m so happy that I purchased</li>
            <li>I will never get this again, and the smell isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using it both ways and both ways work really great for my hair</li>
            <li>My hair texture has changed greatly, because I am not stripping all the oils out.</li>
            <li>i am a happy hair one user.</li>
            <li>if your looking for well cleansed hair and it feeling great after a rinse</li>
            <li>Keep up the great mix Hair One.</li>
            <li>Great as a shampoo and leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>omg my hair looks and feels amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>I actually liked this!</li>
            <li>basically, it did nothing to \\&quot;cleanse\\&quot; my hair, but I have begun using it as a leave in conditioner (which the product states you can do) and am having good results with that.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells good too.</li>
            <li>Feels good.</li>
            <li>Have never seen my hair look this good before.</li>
            <li>When I got Hair one in the mail, I immediately tried it and loved it.</li>
            <li>, I think that it just didn&#x27;t do a good job of cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li>and I hoped for good results</li>
            <li>I have tried this, and LOVED it.</li>
            <li>Anyway I like it, my hair loved it</li>
            <li>this  is a good product</li>
            <li>However, when I used Hair One, it made my scalp feel good, but when I could not \\&quot;easily\\&quot; run my fingers through my hair.  </li>
            <li>I went through all the steps and my hair felt sooooooo good.  </li>
            <li>This product works just as good.</li>
            <li>My mom who has thinner and nicer hair got really good results from it.</li>
            <li>I also agree with the girls who experienced much more hair loss when they were using the product.  </li>
            <li>I went into this hoping I&#x27;d found a great product people had reviewed mostly saying it worked well</li>
            <li>Had I have found this before I figured the right combo of products I would be raving about how awesome it is.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t clean your hair and scalp very good</li>
            <li>, LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>like this version better!</li>
            <li>and I love it !</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love It!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>It styled easily, felt and looked very nice.</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing this product from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supplies for a while now and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so thrilled.  </li>
            <li>Nice shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li>Honestly, I wanted to hold my breath.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It really works the best for me.  </li>
            <li>It felt nice in my hands and hair.</li>
            <li>I have since found my own way to use it</li>
            <li>liked the Wen product, but it caused my scalp, neck and shoulders to break out.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Wen has made my hair healthy and gorgeous</li>
            <li>It has a great smell, great menthol cooling sensation, it moisturizes, and makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li>Like many of you I saw the \\&quot;wonderful WEN\\&quot; infomercials and really wanted to try it out</li>
            <li>VERY STRONG FRAGRANCE smell.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty good!</li>
            <li>Hair and scalp feels more than clean with a great smell.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing</li>
            <li>lmao :-)</li>
            <li>many women review hair product without stating what type of hair they have, whether they color it and what kind of heat damage they do to it.  </li>
            <li>This is a great alternative, and worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is a perfect combination for me, my hair looks and smells great, I have less frizz</li>
            <li>I was very excited about the WEN infomercials but didnt want to be included in autoship or a membership of any kind, nor did I want to spend that amount of money on something that might not work for me.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine</li>
            <li>So much cheaper then wen and works just as good!</li>
            <li>The product is just OK</li>
            <li>MY FAVORITE IS GIOVANNI.</li>
            <li>Its made my hair smoother and feels healthy.</li>
            <li>I must say that I am quite pleased.  </li>
            <li>The longer you leave the product on the better</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried Wen, so I can&#x27;t compare, but I LOVE Hair One.  </li>
            <li>and I love that I can just towel</li>
            <li>We love this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;LOVE, LOVE</li>
            <li>As many people do, I have to take medicines and top</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the way this stuff makes my hair looks.</li>
            <li>I love the menthol feeling,</li>
            <li>The longer you leave it in the better</li>
            <li>I love it and will continue using it.</li>
            <li>Besides I&#x27;m frugal, 10-15 bucks sounds a lot better than 35-40</li>
            <li>this is a better value.  </li>
            <li>I do love Wen</li>
            <li>whereas the Herbal Essences does not (which I like better).  </li>
            <li>I know for sure I am allergic to formaldehyde (and its cousin, Quaternium-15 which is often listed in so-called formaldehyde-free formulas).</li>
            <li>Anyway, the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shampoos didn&#x27;t work any better for me than the chemical ones and in desperation I tried a sample packet of this.  </li>
            <li>It is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I have two curly girls (who cowash) and we love this line.  </li>
            <li>This should have been packaged better.</li>
            <li>It even makes my scalp feel better.</li>
            <li>I love how this made my hair and scalp fell</li>
            <li>/&gt;YES, I have curly hair, and I LOVE this.</li>
            <li>But cheap Suave conditioner has cetyl alcohol too!</li>
            <li>The Tea Tree Cleansing Conditioner did much better with her hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, 1/3 of the price of WEN, so there has to be a trade off.  </li>
            <li>and you can cleanse your scalp better.</li>
            <li>Do NOT use as many pumps as they tell you.</li>
            <li>A gentle cleanse great for colored hair.</li>
            <li>I love how it doesn&#x27;t wash out my color.</li>
            <li>so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>This did not perform any better than Ion Keratin Shampoo &amp; Smoothing</li>
            <li>I give this product a 3 star, probably because I was expecting more.</li>
            <li>I think I need more to combat the iron when it comes to straightening my hair out.</li>
            <li>will for sure continue to use this because I do like it a lot.</li>
            <li>I think I need more to combat the iron when it comes to straightening my hair out.</li>
            <li>will for sure continue to use this because I do like it a lot.</li>
            <li>Ok, so we&#x27;ve all watched the Wen infomercials.</li>
            <li>It was ok.  </li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>and i was impressed same quality and does wonders for my hair for a fraction of the price, but i do prefer the wen fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love what this product has done for my hair.</li>
            <li>It tells you to add SO MANY pumps</li>
            <li>harm toxins work better</li>
            <li>and I love that.</li>
            <li>I was really, really looking forward to trying it, after reading some of the great reviews.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and great shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>OK, maybe an updated label</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually pretty good, but with every shampoo or conditioner, it works better after you use that shampoo to remove residual, like neutrogena.</li>
            <li>I found and used Joico for a long time because it worked the best...</li>
            <li>I used it I was impressed, but when I got out of the shower it was a bit strange.</li>
            <li>Go easy on your pumps and add some water to your hair and lather it and see if u need more after that.</li>
            <li>My hair was just as clean, shiny, and bouncy as with Hair One, but for a tenth of the price (and a thirtieth of the price of Wen)!</li>
            <li>I plan to try some of the other products on Amazon that are WEN-like and see what works best.</li>
            <li>I did a deep condition (let it sit on for an hr) and let me tell you my hair LOVED IT!</li>
            <li>great alternative for wen cleansing products - will definitely buy again! :-)</li>
            <li>and it easily detangles my hair</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no breakage just clean healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Great WEN knock off, same ingred and better price.</li>
            <li>My head felt fine after using this.  </li>
            <li>it did not work for me, but if you have fine hair, it will work wonders.</li>
            <li>I use are fine.</li>
            <li>Within the line is the sulphate free shampoo, conditioner, leave in reconstructor and serum in a tube.  </li>
            <li>As with any soap free shampoos, you have to use a ton of it...</li>
            <li>I like to use Giovanni conditioners that are gluten free.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even use what is supposed to be the best anti-allergy shampoo,[[ASIN:B0006FMK98 Free &amp; Clear Shampoo for Sensitive Skin 12 fl oz (355 ml)]].</li>
            <li>I say light because there is no buildup with this product.</li>
            <li>It looked fantastic.</li>
            <li>(heck, i did buy P-90x and got fabulous results).</li>
            <li>shower with a light film.  </li>
            <li>and I like to use this as my primary shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>so I thought the Olive Oil would be fantastic.</li>
            <li>i have used almost every product in market to make my hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stand leaving my hair like this, so I put some Infusium in it to smooth things out.</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel like I hadn&#x27; t conditioned it at all (and I used a sulfate free condtioner after the shampoo).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing that one product can do what it normally takes 4 to manage though!  </li>
            <li>This product is my new favorite!  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair easy to detangle after washing and it  makes my hair nice and soft after it air dries.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not pleased with the results I had when I bought this one thinking it would be best for my bi-racial daughter&#x27;s curly hair.  </li>
            <li>(And I am pregnant, so if I think its fine</li>
            <li>Anyone searching for something to help with dryness give it a try, my hair for sure look healthier and I am confident will do even better the next time I use</li>
            <li>(And I am pregnant, so if I think its fine</li>
            <li>Anyone searching for something to help with dryness give it a try, my hair for sure look healthier and I am confident will do even better the next time I use it!</li>
            <li>It is not quite as thick and moisturizing, but it&#x27;s the best cheap substitute I have found.</li>
            <li>Plus, my hair stays clean for 2-3 days...</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s because Hair One uses cetyl alcohol to clean your hair.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair silky and clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for something that will clean my hair but leave it manageable.</li>
            <li>only thing that I could give this product credit for is that it does have a pleasant odor.</li>
            <li>Wow, for a fraction of the cost and it works better!</li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty quick and they made sure to package each bottle so that they would not be damaged---Good job.</li>
            <li>I received this product today and was super excited to use it.</li>
            <li>I tried the sample before ponying up the cash for a full bottle.</li>
            <li>It really does not get it better than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That makes more sense than letting the shower water run the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but you got to play with it a bit before you get the full</li>
            <li>My hair is always shiny and full of life.</li>
            <li>The only thing it did was make my hair smell good and detangle it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a reasonably priced cleansing conditioner, I think you can find a better one than this.</li>
            <li>i am not gonna say that its a miracle i will say that its one of the best product i have ever use , my hair is really thick</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for a dry itchy scalp!!</li>
            <li>great alternative to Wen and other sulfate-free cleaners.</li>
            <li>It seems to be really mild on my color</li>
            <li>the love of God, can&#x27;t ANYone create a decent Wen knock off for those of us who don&#x27;t make 6 figures???</li>
            <li>but I certainly don&#x27;t love the high price tag.  </li>
            <li>This product, after following the instructions and letting my hair dry, made my hair look great after straightening it and my waves were smooth and cute...</li>
            <li>With this you put it in, scrub as normal, then add more, \\&quot;finger comb\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I washed my hair with this, put in some infusium 23 leave-in for a detangler, combed, and let air dry, and my hair is GORGEOUS.</li>
            <li>It gave my hair a lot of moisture and limited frizz which is excellent because I have very curly hair and live in an area with tons of humidity.</li>
            <li>I thought that the prospect of a sulphate free hair cleanser would really help my situation.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth trying</li>
            <li>The only think I liked about Hair</li>
            <li>Well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have heard so many positives to cleansing conditioners, and I was sold at soft silky hair that would not need to be trimmed as often.  </li>
            <li>But I have psoriasis which makes my scalp more sensitive to things like that</li>
            <li>But I have psoriasis which makes my scalp more sensitive to things like that</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and tangle free!</li>
            <li>Hope to have the results and success</li>
            <li>It cleanses very well and leaves the hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>But with my hair type it loves any kind of moisture my hair is coarse and doesn&#x27;t like to do anything</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>but I still love how it effects the appearance of my hair makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li>Perhaps this will work better for someone without a sensitive scalp and who has healthier hair.</li>
            <li>However, I kept up the faith and kept going, leaving it in for at least 7 minutes, while continuing to add more and more of the stuff, before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things didn&#x27;t get much better when I rinsed it out.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s MUCH more managable, soft and shinney that way.</li>
            <li>However, because I found the right stuff for my hair (after years) I don&#x27;t notice a difference in the shine or texture.  </li>
            <li>right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I just can&#x27;t handle the thought of a hair drier right now.  </li>
            <li>You just have to find what is right for your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not tempted to either, because this price is so much more reasonable at about half the cost and produces amazing results.</li>
            <li>I liked it enough to invest in the higher quality one.</li>
            <li>I live in LA, and I have hard water and great water pressure, so I&#x27;m pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t build-up</li>
            <li>The healthy hair did great,my only issue is my hair is so super curly</li>
            <li>it!e healthy hair did great,my only issue is my hair is so super curly</li>
            <li>Everybody&#x27;s hair is different, but I think everybody should give this product a try because if they are lucky enough to have the right type of hair to have the same results I&#x27;ve had it will make them so happy they switched!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tingly feeling of it being on my scalp was a nice feeling but the scent is very strange.  </li>
            <li>dry my hair and my curl comes out on its own.  </li>
            <li>I am African-American with an oily scalp and dry ends, and this product effectively cleans my scalp without stripping it, and moisturizes my ends.  </li>
            <li>Its cheap, its one product versus several and its sulfate free which is a must for people with hair like mine.</li>
            <li>Its cheap, its one product versus several and its sulfate free which is a must for people with hair like mine.</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft, tangle free, has body and movement and it&#x27;s brighter than before.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>My hair stopped breaking, started back growing, and became soft to touch, easy to style and healthy looking</li>
            <li>its best if you have really dry hair and thick hair / ethnic,  hair that needs more oils than normal hair would to look sleek / not frizzy.</li>
            <li>If this was a process that I would have to endure only once or twice per week it would be okay</li>
            <li>However, after the first couple of times I used it</li>
            <li>The first time I sprayed it onto my damp hair and smoothed it through with my hands</li>
            <li>Also, it takes a lot more pumps to get a necessary amount of product to put in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I have very short hair and get away with 4 pumps (plus one more as a leave-in conditioner).  </li>
            <li>But when I blow out my hair, it looks multitudes better than w/ traditional shampooing and conditioning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I just bought a bottle of Hair one with olive oil and tried it today for the first time....</li>
            <li>Tried this the first time</li>
            <li>did exactly what the directions said</li>
            <li>First of all-- please note that this review is for the Olive Oil formula.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE that you can also use the product as a leave-in; AND I also use it as a deep treatment by applying and sitting under a hood dryer for 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice after finding it at Sally&#x27;s Beauty for $9.99, and I&#x27;m already in love.</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so soft or light.</li>
            <li>Looking at the label, I noticed that it has many of the same ingredients as Hair One, and decided to give it a shot</li>
            <li>(I also think it smells better than Wen or Hair One, personally).</li>
            <li>first week I did go through a bit of the \\&quot;oily\\&quot; stage that people talk about</li>
            <li>And my color isn&#x27;t NEARLY as faded as it would normally be this many weeks after coloring</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem any better to me than the co-wash products that you can buy at a local store.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li>Just would love to find this in larger bottles.</li>
            <li>But when someone I know who had thicker more coarse hair used it...</li>
            <li>and my hair is still pretty greasy from it.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty damaged</li>
            <li>I thought why not, Sally&#x27;s is around the block I can hop over buy it, be back easily and $10-$11 for the bottle was worth it if this lives up to its hype.&lt;br</li>
            <li>- however I do think that this product is definitely dependent upon the individual and your own unique hair.  </li>
            <li>In fact, any cheap conditioner does the trick (a little fact I&#x27;m sure the folks at Wen don&#x27;t want you to know,lol).  </li>
            <li>does a good job otherwise, but then, any silicone free conditioner will do the same thing just as well and for significantly less money.  </li>
            <li>I am a product junkie and have spent many years finding the right combo of products for my hair.  </li>
            <li>First off, it&#x27;s very time consuming.  </li>
            <li>think this product works pretty much like Wen.</li>
            <li>The first time, I followed the instructions, saturated my hair on the product, combed it through, and rinsed very well.</li>
            <li>but it just depend on ur hair type , my hair after first use was not dry and with the regular use now they look amazing .</li>
            <li>it felt to me, and my hair came out super soft.</li>
            <li>and my hair is super shine, and soft as silk.</li>
            <li>and I must say when I touched parts of my hair and messed with it, it was super soft and that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li>Hair One olive oil for dry hair has a better smell than the almond mint one labeled for all hair types.</li>
            <li>Of course, it&#x27;s goi g to largely depend on the length of your hair but u be the judge.</li>
            <li>My hair was much more tangled and knotted up, it felt very dry and had no shine.</li>
            <li>really wanted to like this but cannot recommend it at all.</li>
            <li>so it became very course and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes, I just dont have the much time.  </li>
            <li>but the menthol odor is very pronounced and the steam makes it stronger.  </li>
            <li>I really like having a shampoo and conditioner in one so to say.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you need to use nearly as much as the instructions</li>
            <li>/&gt;That is over now; this product really is \\&quot;IT\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>, is all I can really say.</li>
            <li>Price reasonable.</li>
            <li>also got a sample pack of the jojoba version of Hair one, but didn&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li>and it felt really conditioned.</li>
            <li>It has too much menthol in it and it really irritated my scalp a bit.  </li>
            <li>What I&#x27;ve discovered since then, through various message boards, is that VO5 Kiwi Lime conditioner is a fantastic dupe for Wen.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it in the shower; I washed my hair in the sink so that I could just stick a towel around my wet head while it did its magic for 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Works really well on my 4a-4c hair.</li>
            <li>I really like how it makes my hair feel and it thickens my hair.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comparable to Wen, but is much much much cheaper.</li>
            <li>that was too much for my length of hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was damaged from dying it so much, the ends were so brittle, then I started using this</li>
            <li>and I thought it cost too much.  </li>
            <li>and I really cannot afford WEN.</li>
            <li>Wanted to try something much cheaper</li>
            <li>nothing happened really some</li>
            <li>so i have to use a whole lot</li>
            <li>Wow worth every cent.</li>
            <li>So maybe it&#x27;s me but not so fast.  </li>
            <li>my hair was super super dry, color treated and heat damaged</li>
            <li>As far as body, a lot of fluff (the kind I try to get rid of).</li>
            <li>I purchased this product while engaged in the task of trying to find new products for my hair that would keep it healthy while I was growing it long.</li>
            <li>Because other reviewers mentioned having build-up, I made sure that I rinsed really well.</li>
            <li>I came across Hair One, most of the reviews were very similar to what I was reading on WEN but with major highlights being much lower cost, easier accessibility (no shipping) and no hassle trying to navigate the WEN site</li>
            <li>max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was drying out because I had to wash too frequently due to my sweaty workouts, so was looking for something better.  </li>
            <li>I love the Wen Fig due to my damaged hair.</li>
            <li>My relaxed/african-american hair gets extremely dry and breaks off easily.</li>
            <li>But, this product not only allowed me to detangle, but I was able to comb from root to tip with a wide tooth comb, and that never happens, even with super slippery</li>
            <li>Keep in mind: if you don&#x27;t get it right the first time, there&#x27;s always next</li>
            <li>I normally use a LOT of conditioner, use my fingers to pull it through and leave it on for the duration of my shower, then rinse it out very well.  </li>
            <li>Not enthused enough about it to buy a full bottle.  </li>
            <li>and my curls are much more defined, but it is not weighted down.  </li>
            <li>If its clean its to frizzy feeling and can&#x27;t be controlled with the flat iron.</li>
            <li>It was softer and it was less frizzy and more manageable</li>
            <li>Pass up Hair One, there are better options out there and for a lot less $$$.</li>
            <li>I love this product but use less pumps once you re-wet your hair</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s able to \\&quot;lather\\&quot; slightly</li>
            <li>It did leave my color beautifully vibrant and</li>
            <li>I bought this product as an alternative to buying the more expensive Wen, and I think I&#x27;m already in love.</li>
            <li>Left it on longer than the recommended time as everything indicates the longer its left in the better the results.  </li>
            <li>This is a decent shampoo/cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Ren&#x27;s is actually just as good and a few dollars cheaper than this.</li>
            <li>Ok Product works ok but difficult to rinse out of hair .  </li>
            <li>The first couple times I used it, I followed the directions exactly, but even though I have dry, curly hair, leaving the shampoo in as a leave-in conditioner was too much for hair.  </li>
            <li>Hair is left soft silky and clean.</li>
            <li>Hair One is fine for someone who likes the smell and feel of menthol on the scalp, but it&#x27;s certainly not for me.  </li>
            <li>The only difference I noticed from my regular shampoo and conditioner, was that my hair didn&#x27;t feel clean, even when it was wet, it was more tangled, and my roots were greasy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use near as much as the bottle recommends.  </li>
            <li>After a few more uses I guess I got used to it because it didnt happen again</li>
            <li>Aside from that, it pretty much did the opposite of everything I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>(normally wash twice, scrubbing my scalp anyways, followed by conditioner that I have to work \\&quot;finger</li>
            <li>I did notice a bit of a static cling issue brushing it when it dried fully.</li>
            <li>I put a few more pumps as a leave-in like it said on the directions.  </li>
            <li>, I use it like normal shampoo, leave it on while I finish everything else in the shower and then rinse.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll go ahead and try the one for normal hair.</li>
            <li>I can notice it most often if his dandruff comes back, because he has a dry scalp.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone looking to try something new.</li>
            <li>I have so much new growth</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado, so I also fight the super dry climate.  </li>
            <li>I still get frizzies on hot humid days, but it is pretty minimal, and with the argon oil, not that noticable.  </li>
            <li>so my hair gets super dry.  </li>
            <li>I used it in the shower after work one morning, followed the directions thoroughly, and had high hopes as it made my hair feel somewhat soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is feeling very soft now.</li>
            <li>When I used this it made my hair very soft...</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Several of the line of Suave conditioners are appropriate for Conditioner Only hair cleansing, and they run only about $1.00 per 16 oz bottle.  </li>
            <li>especially those of you looking for a fix that doesn&#x27;t include taking the time to use a straight iron!</li>
            <li>Maybe next time it will go higher when I use it</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I have used hair one with olive oil and Teflon anti snap as a leave in and my hair is so soft!</li>
            <li>It made my hair even have more body than WEN and at half the price!!</li>
            <li>I am biracial (white/black) and I have super curly hair that I have relaxed almost all my life until recently when I finally accepted my curls and tried to live without the relaxer.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re worried about having so much product in your hair you can use this as a leave in conditioner only and still use your normal shampoo and conditioner routine.</li>
            <li>The thing is, they all work pretty much the same way, so save your pennies and try a lesser priced brand.  </li>
            <li>It says you are supposed to use a lot, my husband has short hair, so not sure he uses as much as he is supposed to, but seems to do okay.  </li>
            <li>I have always had a head full of hair (Mixed Culture) and have spent over $1000.00 for \\&quot;I wish this really would work</li>
            <li>To my suprise it worked wonders on my fine limp damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair and throughout the years I have bleached and highlighted the life out of it</li>
            <li>so far i like it.</li>
            <li>I have wash and go hair for the first time in a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You also won&#x27;t get out of the shower with soft hair.</li>
            <li>products\\&quot;, that left you saying; \\&quot;I wish I really would not have, bought this product\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>as if too much hair gel was present)</li>
            <li>I am transitioning from relaxed to natural, so I&#x27;m looking for something that will work for me.</li>
            <li>I got out of the shower my hair felt quite soft.</li>
            <li>This is then followed by a combo of extra strength frizz ease and straight &amp; shine frizz</li>
            <li>My hair did not feel soft.  </li>
            <li>I have used this about 3 times so far.  </li>
            <li>My hair was soft and shiny and</li>
            <li>completely clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>One is still too much (especially considering how much you have to use).</li>
            <li>One step that I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll repeat is the \\&quot;combing\\&quot; through, WOW was there pulling (yes worked my way from the bottom up) and did a lot of hair come out.  </li>
            <li>She bleaches her hair to WHITE so its very damaged.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I relaxed my hair is because of how curly my hair is not because I like straight hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember my hair being this soft, this shiny and this manageable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got really intense dyed red hair</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>I may do a few things different and see even better results.</li>
            <li>I may do a few things different and see even better results.</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s hair may respond differently to this product, so it is worth a try, HOWEVER- for chemically treated hair that is prone to drying out, such as relaxed or color-</li>
            <li>hair is quite dry, so shampoos can be harsh since i have very fine</li>
            <li>and I have lots of highlights, which made my hair pretty dry, but manageable.</li>
            <li>did notice the the \\&quot;menthol\\&quot; effect was a little intense at the nape (not uncomfortable or anything though).  </li>
            <li>did notice the the \\&quot;menthol\\&quot; effect was a little intense at the nape (not uncomfortable or anything though).  </li>
            <li>I tried it a few times and it made my scalp very itchy and left my hair full of tangles.  </li>
            <li>As I said at first I didnt realize it was from the product, but I used it again 2 nights later and the same thing happened.  </li>
            <li>(you usually have to give something a try more than once), and only used one at a time</li>
            <li>Today I picked up the Dry Hair formula and the Color Treated formula figuring I would either alternate or combine them depending on the results and if I liked the product(s) after using them a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a shine that I haven&#x27;t seen since I was a little girl and its super soft.</li>
            <li>so I just ordered my second bottle of normal formula, stay tuned....</li>
            <li>have nearly waist length fine but thick hair that I keep died red (very difficult color to maintain) and because I live in the desert I get even drier here in the summer than I normally am (lol).  </li>
            <li>I have since stopped using it because with the price (even though it&#x27;s much cheaper than WEN), and the time it takes to use it, the hair loss and the odor - was too much con for the little bit of pro it did for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My naturally wavy hair is never dry or frizzy, anymore.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to traditional shampooing if I don&#x27;t absolutely have to.</li>
            <li>The only thing that surprised me was the texture of the product I was expecting a clear gel</li>
            <li>With the gray, it&#x27;s wavy, more coarse and still thick.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks shiny, strong, and thick.</li>
            <li>Even with the extra pump left in, my hair never feels oily, heavy, or--well, anything except for clean!  </li>
            <li>but the cost was a major factor in making me rethink my desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My roots were greasy, and the rest of my hair was dry and more tangled than usual.</li>
            <li>--I have very oily roots and very dry ends, but it still works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It tends to be very dry and stringy, and is extremely straight.</li>
            <li>anyways, I usually use Mixed chicks on my hair which I love, but there is nothing in their line that works for when I use the flat iron on my hair.</li>
            <li>I wish they would make a version that is free of this common allergen - if they did, I might use this item sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Im a 21 yr old male and have used this about 3 times and</li>
            <li>I had been contemplating purchasing Wen conditioning cleanser, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money on something that is unknown and untested.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise, my hair was left soft, shiny, tingly and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I cowash frequently with regular conditioner</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and bouncy and my curls are actually curling instead of frizzing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t put any extra in and continue to use my old mousse to style my hair.  </li>
            <li>i am not ever using a shampoo and not going back to any of my old products.</li>
            <li>normal hair care consists of a double wash and condition with an ultra moisture shampoo and conditioner (various brands).  </li>
            <li>I always wanted to try WEN, but it was so expensive, when I found Hair One I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>I stumbled upon Hair One on a trip to Sally Beauty Supply and thought it might be worth investigating as it is a similar product to Wen at half the</li>
            <li>I got the little 99 cent packet for dry hair, and I was so excited to use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>BUT not so much to make an extreme difference in the LOOK of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping between Hair One and hounding her to not have white hair that she will have the hair back that she really wants (long and full).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is hard to clean since it&#x27;s not foamy at all</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work, but two tries was enough for me.</li>
            <li>But if you just take a second and compare the ingredients in Hair One with the ingredients of a $2 bottle of conditioner from the grocery store, I think you&#x27;ll be surprised at how similar they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair One definitely cleanses and leaves hair soft, but it is not enough moisture for my hair type.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall my hair was left feeling \\&quot;hard\\&quot; and sticky and not remotely shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can see how it might be too much for regular daily use unless you have very dry hair, but if you do, give it a try!</li>
            <li>I have hair down to my mid-back and it was just too much.  </li>
            <li>After having 2 babies very close together, my usually silky fine, never frizzy hair was left perpetually frizzed and dried out.  </li>
            <li>It feels odd using so much product.</li>
            <li>After reading all the data on sulfates and the harsh chemicals normal shampoos contain, I decided to switch to natural products.</li>
            <li>my normally dry, frizzy, red-but-turning-grey hair was actually manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li>It has completely repaired my hair and changed it from coarse, dry and unruly to silky and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I dye my thin baby fine hair and am on lots of meds.</li>
            <li>I was able to comb through my wet thick hair while in the shower EFFORTLESSLY!</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length, naturally curly (frizzy), very dry color treated hair.  </li>

            <li> It is lighter weight and perfect for my wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s what you like, or what works best for you, but I didn&#x27;t see the &amp;#34;rave&amp;#34; over this product.</li>
            <li> The price is awesome.  </li>
            <li> I suggest trying it and add a post-wash moisterizer for best results.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very happy I did.</li>
            <li> LOL!!</li>
            <li> It was wonderful for them.</li>
            <li> Hair one is the  best for cleansing I have ever used with out breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> This tames his hair frizzies so good!</li>
            <li> dry\\&quot; and have beautiful spiral curls with no effort...</li>
            <li> As good as WEN, much better price!!!!  </li>
            <li> Where it works for some, it didnt do that great for me.  </li>
            <li> and it smells great.</li>
            <li> my hair looks GREAT.</li>
            <li> and this makes it feel and look great.</li>
            <li> This combo works great if I keep my hair washing to a 3 x per week</li>
            <li> and it smells great too.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been hearing all these great things about WEN and planned on buying it.  </li>
            <li> And decided to give it a go, I&#x27;m so happy that I purchased</li>
            <li> I will never get this again, and the smell isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using it both ways and both ways work really great for my hair</li>
            <li> My hair texture has changed greatly, because I am not stripping all the oils out.</li>
            <li> i am a happy hair one user.</li>
            <li> if your looking for well cleansed hair and it feeling great after a rinse</li>
            <li> Keep up the great mix Hair One.</li>
            <li> Great as a shampoo and leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> omg my hair looks and feels amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!</li>
            <li> I actually liked this!</li>
            <li> basically, it did nothing to \\&quot;cleanse\\&quot; my hair, but I have begun using it as a leave in conditioner (which the product states you can do) and am having good results with that.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good too.</li>
            <li> Feels good.</li>
            <li> Have never seen my hair look this good before.</li>
            <li> When I got Hair one in the mail, I immediately tried it and loved it.</li>
            <li> , I think that it just didn&#x27;t do a good job of cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li> and I hoped for good results</li>
            <li> I have tried this, and LOVED it.</li>
            <li> Anyway I like it, my hair loved it</li>
            <li> this  is a good product</li>
            <li> However, when I used Hair One, it made my scalp feel good, but when I could not \\&quot;easily\\&quot; run my fingers through my hair.  </li>
            <li> I went through all the steps and my hair felt sooooooo good.  </li>
            <li> This product works just as good.</li>
            <li> My mom who has thinner and nicer hair got really good results from it.</li>
            <li> I also agree with the girls who experienced much more hair loss when they were using the product.  </li>
            <li> I went into this hoping I&#x27;d found a great product people had reviewed mostly saying it worked well</li>
            <li> Had I have found this before I figured the right combo of products I would be raving about how awesome it is.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t clean your hair and scalp very good</li>
            <li> , LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> like this version better!</li>
            <li> and I love it !</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love It!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> It styled easily, felt and looked very nice.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this product from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supplies for a while now and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thrilled.  </li>
            <li> Nice shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li> Honestly, I wanted to hold my breath.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It really works the best for me.  </li>
            <li> It felt nice in my hands and hair.</li>
            <li> I have since found my own way to use it</li>
            <li> liked the Wen product, but it caused my scalp, neck and shoulders to break out.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Wen has made my hair healthy and gorgeous</li>
            <li> It has a great smell, great menthol cooling sensation, it moisturizes, and makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li> Like many of you I saw the \\&quot;wonderful WEN\\&quot; infomercials and really wanted to try it out</li>
            <li> VERY STRONG FRAGRANCE smell.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty good!</li>
            <li> Hair and scalp feels more than clean with a great smell.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing</li>
            <li> lmao :-)</li>
            <li> many women review hair product without stating what type of hair they have, whether they color it and what kind of heat damage they do to it.  </li>
            <li> This is a great alternative, and worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is a perfect combination for me, my hair looks and smells great, I have less frizz</li>
            <li> I was very excited about the WEN infomercials but didnt want to be included in autoship or a membership of any kind, nor did I want to spend that amount of money on something that might not work for me.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very fine</li>
            <li> So much cheaper then wen and works just as good!</li>
            <li> The product is just OK</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE IS GIOVANNI.</li>
            <li> Its made my hair smoother and feels healthy.</li>
            <li> I must say that I am quite pleased.  </li>
            <li> The longer you leave the product on the better</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried Wen, so I can&#x27;t compare, but I LOVE Hair One.  </li>
            <li> and I love that I can just towel</li>
            <li> We love this stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;LOVE, LOVE</li>
            <li> As many people do, I have to take medicines and top</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the way this stuff makes my hair looks.</li>
            <li> I love the menthol feeling,</li>
            <li> The longer you leave it in the better</li>
            <li> I love it and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Besides I&#x27;m frugal, 10-15 bucks sounds a lot better than 35-40</li>
            <li> this is a better value.  </li>
            <li> I do love Wen</li>
            <li> whereas the Herbal Essences does not (which I like better).  </li>
            <li> I know for sure I am allergic to formaldehyde (and its cousin, Quaternium-15 which is often listed in so-called formaldehyde-free formulas).</li>
            <li> Anyway, the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shampoos didn&#x27;t work any better for me than the chemical ones and in desperation I tried a sample packet of this.  </li>
            <li> It is fabulous!  </li>
            <li> I have two curly girls (who cowash) and we love this line.  </li>
            <li> This should have been packaged better.</li>
            <li> It even makes my scalp feel better.</li>
            <li> I love how this made my hair and scalp fell</li>
            <li> /&gt;YES, I have curly hair, and I LOVE this.</li>
            <li> But cheap Suave conditioner has cetyl alcohol too!</li>
            <li> The Tea Tree Cleansing Conditioner did much better with her hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, 1/3 of the price of WEN, so there has to be a trade off.  </li>
            <li> and you can cleanse your scalp better.</li>
            <li> Do NOT use as many pumps as they tell you.</li>
            <li> A gentle cleanse great for colored hair.</li>
            <li> I love how it doesn&#x27;t wash out my color.</li>
            <li> so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> This did not perform any better than Ion Keratin Shampoo &amp; Smoothing</li>
            <li> I give this product a 3 star, probably because I was expecting more.</li>
            <li> I think I need more to combat the iron when it comes to straightening my hair out.</li>
            <li> will for sure continue to use this because I do like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I think I need more to combat the iron when it comes to straightening my hair out.</li>
            <li> will for sure continue to use this because I do like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Ok, so we&#x27;ve all watched the Wen infomercials.</li>
            <li> It was ok.  </li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> and i was impressed same quality and does wonders for my hair for a fraction of the price, but i do prefer the wen fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love what this product has done for my hair.</li>
            <li> It tells you to add SO MANY pumps</li>
            <li> harm toxins work better</li>
            <li> and I love that.</li>
            <li> I was really, really looking forward to trying it, after reading some of the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and great shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> OK, maybe an updated label</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually pretty good, but with every shampoo or conditioner, it works better after you use that shampoo to remove residual, like neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I found and used Joico for a long time because it worked the best...</li>
            <li> I used it I was impressed, but when I got out of the shower it was a bit strange.</li>
            <li> Go easy on your pumps and add some water to your hair and lather it and see if u need more after that.</li>
            <li> My hair was just as clean, shiny, and bouncy as with Hair One, but for a tenth of the price (and a thirtieth of the price of Wen)!</li>
            <li> I plan to try some of the other products on Amazon that are WEN-like and see what works best.</li>
            <li> I did a deep condition (let it sit on for an hr) and let me tell you my hair LOVED IT!</li>
            <li> great alternative for wen cleansing products - will definitely buy again! :-)</li>
            <li> and it easily detangles my hair</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no breakage just clean healthy hair.</li>
            <li> Great WEN knock off, same ingred and better price.</li>
            <li> My head felt fine after using this.  </li>
            <li> it did not work for me, but if you have fine hair, it will work wonders.</li>
            <li> I use are fine.</li>
            <li> Within the line is the sulphate free shampoo, conditioner, leave in reconstructor and serum in a tube.  </li>
            <li> As with any soap free shampoos, you have to use a ton of it...</li>
            <li> I like to use Giovanni conditioners that are gluten free.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even use what is supposed to be the best anti-allergy shampoo,[[ASIN:B0006FMK98 Free &amp; Clear Shampoo for Sensitive Skin 12 fl oz (355 ml)]].</li>
            <li> I say light because there is no buildup with this product.</li>
            <li> It looked fantastic.</li>
            <li> (heck, i did buy P-90x and got fabulous results).</li>
            <li> shower with a light film.  </li>
            <li> and I like to use this as my primary shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> so I thought the Olive Oil would be fantastic.</li>
            <li> i have used almost every product in market to make my hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stand leaving my hair like this, so I put some Infusium in it to smooth things out.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel like I hadn&#x27; t conditioned it at all (and I used a sulfate free condtioner after the shampoo).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing that one product can do what it normally takes 4 to manage though!  </li>
            <li> This product is my new favorite!  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair easy to detangle after washing and it  makes my hair nice and soft after it air dries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pleased with the results I had when I bought this one thinking it would be best for my bi-racial daughter&#x27;s curly hair.  </li>
            <li> (And I am pregnant, so if I think its fine</li>
            <li> Anyone searching for something to help with dryness give it a try, my hair for sure look healthier and I am confident will do even better the next time I use</li>
            <li> (And I am pregnant, so if I think its fine</li>
            <li> Anyone searching for something to help with dryness give it a try, my hair for sure look healthier and I am confident will do even better the next time I use it!</li>
            <li> It is not quite as thick and moisturizing, but it&#x27;s the best cheap substitute I have found.</li>
            <li> Plus, my hair stays clean for 2-3 days...</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s because Hair One uses cetyl alcohol to clean your hair.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair silky and clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something that will clean my hair but leave it manageable.</li>
            <li> only thing that I could give this product credit for is that it does have a pleasant odor.</li>
            <li> Wow, for a fraction of the cost and it works better!</li>
            <li> Shipping was pretty quick and they made sure to package each bottle so that they would not be damaged---Good job.</li>
            <li> I received this product today and was super excited to use it.</li>
            <li> I tried the sample before ponying up the cash for a full bottle.</li>
            <li> It really does not get it better than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That makes more sense than letting the shower water run the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but you got to play with it a bit before you get the full</li>
            <li> My hair is always shiny and full of life.</li>
            <li> The only thing it did was make my hair smell good and detangle it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a reasonably priced cleansing conditioner, I think you can find a better one than this.</li>
            <li> i am not gonna say that its a miracle i will say that its one of the best product i have ever use , my hair is really thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for a dry itchy scalp!!</li>
            <li> great alternative to Wen and other sulfate-free cleaners.</li>
            <li> It seems to be really mild on my color</li>
            <li> the love of God, can&#x27;t ANYone create a decent Wen knock off for those of us who don&#x27;t make 6 figures???</li>
            <li> but I certainly don&#x27;t love the high price tag.  </li>
            <li> This product, after following the instructions and letting my hair dry, made my hair look great after straightening it and my waves were smooth and cute...</li>
            <li> With this you put it in, scrub as normal, then add more, \\&quot;finger comb\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I washed my hair with this, put in some infusium 23 leave-in for a detangler, combed, and let air dry, and my hair is GORGEOUS.</li>
            <li> It gave my hair a lot of moisture and limited frizz which is excellent because I have very curly hair and live in an area with tons of humidity.</li>
            <li> I thought that the prospect of a sulphate free hair cleanser would really help my situation.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth trying</li>
            <li> The only think I liked about Hair</li>
            <li> Well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have heard so many positives to cleansing conditioners, and I was sold at soft silky hair that would not need to be trimmed as often.  </li>
            <li> But I have psoriasis which makes my scalp more sensitive to things like that</li>
            <li> But I have psoriasis which makes my scalp more sensitive to things like that</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and tangle free!</li>
            <li> Hope to have the results and success</li>
            <li> It cleanses very well and leaves the hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> But with my hair type it loves any kind of moisture my hair is coarse and doesn&#x27;t like to do anything</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> but I still love how it effects the appearance of my hair makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this will work better for someone without a sensitive scalp and who has healthier hair.</li>
            <li> However, I kept up the faith and kept going, leaving it in for at least 7 minutes, while continuing to add more and more of the stuff, before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things didn&#x27;t get much better when I rinsed it out.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s MUCH more managable, soft and shinney that way.</li>
            <li> However, because I found the right stuff for my hair (after years) I don&#x27;t notice a difference in the shine or texture.  </li>
            <li> right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I just can&#x27;t handle the thought of a hair drier right now.  </li>
            <li> You just have to find what is right for your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not tempted to either, because this price is so much more reasonable at about half the cost and produces amazing results.</li>
            <li> I liked it enough to invest in the higher quality one.</li>
            <li> I live in LA, and I have hard water and great water pressure, so I&#x27;m pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t build-up</li>
            <li> The healthy hair did great,my only issue is my hair is so super curly</li>
            <li> it!e healthy hair did great,my only issue is my hair is so super curly</li>
            <li> Everybody&#x27;s hair is different, but I think everybody should give this product a try because if they are lucky enough to have the right type of hair to have the same results I&#x27;ve had it will make them so happy they switched!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tingly feeling of it being on my scalp was a nice feeling but the scent is very strange.  </li>
            <li> dry my hair and my curl comes out on its own.  </li>
            <li> I am African-American with an oily scalp and dry ends, and this product effectively cleans my scalp without stripping it, and moisturizes my ends.  </li>
            <li> Its cheap, its one product versus several and its sulfate free which is a must for people with hair like mine.</li>
            <li> Its cheap, its one product versus several and its sulfate free which is a must for people with hair like mine.</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft, tangle free, has body and movement and it&#x27;s brighter than before.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> My hair stopped breaking, started back growing, and became soft to touch, easy to style and healthy looking</li>
            <li> its best if you have really dry hair and thick hair / ethnic,  hair that needs more oils than normal hair would to look sleek / not frizzy.</li>
            <li> If this was a process that I would have to endure only once or twice per week it would be okay</li>
            <li> However, after the first couple of times I used it</li>
            <li> The first time I sprayed it onto my damp hair and smoothed it through with my hands</li>
            <li> Also, it takes a lot more pumps to get a necessary amount of product to put in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I have very short hair and get away with 4 pumps (plus one more as a leave-in conditioner).  </li>
            <li> But when I blow out my hair, it looks multitudes better than w/ traditional shampooing and conditioning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I just bought a bottle of Hair one with olive oil and tried it today for the first time....</li>
            <li> Tried this the first time</li>
            <li> did exactly what the directions said</li>
            <li> First of all-- please note that this review is for the Olive Oil formula.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE that you can also use the product as a leave-in; AND I also use it as a deep treatment by applying and sitting under a hood dryer for 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice after finding it at Sally&#x27;s Beauty for $9.99, and I&#x27;m already in love.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so soft or light.</li>
            <li> Looking at the label, I noticed that it has many of the same ingredients as Hair One, and decided to give it a shot</li>
            <li> (I also think it smells better than Wen or Hair One, personally).</li>
            <li> first week I did go through a bit of the \\&quot;oily\\&quot; stage that people talk about</li>
            <li> And my color isn&#x27;t NEARLY as faded as it would normally be this many weeks after coloring</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem any better to me than the co-wash products that you can buy at a local store.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li> Just would love to find this in larger bottles.</li>
            <li> But when someone I know who had thicker more coarse hair used it...</li>
            <li> and my hair is still pretty greasy from it.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty damaged</li>
            <li> I thought why not, Sally&#x27;s is around the block I can hop over buy it, be back easily and $10-$11 for the bottle was worth it if this lives up to its hype.&lt;br</li>
            <li> - however I do think that this product is definitely dependent upon the individual and your own unique hair.  </li>
            <li> In fact, any cheap conditioner does the trick (a little fact I&#x27;m sure the folks at Wen don&#x27;t want you to know,lol).  </li>
            <li> does a good job otherwise, but then, any silicone free conditioner will do the same thing just as well and for significantly less money.  </li>
            <li> I am a product junkie and have spent many years finding the right combo of products for my hair.  </li>
            <li> First off, it&#x27;s very time consuming.  </li>
            <li> think this product works pretty much like Wen.</li>
            <li> The first time, I followed the instructions, saturated my hair on the product, combed it through, and rinsed very well.</li>
            <li> but it just depend on ur hair type , my hair after first use was not dry and with the regular use now they look amazing .</li>
            <li> it felt to me, and my hair came out super soft.</li>
            <li> and my hair is super shine, and soft as silk.</li>
            <li> and I must say when I touched parts of my hair and messed with it, it was super soft and that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> Hair One olive oil for dry hair has a better smell than the almond mint one labeled for all hair types.</li>
            <li> Of course, it&#x27;s goi g to largely depend on the length of your hair but u be the judge.</li>
            <li> My hair was much more tangled and knotted up, it felt very dry and had no shine.</li>
            <li> really wanted to like this but cannot recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> so it became very course and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes, I just dont have the much time.  </li>
            <li> but the menthol odor is very pronounced and the steam makes it stronger.  </li>
            <li> I really like having a shampoo and conditioner in one so to say.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you need to use nearly as much as the instructions</li>
            <li> /&gt;That is over now; this product really is \\&quot;IT\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> , is all I can really say.</li>
            <li> Price reasonable.</li>
            <li> also got a sample pack of the jojoba version of Hair one, but didn&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li> and it felt really conditioned.</li>
            <li> It has too much menthol in it and it really irritated my scalp a bit.  </li>
            <li> What I&#x27;ve discovered since then, through various message boards, is that VO5 Kiwi Lime conditioner is a fantastic dupe for Wen.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it in the shower; I washed my hair in the sink so that I could just stick a towel around my wet head while it did its magic for 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Works really well on my 4a-4c hair.</li>
            <li> I really like how it makes my hair feel and it thickens my hair.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comparable to Wen, but is much much much cheaper.</li>
            <li> that was too much for my length of hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was damaged from dying it so much, the ends were so brittle, then I started using this</li>
            <li> and I thought it cost too much.  </li>
            <li> and I really cannot afford WEN.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try something much cheaper</li>
            <li> nothing happened really some</li>
            <li> so i have to use a whole lot</li>
            <li> Wow worth every cent.</li>
            <li> So maybe it&#x27;s me but not so fast.  </li>
            <li> my hair was super super dry, color treated and heat damaged</li>
            <li> As far as body, a lot of fluff (the kind I try to get rid of).</li>
            <li> I purchased this product while engaged in the task of trying to find new products for my hair that would keep it healthy while I was growing it long.</li>
            <li> Because other reviewers mentioned having build-up, I made sure that I rinsed really well.</li>
            <li> I came across Hair One, most of the reviews were very similar to what I was reading on WEN but with major highlights being much lower cost, easier accessibility (no shipping) and no hassle trying to navigate the WEN site</li>
            <li> max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was drying out because I had to wash too frequently due to my sweaty workouts, so was looking for something better.  </li>
            <li> I love the Wen Fig due to my damaged hair.</li>
            <li> My relaxed/african-american hair gets extremely dry and breaks off easily.</li>
            <li> But, this product not only allowed me to detangle, but I was able to comb from root to tip with a wide tooth comb, and that never happens, even with super slippery</li>
            <li> Keep in mind: if you don&#x27;t get it right the first time, there&#x27;s always next</li>
            <li> I normally use a LOT of conditioner, use my fingers to pull it through and leave it on for the duration of my shower, then rinse it out very well.  </li>
            <li> Not enthused enough about it to buy a full bottle.  </li>
            <li> and my curls are much more defined, but it is not weighted down.  </li>
            <li> If its clean its to frizzy feeling and can&#x27;t be controlled with the flat iron.</li>
            <li> It was softer and it was less frizzy and more manageable</li>
            <li> Pass up Hair One, there are better options out there and for a lot less $$$.</li>
            <li> I love this product but use less pumps once you re-wet your hair</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s able to \\&quot;lather\\&quot; slightly</li>
            <li> It did leave my color beautifully vibrant and</li>
            <li> I bought this product as an alternative to buying the more expensive Wen, and I think I&#x27;m already in love.</li>
            <li> Left it on longer than the recommended time as everything indicates the longer its left in the better the results.  </li>
            <li> This is a decent shampoo/cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Ren&#x27;s is actually just as good and a few dollars cheaper than this.</li>
            <li> Ok Product works ok but difficult to rinse out of hair .  </li>
            <li> The first couple times I used it, I followed the directions exactly, but even though I have dry, curly hair, leaving the shampoo in as a leave-in conditioner was too much for hair.  </li>
            <li> Hair is left soft silky and clean.</li>
            <li> Hair One is fine for someone who likes the smell and feel of menthol on the scalp, but it&#x27;s certainly not for me.  </li>
            <li> The only difference I noticed from my regular shampoo and conditioner, was that my hair didn&#x27;t feel clean, even when it was wet, it was more tangled, and my roots were greasy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use near as much as the bottle recommends.  </li>
            <li> After a few more uses I guess I got used to it because it didnt happen again</li>
            <li> Aside from that, it pretty much did the opposite of everything I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> (normally wash twice, scrubbing my scalp anyways, followed by conditioner that I have to work \\&quot;finger</li>
            <li> I did notice a bit of a static cling issue brushing it when it dried fully.</li>
            <li> I put a few more pumps as a leave-in like it said on the directions.  </li>
            <li> , I use it like normal shampoo, leave it on while I finish everything else in the shower and then rinse.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll go ahead and try the one for normal hair.</li>
            <li> I can notice it most often if his dandruff comes back, because he has a dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone looking to try something new.</li>
            <li> I have so much new growth</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado, so I also fight the super dry climate.  </li>
            <li> I still get frizzies on hot humid days, but it is pretty minimal, and with the argon oil, not that noticable.  </li>
            <li> so my hair gets super dry.  </li>
            <li> I used it in the shower after work one morning, followed the directions thoroughly, and had high hopes as it made my hair feel somewhat soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is feeling very soft now.</li>
            <li> When I used this it made my hair very soft...</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Several of the line of Suave conditioners are appropriate for Conditioner Only hair cleansing, and they run only about $1.00 per 16 oz bottle.  </li>
            <li> especially those of you looking for a fix that doesn&#x27;t include taking the time to use a straight iron!</li>
            <li> Maybe next time it will go higher when I use it</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I have used hair one with olive oil and Teflon anti snap as a leave in and my hair is so soft!</li>
            <li> It made my hair even have more body than WEN and at half the price!!</li>
            <li> I am biracial (white/black) and I have super curly hair that I have relaxed almost all my life until recently when I finally accepted my curls and tried to live without the relaxer.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re worried about having so much product in your hair you can use this as a leave in conditioner only and still use your normal shampoo and conditioner routine.</li>
            <li> The thing is, they all work pretty much the same way, so save your pennies and try a lesser priced brand.  </li>
            <li> It says you are supposed to use a lot, my husband has short hair, so not sure he uses as much as he is supposed to, but seems to do okay.  </li>
            <li> I have always had a head full of hair (Mixed Culture) and have spent over $1000.00 for \\&quot;I wish this really would work</li>
            <li> To my suprise it worked wonders on my fine limp damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair and throughout the years I have bleached and highlighted the life out of it</li>
            <li> so far i like it.</li>
            <li> I have wash and go hair for the first time in a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You also won&#x27;t get out of the shower with soft hair.</li>
            <li> products\\&quot;, that left you saying; \\&quot;I wish I really would not have, bought this product\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> as if too much hair gel was present)</li>
            <li> I am transitioning from relaxed to natural, so I&#x27;m looking for something that will work for me.</li>
            <li> I got out of the shower my hair felt quite soft.</li>
            <li> This is then followed by a combo of extra strength frizz ease and straight &amp; shine frizz</li>
            <li> My hair did not feel soft.  </li>
            <li> I have used this about 3 times so far.  </li>
            <li> My hair was soft and shiny and</li>
            <li> completely clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> One is still too much (especially considering how much you have to use).</li>
            <li> One step that I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll repeat is the \\&quot;combing\\&quot; through, WOW was there pulling (yes worked my way from the bottom up) and did a lot of hair come out.  </li>
            <li> She bleaches her hair to WHITE so its very damaged.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I relaxed my hair is because of how curly my hair is not because I like straight hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember my hair being this soft, this shiny and this manageable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got really intense dyed red hair</li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> I may do a few things different and see even better results.</li>
            <li> I may do a few things different and see even better results.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s hair may respond differently to this product, so it is worth a try, HOWEVER- for chemically treated hair that is prone to drying out, such as relaxed or color-</li>
            <li> hair is quite dry, so shampoos can be harsh since i have very fine</li>
            <li> and I have lots of highlights, which made my hair pretty dry, but manageable.</li>
            <li> did notice the the \\&quot;menthol\\&quot; effect was a little intense at the nape (not uncomfortable or anything though).  </li>
            <li> did notice the the \\&quot;menthol\\&quot; effect was a little intense at the nape (not uncomfortable or anything though).  </li>
            <li> I tried it a few times and it made my scalp very itchy and left my hair full of tangles.  </li>
            <li> As I said at first I didnt realize it was from the product, but I used it again 2 nights later and the same thing happened.  </li>
            <li> (you usually have to give something a try more than once), and only used one at a time</li>
            <li> Today I picked up the Dry Hair formula and the Color Treated formula figuring I would either alternate or combine them depending on the results and if I liked the product(s) after using them a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a shine that I haven&#x27;t seen since I was a little girl and its super soft.</li>
            <li> so I just ordered my second bottle of normal formula, stay tuned....</li>
            <li> have nearly waist length fine but thick hair that I keep died red (very difficult color to maintain) and because I live in the desert I get even drier here in the summer than I normally am (lol).  </li>
            <li> I have since stopped using it because with the price (even though it&#x27;s much cheaper than WEN), and the time it takes to use it, the hair loss and the odor - was too much con for the little bit of pro it did for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My naturally wavy hair is never dry or frizzy, anymore.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to traditional shampooing if I don&#x27;t absolutely have to.</li>
            <li> The only thing that surprised me was the texture of the product I was expecting a clear gel</li>
            <li> With the gray, it&#x27;s wavy, more coarse and still thick.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks shiny, strong, and thick.</li>
            <li> Even with the extra pump left in, my hair never feels oily, heavy, or--well, anything except for clean!  </li>
            <li> but the cost was a major factor in making me rethink my desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My roots were greasy, and the rest of my hair was dry and more tangled than usual.</li>
            <li> --I have very oily roots and very dry ends, but it still works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It tends to be very dry and stringy, and is extremely straight.</li>
            <li> anyways, I usually use Mixed chicks on my hair which I love, but there is nothing in their line that works for when I use the flat iron on my hair.</li>
            <li> I wish they would make a version that is free of this common allergen - if they did, I might use this item sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im a 21 yr old male and have used this about 3 times and</li>
            <li> I had been contemplating purchasing Wen conditioning cleanser, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money on something that is unknown and untested.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise, my hair was left soft, shiny, tingly and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I cowash frequently with regular conditioner</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and bouncy and my curls are actually curling instead of frizzing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put any extra in and continue to use my old mousse to style my hair.  </li>
            <li> i am not ever using a shampoo and not going back to any of my old products.</li>
            <li> normal hair care consists of a double wash and condition with an ultra moisture shampoo and conditioner (various brands).  </li>
            <li> I always wanted to try WEN, but it was so expensive, when I found Hair One I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li> I stumbled upon Hair One on a trip to Sally Beauty Supply and thought it might be worth investigating as it is a similar product to Wen at half the</li>
            <li> I got the little 99 cent packet for dry hair, and I was so excited to use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> BUT not so much to make an extreme difference in the LOOK of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping between Hair One and hounding her to not have white hair that she will have the hair back that she really wants (long and full).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is hard to clean since it&#x27;s not foamy at all</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work, but two tries was enough for me.</li>
            <li> But if you just take a second and compare the ingredients in Hair One with the ingredients of a $2 bottle of conditioner from the grocery store, I think you&#x27;ll be surprised at how similar they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair One definitely cleanses and leaves hair soft, but it is not enough moisture for my hair type.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall my hair was left feeling \\&quot;hard\\&quot; and sticky and not remotely shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can see how it might be too much for regular daily use unless you have very dry hair, but if you do, give it a try!</li>
            <li> I have hair down to my mid-back and it was just too much.  </li>
            <li> After having 2 babies very close together, my usually silky fine, never frizzy hair was left perpetually frizzed and dried out.  </li>
            <li> It feels odd using so much product.</li>
            <li> After reading all the data on sulfates and the harsh chemicals normal shampoos contain, I decided to switch to natural products.</li>
            <li> my normally dry, frizzy, red-but-turning-grey hair was actually manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li> It has completely repaired my hair and changed it from coarse, dry and unruly to silky and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I dye my thin baby fine hair and am on lots of meds.</li>
            <li> I was able to comb through my wet thick hair while in the shower EFFORTLESSLY!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, naturally curly (frizzy), very dry color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> Even my husband has noticed the change in my hair, to quote him \\&quot;your hair was stiff and prickly before now its really soft.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Very soft and silky wet hair, very gross and greasy looking dry hair.</li>
            <li> I also use extra on the ends as I flat iron.</li>
            <li> I read all reviews the good and especially the bad, despite all that was said, negative and positive</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, if I have the same manageability and texture results from the Color formula as the Dry Hair formula I may have very well found the hair regime to stick with and convert a few people too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> will add also that my hair feels even better after I blow dry it than when it air dries which is so weird and opposite of what I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li> I am a middle-aged, caucasian female with some gray hair (not sure how much b/c I color it).  </li>
            <li> This product has left my hair looking soft, manageable, WAY less frizz than I ever had before.</li>
            <li> I dried it and the ends looked very frizzy and dry.  </li>
            <li> It must be working at least pretty well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll update the review if I notice any changes after long term use.who are using multiple products to achieve manageable hair and anyone with unmanageable hair.  </li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t you&#x27;re not getting the product on your scalp or you&#x27;re not letting it sit on long enough, after 3 minutes my scalp was tingling.</li>
            <li> I decided to flat iron my hair</li>
            <li> and you really should t because this is some pretty thick and heavy stuff!</li>
            <li> It is not bad for my hair, but it&#x27;s not great, either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just not great, either.</li>
            <li> Two people at my job have recently told me that my hair is getting so long!  </li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend the to anyone with dry frizzy hair...</li>
            <li> The only time it doesn&#x27;t look dry one way or</li>
            <li> The three following times I used Hair One, my hair was extremely dry, had no luster and felt brittle.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry especially on the ends</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and I have much less hair loss than when using shampoo.</li>
            <li> Before I had gray hair, my hair was straight, thick and coarse.  </li>
            <li> did use one pump for leave-in conditioner the first time I used it, and it was a bit heavy and weighed my hair down.</li>
            <li> I started by trying the leave in conditioner because it says that it actually contains hair cell reproductions right in the product that penetrate the broken shaft and help repair it from the inside out.  </li>
            <li> product does NOT cause break outs on my scalp, neck and shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;This is quite similar but not exactly the same--</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, as one other reviewer described, as I started working this into my scalp, I could actually feel my hair starting to tangle.</li>
            <li> And also how dry the ends feel when I flat iron.</li>
            <li> I use product on my hair (balms,gloss etc) to protect and manage the hair when I am flat ironing it, but I never feel like my hair isn&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so heavy that it&#x27;ll stick around in my hair, I don&#x27;t think, but it was a little disconcerting at first.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have long curly hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll update the review if I notice any changes after long term use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to see how long I can go between washes with this stuff</li>
            <li> I have very short(3in) and EXTREMELY thick hair.</li>
            <li> It was really soft, but a bit dry at the ends, so I added a little moisterizer and that worked.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavey, coarse hair that is pretty dry from coloring.</li>
            <li> I use Garnier hair color regularly, shampoo &amp; blow dry every other day and flat iron every day.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was running out of WEN and needed a less expensive alternative because I started to love cowashing.</li>
            <li> This product gives your hair a no significant different feeling then the Wen Cleansing Conditioner but lets face it we need the deep conditioning that the Wen</li>
            <li> I usually have a few different problems when I wear my hair straight versus curly.</li>
            <li> than they figured out how to distill the smell that you get when you walk into a health/herbal/supplement store; again very strange</li>
            <li> that with some years of age (50) my hair had become dry, brittle, and breaking.</li>
            <li> I use the Cucumber Aloe conditioning cleanser on my scalp, and the Dry Hair w/ olive oil for the \\&quot;conditioning\\&quot; step.</li>
            <li> the need to blow dry, brush, and style.</li>
            <li> if I let it just air dry.</li>
            <li> let my hair air-dry and it got frizzier and frizzier and my hair looked dry and felt like straw.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I then blow dry and straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> This stuff just made my scalp greasy and my and my ends dry.</li>
            <li> Found that the dry hair formula maybe too oily for my hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Chose to use the Dry Hair formula, went through the steps of rinsing, working into scalp and then through the length.  </li>
            <li> Might work for you if you have dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Its lighter and shinier, I trimmed the ends that were STILL dry.</li>
            <li> I used an ion blow-dryer to dry my hair with a vented brush</li>
            <li> It rinsed out REALLY FAST (this may be due to the extremely hard water we have here)</li>
            <li> With this product not very much product is needed.</li>
            <li> my entire life...had problems with finding a shampoo/conditioner that was moisturizing without weighing my hair down or making it look oily.</li>
            <li> Also even though everyone talked about having no color loss there was a TON of red pouring out of my hair and down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color of the shampoo, the texture and everything is just different even down to the smell.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even imagine if I didn&#x27;t get the Dry Hair version of Hair One!</li>
            <li> I let it air dry and used a flat iron the next morning using very little leave-in conditioner and nothing else.</li>
            <li> IT MADE MY HAIR VERY DRY.</li>
            <li> When I rinsed, my hair felt very dry like I could not run my fingers through it.  </li>
            <li> So in the long run, it will save me from purchasing 3 other products (shampoo and the two serums).  </li>
            <li> Sally&#x27;s (who make it) has a great return policy, so you have nothing to lose except nasty hair and frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this would have been a good replacement, but it actually was horrible for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;There was massive buildup to the point where I would have to shampoo a few times a week just to get it out.</li>
            <li> and the cost is minimal.  </li>
            <li> However, it left my hair limp and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> Partially damp</li>
            <li> I cringe at the money spent...</li>
            <li> This one left my hair feeling greasy and limp.</li>
            <li> another is when its wet and slathered in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> order another as soon as this is close to empty.</li>
            <li> I hate the whole million pump thing, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> So you can imagine how wary I was about using this conditioner to clean up that mess.</li>
            <li> ( firstly because you have to use so much, and because I normally have to wash my hair every other day for all of the oil in my roots, which I attribute to washing it too much- vicious cycle).</li>
            <li> It makes your hair less dry</li>
            <li> I have medium length thick, coarse, color treated, dry hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it as a leave in as my hair is thin and long and usually leave in is too much.</li>
            <li> My guess that is due to the silicon in it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I should have given this product 3 stars, but that&#x27;s the Amazon standard for \\&quot;it&#x27;s OK\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product in lue of getting the WEN conditioning treatments due to cost.</li>
            <li> I threw out all of those other products and I use a shampoo once every 6 weeks to remove buildup and all other shampoos are done with Hair One.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t do that with regular shampoo :-/</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience the itching, irritation, headaches, burning lips or other symptoms that other shampoos cause.  </li>
            <li> It combed out as if I had put all my other leave-ins, serums and restorative masks on it.  </li>
            <li> The other day I was in and they had the Olive Oil formula samples by the register.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It might work for other hair types, did not work for mine.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works well for other hair types, but not for mine.</li>
            <li> cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle because my hair is curly, thick and long (half-way down my back).  </li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way!!</li>
            <li> There is a system out there now called Citre Shine&#x27;s Repair Active 1/3 Serum treatment.  </li>
            <li> If you have long, dry, frizzy, thick, and unmanageable hair</li>
            <li> Not sure about the strange instructions, but I use it like any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> I hate that I have to use so much ( following the instructions) to get my hair clean</li>
            <li> I think those that used it and are complaining of the greasiness are using the wrong type for their hair and also using too much product for their hair.</li>
            <li> : I have long, thin blonde hair.</li>
            <li> only complaint that I have is the smell.</li>
            <li> I have extremely coarse thick curly hair that looks wirey.</li>
            <li> but instead it has a thick white foam consistency.</li>
            <li> I have thick lomg blonde straw hair; this productly didnt work well for me at all.  </li>
            <li> It added moisure to my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re down to $5, a $10 bottle of Hair</li>
            <li> It just weighed her hair down and didn&#x27;t hold her curls at all.</li>
            <li> I leave a little of the product in my hair after cleaning and it mixes well with my other oils I use for my hair.</li>
            <li> It would leave my hair dull, flat, and lifeless.</li>
            <li> I hardly have to use a flat iron at all anymore.</li>
            <li> Other reviews said that the greasy feeling goes away after a few uses</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t worry it&#x27;s not very strong</li>
            <li> i followed the directions except i used half of the amount because I have shoulder length hair...</li>
            <li> I am having considerably less hair fall since switching to this Wen knockoff.</li>
            <li> The only thing is you have to use a ridiculous amount of product.</li>
            <li> Well, I opened the box to a mess.</li>
            <li> My hair was a mess</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair</li>
            <li> relax every six months and sometimes my new growth can be difficult to detangle.</li>
            <li> the record, I have bleached out, highlighted (half) Asian hair that gets soft and shiny with (overpriced, impossible to buy)</li>
            <li> I have naturally dry, course and thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick dry hair that is shoulder length.</li>
            <li> I add a little to the hair after rinsing it out as a leave in and there you have it....</li>
            <li> , yes, as others report, it is a little time-consuming to use.  </li>
            <li> Rinsing it out took a little while.</li>
            <li> I do think it feels a little greasy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to even describe it other</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little struggle.</li>
            <li> Just a little olive oil for shine.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little bit damaged from straightening it.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been so manageable with so little effort and so few products.  </li>
            <li> I stated using when a few years ago and it made my hair so soft and bouncy but it was also so expensive</li>
            <li> This products leaves my hair heavy coated feeling and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Ugh... A waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Waste of $$.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble finding the VO5 in my town, but I&#x27;ll keep looking.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll edit this post after a few weeks of use and let you know if I still like it.</li>
            <li> My hair had shine and body after I blow dried it.</li>
            <li> One size does not fit all in this case.</li>
            <li> I stayed that way for a few hours</li>
            <li> I simply dried it and then used the iron.</li>
            <li> When it dried, my hair looked like it does if I avoid washing it for three days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably the worst brand of shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried, which is really unfortunate because I got sucked into those Wen infomercials and was really hoping this product would be close to it since it&#x27;s so much more</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that goes a few inches past my shoulders</li>
            <li> Blow dried it, and it still felt \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; and not at all bouncy.</li>
            <li> I am 49 years old, I have thin but thick color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li> I would love to use Hair One products but they contain wheat and therefore make me very sick.  </li>
            <li> let me tell you a story about how tough this cleaner is--last week, when it was in the 90s where I live, I had to work for two days in a metal box with a broken air conditioner.</li>
            <li> It was dark and dull, with frizz and zero body.</li>
            <li> If I use the wrong shampoo I have what looks similar to a dried out lion mane.</li>
            <li> stuff keeps my hair from being a poofy frizz, but it is a little hard to wash out.</li>
            <li> I was really anxious to try this, hoping it would be my hair&#x27;s holy grail.</li>
            <li> Shipping BACK is too expensive.</li>
            <li> So, not sure if it works like it promises.  </li>
            <li> you can use it as a leave-in conditioner and style like usual.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sort of a faint herbally/ medical scent.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that changed something chemically in the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> well I&#x27;m will to look past that.</li>
            <li> But also very limp and then oily...</li>
            <li> IT HAS BEEN THE WORST NATURAL CONDITIONER/ SHAMPOO I HAVE USED SO FAR.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be a die hard direction follower on this one or u will have some heavily greased hair!</li>
            <li> The water here is hard, so we have a water softener.</li>
            <li> I just hate using so much product.</li>
            <li> I just could not get past the smell and worse, it stung my eyes where I applied it around my hair</li>
            <li> I purchased it as an alternative to Wen products, and I have not been disappointed so far.  </li>
            <li> One is certainly less expensive.</li>
            <li> For those who are looking for a less expensive version of Wen, this may be it.</li>
            <li> The best part for me is that I&#x27;ve always had a problem with terrible dandruff/psoriasis (nasty case of it)</li>
            <li> I desperately want to blow dry it and see what my color looks like but its 105+ here</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of this product when I heard of it.</li>
            <li> The worst part is that I used the entire bottle in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> The product was very thick and luxurious feeling.</li>
            <li> Anyone who is not happy with Hair One should give this one a try.  </li>
            <li> I was not happy with the way this worked on my hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of your hair looking like straw or feeling like steel wool, you need hair one.</li>
            <li> And I didn&#x27;t wash my hair in between shifts because I was just too tired.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I hate it, but I will definitely not buy again.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s not good when it is expensive to start with.</li>
            <li> When I got home, I was shocked to find that my scalp was still BLACK from the dust at work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Running a wide-tooth comb through it was unpleasant, to say the least.</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS have split ends and end up cutting them, so my hair is tough to grow out.</li>
            <li> sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> I also like how it doesnt leave that weird residue feeling that shampoo does.</li>
            <li> Seems weird to not put a conditioner in my hair.  </li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t be shy if you have oily hair</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too expensive, so I found this \\&quot;knock off\\&quot; product called hair one, that everyone talked about.</li>
            <li> but the next day my hair would look greasy and nasty.</li>
            <li> One:  this was a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll stop gushing now, but don&#x27;t be afraid to try this, even if you don&#x27;t get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical about anything sold on tv after midnight.</li>
            <li> I found it very difficult to diet angle my hair after using this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, the smell is bad.</li>
            <li> I also have psoriasis on my scalp which can react badly to products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels and the smell isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels and the smell isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I have used WEN for years and now with the bad economy I needed to find a cheaper version.</li>
            <li> and I hate the weird menthol smell!</li>
            <li> have to say though, if you don&#x27;t follow the directions, you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is so close to being like Wen its Crazy!</li>
            <li> I work in a foundry, so my hair gets absolutely filthy with metal dust.</li>
            <li> and I hated the menthol</li>
            <li> I hated it.  </li>
            <li> I dont think you&#x27;ll be disappointed!</li>
            <li> It was awful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would not buy this product again, maybe for some people it would work but for me it was horrible.</li>
            <li> Talk about miserable!</li>
            <li> I used it and 1 minute after I put it on my hair, my hair felt horrible.</li>
            <li> Horrifying!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I hate that I have to use so much ( following the instructions) to get my hair clean and I hate the weird menthol smell! This products leaves my hair heavy coated feeling and frizzy.  My guess that is due to the silicon in it.... Why does a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shampoo need silicon anyway!??? Ugh... A waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I was really anxious to try this, hoping it would be my hair&#x27;s holy grail. I tried the sample before ponying up the cash for a full bottle. Upon application, it smelled offensively like cough syrup. It was awful. I checked the ingredient list which has menthol in it. I just could not get past the smell and worse, it stung my eyes where I applied it around my hair line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also didn&#x27;t make my hair feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this but cannot recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product while engaged in the task of trying to find new products for my hair that would keep it healthy while I was growing it long. I work in a foundry, so my hair gets absolutely filthy with metal dust. I used it in the shower after work one morning, followed the directions thoroughly, and had high hopes as it made my hair feel somewhat soft. When I got home, I was shocked to find that my scalp was still BLACK from the dust at work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically, it did nothing to \\&quot;cleanse\\&quot; my hair, but I have begun using it as a leave in conditioner (which the product states you can do) and am having good results with that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I should have given this product 3 stars, but that&#x27;s the Amazon standard for \\&quot;it&#x27;s OK\\&quot; which is what I think.  The product is just OK - however I do think that this product is definitely dependent upon the individual and your own unique hair.  Where it works for some, it didnt do that great for me.  I have naturally wavy hair and throughout the years I have bleached and highlighted the life out of it so it became very course and frizzy.  I was very excited about the WEN infomercials but didnt want to be included in autoship or a membership of any kind, nor did I want to spend that amount of money on something that might not work for me.  I found some testimonials online about Hair One and went and picked it up.  I thought that the prospect of a sulphate free hair cleanser would really help my situation.  First off, it&#x27;s very time consuming.  I didnt realize how time consuming until I tried it for myself.  If this was a process that I would have to endure only once or twice per week it would be okay but not every time I shampoo my hair.  Sometimes, I just dont have the much time.  I have hair down to my mid-back and it was just too much.  However, after the first couple of times I used it I did notice a difference in my hair.  It was softer and it was less frizzy and more manageable BUT not so much to make an extreme difference in the LOOK of my hair.  I still needed to spot touch it with styling appliances because of the frizziness.  Then there is the smell.  I didnt realize it until later, but the menthol in the product, along with the steam from the shower actually made my eyes tear and the next morning when I woke up my eyes were burning. As I said at first I didnt realize it was from the product, but I used it again 2 nights later and the same thing happened.  After a few more uses I guess I got used to it because it didnt happen again but the menthol odor is very pronounced and the steam makes it stronger.  I also agree with the girls who experienced much more hair loss when they were using the product.  I have since stopped using it because with the price (even though it&#x27;s much cheaper than WEN), and the time it takes to use it, the hair loss and the odor - was too much con for the little bit of pro it did for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since discovered a product that is perfect for me.  It is from Citre Shine who are known for their shine products.  There is a system out there now called Citre Shine&#x27;s Repair Active 1/3 Serum treatment.  Within the line is the sulphate free shampoo, conditioner, leave in reconstructor and serum in a tube.  Each piece in the line is $4.99.  I started by trying the leave in conditioner because it says that it actually contains hair cell reproductions right in the product that penetrate the broken shaft and help repair it from the inside out.  The first time I sprayed it onto my damp hair and smoothed it through with my hands I saw IMMEDIATE changes in my hair.  I couldnt believe it.  I then ran out and bought the shampoo and conditioner and I swear I would not be without this product.  The shampoo does not suds up - it&#x27;s the same as the WEN and Hair One but it smells like citrus - no menthol.  This product has left my hair looking soft, manageable, WAY less frizz than I ever had before. My hair is even growing longer because it has since stopped breaking.  Two people at my job have recently told me that my hair is getting so long!  I&#x27;m so thrilled.  Anyone who is not happy with Hair One should give this one a try.  I dont think you&#x27;ll be disappointed!</li>
            <li> IT MADE MY HAIR VERY DRY. IT DID NOT MOISTURIZE MY HAIR ANY. IT HAS BEEN THE WORST NATURAL CONDITIONER/ SHAMPOO I HAVE USED SO FAR. I AM NOT BUYING THIS AGAIN. I SUGGEST GIOVANNI SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER, ALBA SHAMPOO AND OR CONDITIONER. MY FAVORITE IS GIOVANNI.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product in lue of getting the WEN conditioning treatments due to cost. I have extremely coarse thick curly hair that looks wirey. Im a 21 yr old male and have used this about 3 times and so far i like it. Its made my hair smoother and feels healthy. This stuff smells good too.</li>
            <li> great alternative for wen cleansing products - will definitely buy again! :-)</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo/conditioner and it smells great. As with any soap free shampoos, you have to use a ton of it...and that&#x27;s not good when it is expensive to start with.</li>
            <li> I must say that I am quite pleased.  I had been contemplating purchasing Wen conditioning cleanser, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money on something that is unknown and untested.  I stumbled upon Hair One on a trip to Sally Beauty Supply and thought it might be worth investigating as it is a similar product to Wen at half the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle because my hair is curly, thick and long (half-way down my back).  To my surprise, my hair was left soft, shiny, tingly and manageable.  I wish it had the variety of fragrances that Wen has, but you can&#x27;t have everything.  If Wen works as well as Hair One, I may give it a try.</li>
            <li> I tried this product out as a possible cheaper version of Wen since I had been a Wen user for about 2 years. I was hoping that this would have been a good replacement, but it actually was horrible for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;There was massive buildup to the point where I would have to shampoo a few times a week just to get it out. It would leave my hair dull, flat, and lifeless. I ended up switching back to Wen because of the condition it left my hair in.&lt;br /&gt;Other things I would say about this product is that the bottle is smaller compared to the smallest size of the Wen bottle. Also, it takes a lot more pumps to get a necessary amount of product to put in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I could give this product credit for is that it does have a pleasant odor.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim while in the beauty supply.  To my suprise it worked wonders on my fine limp damaged hair.  My hair is now stronger and healthier.  I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to regular shampoo and conditioners.  Also because it&#x27;s a cleanser and conditioner in one you can skip a step.  The longer you leave the product on the better it seems to work.  I recommend this product to anyone looking to try something new.</li>
            <li> I really like having a shampoo and conditioner in one so to say.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is quite dry, so shampoos can be harsh since i have very fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;I think this product works pretty much like Wen. It is slightly different, but I can&#x27;t explain how. I like Wen and I like Hair One.&lt;br /&gt;Hair One is certainly less expensive. Neither of them are miracle products, but I like having just one step.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make me give up my regular shampoo altogether. Sometimes I need to still use regular shampoo to get rid of the build up from this one. However, when I alternate back to my regular shampoo my hair looks GREAT. I have wash and go hair for the first time in a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff keeps my hair from being a poofy frizz, but it is a little hard to wash out. You also won&#x27;t get out of the shower with soft hair.</li>
            <li> For those who are looking for a less expensive version of Wen, this may be it. It is not quite as thick and moisturizing, but it&#x27;s the best cheap substitute I have found.</li>
            <li> I tried this as a cheaper alternative to the Wen stuff seen on tv.  I haven&#x27;t tried Wen, so I can&#x27;t compare, but I LOVE Hair One.  I don&#x27;t use near as much as the bottle recommends.  I have very short hair and get away with 4 pumps (plus one more as a leave-in conditioner).  My naturally wavy hair is never dry or frizzy, anymore.  Even with the extra pump left in, my hair never feels oily, heavy, or--well, anything except for clean!  I&#x27;m a low maintanence person and I love that I can just towel dry my hair and my curl comes out on its own.  The best part for me is that I&#x27;ve always had a problem with terrible dandruff/psoriasis (nasty case of it) and now I can go months without needing to break out the T-gel.  Everybody&#x27;s hair is different, but I think everybody should give this product a try because if they are lucky enough to have the right type of hair to have the same results I&#x27;ve had it will make them so happy they switched!</li>
            <li> I have always exclusively used salon brands of shampoo and conditioner (TiGi, Rusk,&amp; Matrix were my favorites)until I bought this on a whim at Sally Beauty Supply. WOW! We love this stuff. My daughter and I both have long curly hair and this makes it feel and look great.We are on our 2nd bottle and we are now \\&quot;converts\\&quot;. It&#x27;s definitely worth trying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I don&#x27;t think you need to use nearly as much as the instructions suggest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> I would love to use Hair One products but they contain wheat and therefore make me very sick.  I wish they would make a version that is free of this common allergen - if they did, I might use this item sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a good job otherwise, but then, any silicone free conditioner will do the same thing just as well and for significantly less money.  I like to use Giovanni conditioners that are gluten free.  Several of the line of Suave conditioners are appropriate for Conditioner Only hair cleansing, and they run only about $1.00 per 16 oz bottle.  Just a thought.</li>
            <li> As many people do, I have to take medicines and top that with some years of age (50) my hair had become dry, brittle, and breaking. I have always had a head full of hair (Mixed Culture) and have spent over $1000.00 for \\&quot;I wish this really would work products\\&quot;, that left you saying; \\&quot;I wish I really would not have, bought this product\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is over now; this product really is \\&quot;IT\\&quot;. My hair stopped breaking, started back growing, and became soft to touch, easy to style and healthy looking again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOWWWWWWWWWW, is all I can really say. I threw out all of those other products and I use a shampoo once every 6 weeks to remove buildup and all other shampoos are done with Hair One. I add a little to the hair after rinsing it out as a leave in and there you have it.... It really does not get it better than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can even use this and just let my hair \\&quot;air dry\\&quot; and have beautiful spiral curls with no effort... I love it.</li>
            <li> I have ordered before. Feels good. Hair and scalp feels more than clean with a great smell.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing has changed for me. Price reasonable.</li>
            <li> I use the Cucumber Aloe conditioning cleanser on my scalp, and the Dry Hair w/ olive oil for the \\&quot;conditioning\\&quot; step. Love the way this stuff makes my hair looks. Don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to traditional shampooing if I don&#x27;t absolutely have to. My hair looks shiny, strong, and thick. Have never seen my hair look this good before. Plus, my hair stays clean for 2-3 days... that never used to happen with shampoo. Always thought I had an oily scalp. Can&#x27;t compare it to Wen, have never tried it. I&#x27;m not tempted to either, because this price is so much more reasonable at about half the cost and produces amazing results. For those who mention a greasy appearance, it might be that 1. there&#x27;s a lack of thorough rinsing, or 2. the need to blow dry, brush, and style. I noticed my hair looking greasy (but not feeling greasy -- rather it felt \\&quot;piece-y\\&quot; as if too much hair gel was present) if I let it just air dry. But when I blow out my hair, it looks multitudes better than w/ traditional shampooing and conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got a sample pack of the jojoba version of Hair one, but didn&#x27;t like it as much. Not enough slip... like this version better!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of this product when I heard of it. I read all reviews the good and especially the bad, despite all that was said, negative and positive, I needed to try it for myself... which I think everyone should do...I&#x27;m African American and I am transitioning from relaxed to natural, so I&#x27;m looking for something that will work for me. When I got Hair one in the mail, I immediately tried it and loved it. It has a great smell, great menthol cooling sensation, it moisturizes, and makes your hair soft. I was able to comb through my wet thick hair while in the shower EFFORTLESSLY! I couldn&#x27;t do that with regular shampoo :-/ I love the menthol feeling, don&#x27;t worry it&#x27;s not very strong but if you don&#x27;t like that medicated feeling, this is not for you. The longer you leave it in the better it felt to me, and my hair came out super soft. I never tried the Wen, so I can&#x27;t compare. But I have done my research and they both have the same ingredients and have the same purpose. Hair one...a generic version yes, but does it do the trick, in my opinion, yes it does! Like I said you need to try it for yourself. What works for one may not work for another. I love it and will continue using it. Besides I&#x27;m frugal, 10-15 bucks sounds a lot better than 35-40 lmao :-) Happy Shopping!</li>
            <li> As good as WEN, much better price!!!!  I used WEN for about 6 months prior to trying this product and buck for buck this is a better value.  Shipping was pretty quick and they made sure to package each bottle so that they would not be damaged---Good job.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dry, course and thick hair. I have always...my entire life...had problems with finding a shampoo/conditioner that was moisturizing without weighing my hair down or making it look oily. So I just bought a bottle of Hair one with olive oil and tried it today for the first time....i followed the directions except i used half of the amount because I have shoulder length hair...omg my hair looks and feels amazing! It has a shine that I haven&#x27;t seen since I was a little girl and its super soft. I know not every product is made for everyone but this one is definitely for me!</li>
            <li> Worked great!  It added moisure to my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Tried this the first time and I love it ! I have so much new growth and it easily detangles my hair and it felt really conditioned.</li>
            <li> Waste of $$. VERY STRONG FRAGRANCE smell. Started having breathing problems. I didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;see that indicated on the website...sorry I bought it. Shipping BACK is too expensive. Ended up&lt;br /&gt;giving it away $28...</li>
            <li> The only think I liked about Hair One was the fact that I only had to apply and rinse one product. Aside from that, it pretty much did the opposite of everything I was hoping for. My roots were greasy, and the rest of my hair was dry and more tangled than usual. I have thick, long hair and I bought two trial sizes (you usually have to give something a try more than once), and only used one at a time so it&#x27;s possible that I just didn&#x27;t use enough. Because other reviewers mentioned having build-up, I made sure that I rinsed really well. I live in LA, and I have hard water and great water pressure, so I&#x27;m pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t build-up, I think that it just didn&#x27;t do a good job of cleaning my hair. The only difference I noticed from my regular shampoo and conditioner, was that my hair didn&#x27;t feel clean, even when it was wet, it was more tangled, and my roots were greasy. I really wanted it to work, but two tries was enough for me. I didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> I could not use this product.  So, not sure if it works like it promises.  I had allergic reactions to whatever is in it.</li>
            <li> I went into this hoping I&#x27;d found a great product people had reviewed mostly saying it worked well and when I used it... Different story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the smell is bad. Unless you are a fan of the smell of medicine, it&#x27;s gross. Honestly, I wanted to hold my breath.&lt;br /&gt;I did exactly what the directions said and I hoped for good results but when I rinsed, globs and globs of hair fell out. It was scary.&lt;br /&gt;When I got out of the shower my hair felt quite soft. So I thought things were headed for the best.&lt;br /&gt;I let my hair air-dry and it got frizzier and frizzier and my hair looked dry and felt like straw.&lt;br /&gt;I had to wash it again all over with my regular shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would not buy this product again, maybe for some people it would work but for me it was horrible.</li>
            <li> Love it!! And will continue to purchase and use this product! So much cheaper then wen and works just as good!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel silky, my hair never sheds anymore and I have color in it. This is my go to shampoo. I am African American and this makes my hair feel bouncey.</li>
            <li> I was a dedicated Wen user for several years (on the auto ship program and everything).  But when I saw this in Sally&#x27;s I had to give it a shot.  I do love Wen but I certainly don&#x27;t love the high price tag.  It did leave my color beautifully vibrant and once my scalp and hair got used to it, it performed perfectly.  Enter Hair One:  this was a disappointment.  It has too much menthol in it and it really irritated my scalp a bit.  The trick to using any cleansing conditioner is to use plenty of it.  It won&#x27;t work if you&#x27;re not saturating your hair.  The Hair One product didn&#x27;t work as well as Wen and I hated the menthol so I returned the bottle to Sally&#x27;s.  What I&#x27;ve discovered since then, through various message boards, is that VO5 Kiwi Lime conditioner is a fantastic dupe for Wen.  In fact, any cheap conditioner does the trick (a little fact I&#x27;m sure the folks at Wen don&#x27;t want you to know,lol).  Now even Pantene and Herbal Essences have CC that work well and the cost is minimal.  Hair One is fine for someone who likes the smell and feel of menthol on the scalp, but it&#x27;s certainly not for me.  I hated it.  Try VO5 or one of the mainstream brands.  Every hair care company is trying to get on the CC bandwagon.  The thing is, they all work pretty much the same way, so save your pennies and try a lesser priced brand.  It&#x27;s just a matter of preference which one someone likes.  The Pantene, for example, does make my scalp tingle quite a bit whereas the Herbal Essences does not (which I like better).  I&#x27;ve had trouble finding the VO5 in my town, but I&#x27;ll keep looking.  It really works the best for me.  Pass up Hair One, there are better options out there and for a lot less $$$.</li>
            <li> First of all-- please note that this review is for the Olive Oil formula.  Some of the reviews in this section refer to Tea Tree Oil or Argan oil.  This formula is olive-oil based.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product at the recommendation of the clerk at a Sally Beauty Supply store. I have been wasting my money for years trying to find a hair product that doesn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction.  I know for sure I am allergic to formaldehyde (and its cousin, Quaternium-15 which is often listed in so-called formaldehyde-free formulas). I can&#x27;t even use what is supposed to be the best anti-allergy shampoo,[[ASIN:B0006FMK98 Free &amp; Clear Shampoo for Sensitive Skin 12 fl oz (355 ml)]]. Anyway, the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shampoos didn&#x27;t work any better for me than the chemical ones and in desperation I tried a sample packet of this.  What a difference-- my normally dry, frizzy, red-but-turning-grey hair was actually manageable and soft.  I didn&#x27;t experience the itching, irritation, headaches, burning lips or other symptoms that other shampoos cause.  My head felt fine after using this.  Well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, yes, as others report, it is a little time-consuming to use.  I didn&#x27;t use it in the shower; I washed my hair in the sink so that I could just stick a towel around my wet head while it did its magic for 5 minutes.  I took a shower at the end to wash it all out. That makes more sense than letting the shower water run the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because I&#x27;m waiting to see if problems develop after I use it several times.  Will come back and report-- and change the stars as needed.</li>
            <li> This product is my new favorite!  I purchased it as an alternative to Wen products, and I have not been disappointed so far.  I have heard so many positives to cleansing conditioners, and I was sold at soft silky hair that would not need to be trimmed as often.  I am African-American with an oily scalp and dry ends, and this product effectively cleans my scalp without stripping it, and moisturizes my ends.  I LOVE that you can also use the product as a leave-in; AND I also use it as a deep treatment by applying and sitting under a hood dryer for 20 minutes.  It is fabulous!  I am definitely purchasing another bottle!</li>
            <li> It makes your hair less dry but it doesn&#x27;t clean your hair and scalp very good, you have to wash hair every day.</li>
            <li> its best if you have really dry hair and thick hair / ethnic,  hair that needs more oils than normal hair would to look sleek / not frizzy. you can use it as a leave-in conditioner and style like usual.</li>
            <li> Hair one is just like Wen, but at a 1/3 of the price.  I have two curly girls (who cowash) and we love this line.  You should definitely try if you are a curly girl!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a curly girl but I use the tea tree oil for itchy scalp.  It is lighter weight and perfect for my wavy hair.  Give up suds-ing shampoos and try Hair One!!!!!</li>
            <li> My son has the curliest hair. This tames his hair frizzies so good!</li>
            <li> I am a product junkie and have spent many years finding the right combo of products for my hair.  I have shoulder length, naturally curly (frizzy), very dry color treated hair.  I also have psoriasis on my scalp which can react badly to products.&lt;br /&gt;My normal hair care consists of a double wash and condition with an ultra moisture shampoo and conditioner (various brands).  I normally use a LOT of conditioner, use my fingers to pull it through and leave it on for the duration of my shower, then rinse it out very well.  This is then followed by a combo of extra strength frizz ease and straight &amp; shine frizz serum.  I then blow dry and straighten my hair.  This combo works great if I keep my hair washing to a 3 x per week max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was drying out because I had to wash too frequently due to my sweaty workouts, so was looking for something better.  I picked this up at my local Sally&#x27;s to try.  I didn&#x27;t find the amount of product used excessive(10 pumps is about a golf ball size and I use about 3X that amount in conditioner alone anyways).  I also found it shortened my time dealing with my hair in the shower.  (normally wash twice, scrubbing my scalp anyways, followed by conditioner that I have to work \\&quot;finger combing\\&quot; through my hair anyways).  With this you put it in, scrub as normal, then add more, \\&quot;finger comb\\&quot; it through and then just leave it in while you continue your shower.  So the time frame was shorter for me.  I use two pumps as a leave in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have to use any serums and the results were identical.  So in the long run, it will save me from purchasing 3 other products (shampoo and the two serums).  Had I have found this before I figured the right combo of products I would be raving about how awesome it is.  However, because I found the right stuff for my hair (after years) I don&#x27;t notice a difference in the shine or texture.  It&#x27;s amazing that one product can do what it normally takes 4 to manage though!  I would recommend it to people who are using multiple products to achieve manageable hair and anyone with unmanageable hair.  If you want to buy the sample packs to try, you probably need two to get enough product to see a difference unless you have very short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice the the \\&quot;menthol\\&quot; effect was a little intense at the nape (not uncomfortable or anything though).  But I have psoriasis which makes my scalp more sensitive to things like that anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update the review if I notice any changes after long term use.who are using multiple products to achieve manageable hair and anyone with unmanageable hair.

            <li> Well, I opened the box to a mess. The bottle leaked all over the inside of the box. This should have been packaged better. We&#x27;ll see if it helps my hair, otherwise I won&#x27;t be ordering from Cosmetic Solutions again.</li>
            <li> I gave this product two stars instead of one because it did make my scalp tingle.  However, it left my hair limp and lifeless.  It did not in any way detangle.  My hair did not feel soft.  It felt oily.  The worst part is that I used the entire bottle in less than a week.  My hair is about shoulder-length.  I went back to using Dove conditioner and L&#x27;Oriel sulfate-free shampoo.  My hair is feeling very soft now.</li>
            <li> Works really well on my 4a-4c hair. Makes my hair easy to detangle after washing and it  makes my hair nice and soft after it air dries.</li>
            <li> I really like how it makes my hair feel and it thickens my hair.  I also like how it doesnt leave that weird residue feeling that shampoo does. It even makes my scalp feel better. I would recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as Wen for 1/3 the price. I like the herby smell and tingle! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love how this made my hair and scalp fell and it smells great too. I will buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> Got it today and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. Not crazy about the scent. It&#x27;s sort of a faint herbally/ medical scent. It&#x27;s not so heavy that it&#x27;ll stick around in my hair, I don&#x27;t think, but it was a little disconcerting at first. It feels odd using so much product. The product was very thick and luxurious feeling. It felt nice in my hands and hair. Rinsing it out took a little while. I didn&#x27;t use it as a leave in as my hair is thin and long and usually leave in is too much. Turns out it&#x27;s pretty good! My hair is very soft, tangle free, has body and movement and it&#x27;s brighter than before. I did notice a bit of a static cling issue brushing it when it dried fully. I&#x27;m going to see how long I can go between washes with this stuff ( firstly because you have to use so much, and because I normally have to wash my hair every other day for all of the oil in my roots, which I attribute to washing it too much- vicious cycle). I&#x27;ll edit this post after a few weeks of use and let you know if I still like it.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to try Wen but never have. After researching similar products and reading reviews I decided to try this product. I have thick dry hair that is shoulder length. I applied 2-3 palm size amounts to my hair, massaged it in thoroughly, and let it sit for over an hour before washing it out. My hair had shine and body after I blow dried it. I don&#x27;t like to use a lot of product on my hair. With this product not very much product is needed.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and tangle free! great alternative to Wen and other sulfate-free cleaners.The only thing that surprised me was the texture of the product I was expecting a clear gel but instead it has a thick white foam consistency.</li>
            <li> I use this as a conditioner instead of shampoo for when I&#x27;m finished with my hair.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both Wen and Hair one. Wirh Hair One you get the same result at a cheaper price. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am having considerably less hair fall since switching to this Wen knockoff. I dye my thin baby fine hair and am on lots of meds. I like the product tingle and my hair is staying on my head - which is a relief.</li>
            <li> If you have Caucasian (or Indian, in my case) hair, this product will probably make your hair greasy. I cowash frequently with regular conditioner and I thought I&#x27;d try out a product specifically for cowashing. This stuff just made my scalp greasy and my and my ends dry. I&#x27;m going back to regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the way this worked on my hair. It made it feel greasy and I did not like the smell. It was not my wen</li>
            <li> I have only used this product twice and my hair is super shine, and soft as silk. I bought this product as an alternative to buying the more expensive Wen, and I think I&#x27;m already in love. Found that the dry hair formula maybe too oily for my hair so I just ordered my second bottle of normal formula, stay tuned....</li>
            <li> My hair has never been so manageable with so little effort and so few products.  Now all I use is Hair One and a detangler.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the switch.</li>
            <li> I have used this about 3 times so far.  Seems weird to not put a conditioner in my hair.  I do think it feels a little greasy but my hair does look and feel healthier and shiner,  No frizz.  Other reviews said that the greasy feeling goes away after a few uses so we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of your hair looking like straw or feeling like steel wool, you need hair one. It&#x27;s comparable to Wen, but is much much much cheaper. I&#x27;ve only used it twice after finding it at Sally&#x27;s Beauty for $9.99, and I&#x27;m already in love. My hair is soft and bouncy and my curls are actually curling instead of frizzing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES, I have curly hair, and I LOVE this. My hair has never felt so soft or light. I say light because there is no buildup with this product. I didn&#x27;t even have to use gel! I washed my hair with this, put in some infusium 23 leave-in for a detangler, combed, and let air dry, and my hair is GORGEOUS. Sorry for all the caps locking, but I am so in love with my hair right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say though, if you don&#x27;t follow the directions, you will be disappointed. You have to get enough of it onto your hair so it can do its job. And don&#x27;t be shy if you have oily hair--I have very oily roots and very dry ends, but it still works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And let me tell you a story about how tough this cleaner is--last week, when it was in the 90s where I live, I had to work for two days in a metal box with a broken air conditioner. Talk about miserable! And I didn&#x27;t wash my hair in between shifts because I was just too tired. So you can imagine how wary I was about using this conditioner to clean up that mess. But it did! My hair was soft and shiny and completely clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use one pump for leave-in conditioner the first time I used it, and it was a bit heavy and weighed my hair down. But that was solved by using the lighter infusium leave-in. Keep in mind: if you don&#x27;t get it right the first time, there&#x27;s always next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stop gushing now, but don&#x27;t be afraid to try this, even if you don&#x27;t get it on Amazon. Sally&#x27;s (who make it) has a great return policy, so you have nothing to lose except nasty hair and frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT!!! I have tried this, and LOVED it. However, if you&#x27;re down to $5, a $10 bottle of Hair One is still too much (especially considering how much you have to use). But if you just take a second and compare the ingredients in Hair One with the ingredients of a $2 bottle of conditioner from the grocery store, I think you&#x27;ll be surprised at how similar they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s because Hair One uses cetyl alcohol to clean your hair. But cheap Suave conditioner has cetyl alcohol too! I tried washing my hair with Suave Rosemary Mint conditioner one day after I ran out of my Hair One. My hair was a mess and I had sworn that I was NEVER going back to shampoo. I saw Suave conditioner on sale for $1.67 at Kroger. Looking at the label, I noticed that it has many of the same ingredients as Hair One, and decided to give it a shot (I also think it smells better than Wen or Hair One, personally). I was amazed! My hair was just as clean, shiny, and bouncy as with Hair One, but for a tenth of the price (and a thirtieth of the price of Wen)! Suave Rosemary Mint conditioner all the way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pleased with the results I had when I bought this one thinking it would be best for my bi-racial daughter&#x27;s curly hair.  It just weighed her hair down and didn&#x27;t hold her curls at all. The Tea Tree Cleansing Conditioner did much better with her hair.  One size does not fit all in this case.</li>
            <li> Like many of you I saw the \\&quot;wonderful WEN\\&quot; infomercials and really wanted to try it out but the cost was a major factor in making me rethink my desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my research to find if it could be purchased at a lower price or if there were similar products out there I came across Hair One, most of the reviews were very similar to what I was reading on WEN but with major highlights being much lower cost, easier accessibility (no shipping) and no hassle trying to navigate the WEN site if I wanted to change the product to be delivered or cancel \\&quot;membership\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I needed to wash my hair today I thought why not, Sally&#x27;s is around the block I can hop over buy it, be back easily and $10-$11 for the bottle was worth it if this lives up to its hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have nearly waist length fine but thick hair that I keep died red (very difficult color to maintain) and because I live in the desert I get even drier here in the summer than I normally am (lol).  Today I picked up the Dry Hair formula and the Color Treated formula figuring I would either alternate or combine them depending on the results and if I liked the product(s) after using them a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chose to use the Dry Hair formula, went through the steps of rinsing, working into scalp and then through the length.  Left it on longer than the recommended time as everything indicates the longer its left in the better the results.  One step that I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll repeat is the \\&quot;combing\\&quot; through, WOW was there pulling (yes worked my way from the bottom up) and did a lot of hair come out.  (I am used to combing through with my traditional conditioner so I didn&#x27;t think any of this initially.) It rinsed out REALLY FAST (this may be due to the extremely hard water we have here) and my hair had the stripped feeling it would if I&#x27;d used a clarifying shampoo on it from roots out and then no conditioner (was getting concerned at this time but figured I would finish the process out) and three pumpsworked through as leave-in conditioner before wrapping it up in my turban.  Also even though everyone talked about having no color loss there was a TON of red pouring out of my hair and down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tingly feeling of it being on my scalp was a nice feeling but the scent is very strange.  I&#x27;m not sure how to even describe it other than they figured out how to distill the smell that you get when you walk into a health/herbal/supplement store; again very strange and I&#x27;m hoping it dissipates as everyone else has mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took my hair out of my turban and had my fingers crossed for the comb out before styling.  Holy Moses!!!! It combed out as if I had put all my other leave-ins, serums and restorative masks on it.  I am amazed!! I desperately want to blow dry it and see what my color looks like but its 105+ here and I just can&#x27;t handle the thought of a hair drier right now.  Partially damp and I can still keep running my fingers through my hair without it snagging or snarling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;ll be going out with the hubby soon and the heat outside will finish drying my hair and I&#x27;ll have to update this for the end results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, if I have the same manageability and texture results from the Color formula as the Dry Hair formula I may have very well found the hair regime to stick with and convert a few people too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/9/11&lt;br /&gt;Its been two weeks since I started with Hair One.  I can definitely say that I&#x27;m converted to using this system.  Even my husband has noticed the change in my hair, to quote him \\&quot;your hair was stiff and prickly before now its really soft.\\&quot;  This from the man who doesn&#x27;t notice when the color/shade changes or when I get a hair cut LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first week I did go through a bit of the \\&quot;oily\\&quot; stage that people talk about but I persisted through that to see if it would resolve itself, it has.  I can go three to four days between washing my hair.  And my color isn&#x27;t NEARLY as faded as it would normally be this many weeks after coloring it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m trying to get my sister to try it on hers.  She bleaches her hair to WHITE so its very damaged.  I&#x27;m hoping between Hair One and hounding her to not have white hair that she will have the hair back that she really wants (long and full).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add also that my hair feels even better after I blow dry it than when it air dries which is so weird and opposite of what I&#x27;m used to.  Hope to have the results and success continue.</li>
            <li> This is a decent shampoo/cleanser.  I did buy it to see if the performance was anything like WEN.  It&#x27;s okay, 1/3 of the price of WEN, so there has to be a trade off.  It says you are supposed to use a lot, my husband has short hair, so not sure he uses as much as he is supposed to, but seems to do okay.  I can notice it most often if his dandruff comes back, because he has a dry scalp.  It must be working at least pretty well.  It doesn&#x27;t address dandruff as something it does, but found with WEN the extra moisture was enough to take care of it.  This seems to be working also.  I plan to try some of the other products on Amazon that are WEN-like and see what works best.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I have recommended it to all my friends</li>
            <li> I have been using HAIR ONE for about 2 years now. I like it very much. It cleanses very well and leaves the hair nice and soft. Sometimes I do need a leave in conditioner or oil.</li>
            <li> This product gives your hair a no significant different feeling then the Wen Cleansing Conditioner but lets face it we need the deep conditioning that the Wen Re Moist Mask Intensive Hair Treatment gives. If you only used the Wen Cleansing Conditioner then the only difference is your pocket book because this is a lot cheaper. I buy this and the Wen Re Moist Mask until someone makes a generic version of that too.</li>
            <li> This is not even close to comparable with WEN</li>
            <li> This product has a learning curve. I have very short(3in) and EXTREMELY thick hair. The directions of all the pumps...that was too much for my length of hair. I did a deep condition (let it sit on for an hr) and let me tell you my hair LOVED IT! But with my hair type it loves any kind of moisture my hair is coarse and doesn&#x27;t like to do anything but once the conditioner was soaked in ALL my spirals came to life. It looked fantastic. I love this product but use less pumps once you re-wet your hair then it&#x27;s able to \\&quot;lather\\&quot; slightly and you can cleanse your scalp better. I think those that used it and are complaining of the greasiness are using the wrong type for their hair and also using too much product for their hair. Do NOT use as many pumps as they tell you. Also your scalp does tingle this product has menthol in it. If it doesn&#x27;t you&#x27;re not getting the product on your scalp or you&#x27;re not letting it sit on long enough, after 3 minutes my scalp was tingling. Anyway I like it, my hair loved it but you got to play with it a bit before you get the full benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:06/28/2013... I have longer hair now about 8 inches in length. My hair still loves this product. It brings definition to my spirals. There&#x27;s no breakage just clean healthy hair. My hair is always shiny and full of life. I get alot of compliments.</li>
            <li> this  is a good product</li>
            <li> Great product. A gentle cleanse great for colored hair. Hair is left soft silky and clean. I love how it doesn&#x27;t wash out my color. It&#x27;s great for a dry itchy scalp!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I hate it, but I will definitely not buy again. It is not bad for my hair, but it&#x27;s not great, either. It is hard to clean since it&#x27;s not foamy at all and it doesn&#x27;t reach all strands so it&#x27;s a little struggle. I still have to use lots of leave in after using this product. My hair is very fine and I have lots of highlights, which made my hair pretty dry, but manageable. It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just not great, either. I will try something else...</li>
            <li> No. it did not work for me, but if you have fine hair, it will work wonders. The only thing it did was make my hair smell good and detangle it. If you have long, dry, frizzy, thick, and unmanageable hair like I do, don&#x27;t spend your money.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Im so glad I found it. It makes my hair soft and healthy. My hair was damaged from dying it so much, the ends were so brittle, then I started using this and I noticed a change within 2 days! Works wonders!</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s what you like, or what works best for you, but I didn&#x27;t see the &amp;#34;rave&amp;#34; over this product. It didn&#x27;t seem any better to me than the co-wash products that you can buy at a local store. I don&#x27;t see any need to purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair silky and clean.  The price is awesome.  Not sure about the strange instructions, but I use it like any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have medium length thick, coarse, color treated, dry hair. I&#x27;ve been looking for something that will clean my hair but leave it manageable. If I use the wrong shampoo I have what looks similar to a dried out lion mane. I found and used Joico for a long time because it worked the best... that is... until I found this stuff. Wow, for a fraction of the cost and it works better! I&#x27;m totally hooked on this hair one! If I can ever afford it, I&#x27;ll try the Wen, but until then this is a God sent! Even my husband says that he notices a big difference with the lack of frizz and he&#x27;s not that observant so that says a lot! Get it! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually pretty good, but with every shampoo or conditioner, it works better after you use that shampoo to remove residual, like neutrogena.</li>
            <li> After having 2 babies very close together, my usually silky fine, never frizzy hair was left perpetually frizzed and dried out.  I tried argon oil, mousses, gels, defrizz shampoos.....I cringe at the money spent... Finally tried this.  I use it 2-3 times a week and it has done wonders.  I still get frizzies on hot humid days, but it is pretty minimal, and with the argon oil, not that noticable.  Would definitely recommend the to anyone with dry frizzy hair...especially those of you looking for a fix that doesn&#x27;t include taking the time to use a straight iron!</li>
            <li> Prefer the jojoba version.  This one left my hair feeling greasy and limp. Might work for you if you have dry hair.  I have color treated hair but this one was not what I needed.</li>
            <li> I am updating this review since I discovered Lanza Trauma Treatment.  It&#x27;s the only thing that worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;So many women review hair product without stating what type of hair they have, whether they color it and what kind of heat damage they do to it.  I am a middle-aged, caucasian female with some gray hair (not sure how much b/c I color it).  I use Garnier hair color regularly, shampoo &amp; blow dry every other day and flat iron every day.  Before I had gray hair, my hair was straight, thick and coarse.  With the gray, it&#x27;s wavy, more coarse and still thick.  I live in Colorado, so I also fight the super dry climate.  I have been trying various sulfate-free shampoos and mega conditioners.  I saw reviews of this product as similar to Wen.  I have never used Wen.  However, when I used Hair One, it made my scalp feel good, but when I could not \\&quot;easily\\&quot; run my fingers through my hair.  I had to get a large-tooth comb and comb it through my hair.  It was semi-moisturizing.  I left it in for a minute or 2 and rinsed it.  When I rinsed, my hair felt very dry like I could not run my fingers through it.  I put a few more pumps as a leave-in like it said on the directions.  I dried it and the ends looked very frizzy and dry.  This did not perform any better than Ion Keratin Shampoo &amp; Smoothing Masque.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I use Lanza Trauma Treatment which is a leave-in conditioner, any shampoo and conditioner I use are fine. It has completely repaired my hair and changed it from coarse, dry and unruly to silky and manageable.  I hardly have to use a flat iron at all anymore.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to try WEN, but it was so expensive, when I found Hair One I was thrilled.  The first couple times I used it, I followed the directions exactly, but even though I have dry, curly hair, leaving the shampoo in as a leave-in conditioner was too much for hair.  I have since found my own way to use it, I use it like normal shampoo, leave it on while I finish everything else in the shower and then rinse.  I don&#x27;t put any extra in and continue to use my old mousse to style my hair.  It is a perfect combination for me, my hair looks and smells great, I have less frizz and my curls are much more defined, but it is not weighted down.  You just have to find what is right for your hair.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the Wen product, but it caused my scalp, neck and shoulders to break out.&lt;br /&gt;This product does NOT cause break outs on my scalp, neck and shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;This is quite similar but not exactly the same--but I still love how it effects the appearance of my hair makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I received this product today and was super excited to use it. My issue with my hair is dryness. I am biracial (white/black) and I have super curly hair that I have relaxed almost all my life until recently when I finally accepted my curls and tried to live without the relaxer. The only reason I relaxed my hair is because of how curly my hair is not because I like straight hair. But I believe after all the years I have relaxed my hair its done a lot of damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyways, I usually use Mixed chicks on my hair which I love, but there is nothing in their line that works for when I use the flat iron on my hair. I usually have a few different problems when I wear my hair straight versus curly. If its clean its to frizzy feeling and can&#x27;t be controlled with the flat iron. And also how dry the ends feel when I flat iron. I trim my ends all the time but its just something that happens regardless. I use product on my hair (balms,gloss etc) to protect and manage the hair when I am flat ironing it, but I never feel like my hair isn&#x27;t dry no matter what I do. The only time it doesn&#x27;t look dry one way or another is when its wet and slathered in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I give this product a 3 star, probably because I was expecting more. Maybe next time it will go higher when I use it but I wasn&#x27;t blown away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used it I was impressed, but when I got out of the shower it was a bit strange. My hair felt shorter and tighter in the curls then usual--no matter, I used two pumps as a leave in and wrapped my head in a towel. I stayed that way for a few hours and I must say when I touched parts of my hair and messed with it, it was super soft and that&#x27;s a plus. There was no frizzy feeling to it so I do think it added moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I decided to flat iron my hair I simply dried it and then used the iron. Its lighter and shinier, I trimmed the ends that were STILL dry. I understand its not going to fix damaged ends, that&#x27;s why I cut them myself. The healthy hair did great,my only issue is my hair is so super curly I think I need more to combat the iron when it comes to straightening my hair out. Just this as a leave in isn&#x27;t enough for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will for sure continue to use this because I do like it a lot. I like the 3 in 1 functionality of it. I like the way it feels and the smell isn&#x27;t bad. (And I am pregnant, so if I think its fine I don&#x27;t think its that horrid.)I think the next time I use it I may do a few things different and see even better results. Its cheap, its one product versus several and its sulfate free which is a must for people with hair like mine. Anyone searching for something to help with dryness give it a try, my hair for sure look healthier and I am confident will do even better the next time I use it!e healthy hair did great,my only issue is my hair is so super curly I think I need more to combat the iron when it comes to straightening my hair out.

            <li> Ok, so we&#x27;ve all watched the Wen infomercials. I am very skeptical about anything sold on tv after midnight. (heck, i did buy P-90x and got fabulous results). I went to Sally&#x27;s knowing that they had a Wen knock off. I knew it wouldn&#x27;t be the same, but I figured It would give me an idea of how it worked. I actually liked this! I liked it enough to invest in the higher quality one. I love the Wen Fig due to my damaged hair. Wen has made my hair healthy and gorgeous and I even use it on clients at the salon. I can&#x27;t sell it to them unfortunately, but they love the way their hair feels after I finish them. I suggest Wen to them and this Hair One version. This is a great alternative, and worth the money. Ren&#x27;s is actually just as good and a few dollars cheaper than this. You can get this at Sally&#x27;s for a dollar or two cheaper, Ren you can get at Rite Aide for 9.99. Hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;Licensed Beauty Pro</li>
            <li> My daughter works at Sally Beauty.  One day, we were watching tv and the Wen infommercial came on.  I said how I&#x27;d like to try it, but I was not about to get involved with Guthy-Renker and I thought it cost too much.  She said, \\&quot;Mom, we have a version of our own\\&quot;.  I stopped by and bought a couple of samples of the Almond Mint.  It was ok.  Not enthused enough about it to buy a full bottle.  The other day I was in and they had the Olive Oil formula samples by the register.  I bought a couple and used one the next day.  I don&#x27;t remember my hair being this soft, this shiny and this manageable.  I am 49 years old, I have thin but thick color-treated hair.  I followed the directions exactly.  I used an ion blow-dryer to dry my hair with a vented brush and then I flat-ironed without any additional product.  I used it again this morning.  Even the men in my office have been asking me what I&#x27;ve done to my hair!</li>
            <li> After reading all the data on sulfates and the harsh chemicals normal shampoos contain, I decided to switch to natural products. My relaxed/african-american hair gets extremely dry and breaks off easily. I ALWAYS have split ends and end up cutting them, so my hair is tough to grow out. I read several reviews on Hair One and bought it at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply to try it. The first time, I followed the instructions, saturated my hair on the product, combed it through, and rinsed very well. I let it air dry and used a flat iron the next morning using very little leave-in conditioner and nothing else. It was really soft, but a bit dry at the ends, so I added a little moisterizer and that worked. It styled easily, felt and looked very nice. The three following times I used Hair One, my hair was extremely dry, had no luster and felt brittle. Everyone&#x27;s hair may respond differently to this product, so it is worth a try, HOWEVER- for chemically treated hair that is prone to drying out, such as relaxed or color- you WILL need another moisterizing product. Hair One definitely cleanses and leaves hair soft, but it is not enough moisture for my hair type. I suggest trying it and add a post-wash moisterizer for best results.</li>
            <li> This product did NOT work for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my situation: I have long, thin blonde hair. It tends to be very dry and stringy, and is extremely straight. The water here is hard, so we have a water softener. Not sure if that changed something chemically in the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions to a tee. The result? Very soft and silky wet hair, very gross and greasy looking dry hair. When it dried, my hair looked like it does if I avoid washing it for three days. It was dark and dull, with frizz and zero body. It&#x27;s probably the worst brand of shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried, which is really unfortunate because I got sucked into those Wen infomercials and was really hoping this product would be close to it since it&#x27;s so much more affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might work for other hair types, did not work for mine.</li>
            <li> love this product. I stated using when a few years ago and it made my hair so soft and bouncy but it was also so expensive so i brought this product hoping for a cheaper replacement and i was impressed same quality and does wonders for my hair for a fraction of the price, but i do prefer the wen fragrance. i would definitely recommend this product for a wen by chaz dean replacement.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for WEN type products, look no further than this.  I use it when I&#x27;m on dive trips and find that my hair doesn&#x27;t get all straw-like from the constant salt exposure when I use Hair One each day.  I can see how it might be too much for regular daily use unless you have very dry hair, but if you do, give it a try!</li>
            <li> I bought this about 6 months ago.  I&#x27;m a bit of a pj, so I used it a bit then put it to the side.  It made my scalp itch so I used it as a leave in.  FF and I&#x27;ve been hearing all these great things about WEN and planned on buying it.  Then I decided to pull out my Hair One just to see if I would like WEN.  This time I used as directed.  I&#x27;m relaxed and colored so my hair gets super dry.  I went through all the steps and my hair felt sooooooo good.  I hate the whole million pump thing, but it&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;m going to stick with Hair One because it works for me and I&#x27;m on a budget and I really cannot afford WEN.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen for a couple years. Wanted to try something much cheaper and I&#x27;m very happy I did. This product works just as good. I will purchase again. I canceled our wen deliveries!</li>
            <li> Love what this product has done for my hair. I am now a hair one girl. Just would love to find this in larger bottles.</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok...but not what I wanted....so I cut my firetrap hair off and I&#x27;m starting over! LOL!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try Wen for a while now, but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend $30. I saw a lot of reviews for Hair One. And decided to give it a go, I&#x27;m so happy that I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I relax every six months and sometimes my new growth can be difficult to detangle. But, this product not only allowed me to detangle, but I was able to comb from root to tip with a wide tooth comb, and that never happens, even with super slippery conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint that I have is the smell. It had a medicated smell, like the medicated chapstick. I&#x27;m not a fan of it, but it works so well I&#x27;m will to look past that.</li>
            <li> I like it but I don&#x27;t agree with the instructions. It tells you to add SO MANY pumps and you really should t because this is some pretty thick and heavy stuff! A little goes a LONG way!! Of course, it&#x27;s goi g to largely depend on the length of your hair but u be the judge. Go easy on your pumps and add some water to your hair and lather it and see if u need more after that. Don&#x27;t be a die hard direction follower on this one or u will have some heavily greased hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try wen but it&#x27;s too expensive, so I found this \\&quot;knock off\\&quot; product called hair one, that everyone talked about. I got the little 99 cent packet for dry hair, and I was so excited to use it in the shower. I used it and 1 minute after I put it on my hair, my hair felt horrible. It felt stripped of moisture, I couldn&#x27;t even comb through it! I regretted even trying it. I will never get this again, and the smell isn&#x27;t great. I&#x27;m definitely going to try wen and compare.</li>
            <li> Ok Product works ok but difficult to rinse out of hair .  Leave tub/ shower with a light film.  Shampoo w/ out harm toxins work better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got really intense dyed red hair and I like to use this as my primary shampoo/conditioner. It seems to be really mild on my color and I love that. The only thing is you have to use a ridiculous amount of product. With your roots, crown and ends you end up using like 25-30 pumps per wash. If you&#x27;re worried about having so much product in your hair you can use this as a leave in conditioner only and still use your normal shampoo and conditioner routine. I&#x27;ve tried using it both ways and both ways work really great for my hair I just hate using so much product. It gave my hair a lot of moisture and limited frizz which is excellent because I have very curly hair and live in an area with tons of humidity.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hair One for three years. I started using it when I wanted to stop putting chemicals in my hair. I use it as a shampoo, it will not lather, and after cleaning as conditioner. I apply some to the ends and work it through. I also use extra on the ends as I flat iron. My hair texture has changed greatly, because I am not stripping all the oils out. Besides growing and keeping the length. No petroleum based products do I use. Just a little olive oil for shine.</li>
            <li> I have used WEN for years and now with the bad economy I needed to find a cheaper version. I was very pleasantly surprised!  It made my hair even have more body than WEN and at half the price!!</li>
            <li> When I used this it made my hair very soft... But also very limp and then oily... But when someone I know who had thicker more coarse hair used it... It was wonderful for them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was running out of WEN and needed a less expensive alternative because I started to love cowashing. My hair is dry especially on the ends so I thought the Olive Oil would be fantastic. However this was not the case. It&#x27;s definitely not as nourishing as WEN. This left my hair drier than when I was using Shampoo. I couldn&#x27;t even imagine if I didn&#x27;t get the Dry Hair version of Hair One! If you&#x27;re looking for a reasonably priced cleansing conditioner, I think you can find a better one than this.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that goes a few inches past my shoulders and it&#x27;s a little bit damaged from straightening it. This product, after following the instructions and letting my hair dry, made my hair look great after straightening it and my waves were smooth and cute...but the next day my hair would look greasy and nasty. I stopped following the directions (which required me to use a lot of it) and only used it once a week and my hair is still pretty greasy from it. My mom who has thinner and nicer hair got really good results from it. Maybe I&#x27;ll go ahead and try the one for normal hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick lomg blonde straw hair; this productly didnt work well for me at all.  I had to shampoo and rinse tbis outta my hair the morning after using it because it was so greasy.  Maybe it works well for other hair types, but not for mine.</li>
            <li> I found it very difficult to diet angle my hair after using this product. Definitely not for everyone!&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase ever again</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty damaged and so I have been searching for something to help alleviate the dryness.  For me, this product didn&#x27;t do what I was looking for.  I tried it a few times and it made my scalp very itchy and left my hair full of tangles.  Perhaps this will work better for someone without a sensitive scalp and who has healthier hair.</li>
            <li> well i am asian ant my hair was super super dry, color treated and heat damaged i have used almost every product in market to make my hair smooth and silky. nothing happened really some how by online search i heard about hair one . i am not gonna say that its a miracle i will say that its one of the best product i have ever use , my hair is really thick so i have to use a whole lot and i have to keep it for 15 min in my hair but it just depend on ur hair type , my hair after first use was not dry and with the regular use now they look amazing . i am not ever using a shampoo and not going back to any of my old products. i am a happy hair one user.</li>
            <li> Hair One olive oil for dry hair has a better smell than the almond mint one labeled for all hair types.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this product from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supplies for a while now and it is amazing.  Leaves my hair soft and I have much less hair loss than when using shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing like Wen. I was really, really looking forward to trying it, after reading some of the great reviews. So believe me, the pump was primed; I was inclined to like this product from the get-go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as one other reviewer described, as I started working this into my scalp, I could actually feel my hair starting to tangle. Yes, it was creating tangles as I worked it into my hair. Horrifying!! However, I kept up the faith and kept going, leaving it in for at least 7 minutes, while continuing to add more and more of the stuff, before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things didn&#x27;t get much better when I rinsed it out. My hair felt sticky and tangly, as if I&#x27;d just gone swimming in the ocean. Running a wide-tooth comb through it was unpleasant, to say the least. I couldn&#x27;t stand leaving my hair like this, so I put some Infusium in it to smooth things out. Blow dried it, and it still felt \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; and not at all bouncy. Tried rubbing some in the ends as \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot; conditioner as the bottle sugggests, and things only got worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall my hair was left feeling \\&quot;hard\\&quot; and sticky and not remotely shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I have bleached out, highlighted (half) Asian hair that gets soft and shiny with (overpriced, impossible to buy) Wen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the love of God, can&#x27;t ANYone create a decent Wen knock off for those of us who don&#x27;t make 6 figures???</li>
            <li> Wow! Wow worth every cent. This is so close to being like Wen its Crazy! I have natural hair and I have used many,many products. Hair one is the  best for cleansing I have ever used with out breaking the bank. if your looking for well cleansed hair and it feeling great after a rinse this is It! I leave a little of the product in my hair after cleaning and it mixes well with my other oils I use for my hair. Keep up the great mix Hair One. Love It!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavey, coarse hair that is pretty dry from coloring. It made my hair feel like I hadn&#x27; t conditioned it at all (and I used a sulfate free condtioner after the shampoo).  My hair was much more tangled and knotted up, it felt very dry and had no shine. As far as body, a lot of fluff (the kind I try to get rid of). So it&#x27;s back to silicones and build up for me, it&#x27;s MUCH more managable, soft and shinney that way.</li>
            <li> Great as a shampoo and leave in conditioner. Reasonably priced and great shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Will order another as soon as this is close to empty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Hair One for years and decided to buy here on Amazon out of convenience.  When I received the shampoo the label on the bottle looked different.  OK, maybe an updated label but then I used it....umm yeah!  The color of the shampoo, the texture and everything is just different even down to the smell. My hair feels like soap was used.  So maybe it&#x27;s me but not so fast.  My wife pulled me to the side and said, &amp;#34;This stuff is not Hair One...I&#x27;m certain&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I question the authenticity of this seller and the product.  I will not buy here again and I am filling a claim with Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great WEN knock off, same ingred and better price.</li>
            <li> My hair was fried to the point where it was breaking off I have used hair one with olive oil and Teflon anti snap as a leave in and my hair is so soft! I love this!</li>
