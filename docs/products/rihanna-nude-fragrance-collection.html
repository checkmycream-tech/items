            <li>Fragrance smells good and the bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li>It came before the it was expected to be delivered and that made me very happy!</li>
            <li>but everything was right!!</li>
            <li>Great price for a big bottle</li>
            <li>Price was right and love the perfume</li>
            <li>Normally fragrances smooth out into a nice sultry aroma</li>
            <li>Prefer her first fragrance better.</li>
            <li>The bottle I purchased at Macy&#x27;s for $20.00 more, the smell lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>I received the smaller version as a gift for my birrhday in September of 2013 and loved it.</li>
            <li>I like clean, fruity and light and this perfume certainly delivers that.</li>
            <li>I received my order very fast!</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>The bottle looks pretty cool also.</li>
            <li>Love this soft scent.  </li>
            <li>but this one really makes itself known, which is not necessarily a bad thing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited about my new perfume.</li>
            <li>but my neighbor has a perfume that smell exactly like nude</li>
            <li>Just like it was at the store not a fake.</li>
            <li>Found a sample in a magazine a year or two ago and finally decided to buy it :)</li>
            <li>Thank you for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I give her it as one of present, her favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>My husband also is very picky about scents and loves when I where this one.</li>
            <li>Its is also very affordable.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t put my finger on it, but it didn&#x27;t seem like the real thing.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t care for the smell</li>
            <li>As it wore off, not so much.</li>
            <li>Got it for a gift and person really like the smell</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I suggest this to someone who likes a light, clean smell rather than a heavy, in-your-face smell.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume, it has a sweet soft smell that I can use everyday without it being overpowering.</li>
            <li>Softer than the other two but still love</li>
            <li>The One when I ran out, and while I enjoy the sweet smell, it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Rihanna&#x27;s Rebel Fleur however, the Nude did not live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>smell good not a 5 star bec not strong enough</li>
            <li>It has become my new favorite everyday</li>
            <li>I have all three of Rihanna&#x27;s fragrances, and this one is definitely sweeter and more lighter than the other two.</li>
            <li>I noticed that this fragrance smells differently on other people, I believe it depends on the persons body chemistry that determines which notes are significant in this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I typically use Armani code or Brittney&#x27;s Midnight fantasy daily and Marc Jacob&#x27;s Daisy for special occasions.</li>
            <li>BUT... when I opened the box and spritz a little on my wrist, it didn&#x27;t smell as rich as  my last bottle.</li>
            <li>smell so good on me and the men go crazy when they smell it on me.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a nice gift you will not be sorry.</li>

            <li> I believe the top notes are: guava, mandarin orange and pear, middle notes: orange blossom jasmine sambac and gardenia, base notes: sandalwood, vanilla orchid, and musk.</li>
            <li> It seems it wears off after about 45 minutes to an hour, which is extremely quick and rather disappointing.</li>
            <li> It was not fragrant enough for me; too subtle.</li>
            <li> , it just becomes a little overpowering for me.</li>
            <li> Next time, I will just smell a little funky for a few days until I can get the D&amp;G rather than buy a less expensive fragrance in the meantime.</li>
            <li> Not very happy about that!  </li>
            <li> I was worried it might break or be the wrong perfume</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume &amp;#34;NUDE&amp;#34; an item that smells awful compared to the same perfume sold in Macy&#x27;s.&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered as a gift. You get a lot for your money. Fragrance smells good and the bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li> smells so good!  I love it!</li>
            <li> This smell is very light and fruity. It has become my new favorite everyday where. I typically use Armani code or Brittney&#x27;s Midnight fantasy daily and Marc Jacob&#x27;s Daisy for special occasions. I like clean, fruity and light and this perfume certainly delivers that. I believe the top notes are: guava, mandarin orange and pear, middle notes: orange blossom jasmine sambac and gardenia, base notes: sandalwood, vanilla orchid, and musk. My husband also is very picky about scents and loves when I where this one. Its is also very affordable.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter-in--law. She loves it. Thanks Great Buy.</li>
            <li> Showed up leaking in box.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a great price on my favorite perfume. Yes, it was shipped in two days BUT... when I opened the box and spritz a little on my wrist, it didn&#x27;t smell as rich as  my last bottle. I guess you get what you pay for. The bottle I purchased at Macy&#x27;s for $20.00 more, the smell lasts much longer. The bottle I purchased from Amazon was more like a body spray or eau de toilette. Everything about the packaging was the same but there was something different about the fragrance. I can&#x27;t put my finger on it, but it didn&#x27;t seem like the real thing.</li>
            <li> I love it .it smell so good on me and the men go crazy when they smell it on me.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my daughter and she just loves it. If you are looking for a nice gift you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> I received the smaller version as a gift for my birrhday in September of 2013 and loved it. I wanted it for Christmas of 2013 because I loved it so much and got many smell good compliments.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for it when I saw it in the mall had a different smell for some reason but my neighbor has a perfume that smell exactly like nude but it&#x27;s not Rihanna so I gave it to her lol yeah!! I really didn&#x27;t care for the smell</li>
            <li> Smells beautiful! Love it. Just like it was at the store not a fake. Would purchase again. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Loved it!! Great price to...</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this as a substitute for Dolce &amp; Gabbana The One when I ran out, and while I enjoy the sweet smell, it doesn&#x27;t last long at all. It seems it wears off after about 45 minutes to an hour, which is extremely quick and rather disappointing. If I could have returned it, I would have. Next time, I will just smell a little funky for a few days until I can get the D&amp;G rather than buy a less expensive fragrance in the meantime.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister for her birthday.  She really likes Rihanna and the smell of the perfume is very nice</li>
            <li> Arrived within a week, the bottle was much bigger than I thought. Smell lasts for about 3-4 hours and that&#x27;s it. I suggest this to someone who likes a light, clean smell rather than a heavy, in-your-face smell. Over all I&#x27;m satisfied, thank you to the seller! Found a sample in a magazine a year or two ago and finally decided to buy it :)</li>
            <li> Price was right and love the perfume</li>
            <li> Bought this for my niece, she loved it!</li>
            <li> Get so many compliments on this perfume. It&#x27;s inexpensive but doesn&#x27;t smell like it. Men and women both find it to smell good. I love it myself.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, it has a sweet soft smell that I can use everyday without it being overpowering. I apply to my pulse point, neck and it last all day on me.</li>
            <li> I received my order very fast! It came before the it was expected to be delivered and that made me very happy! Also, the perfume arrived in perfect condition. I was worried it might break or be the wrong perfume but everything was right!! I&#x27;m so excited about my new perfume. Thank you for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume &amp;#34;NUDE&amp;#34; an item that smells awful compared to the same perfume sold in Macy&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy is that I cannot return this item and have to keep it.  Not very happy about that!  I bought the item in good faith, but&lt;br /&gt;do not understand why I have to keep an item that is rancid.</li>
            <li> First time I smelled \\&quot;Nude\\&quot;, I thought it was very pleasant and liked it very much. As it wore off, not so much. To me, it actually became stronger instead of softer as the day went by. Normally fragrances smooth out into a nice sultry aroma but this one really makes itself known, which is not necessarily a bad thing, it just becomes a little overpowering for me. I can say that it lasts all day and night. Even after washing my hands, I could still smell it, which is a plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very nice but a bit strong. Prefer her first fragrance better.</li>
            <li> Softer than the other two but still love</li>
            <li> Smells nice and a good price</li>
            <li> I have all three of Rihanna&#x27;s fragrances, and this one is definitely sweeter and more lighter than the other two. It puts me in mind of baby powder and cotton candy. (Side note) I noticed that this fragrance smells differently on other people, I believe it depends on the persons body chemistry that determines which notes are significant in this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Got it for a gift and person really like the smell and it last all day.The bottle looks pretty cool also.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Rihanna&#x27;s Rebel Fleur however, the Nude did not live up to my expectations. It was not fragrant enough for me; too subtle. I gave it to my daughter who loves it! Still happy with the products~!</li>
            <li> my fav out of all her sents</li>
            <li> U  made my girl the happiest on our anniversary,  I give her it as one of present, her favorite perfume. Thank you would shop there again.</li>
            <li> Great price for a big bottle</li>
            <li> smell good not a 5 star bec not strong enough</li>
            <li> Great product . Fast shipping. Thanks</li>
            <li> I love it. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Love this soft scent.  Reasonably priced for everyday use.</li>
