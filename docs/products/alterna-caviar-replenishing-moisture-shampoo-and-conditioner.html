            <li>These products are the best I&#x27;ve ever used even better than the overpriced Kerastase.</li>
            <li>Also, the smell is pleasant - unisex smell that reminds me an \\&quot;ocean breeze\\&quot; scent if that makes any</li>
            <li>Not too heavyâ€¦ perfect for fine hair.</li>
            <li>These products have been wonderful for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>While the reviews are good for Nanoworks, someone recommended Alterna.  </li>
            <li>No frizz, none of that \\&quot;soft\\&quot; flyaway look that I can&#x27;t stand, it just looked smooth and perfect.</li>

            <li>I tried to use up the rest of the Wen I have, but my hair is so brittle and FULL of snarls, that I had to use a ton of my good Josie Maran Argan Oil , so I now feel I could be used for a surfboard.</li>

            <li>surely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>However, I always decant the  products into more manageable bottles.</li>
            <li>It was great to find them for such a good price.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic.</li>
            <li>I wondered if they would be authentic</li>
            <li>I will never be ripped off by paying more for it again.</li>

            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have since purchased more...........</li>
            <li>I get excited to wash my hair because I know the end results are going to be amazing.</li>
            <li>Plus it leaves my hair super soft and smells great!</li>
            <li>I used to use Joico, which is not bad at all, but this stuff is kind of miraculous.</li>
            <li>Soft, shiny, beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>you will notice SIGNIFICANT results after ONE use!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!!</li>
            <li>This is the best I have found for my dry, wavy/ curly hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo and conditioner set that has no sulfates (makes it brazilian treatment and keratin treatment friendly), contains a heat protectant and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Smell is light &amp; refreshing doesn&#x27;t over power.</li>
            <li>But with Alterna my hair looks smooth, shiny, and so much  better.</li>
            <li>It made my hair more smooth than before I had my hair colored.  </li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s free of parabens, etc.</li>
            <li>Great stuff that makes your hair shine and feel so soft.</li>
            <li>I am in 40&#x27;s and chopped off my hair because it was breaking and becoming frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Good and fast device.</li>
            <li>My hair is super curly and it&#x27;s very easy to brush it out after using this</li>
            <li>Nothing special!</li>
            <li>I was originally going to get Nanoworks by Pureology because of how many people I know that have used it but was put off by the price</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shampoo/conditioner..!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s twice as easy to mange/style.  </li>
            <li>Easy to buy.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra price for an excellent result.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is good as far as being able to comb out the tangles.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny and feels amazing!</li>
            <li>In general, Alterna has great series of products for all types of hair.</li>
            <li>hair is healthy and full of body.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent--spicy sweet.  </li>
            <li>Hair with it are just silk, smooth, shiny, easy to comb and style.</li>
            <li>(can&#x27;t remember from where), loved it so much had to buy the full sized bottles.</li>
            <li>My hair is ultra fine all my life and at 65</li>
            <li>But I still can style my fine hair to have some body.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo works fine</li>
            <li>Makes my fine hair look thicker.  </li>
            <li>and it made my hair super healthy</li>
            <li>I am always up for trying different brands down the road but for now Alterna is giving me great hair at a great price!!</li>
            <li>Alterna makes amazing hair products, and I love the way it makes my hair so soft</li>
            <li>and I had bought a huge container of Purology, so</li>
            <li>It has controlled my frizz and makes it shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny, much better than WEN.</li>
            <li>Really light scent that does not linger.</li>
            <li>My hair is so smooth and has the appearance of thicker hair.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Just a great shampoo and conditioner,  never leaves my roots greasy but definitely conditions my hair.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;s hair is different and these products may be great for your hair.  </li>
            <li>I heard that this shampoo and conditioner was fabulous.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>My hair is sleek, smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was fabulous.</li>
            <li>When I got home the fist thing I done was check amazon and to my utter joy thry had it and the price is well below the salon.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes my hair feel light and moisturized -</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>After my first wash I thought these were pretty good, and after 2 weeks of using it, my hair almost looks airbrushed.</li>
            <li>I most likely wouldnt buy this again unless there was a really good deal on it.</li>
            <li>but afterwards my hair is soft and smells good.</li>
            <li>I have tried many higher end hair care products, and this is my favorite currently for shine, softness, manageability and a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>:) After a month of using these two products,it is back to being soft and manageable and gorgeous (yes, yes, I love my hair!)</li>
            <li>It is light weight and washes clean every time.  </li>
            <li>These products was used on me in a salon and the results was amazing after just one use but the salon prices was high as a kite.</li>
            <li>But then I styled as usual, and I couldn&#x27;t believe how great my hair looked!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen a significant improvement in the way my hair looks and feels.  </li>
            <li>but it is worth it!</li>
            <li>I had originally just purchased the conditioner</li>
            <li>I have shine, luster, fullness, no frizzies...and a smile!</li>
            <li>I had originally gone to Sephora to buy this</li>
            <li>It is well worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny to me!</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>So worth every penny!</li>
            <li>This is a great product for dry hair.</li>
            <li>MY Hair clean AND CONDITIONER</li>
            <li>I have coarse hair and these two are by far the best I have used for my hair.</li>
            <li>Alterna, Seasilk Caviar shampoo &amp; conditioner are one of the few products that leave my hair look great more than one day.</li>
            <li>So I finished up the travel size and began purchasing the full size bottles here on Amazon (which is significantly more cost-effective than purchasing at the store where I first purchased it).  </li>
            <li>It has a nice twist to open top.</li>
            <li>After reading so many positive reviews I decided to try it.    </li>
            <li>I have straight fine hair that is dyed and this combo makes my hair color glisten..!</li>
            <li>Both the shampoo and conditioner have a nice smell and leave my hair very soft and super shiny.  </li>
            <li>The products have wonderful things for the hair and it was really hard for to me</li>
            <li>I still use products after I wash, but this stuff really makes the texture more manageable.</li>
            <li>I hope it is true.</li>
            <li>My hair is now full of body and shines like the day it was colored.  </li>
            <li>My hair is nice and soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T purchase this from QVC-they&#x27;re overpriced, and shipping and tax would be more that you&#x27;d really want to pay.</li>
            <li>Now the true test will be how my hair looks and manages in the heat of our humid Fla.summers.</li>
            <li>I can also go much longer between hair color than I had been able to.  </li>
            <li>They make your hair look so sleek and full.</li>
            <li>I still can not believe a shampoo can be this good, it made my hair so different!</li>
            <li>Best ever..resores thick hair and adds moisture without heaviness.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much shinier and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>It was a nice splurge for sure for my normally dry hair and scalp!</li>
            <li>If you want shampoo with great scent and texture but without phthalates and other scent-enhancing chemicals known as &amp;</li>
            <li>And even though the haircut is good, the hair goes flat the day after a shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This line offers some great product at a pretty reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of alterna caviar products - their dry shampoo is also amazing and works great in a pinch when I&#x27;m working really long hours...</li>
            <li>The smell is a fresh clean citrus.</li>
            <li>But I LOVE this brand and this particular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>and I wanted a quick fix.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair feeling very clean, soft, and tangle free.  </li>
            <li>The very first time I used the shampoo</li>
            <li>The texture and body of my hair improved with the very first use.  </li>
            <li>And I continue to be pleased with the results - my hair is soft and shiny, the product has a nice but very subtle scent, and I continue to get compliments on how beautiful my hair looks.  </li>
            <li>I absolutey love this shampoo and conditioner it has made my hair stop falling out and made so much new hair growth.</li>
            <li>I feel as if I have a new healthy head of hair each time I use it.</li>
            <li>First off, did not take a lot of shampoo to get my long hair into a good lather and yet still clean feeling with out dryness.  </li>
            <li>Highly reccomend this one!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Healthy hair is an investment I am willing to pay a premium for!</li>
            <li>I really like this brand and line for shampoo and conditioner!!</li>
            <li>My students noticed the first day i used it that my hair looked really different and nice and it was smooth and shiny and silky like it hasn&#x27;t been in years.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels like silk, actually it feels better than silk!  </li>
            <li>My hair dresser turned me on to this product because my hair was pretty damaged!</li>
            <li>The shampoo is decent, but the conditioner is what&#x27;s really special!</li>
            <li>Fabulous and really makes a difference after using for about a week.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on how shiny &amp; soft my hair is.</li>
            <li>worth the price.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not life changing, but definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>but this is by far my favorite shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Now that I am all natural my hair still love it.</li>
            <li>It is worth every cent--</li>
            <li>My favorite so far.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth trying.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way better than some of the natural food store house brands.</li>
            <li>but I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li>It is pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>It works best when I wear my hair curly because it adds that extra layer of silkiness, but the same silkiness keeps my hair from holding a style when it is straight.</li>
            <li>but, well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the investment</li>
            <li>about a weeks worth was spilled all over the bottle and packaging.  </li>
            <li>Makes your hair so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel so soft &amp; healthy.  </li>
            <li>Is it worth the price?</li>
            <li>Is it worth it?</li>
            <li>So worth the money.</li>
            <li>Thanks for affordable pricing and fast service!!!</li>
            <li>A few nice things about it are that for my fine hair, it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down like some moisturzing shampoo/conditioners do which is great.  </li>
            <li>I like this equally as much as the pureology brand I have used in the past and both companies seem to keep a good mind about the ingredients they put into their product:)</li>
            <li>it is rich and gentle.  </li>
            <li>So now that I use it together, I realize she is SO right.</li>
            <li>,you will see a change in your hair right away but</li>
            <li>So thankful for her advice, she was totally right.  </li>
            <li>more so normal, straight hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and appeared healthy in the first couple of washes.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much so it lasts a long time &amp; does a good job.  </li>
            <li>no other shampoo makes my hair feel this healthy.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is maybe more moisturizing than I need, having very fine hair, but I just use it sparingly and it seems to work well, not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to get back to good old shampoo!</li>
            <li>I have baby fine graying hair and have recently gone gluten free.  </li>
            <li>Pure hair gold!</li>
            <li>only used a couple of times but so far so good; i fear that the factory is discontinuing this line</li>
            <li>Made my hair very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I will always spend more if a product really works for me, and so far, this really does!</li>
            <li>It literally changed my hair into bouncy, healthy, shiny full of body hair that lost that frizzy damaged dry look.</li>
            <li>I have very much hair fell out from stress.</li>
            <li>Just so you know, my hair texture is fine and naturally wavy.</li>
            <li>Honestly I prefer the Morocan Oil Hydrating Shanpoo better for dry, coarse</li>
            <li>The shampoo smells good, a little perfume</li>
            <li>Really makes a difference!</li>
            <li>My first set is getting over</li>
            <li>My hair feels and looks so healthy, its easier to manage and has a lasting affect on the hair.</li>
            <li>It so much cheaper on Amazon than Sephora!</li>
            <li>The conditioner is first i&#x27;ve used ever where my hair is just as moisturized and shiny and healthy looking as when i deep condition and then have to add leave in conditioner too.  </li>
            <li>and I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>I have gone to countless dermatologists and hair stylists and tried more products than I can remember.</li>
            <li>Recommend highly!!</li>
            <li>Another case where the sample was a lot better than the actual product.  </li>
            <li>The first time my stylist recommended them, I was taken aback.</li>
            <li>The conditioner however did compensate and made my hair soften back up, but for the price, you can find something a lot better.</li>
            <li>after the first use.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had one since Sunday when I washed my hair with this for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>first saw this shampoo on the Neiman Marcus website and it had received  a beauty award.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first experience with an Alterna product.</li>
            <li>a sample of the product from sophora first then went on ahead and bought some .expensive</li>
            <li>I have never been able to skip a day washing my hair, but suddenly I can.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and it is more than double the price for the shampoo and conditioner there.  </li>
            <li>Did you know that Gluten is found in many different products that you use every day???</li>
            <li>These are such fabulous products that I am elated to have found them!  </li>
            <li>When I first began using it</li>
            <li>If you decide to get these dont forget about the serum to if you have coarse or unruly or frizzy hair then you to will love these products.</li>
            <li>When my hair started turning gray, it became even more coarse.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe it the first time I tried it.  </li>
            <li>My ends are looking so much better and overall</li>
            <li>I took a chance and I will say that with the first shampoo I could already tell a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but the conditioner was open so</li>
            <li>I tried a tester of this and the shampoo in the test was clear and sulfate free</li>
            <li>Absolutely!</li>
            <li>and I actually double-checked to make sure I hadn&#x27;t mistakenly put the conditioner on first.  </li>
            <li>shampoo and conditioner (it&#x27;s made for &amp;#34;mature hair&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>Just after the first wash I already felt a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>Wish it was more affordable, its alot of money for only 8 onz but</li>
            <li>the product itself is outstanding and does instant repair.</li>
            <li>It has really helped make my hair healthier!</li>
            <li>The closest I can compare to is Nanoworks by pureology, which is much pricier.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is great, the bottles design I think is actually very smart, I haven&#x27;t had a hard time squeezing as some reviewers have said.</li>
            <li>And like any sulfate free product, the larger is less than low quality chemical shampoos, but I think it is actually great for this shampoo, and the conditioner is nourishing without creating bulk or grease!</li>
            <li>I had bought this at Sephora and loved it but never bought it again due to the high price.</li>
            <li>After doing so much research i found this product and it worked really nice for my dry and damaged and chemically processed hair.</li>
            <li>but you also use half as much and your hair looks twice as good</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel so soft!!!!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner it make my hair look shiny and healthy, considering I use a flat iron daily.</li>
            <li>Holy cow, this stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>; hair feels soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>The products leave my hair clean, shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>Normally a use whatever is at the hotel shampoo person and take my own conditioner for long hair.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t love the scent on this alterna as much as the scent on the lighter purple instant recovery alterna product.</li>
            <li>Both the shampoo and conditioner have had positive results so I would definetly recommend the &amp;#34;duo&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>This stuff from this seller is the real deal and SOOO much cheaper!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much as compared to all the cheaper products I&#x27;ve purchased, but still pretty pricey per use.  </li>
            <li>Being an older person with longer hair it makes my hair shine and looks exceptionally extra healthy.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve never written this long a review, but this product deserves the recognition!:)</li>
            <li>your hair will be super soft and shiny and it works on all types of hair</li>
            <li>I really like the CC cream, too - it nourished my hair and made it so shiny and smooth without weighing down my fine</li>
            <li>It makes my hair super soft and silky after using it and it feels so much healthier now.</li>
            <li>This particular line has truly earned the name \\&quot;Caviar\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>Very high quality</li>
            <li>things that I didn&#x27;t like were that the shampoo dried my hair out, even though it was very easy to lather and seemed very gentle to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like this brand</li>
            <li>and I must add that its so much cheaper than buying it from Sephora.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the products are each 8.5 fl oz.</li>
            <li>so I really need something that is going to work.    </li>
            <li>I really recommend this product for colored hair.  </li>
            <li>I really hope Amazon isn&#x27;t doing that.</li>
            <li>I have thin hair that is slightly fly away.  </li>
            <li>I can really tell a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>Might as well get the same stuff off of Amazon for dirt cheap.  </li>
            <li>Then I work it onto my scalp really well.  </li>
            <li>would recommend highly to anyone!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on the reviews, I really expected to love this product.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is very creamy, and did balance out the drying effect of the shampoo a bit.  </li>
            <li>Again, not really a factor for most people, but wanted to mention it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this combo as opposed to a drugstore shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>As someone who blow drys, straightens, and in the summer does highlights, my hair really takes a beating...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really am amazed.</li>
            <li>The shampoo/conditioner made my hair feel really greasy within hours of washing.</li>
            <li>As for the bottles the top twist up and the product comes out from the center.</li>
            <li>after much research i bit the bullet and bought this combo.  </li>
            <li>When I wish to return to my straight hair (pre-medication and surgery hair)</li>
            <li>I use Moroccan Oil before using the straight iron.</li>
            <li>I have really curly and frizzy hair so after blow drying</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that the shampoo/conditioner duo damaged my hair, but it just hasn&#x27;t done much for it.  </li>
            <li>If they would use a softer bottle they may not need to charge as much.</li>
            <li>; however, when users say you don&#x27;t need to use much - believe it.  </li>
            <li>and it really washes my hair.</li>
            <li>, I proudly let them know my secret is Alterna Caviar.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very picky person...</li>
            <li>but this product has really changed the way my hair feels.</li>
            <li>The conditioner works really well and the smell is great.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone</li>
            <li>This hair product really does seem to moisturize your hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight</li>
            <li>But this shampoo has really worked.</li>
            <li>I never thought I would spend this much on shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner make it feel so much softer.  </li>
            <li>I thought it made my hair feel much thicker.  </li>
            <li>After switching from Matrix to Redken and Aveda, I was looking for something that was really going to remoisturize and soften my hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so light the second I get out of the shower</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend these products.</li>
            <li>This makes my frizzy hair so much softer and healthier.</li>
            <li>Although its a bit pricey this shampoo and conditioner combination works great in my thin wavy, color treated hair.</li>
            <li>so much for that dinner party cred.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m on my second bottle of each and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>loving this duo and will buy in a larger size next purchase.  </li>
            <li>The tangles just fall right now and my hair is extremely soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is long and tangles easily</li>
            <li>the shampoo is extremely thick which is awesome, lathers very well and has a very nice clean scent to it - the conditioner was thick in texture and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Yes it costs twice as much (or more) than other products</li>
            <li>A little background first, I have been battling what seems to be psoriasis on my scalp for many years.</li>
            <li>It also smells great and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I realize it&#x27;s more costly than other brands</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried SOOO many other brands (Pureology, WEN, Bumble and Bumble, Ojon, Fredric Fekkai, etc)</li>
            <li>I use it combined with other shampoos and conditioners, but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Since I am so pleased with the shampoo and conditioner, I want to try some of their other styling products.</li>
            <li>my hair went from super fine, dull, limp and lifeless to shiny, healthy and full of bounce.</li>
            <li>The product is definitely on the higher end of the price scale, but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>I also love how its very moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t way your hair down.  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, my very long hair has so much body and is silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>my hair always feels soft and my scalp does not get too dry, which happens with most over the counter shampoos.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is not clear and provides a to of lather which tells me it is NOT sulfate free.</li>
            <li>this product is improving the condition of my locks better than any other line has!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it once so far and my hair was incredibly soft after the first wash and a lot shinier!</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing and made my curls come back to life (no frizz either).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I always think that the more expensive something is the better</li>
            <li>I have blonde colored / highlighted hair, and by using this shampoo religiously I am always complimented on how healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers up well and leaves my 64-year-old hair nice and soft, and fluffy, too.  </li>
            <li>After many years of bleaching my hair, i decided to go dark (my natural color) and this stuff has really helped it get its healthiest.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair thick and healthy and so well conditioned!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I have been a high end shampoo/conditioner user for years, and have tried every salon brand under the sun, but nothing compares to this stuff.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t mind buying pricey shampoo &amp; conditioner, so after reading reviews on amazon and sephora i purchased it with high hopes.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>But it was also highly recommended by a family friend/former stylist of mine.</li>
            <li>The cost is high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Works like a dream when you need a little more moisture &amp; conditioning for your hair.</li>
            <li>Item was priced below all other online sellers and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>I used a little more than I normally would of that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft to the touch and very silky.</li>
            <li>These purple containers are attractive, but useless.</li>
            <li>but I have ordered several things in the past from Amazon.com and have always had a good experience.  </li>
            <li>However, I have switched back again because it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Most shampoos would make my hair feel heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve already gone a week longer than normal to color.  </li>
            <li>- I don&#x27;t normally have an itchy scalp</li>
            <li>I normally add Moroccan Oil</li>
            <li>You can use the shampoo and conditioner seperately or together for pretty much the same results.</li>
            <li>Just not happy with the smell since I was expecting so much more - especially since so many of the reviews raved about it.  </li>
            <li>At that point I still wasn&#x27;t hopeful of good results, but I was very pleasantly surprised as my hair dried - for the first time in a long time my hair felt soft, and had some shine.  </li>
            <li>Maybe a better product for people that don&#x27;t have curly or coarse, dry hair....</li>
            <li>The scent was right, but the packaging and consistency of the products was not the same as the ones I bought in a salon.</li>
            <li>And two different people actually complimented me on how pretty my hair looked after just that first use!  </li>
            <li>I used it years back and had to switch because it&#x27;s so expensive, but I went back to it because it really is the best.</li>
            <li>instead i recommend living proof or bumble &amp; bumble thickening shampoo/conditioner that leaves hair feeling thick, clean and full of body.</li>
            <li>I am now questioning whether this product is real - I don&#x27;t know why alterna would manufacture their product in different packaging for certain vendors.</li>
            <li>product because my sister raved about her new shampoo and conditioner that was marketed under that term.</li>
            <li>But, I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li>The product needs new packaging.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t see myself ever switching to a new brand.  </li>
            <li>This time I purchased it for my sister who says that she cannot live without this product.</li>
            <li>I used this exclusively when I bleached my naturally black hair to a beach blonde and it helped keep my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Cruelty reigns at Alterna; stuff is ridiculously expensive and better cruelty-free alternatives are available.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>- makes color treated hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>I am a 43 year old female with fine medium brown hair colored blonde and cut in a bob to my shoulders.  </li>
            <li>However, these products are wonderful...leave my hair very clean and after a few weeks of use it reminds me of when I was young...</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I had to be aware of is how to properly use it.  </li>
            <li>this is the only stuff that really has me feel like it washed and conditioned my hair!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately not moisturizing enough for my damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Have tried many shampoos, in the past, but nothing worked like this one.</li>
            <li>Unlike many other products I&#x27;ve purchased over the years, I use every last drop of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft!</li>
            <li>My hair was completely transformed!</li>
            <li>and they are exactly the same</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>She uses it for almost 5 years and no complains so far!</li>
            <li>The quality is great too, if you can&#x27;t afford both I would say at the least try out the shampoo because some other ones can be so drying.</li>
            <li>This will keep your hair moisturized, soft, and SIKLY!</li>
            <li>Leaves me hair so soft!</li>
            <li>My hair is SO soft, shiny, lustrous, and cooperative after using the conditioner!</li>
            <li>but is so fine it easily goes limp when weighed down by product.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Since my hair does need help on a regular basis, I will now need to open a special savings account</li>
            <li>I saw this product in a store first and since it is a bit more than I typically pay for shampoo, tried the small travel size first.  </li>
            <li>too heavy for my hair which is fine</li>
            <li>Both the shampooo and conditioner goes a long way and the price on Amazon is better than other sites.</li>
            <li>(only cause I&#x27;m no longer working in a large office) and this product was recommended by hair gal.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard to justify giving more than 3 stars.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner made my hair really soft and moisturized it a lot than before.</li>
            <li>I was surprised after all the rave reviews for the shampoo and conditioner that I was thoroughly unimpressed with the product...</li>
            <li>I am in my early 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky soft &amp;</li>
            <li>My hair stylist and even the shampoo lady have complimented about how soft my hair feels.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels extremely soft</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft.</li>
            <li>had the wow effect on my hair.</li>
            <li>The shampoo does go far though, you can tell it&#x27;s concentrated.</li>
            <li>and this is at least three times better.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair silky, shiny and soft - a noticable difference.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Completely extends the life of my color.</li>
            <li>It makes hair so soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner made my hair feel soft but it made my face break out (swelling and pimples)</li>
            <li>I ended up buying the set at a near by salon supply store.</li>
            <li>and I have natural waves.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy and frizzy hair, and it makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair is like silk, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>They say that hair looks and \\&quot;feels\\&quot; different, hair-styling is much easier</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;One important thing about Caviar, is that, it is not so expensive as Ten, which I love too, by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>SOFT AS SILK</li>
            <li>Salon soft hair and helps maintain my color and highlights.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair so soft and</li>
            <li>I have had two complete washes and I have no complaints.  </li>
            <li>and it stays soft all day.</li>
            <li>makes my hair incredibly soft ...</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>So far I like the shampoo</li>
            <li>but I have a sensitive scalp</li>
            <li>Makes the texture of my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft, shiny &amp; manageable.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Alterna makes a really good product, but it&#x27;s not great, especially at this price point.</li>
            <li>The bottles are fairly small, so I may start ordering their super large size from now on to save the hassle and money.</li>
            <li>It is really special and costs half of what I was buying it before.</li>
            <li>My hair is more manageable and less dry.  </li>
            <li>It is very rich so a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>previously used different expensive brands, but the best Alterna not found!!</li>
            <li>I have thick hair, so this product is great so that my hair feels weightless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind of a splurge for shampoo/conditioner, but my last order lasted me about half a year.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair super soft and shiny with plenty of body (will hold a style all day with addition of a little texturizer).  </li>
            <li>No other product has made my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>Alterna is one of the very few companies who&#x27;s entire product line is Gluten Free!  </li>
            <li>We live in a humid climate and these products have complete gotten rid of any frizz left over after drying.  </li>
            <li>It makes hair silky and smooth and it takes very little product when using.</li>
            <li>and then I started noticing not really a build up but more of an odd greasy feeling around the scalp.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy, fine, and thick hair.</li>
            <li>and now I can just blow dry my hair straight and no frizziness.  </li>
            <li>My hair had felt really damaged and dry</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, you just need to make sure you use enough water.</li>
            <li>You need only a little dab, so it goes a long way, and three years in it&#x27;s still my favorite.</li>
            <li>I am interested to discover if the moisturizing is accumulative over repeated use as their other Caviar products are.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is sulfate-free (which is a requirement in my book) and the conditioner works like no other.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, healthy, color treated hair.</li>
            <li>After, I repeat the process with a little more shampoo and then work it into a lather down to the tips of my hair.  </li>
            <li>think that based on the positive experience from the majority of other people, you may want to try it.  </li>
            <li>I have been on the hunt for natural hair products that actually work.</li>
            <li>So far Ojon is the only brand that works.  </li>
            <li>I have been having success with a few of the products from the Phyto line and going to try out Fekkai.</li>
            <li>At first my hair felt soft and shine, but after drying it, it was stiff and frizzy.</li>
            <li>I normally use Redken products, and this was more expensive per fluid ounce, and seemed to be some \\&quot;no-name\\&quot; brand shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>Went to a new salon and they used this on my dry damaged color treated hair.</li>
            <li>Allows me to blow dry straight with ease and my hair straightens with a straight iron with just a few passes.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner have been the only products I&#x27;ve found that actually make my hair soft and manageable again.  </li>
            <li>i have frizzy, dry, thin hair that breaks very easily...</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re a platinum blonde and deal with dryness.. or just dryness in general, this is what you need!</li>
            <li>I thought there was no help for my 43 year old hair and that I was getting to the age where I was going to have to cut my long locks off.  </li>
            <li>Since then, I have gone back to purchase individual bottles only to find they are marked</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a long time to find a product that will maintain that soft silky look.  </li>
            <li>I have thick red hair and this is the only shampoo/conditioner set that helps my hair stay smooth.    </li>
            <li>I have straight fine hair, and it has felt a little dry and frazzled over the past couple of years.</li>
            <li>I blow dry it straight and my hair is highlighted (therefore dry and chemically processed)....</li>
            <li>and I did notice it had a little more lather then usual.</li>
            <li>and I naturally can have dry hair and</li>
            <li>and I literally felt the dry and brittle hair melt into this soft and silky texture while I was conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li>These products help to keep my dry hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I even went 3 days without washing my hair which is impossible for my mediterranean oily skin, but on day 3 my hair still looked good.  </li>
            <li>Amazon carries the brand she uses, but I decided to go with Alterna because it was slightly less expensive and had good reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been busy and preoccupied with work in the last month, but recently realized my hair is dry and breaking.  </li>
            <li>I was certain that I had just wasted my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> These products are the best I&#x27;ve ever used even better than the overpriced Kerastase.</li>
            <li> Also, the smell is pleasant - unisex smell that reminds me an \\&quot;ocean breeze\\&quot; scent if that makes any</li>
            <li> Not too heavyâ€¦ perfect for fine hair.</li>
            <li> These products have been wonderful for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> While the reviews are good for Nanoworks, someone recommended Alterna.  </li>
            <li> No frizz, none of that \\&quot;soft\\&quot; flyaway look that I can&#x27;t stand, it just looked smooth and perfect.</li>

            <li> It was recommended by good friend who is a hair stylist.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that the very first time I used it, I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the way it felt when I massaged it into my hair.  </li>

            <li> Very pleased.</li>

            <li> I tried to use up the rest of the Wen I have, but my hair is so brittle and FULL of snarls, that I had to use a ton of my good Josie Maran Argan Oil , so I now feel I could be used for a surfboard.</li>

            <li> I have VERY fine hair and am finally able to keep it longer (mid-back) than I&#x27;ve been able to in years</li>

            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have since purchased more...........</li>
            <li> I get excited to wash my hair because I know the end results are going to be amazing.</li>
            <li> Plus it leaves my hair super soft and smells great!</li>
            <li> I used to use Joico, which is not bad at all, but this stuff is kind of miraculous.</li>
            <li> Soft, shiny, beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> you will notice SIGNIFICANT results after ONE use!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!!</li>
            <li> This is the best I have found for my dry, wavy/ curly hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo and conditioner set that has no sulfates (makes it brazilian treatment and keratin treatment friendly), contains a heat protectant and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Smell is light &amp; refreshing doesn&#x27;t over power.</li>
            <li> But with Alterna my hair looks smooth, shiny, and so much  better.</li>
            <li> It made my hair more smooth than before I had my hair colored.  </li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s free of parabens, etc.</li>
            <li> Great stuff that makes your hair shine and feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I am in 40&#x27;s and chopped off my hair because it was breaking and becoming frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Good and fast device.</li>
            <li> My hair is super curly and it&#x27;s very easy to brush it out after using this</li>
            <li> Nothing special!</li>
            <li> I was originally going to get Nanoworks by Pureology because of how many people I know that have used it but was put off by the price</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shampoo/conditioner..!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s twice as easy to mange/style.  </li>
            <li> Easy to buy.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra price for an excellent result.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is good as far as being able to comb out the tangles.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny and feels amazing!</li>
            <li> In general, Alterna has great series of products for all types of hair.</li>
            <li> hair is healthy and full of body.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent--spicy sweet.  </li>
            <li> Hair with it are just silk, smooth, shiny, easy to comb and style.</li>
            <li> (can&#x27;t remember from where), loved it so much had to buy the full sized bottles.</li>
            <li> My hair is ultra fine all my life and at 65</li>
            <li> But I still can style my fine hair to have some body.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo works fine</li>
            <li> Makes my fine hair look thicker.  </li>
            <li> and it made my hair super healthy</li>
            <li> I am always up for trying different brands down the road but for now Alterna is giving me great hair at a great price!!</li>
            <li> Alterna makes amazing hair products, and I love the way it makes my hair so soft</li>
            <li> and I had bought a huge container of Purology, so</li>
            <li> It has controlled my frizz and makes it shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny, much better than WEN.</li>
            <li> Really light scent that does not linger.</li>
            <li> My hair is so smooth and has the appearance of thicker hair.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Just a great shampoo and conditioner,  never leaves my roots greasy but definitely conditions my hair.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s hair is different and these products may be great for your hair.  </li>
            <li> I heard that this shampoo and conditioner was fabulous.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> My hair is sleek, smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was fabulous.</li>
            <li> When I got home the fist thing I done was check amazon and to my utter joy thry had it and the price is well below the salon.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Makes my hair feel light and moisturized -</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li> After my first wash I thought these were pretty good, and after 2 weeks of using it, my hair almost looks airbrushed.</li>
            <li> I most likely wouldnt buy this again unless there was a really good deal on it.</li>
            <li> but afterwards my hair is soft and smells good.</li>
            <li> I have tried many higher end hair care products, and this is my favorite currently for shine, softness, manageability and a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> :) After a month of using these two products,it is back to being soft and manageable and gorgeous (yes, yes, I love my hair!)</li>
            <li> It is light weight and washes clean every time.  </li>
            <li> These products was used on me in a salon and the results was amazing after just one use but the salon prices was high as a kite.</li>
            <li> But then I styled as usual, and I couldn&#x27;t believe how great my hair looked!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen a significant improvement in the way my hair looks and feels.  </li>
            <li> but it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I had originally just purchased the conditioner</li>
            <li> I have shine, luster, fullness, no frizzies...and a smile!</li>
            <li> I had originally gone to Sephora to buy this</li>
            <li> It is well worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny to me!</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> So worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for dry hair.</li>
            <li> MY Hair clean AND CONDITIONER</li>
            <li> I have coarse hair and these two are by far the best I have used for my hair.</li>
            <li> Alterna, Seasilk Caviar shampoo &amp; conditioner are one of the few products that leave my hair look great more than one day.</li>
            <li> So I finished up the travel size and began purchasing the full size bottles here on Amazon (which is significantly more cost-effective than purchasing at the store where I first purchased it).  </li>
            <li> It has a nice twist to open top.</li>
            <li> After reading so many positive reviews I decided to try it.    </li>
            <li> I have straight fine hair that is dyed and this combo makes my hair color glisten..!</li>
            <li> Both the shampoo and conditioner have a nice smell and leave my hair very soft and super shiny.  </li>
            <li> The products have wonderful things for the hair and it was really hard for to me</li>
            <li> I still use products after I wash, but this stuff really makes the texture more manageable.</li>
            <li> I hope it is true.</li>
            <li> My hair is now full of body and shines like the day it was colored.  </li>
            <li> My hair is nice and soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T purchase this from QVC-they&#x27;re overpriced, and shipping and tax would be more that you&#x27;d really want to pay.</li>
            <li> Now the true test will be how my hair looks and manages in the heat of our humid Fla.summers.</li>
            <li> I can also go much longer between hair color than I had been able to.  </li>
            <li> They make your hair look so sleek and full.</li>
            <li> I still can not believe a shampoo can be this good, it made my hair so different!</li>
            <li> Best ever..resores thick hair and adds moisture without heaviness.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much shinier and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> It was a nice splurge for sure for my normally dry hair and scalp!</li>
            <li> If you want shampoo with great scent and texture but without phthalates and other scent-enhancing chemicals known as &amp;</li>
            <li> And even though the haircut is good, the hair goes flat the day after a shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This line offers some great product at a pretty reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of alterna caviar products - their dry shampoo is also amazing and works great in a pinch when I&#x27;m working really long hours...</li>
            <li> The smell is a fresh clean citrus.</li>
            <li> But I LOVE this brand and this particular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> and I wanted a quick fix.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair feeling very clean, soft, and tangle free.  </li>
            <li> The very first time I used the shampoo</li>
            <li> The texture and body of my hair improved with the very first use.  </li>
            <li> And I continue to be pleased with the results - my hair is soft and shiny, the product has a nice but very subtle scent, and I continue to get compliments on how beautiful my hair looks.  </li>
            <li> I absolutey love this shampoo and conditioner it has made my hair stop falling out and made so much new hair growth.</li>
            <li> I feel as if I have a new healthy head of hair each time I use it.</li>
            <li> First off, did not take a lot of shampoo to get my long hair into a good lather and yet still clean feeling with out dryness.  </li>
            <li> Highly reccomend this one!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Healthy hair is an investment I am willing to pay a premium for!</li>
            <li> I really like this brand and line for shampoo and conditioner!!</li>
            <li> My students noticed the first day i used it that my hair looked really different and nice and it was smooth and shiny and silky like it hasn&#x27;t been in years.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels like silk, actually it feels better than silk!  </li>
            <li> My hair dresser turned me on to this product because my hair was pretty damaged!</li>
            <li> The shampoo is decent, but the conditioner is what&#x27;s really special!</li>
            <li> Fabulous and really makes a difference after using for about a week.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on how shiny &amp; soft my hair is.</li>
            <li> worth the price.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not life changing, but definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> but this is by far my favorite shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Now that I am all natural my hair still love it.</li>
            <li> It is worth every cent--</li>
            <li> My favorite so far.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth trying.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way better than some of the natural food store house brands.</li>
            <li> but I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> It is pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> It works best when I wear my hair curly because it adds that extra layer of silkiness, but the same silkiness keeps my hair from holding a style when it is straight.</li>
            <li> but, well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the investment</li>
            <li> about a weeks worth was spilled all over the bottle and packaging.  </li>
            <li> Makes your hair so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so soft &amp; healthy.  </li>
            <li> Is it worth the price?</li>
            <li> Is it worth it?</li>
            <li> So worth the money.</li>
            <li> Thanks for affordable pricing and fast service!!!</li>
            <li> A few nice things about it are that for my fine hair, it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down like some moisturzing shampoo/conditioners do which is great.  </li>
            <li> I like this equally as much as the pureology brand I have used in the past and both companies seem to keep a good mind about the ingredients they put into their product:)</li>
            <li> it is rich and gentle.  </li>
            <li> So now that I use it together, I realize she is SO right.</li>
            <li> ,you will see a change in your hair right away but</li>
            <li> So thankful for her advice, she was totally right.  </li>
            <li> more so normal, straight hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and appeared healthy in the first couple of washes.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much so it lasts a long time &amp; does a good job.  </li>
            <li> no other shampoo makes my hair feel this healthy.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is maybe more moisturizing than I need, having very fine hair, but I just use it sparingly and it seems to work well, not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to get back to good old shampoo!</li>
            <li> I have baby fine graying hair and have recently gone gluten free.  </li>
            <li> Pure hair gold!</li>
            <li> only used a couple of times but so far so good; i fear that the factory is discontinuing this line</li>
            <li> Made my hair very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I will always spend more if a product really works for me, and so far, this really does!</li>
            <li> It literally changed my hair into bouncy, healthy, shiny full of body hair that lost that frizzy damaged dry look.</li>
            <li> I have very much hair fell out from stress.</li>
            <li> Just so you know, my hair texture is fine and naturally wavy.</li>
            <li> Honestly I prefer the Morocan Oil Hydrating Shanpoo better for dry, coarse</li>
            <li> The shampoo smells good, a little perfume</li>
            <li> Really makes a difference!</li>
            <li> My first set is getting over</li>
            <li> My hair feels and looks so healthy, its easier to manage and has a lasting affect on the hair.</li>
            <li> It so much cheaper on Amazon than Sephora!</li>
            <li> The conditioner is first i&#x27;ve used ever where my hair is just as moisturized and shiny and healthy looking as when i deep condition and then have to add leave in conditioner too.  </li>
            <li> and I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> I have gone to countless dermatologists and hair stylists and tried more products than I can remember.</li>
            <li> Recommend highly!!</li>
            <li> Another case where the sample was a lot better than the actual product.  </li>
            <li> The first time my stylist recommended them, I was taken aback.</li>
            <li> The conditioner however did compensate and made my hair soften back up, but for the price, you can find something a lot better.</li>
            <li> after the first use.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had one since Sunday when I washed my hair with this for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> first saw this shampoo on the Neiman Marcus website and it had received  a beauty award.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first experience with an Alterna product.</li>
            <li> a sample of the product from sophora first then went on ahead and bought some .expensive</li>
            <li> I have never been able to skip a day washing my hair, but suddenly I can.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and it is more than double the price for the shampoo and conditioner there.  </li>
            <li> Did you know that Gluten is found in many different products that you use every day???</li>
            <li> These are such fabulous products that I am elated to have found them!  </li>
            <li> When I first began using it</li>
            <li> If you decide to get these dont forget about the serum to if you have coarse or unruly or frizzy hair then you to will love these products.</li>
            <li> When my hair started turning gray, it became even more coarse.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it the first time I tried it.  </li>
            <li> My ends are looking so much better and overall</li>
            <li> I took a chance and I will say that with the first shampoo I could already tell a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but the conditioner was open so</li>
            <li> I tried a tester of this and the shampoo in the test was clear and sulfate free</li>
            <li> Absolutely!</li>
            <li> and I actually double-checked to make sure I hadn&#x27;t mistakenly put the conditioner on first.  </li>
            <li> shampoo and conditioner (it&#x27;s made for &amp;#34;mature hair&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> Just after the first wash I already felt a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Wish it was more affordable, its alot of money for only 8 onz but</li>
            <li> the product itself is outstanding and does instant repair.</li>
            <li> It has really helped make my hair healthier!</li>
            <li> The closest I can compare to is Nanoworks by pureology, which is much pricier.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is great, the bottles design I think is actually very smart, I haven&#x27;t had a hard time squeezing as some reviewers have said.</li>
            <li> And like any sulfate free product, the larger is less than low quality chemical shampoos, but I think it is actually great for this shampoo, and the conditioner is nourishing without creating bulk or grease!</li>
            <li> I had bought this at Sephora and loved it but never bought it again due to the high price.</li>
            <li> After doing so much research i found this product and it worked really nice for my dry and damaged and chemically processed hair.</li>
            <li> but you also use half as much and your hair looks twice as good</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so soft!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner it make my hair look shiny and healthy, considering I use a flat iron daily.</li>
            <li> Holy cow, this stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> ; hair feels soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> The products leave my hair clean, shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> Normally a use whatever is at the hotel shampoo person and take my own conditioner for long hair.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t love the scent on this alterna as much as the scent on the lighter purple instant recovery alterna product.</li>
            <li> Both the shampoo and conditioner have had positive results so I would definetly recommend the &amp;#34;duo&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> This stuff from this seller is the real deal and SOOO much cheaper!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much as compared to all the cheaper products I&#x27;ve purchased, but still pretty pricey per use.  </li>
            <li> Being an older person with longer hair it makes my hair shine and looks exceptionally extra healthy.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve never written this long a review, but this product deserves the recognition!:)</li>
            <li> your hair will be super soft and shiny and it works on all types of hair</li>
            <li> I really like the CC cream, too - it nourished my hair and made it so shiny and smooth without weighing down my fine</li>
            <li> It makes my hair super soft and silky after using it and it feels so much healthier now.</li>
            <li> This particular line has truly earned the name \\&quot;Caviar\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> Very high quality</li>
            <li> things that I didn&#x27;t like were that the shampoo dried my hair out, even though it was very easy to lather and seemed very gentle to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I really like this brand</li>
            <li> and I must add that its so much cheaper than buying it from Sephora.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the products are each 8.5 fl oz.</li>
            <li> so I really need something that is going to work.    </li>
            <li> I really recommend this product for colored hair.  </li>
            <li> I really hope Amazon isn&#x27;t doing that.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair that is slightly fly away.  </li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Might as well get the same stuff off of Amazon for dirt cheap.  </li>
            <li> Then I work it onto my scalp really well.  </li>
            <li> would recommend highly to anyone!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on the reviews, I really expected to love this product.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is very creamy, and did balance out the drying effect of the shampoo a bit.  </li>
            <li> Again, not really a factor for most people, but wanted to mention it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this combo as opposed to a drugstore shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> As someone who blow drys, straightens, and in the summer does highlights, my hair really takes a beating...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really am amazed.</li>
            <li> The shampoo/conditioner made my hair feel really greasy within hours of washing.</li>
            <li> As for the bottles the top twist up and the product comes out from the center.</li>
            <li> after much research i bit the bullet and bought this combo.  </li>
            <li> When I wish to return to my straight hair (pre-medication and surgery hair)</li>
            <li> I use Moroccan Oil before using the straight iron.</li>
            <li> I have really curly and frizzy hair so after blow drying</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that the shampoo/conditioner duo damaged my hair, but it just hasn&#x27;t done much for it.  </li>
            <li> If they would use a softer bottle they may not need to charge as much.</li>
            <li> ; however, when users say you don&#x27;t need to use much - believe it.  </li>
            <li> and it really washes my hair.</li>
            <li> , I proudly let them know my secret is Alterna Caviar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very picky person...</li>
            <li> but this product has really changed the way my hair feels.</li>
            <li> The conditioner works really well and the smell is great.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone</li>
            <li> This hair product really does seem to moisturize your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight</li>
            <li> But this shampoo has really worked.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would spend this much on shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner make it feel so much softer.  </li>
            <li> I thought it made my hair feel much thicker.  </li>
            <li> After switching from Matrix to Redken and Aveda, I was looking for something that was really going to remoisturize and soften my hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so light the second I get out of the shower</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend these products.</li>
            <li> This makes my frizzy hair so much softer and healthier.</li>
            <li> Although its a bit pricey this shampoo and conditioner combination works great in my thin wavy, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> so much for that dinner party cred.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m on my second bottle of each and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> loving this duo and will buy in a larger size next purchase.  </li>
            <li> The tangles just fall right now and my hair is extremely soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and tangles easily</li>
            <li> the shampoo is extremely thick which is awesome, lathers very well and has a very nice clean scent to it - the conditioner was thick in texture and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Yes it costs twice as much (or more) than other products</li>
            <li> A little background first, I have been battling what seems to be psoriasis on my scalp for many years.</li>
            <li> It also smells great and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I realize it&#x27;s more costly than other brands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried SOOO many other brands (Pureology, WEN, Bumble and Bumble, Ojon, Fredric Fekkai, etc)</li>
            <li> I use it combined with other shampoos and conditioners, but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Since I am so pleased with the shampoo and conditioner, I want to try some of their other styling products.</li>
            <li> my hair went from super fine, dull, limp and lifeless to shiny, healthy and full of bounce.</li>
            <li> The product is definitely on the higher end of the price scale, but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> I also love how its very moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t way your hair down.  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, my very long hair has so much body and is silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> my hair always feels soft and my scalp does not get too dry, which happens with most over the counter shampoos.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not clear and provides a to of lather which tells me it is NOT sulfate free.</li>
            <li> this product is improving the condition of my locks better than any other line has!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once so far and my hair was incredibly soft after the first wash and a lot shinier!</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing and made my curls come back to life (no frizz either).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I always think that the more expensive something is the better</li>
            <li> I have blonde colored / highlighted hair, and by using this shampoo religiously I am always complimented on how healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers up well and leaves my 64-year-old hair nice and soft, and fluffy, too.  </li>
            <li> After many years of bleaching my hair, i decided to go dark (my natural color) and this stuff has really helped it get its healthiest.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair thick and healthy and so well conditioned!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I have been a high end shampoo/conditioner user for years, and have tried every salon brand under the sun, but nothing compares to this stuff.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t mind buying pricey shampoo &amp; conditioner, so after reading reviews on amazon and sephora i purchased it with high hopes.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> But it was also highly recommended by a family friend/former stylist of mine.</li>
            <li> The cost is high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works like a dream when you need a little more moisture &amp; conditioning for your hair.</li>
            <li> Item was priced below all other online sellers and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> I used a little more than I normally would of that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft to the touch and very silky.</li>
            <li> These purple containers are attractive, but useless.</li>
            <li> but I have ordered several things in the past from Amazon.com and have always had a good experience.  </li>
            <li> However, I have switched back again because it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Most shampoos would make my hair feel heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve already gone a week longer than normal to color.  </li>
            <li> - I don&#x27;t normally have an itchy scalp</li>
            <li> I normally add Moroccan Oil</li>
            <li> You can use the shampoo and conditioner seperately or together for pretty much the same results.</li>
            <li> Just not happy with the smell since I was expecting so much more - especially since so many of the reviews raved about it.  </li>
            <li> At that point I still wasn&#x27;t hopeful of good results, but I was very pleasantly surprised as my hair dried - for the first time in a long time my hair felt soft, and had some shine.  </li>
            <li> Maybe a better product for people that don&#x27;t have curly or coarse, dry hair....</li>
            <li> The scent was right, but the packaging and consistency of the products was not the same as the ones I bought in a salon.</li>
            <li> And two different people actually complimented me on how pretty my hair looked after just that first use!  </li>
            <li> I used it years back and had to switch because it&#x27;s so expensive, but I went back to it because it really is the best.</li>
            <li> instead i recommend living proof or bumble &amp; bumble thickening shampoo/conditioner that leaves hair feeling thick, clean and full of body.</li>
            <li> I am now questioning whether this product is real - I don&#x27;t know why alterna would manufacture their product in different packaging for certain vendors.</li>
            <li> product because my sister raved about her new shampoo and conditioner that was marketed under that term.</li>
            <li> But, I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li> The product needs new packaging.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t see myself ever switching to a new brand.  </li>
            <li> This time I purchased it for my sister who says that she cannot live without this product.</li>
            <li> I used this exclusively when I bleached my naturally black hair to a beach blonde and it helped keep my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Cruelty reigns at Alterna; stuff is ridiculously expensive and better cruelty-free alternatives are available.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> - makes color treated hair very soft.  </li>
            <li> I am a 43 year old female with fine medium brown hair colored blonde and cut in a bob to my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> However, these products are wonderful...leave my hair very clean and after a few weeks of use it reminds me of when I was young...</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I had to be aware of is how to properly use it.  </li>
            <li> this is the only stuff that really has me feel like it washed and conditioned my hair!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately not moisturizing enough for my damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Have tried many shampoos, in the past, but nothing worked like this one.</li>
            <li> Unlike many other products I&#x27;ve purchased over the years, I use every last drop of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft!</li>
            <li> My hair was completely transformed!</li>
            <li> and they are exactly the same</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> She uses it for almost 5 years and no complains so far!</li>
            <li> The quality is great too, if you can&#x27;t afford both I would say at the least try out the shampoo because some other ones can be so drying.</li>
            <li> This will keep your hair moisturized, soft, and SIKLY!</li>
            <li> Leaves me hair so soft!</li>
            <li> My hair is SO soft, shiny, lustrous, and cooperative after using the conditioner!</li>
            <li> but is so fine it easily goes limp when weighed down by product.  </li>
            <li> The smell is nice and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Since my hair does need help on a regular basis, I will now need to open a special savings account</li>
            <li> I saw this product in a store first and since it is a bit more than I typically pay for shampoo, tried the small travel size first.  </li>
            <li> too heavy for my hair which is fine</li>
            <li> Both the shampooo and conditioner goes a long way and the price on Amazon is better than other sites.</li>
            <li> (only cause I&#x27;m no longer working in a large office) and this product was recommended by hair gal.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to justify giving more than 3 stars.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner made my hair really soft and moisturized it a lot than before.</li>
            <li> I was surprised after all the rave reviews for the shampoo and conditioner that I was thoroughly unimpressed with the product...</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair silky soft &amp;</li>
            <li> My hair stylist and even the shampoo lady have complimented about how soft my hair feels.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels extremely soft</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft.</li>
            <li> had the wow effect on my hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo does go far though, you can tell it&#x27;s concentrated.</li>
            <li> and this is at least three times better.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair silky, shiny and soft - a noticable difference.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Completely extends the life of my color.</li>
            <li> It makes hair so soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner made my hair feel soft but it made my face break out (swelling and pimples)</li>
            <li> I ended up buying the set at a near by salon supply store.</li>
            <li> and I have natural waves.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy and frizzy hair, and it makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair is like silk, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> They say that hair looks and \\&quot;feels\\&quot; different, hair-styling is much easier</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;One important thing about Caviar, is that, it is not so expensive as Ten, which I love too, by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> SOFT AS SILK</li>
            <li> Salon soft hair and helps maintain my color and highlights.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> It makes your hair so soft and</li>
            <li> I have had two complete washes and I have no complaints.  </li>
            <li> and it stays soft all day.</li>
            <li> makes my hair incredibly soft ...</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> So far I like the shampoo</li>
            <li> but I have a sensitive scalp</li>
            <li> Makes the texture of my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft, shiny &amp; manageable.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Alterna makes a really good product, but it&#x27;s not great, especially at this price point.</li>
            <li> The bottles are fairly small, so I may start ordering their super large size from now on to save the hassle and money.</li>
            <li> It is really special and costs half of what I was buying it before.</li>
            <li> My hair is more manageable and less dry.  </li>
            <li> It is very rich so a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> previously used different expensive brands, but the best Alterna not found!!</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, so this product is great so that my hair feels weightless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind of a splurge for shampoo/conditioner, but my last order lasted me about half a year.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair super soft and shiny with plenty of body (will hold a style all day with addition of a little texturizer).  </li>
            <li> No other product has made my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Alterna is one of the very few companies who&#x27;s entire product line is Gluten Free!  </li>
            <li> We live in a humid climate and these products have complete gotten rid of any frizz left over after drying.  </li>
            <li> It makes hair silky and smooth and it takes very little product when using.</li>
            <li> and then I started noticing not really a build up but more of an odd greasy feeling around the scalp.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy, fine, and thick hair.</li>
            <li> and now I can just blow dry my hair straight and no frizziness.  </li>
            <li> My hair had felt really damaged and dry</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, you just need to make sure you use enough water.</li>
            <li> You need only a little dab, so it goes a long way, and three years in it&#x27;s still my favorite.</li>
            <li> I am interested to discover if the moisturizing is accumulative over repeated use as their other Caviar products are.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is sulfate-free (which is a requirement in my book) and the conditioner works like no other.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, healthy, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> After, I repeat the process with a little more shampoo and then work it into a lather down to the tips of my hair.  </li>
            <li> think that based on the positive experience from the majority of other people, you may want to try it.  </li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for natural hair products that actually work.</li>
            <li> So far Ojon is the only brand that works.  </li>
            <li> I have been having success with a few of the products from the Phyto line and going to try out Fekkai.</li>
            <li> At first my hair felt soft and shine, but after drying it, it was stiff and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I normally use Redken products, and this was more expensive per fluid ounce, and seemed to be some \\&quot;no-name\\&quot; brand shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> Went to a new salon and they used this on my dry damaged color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Allows me to blow dry straight with ease and my hair straightens with a straight iron with just a few passes.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner have been the only products I&#x27;ve found that actually make my hair soft and manageable again.  </li>
            <li> i have frizzy, dry, thin hair that breaks very easily...</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re a platinum blonde and deal with dryness.. or just dryness in general, this is what you need!</li>
            <li> I thought there was no help for my 43 year old hair and that I was getting to the age where I was going to have to cut my long locks off.  </li>
            <li> Since then, I have gone back to purchase individual bottles only to find they are marked</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a long time to find a product that will maintain that soft silky look.  </li>
            <li> I have thick red hair and this is the only shampoo/conditioner set that helps my hair stay smooth.    </li>
            <li> I have straight fine hair, and it has felt a little dry and frazzled over the past couple of years.</li>
            <li> I blow dry it straight and my hair is highlighted (therefore dry and chemically processed)....</li>
            <li> and I did notice it had a little more lather then usual.</li>
            <li> and I naturally can have dry hair and</li>
            <li> and I literally felt the dry and brittle hair melt into this soft and silky texture while I was conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li> These products help to keep my dry hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I even went 3 days without washing my hair which is impossible for my mediterranean oily skin, but on day 3 my hair still looked good.  </li>
            <li> Amazon carries the brand she uses, but I decided to go with Alterna because it was slightly less expensive and had good reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been busy and preoccupied with work in the last month, but recently realized my hair is dry and breaking.  </li>
            <li> I was certain that I had just wasted my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i have long blonde hilighted hair that was very knotty and dried out, especially from the summer at the beach and pool..</li>
            <li> After using this Alterna shampoo and conditioner, I was worried because my hair felt more knotty than usual when it was wet, like the conditioner wasn&#x27;t heavy enough.</li>
            <li> It feel lights and after you&#x27;re done, your hair feels soft, looks shiny and doesn&#x27;t get frizzy as often as it does with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I use a hair dryer and flat iron daily and this product keeps my hair from getting damaged.  </li>
            <li> I flat iron daily</li>
            <li> In short, it is hard to believe how much difference these products made in the texture of my hair in just one use!  </li>
            <li> Use very little in your hand, it will last much longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but a small amount goes a long way and really repairs your hair!</li>
            <li> not sure I would spend this much again because I don&#x27;t see much different than cheaper shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Usually the first shampoo following a trip to the salon leaves my hair dry and wiry looking.  </li>
            <li> Uses only a small bit of product and cleans and shines hair very well.  </li>
            <li> I initially bought a $40 gift set marked down to $24 for the holidays (40 % off sale).  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s one of the last ingredients unlike other products in which dimethicone is one of the first few ingredients.</li>
            <li> As a product junkie, I&#x27;m constantly trying out different lines, but because I&#x27;ve received so many compliments after using caviar, I&#x27;m afraid to switch.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but you really don&#x27;t need much each time, so I can make a bottle last about 6-7 months!</li>
            <li> I have been so embarassed of my scalp issue for too long and this product has finally helped me.</li>
            <li> I always had to use a flat iron</li>
            <li> I have hair down to my waist and I am 50 years old, ...</li>
            <li> Only issue is that it made my hair a little too soft and because it&#x27;s curly, it didn&#x27;t have a lot of volume.</li>
            <li> The only brand that I can get away with a small amount if conditioner and it spreads through my thick hair easily.</li>
            <li> And no longer flat and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah!</li>
            <li> My husband, who thinks all shampoos are equal and complained about how much I was spending on shampoo/conditioner, started using it and is now converted.    </li>
            <li> Leaves hair silky soft &amp; less frizzy.</li>
            <li> the next day my scalp was dry and itchy causing me to have flakes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Especially when paired with a sleek blow dry and straighten.</li>
            <li> It makes it feel very soft, and my ends a lot less dry.</li>
            <li> I have always had fine hair, but with age it is very weak.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Ojon Color shampoo and conditioner which is similar in price to the Alterna but certainly not the same results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure any product will give me back my old hair, but this atleast given my hair some life back.</li>
            <li> Started using these products several months ago after trying several other shampoo and conditioner combos.  </li>
            <li> I actually find that I only have to wash my hair every other day when I use this shampoo.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product from OTHER venders numerous times prior without ANY problems.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested I try this shampoo when she noticed my hair had little natural shine.  </li>
            <li> I used less than half of that with Alterna and still had way, way too much shampoo</li>
            <li> get my thick, baby fine hair cut at an Aveda salon and have been using their products as suggested by my stylist for the past year.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long, highlighted towards the bottom, and tends to be frizzy and wavy if not styled.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a shampoo that works for my hair for a long time.  </li>
            <li> After I grew out my roots a bit and did the ombre style it got too heavy (because of my natural oils)</li>
            <li> reference, I am in my early 30&#x27;s and do get highlights and/or low-lights in my hair every few months.</li>
            <li> My hair is so knotted after I use the shampoo and conditioner and the conditioner smells strange.</li>
            <li> I have grown my hair out long</li>
            <li> The shampoo goes a long way</li>
            <li> The conditioner is not as intense as I need ( I have long thick hair).  </li>
            <li> but something was wrong with the conditioner top and it won&#x27;t squeeze out (even turned upside down)</li>
            <li> As far as this seller, the price is half of what these items sell for elsewhere!</li>
            <li> This hair product is worth the money to repair unhealthy dry hair and restore its shine.</li>
            <li> but I live in a small town.  </li>
            <li> This one is a little more expensive but it works just as well</li>
            <li> I ombre bleached and tinted my hair purple recently and this shampoo and conditioner does not strip the color out of my hair like other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for several years, after I started having allergic reactions to other products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other types of Alterna shampoo and conditioners and I keep coming back to these.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter who has very long hair.</li>
            <li> Hair remained dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> My hair was getting dry, tangled, and frizzy</li>
            <li> Both of them help your dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li> and my scalp does not feel dry.</li>
            <li> If you have processed or dry hair would recommend.</li>
            <li> These products moisturize dry hair.</li>
            <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s and have blond colored hair and can sometimes get dry.</li>
            <li> I have highlights in my hair which has made my hair dry at times.</li>
            <li> Also, if I just let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> Clears up the dry ends</li>
            <li> Moisturizing but a little flat the second day.</li>
            <li> I have very long dark hair that was formally blonde.  </li>
            <li> I decided to order this as a treat for my hair, I usually just buy products costing less than $5.00, but this time I wanted to see if you really do get what you pay</li>
            <li> It does not make my hair feel soft and shiney as it has done so in the past.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way too do the bottle will last you a long time!</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s and my hair has changed drastically over the past year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty dry and a little damaged, so I always have to use a thick conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is half natural and half relaxed as I am growing my relaxer out.</li>
            <li> I would never have thought something you wash down the drain could make such a difference!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair and normally use a palm size measure of shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I love the product but it is too expensive to be my everyday shampoo and conditioner along 2258th my other qualms.</li>
            <li> - looks like I stepped out of the salon letting it air dry!  </li>
            <li> For a moisturizing set, I had expected for it not to be dry, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I was excited to try Alterna given the lack of sulfates and other questionable ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I found that the shampoo left my hair feeling a little dry after I washed it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very dry, and does not hold color well.  </li>
            <li> The texture is very dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very dry.  </li>
            <li> I actually really didn&#x27;t want to like this shampoo and conditioner, because even on amazon, it&#x27;s on the expensive side when you have long hair and use a lot; the bottles aren&#x27;t very big.</li>
            <li> Less expensive and hassle free.</li>
            <li> I have long, dark, wavy hair that I have to blow dry every day</li>
            <li> I have tried every shampoo and conditioner for my extra long, wavy hair and nothing has ever seemed to tame my lion&#x27;s mane...especially living in the Florida humidity.</li>
            <li> What promised to replenish and restore dry hair actually has been depleting and destroying my hair.  </li>
            <li> but I can tell how it smooths  out my dry hair due to all the coloring that Ive done thru out the yrs.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is with the actual container the items come in.  </li>
            <li> Is expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars, tried brands like CHI,Milano, Morrocanoil and none of them</li>
            <li> Expensive, but totally worth the cost...</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive but it is totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> I have thin straight hair.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> the moisture control means less static, especially in the cold weather!</li>
            <li> You would never guess that the bottom half of my hair has been bleached and then re-dyed about 7-10 times... depending on how far down the strands you go, and blow dried</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and always have issues with finding a conditioner that doesnt weigh my hair down...</li>
            <li> but then my hair is heavy, coated and flat...</li>
            <li> The older I get, the worse my hair behaves.  </li>
            <li> As others said, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long ways</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t loose half of it combing it out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Might be a little too heavy for daily use if your hair isn&#x27;t real dry.</li>
            <li> Usually dimethicone makes me breakout, even in haircare products (jawline, under bangs, back)</li>
            <li> Of course the prices on here are way lower than other places I looked.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day and my hair already looks way shinier, healthier, and smoother.</li>
            <li> It has been 4 weeks of washing every other day and my hair is still as purple as the day I tinted it.</li>
            <li> I bleach and color my hair every other month.</li>
            <li> I have not even added any other product to my hair either.</li>
            <li> I also want to try some of the other products in this Caviar line.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> It feels like i have a lot of hair and they are extremely moisturized.</li>
            <li> But, when I dried my hair, it was a bit dry.  </li>
            <li> I wear my hair long and - due probably to a combination of the natural effects of getting older and using a straightening iron for the past several years - had been really frustrated lately with my dry, split-ended, lifeless hair.  </li>
            <li> The bottles are made of a very dense stiff plastic that is very hard to squeeze and you MUST squeeze the livin&#x27; bejeezus out of these bottles to get any product (especially the conditioner because it&#x27;s so thick).</li>
            <li> Does not weigh my hair down, like some other products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I noticed the difference in my hair texture (dry, stiff) and sheen not what it had been with Alterna products.  </li>
            <li> Before using the Alterna Caviar Shampoo and Conditioner my hair felt coarse and looked dull.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is bottle is tooooooo hard to squeeze.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the packaging...</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel coarse and thick</li>
            <li> Not great for the price - surprised because my hairdresser recommended it.</li>
            <li> Also if you thinner hair it might weigh your hair down a bit.</li>
            <li> I have probably tried about 10 other shampoos with little to no benefit.</li>
            <li> After reading Amazon and other Internet reviews,  I settled on the Alterna Anti-aging (that caught my eye!)</li>
            <li> Usually when I air dry my hair</li>
            <li> Compared to Aveda, my previous shampoo and conditioner regimen, I definetly, hands down, prefer Alterna.</li>
            <li> but it did not help with calming the frizz as previous reviewers boasted about.</li>
            <li> Blow outs time was cut by half..</li>
            <li> (you get less w/Altena).</li>
            <li> cause I use less</li>
            <li> The odd thing is my hair didn&#x27;t look greasy.</li>
            <li> I asked (I am black).</li>
            <li> so while it is expensive it will last a lot longer than regular drugstore shampoo.  </li>
            <li> When I order the product, it always arrives in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> thick long hair and</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to try these products as I could see that these don&#x27;t work for everyone.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt silky and shiny, and I needed little additional product to make my hair sleek and non-frizzy while drying.  </li>
            <li> A little price as anywhere..</li>
            <li> Seriously, a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> A put a little bit on the ends, and I do not rinse it at all.  </li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s even with storing them upside down!  </li>
            <li> and this beats them all hands down!  </li>
            <li> My hair was quite dried out after using this product.</li>
            <li> Got my hair colored a few weeks ago and bought a trial pack at my salon.  </li>
            <li> It could make your hair heavy.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money...</li>
            <li> also the conditioner moisturizes without being too heavy</li>
            <li> The shampoo dried out my skin and the conditioner</li>
            <li> was so heavy that I could not style my hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was wayyy too harsh on my hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip and the conditioner isn&#x27;t greasy nor heavy.</li>
            <li> It is just way too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> but the conditioner is just WAY TOO HEAVY.</li>
            <li> My hair was greasy after just a few hours and felt heavy while blow drying it.</li>
            <li> I was in search of a shampoo and conditioner set that would help relieve my aging, frizzy, and dried hair.</li>
            <li> I have seen improvements, my frizzy and dried hair is no longer.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this WAY overpriced shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Been using this for a few years and WILL NOT  allow myself to run out.  </li>
            <li> but instead of being moisturizing it dried out my hair</li>
            <li> The condition of my hair has improved since I started using it a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Kind of annoying since it&#x27;s such an expensive set!</li>
            <li> And they have become much less fall out!</li>
            <li> also less tangles!</li>
            <li> This shampoo claims it has very less chemicals.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair neat and tame looking.</li>
            <li> after i took a shower and towel dried my hair, it felt very soft but it had an annoying waxy feel that left my hands with a sticky residue from the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Also, you need to use very little product and hair/scalp stay cleaner longer.  </li>
            <li> However, this combo leaves my hair feeling silky and has seriously cut down the frizz factor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unbelievable</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past</li>
            <li> I begin by putting a small amount of shampoo in the palm of my hands and rubbing it into a lather.  </li>
            <li> After I rinse that, I take a small amount of conditioner and work it in.  </li>
            <li> guess I&#x27;m willing to pay a crazy price, for now anyway!</li>
            <li> It conditions my color treated hair without making it limp and lifeless!  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll repurchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but I will continue using Alterna Caviar products.</li>
            <li> It made it hard and stiff.</li>
            <li> have to say that I am disappointed, it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel any different from the less expensive products I normally use.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product two stars because:  my scalp is dry, I saw no noticeable difference in my hair, and the bottles are ridiculously difficult to squeeze.  </li>
            <li> Split ends, frizzy, dull, lifeless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to get me to say</li>
            <li> I had a hard time rinsing out the conditioner from my hair</li>
            <li> Anyway, I have fairly thick, wavy hair that I straighten and get colored.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, color treated and heat damaged hair, and I can not believe what this did to my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i would recommend this product to those who have unruly, thick hair that needs to be tamed.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and color treated, my daughter&#x27;s is thick, wavy and color treated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish Alterna would redesign the bottle into a pump or something easier to get the thick conditioner out.</li>
            <li> after my hair had completely dried, it felt heavy and looked very thin and stringy.  </li>
            <li> I saw less color going down the drain when I used this shampoo combined with rinsing with cold water.  </li>
            <li> I am skeptical about spending a lot money on cosmetics, but I have always used salon shampoos to preserve my color, and this is unlike any other shampoo/conditioner I have used.  </li>
            <li> It works no better than the ION brand that I get for about $8 a bottle at Sally&#x27;s!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to start by saying that the price is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> They are very thick plastic, and since I have arthritis in my hands, I had a hard time squeezing them to get the product to come out.  </li>
            <li> It is a little expensive</li>
            <li> Expensive and hair turned out limp and greasy.</li>
            <li> not good for those with my hair type.  </li>
            <li> but it was not good.</li>
            <li> so I tried another conditioner -- not nearly as good.)</li>
            <li> the bottles are a very hard plastic which is a little difficult to squeeze.</li>
            <li> I can hardly believe it!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very difficult to squeeze the product out of the bottles, especially when my hands are wet. :(</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair but a lot of it</li>
            <li> my crazy colored curly hair seems to be less frizzy since i started using alterna!!</li>
            <li> following a nasty long cold winter which made it look like straw!  </li>
            <li> I used to use Alterna and switched because it is rather expensive.</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars to this product because this is unable to prevent split</li>
            <li> I was not impressed at all by this product for the price.</li>
            <li> I am still looking though for something else because Ojon is really expensive.  </li>
            <li> They also have some ABSURD review requirements, and I have NO IDEA</li>
            <li> Expensive, but never using anything else again.</li>
            <li> I figured if they sell it, it must not be mediocre.  </li>
            <li> and i use expensive salon products.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to have to return</li>
            <li> Difficult to squeeze out the product, too.</li>
            <li> Sadly, both the shampoo AND conditioner leaked from faulty bottles........</li>
            <li> The plastic bottles are not flexible, difficult to get the shampoo and cream rinse out of the bottles.</li>
            <li> Is it expensive?</li>
            <li> It just felt weird to me, it didn&#x27;t seem to lather</li>
            <li> I will finish the bottles because it was expensive; however, I will not be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I do not like at all and unfortunately had to sell it on Ebay to get rid of it. :(</li>
            <li> Very expensive.  </li>
            <li> Too bad the bottles are soooo small!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s practically impossible.  </li>
            <li> after I get it, I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I have not been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> WRONG!!</li>
            <li> I was VERY disappointed with the way this product was shipped.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;OrÃ©al at Albertson isn&#x27;t the worst substitute to this overpriced &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Hate to be without it!</li>
            <li> The worst part?  </li>

            <li> Started using these products several months ago after trying several other shampoo and conditioner combos.  Hair remained dry and frizzy.  Hair is regularly color treated , which is undoubtedly  the reason for my problems.  Even tried a well advertised &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; conditioning product.  For whatever reason, this is the only shampoo/conditioner that works for me.  I also use the mousse for creating volume.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> I really like this brand and I must add that its so much cheaper than buying it from Sephora. The shampoo and conditioner made my hair really soft and moisturized it a lot than before. Only issue is that it made my hair a little too soft and because it&#x27;s curly, it didn&#x27;t have a lot of volume. Great brand and it would still recommend it</li>
            <li> too heavy for my hair which is fine</li>
            <li> Best shampoo ever!!! Can never go back to anything else. Conditioner is very good also?</li>
            <li> My hair was getting dry, tangled, and frizzy I thought there was no help for my 43 year old hair and that I was getting to the age where I was going to have to cut my long locks off.  I was a little hesitant to try these products as I could see that these don&#x27;t work for everyone.  After my first wash I thought these were pretty good, and after 2 weeks of using it, my hair almost looks airbrushed. It&#x27;s unbelievable the change I&#x27;ve seen in my hair.  I even went 3 days without washing my hair which is impossible for my mediterranean oily skin, but on day 3 my hair still looked good.  These products are the best I&#x27;ve ever used even better than the overpriced Kerastase.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal - cannot beat the price. Shipping was fast and the products are each 8.5 fl oz. This is a great shampoo and conditioner set that has no sulfates (makes it brazilian treatment and keratin treatment friendly), contains a heat protectant and is very moisturizing. I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I have thick red hair and this is the only shampoo/conditioner set that helps my hair stay smooth.    The fragrance is heavenly, but not overpowering.      I actually find that I only have to wash my hair every other day when I use this shampoo.    As far as this seller, the price is half of what these items sell for elsewhere! A+</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and I believe that the purchase I made through Amazon has been tampered with.  It does not make my hair feel soft and shiney as it has done so in the past.  I thought that by buying it through Amazon I would get a break on the price but instead I made a big mistake.  Next time I will purchase this product at a beauty salon and pay the extra cost.  NOT HAPPY.</li>
            <li> Alterna Caviar is a great product.  My hair looks and feels great, and the shampoo and conditioner have a pleasant smell.  I&#x27;d buy again!</li>
            <li> I recently started using this shampoo and conditioner after a friend recommended it.  I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.  My hair is long and tangles easily so I always had to use a detangler after washing my hair.  I was so happy to find that I didn&#x27;t need a detangler anymore.  This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair feeling very clean, soft, and tangle free.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I was originally going to get Nanoworks by Pureology because of how many people I know that have used it but was put off by the price so I started reading some of the reviews.  While the reviews are good for Nanoworks, someone recommended Alterna.  After reading so many positive reviews I decided to try it.    All I can say is that I can totally tell a difference since using this.  I have long, dark, wavy hair that I have to blow dry every day so I really need something that is going to work.    My husband, who thinks all shampoos are equal and complained about how much I was spending on shampoo/conditioner, started using it and is now converted.    I didn&#x27;t purchase mine from Amazon because I was out of shampoo and couldn&#x27;t wait so I got my from Ulta (with a coupon), but I have ordered several things in the past from Amazon.com and have always had a good experience.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order it from here in the future.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.  Really makes a difference!</li>
            <li> The Caviar shampoo restores the health and shine back into your hair. It was noticeable to me and my hair dresser that didn&#x27;t know that I had bought the product. If you have the funds go for the splurge.</li>
            <li> The alterna caviar shampoo and conditioner are really great products. Yes it costs twice as much (or more) than other products but you also use half as much and your hair looks twice as good and it&#x27;s twice as easy to mange/style.  I think it&#x27;s worth it. The conditioner is maybe more moisturizing than I need, having very fine hair, but I just use it sparingly and it seems to work well, not too heavy.  The conditioner does have dimethicone in it so that&#x27;s a draw back if you&#x27;re avoiding silicones. However, like I said it works well used sparingly so the amount of dimethicone may not affect you. Usually dimethicone makes me breakout, even in haircare products (jawline, under bangs, back) but this product seems not to, probably bc it&#x27;s one of the last ingredients unlike other products in which dimethicone is one of the first few ingredients. Hope this helps. I&#x27;d say try it.</li>
            <li> I actually really didn&#x27;t want to like this shampoo and conditioner, because even on amazon, it&#x27;s on the expensive side when you have long hair and use a lot; the bottles aren&#x27;t very big. Of course the prices on here are way lower than other places I looked. Anyway, I have fairly thick, wavy hair that I straighten and get colored. It&#x27;s pretty dry and a little damaged, so I always have to use a thick conditioner. After using this Alterna shampoo and conditioner, I was worried because my hair felt more knotty than usual when it was wet, like the conditioner wasn&#x27;t heavy enough. But then I styled as usual, and I couldn&#x27;t believe how great my hair looked! No frizz, none of that \\&quot;soft\\&quot; flyaway look that I can&#x27;t stand, it just looked smooth and perfect. I&#x27;ll be buying this again and again!</li>
            <li> excellent price! leaves hair feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li> I used to use Alterna and switched because it is rather expensive. However, I have switched back again because it&#x27;s worth the cost. I get so many compliments on how shiny &amp; soft my hair is. It smells great, and leaves my hair feeling awesome. I recommend this to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. I have been on the hunt for natural hair products that actually work. Having tried several at lower price points, I finally decided to give Alterna a try. Specifically, I was looking for an &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; product because my sister raved about her new shampoo and conditioner that was marketed under that term. Amazon carries the brand she uses, but I decided to go with Alterna because it was slightly less expensive and had good reviews. So far, I&#x27;m on my second bottle of each and absolutely love it. The scent is wonderful--more on the earthy, Aveda side than a floral. My hair is long, highlighted towards the bottom, and tends to be frizzy and wavy if not styled. I still use products after I wash, but this stuff really makes the texture more manageable. My hair looks gooooood.</li>
            <li> I was surprised after all the rave reviews for the shampoo and conditioner that I was thoroughly unimpressed with the product...I used the shampoo and conditioner twice to make sure but it did not help with calming the frizz as previous reviewers boasted about. Nor, did my hair feel great...So, I have decided to sell the set and buy something I will like....Just so you know, my hair texture is fine and naturally wavy. I blow dry it straight and my hair is highlighted (therefore dry and chemically processed)....But this product did nothing for me and I would have never known the difference between this product and those selling at the drugstore. I have been having success with a few of the products from the Phyto line and going to try out Fekkai.</li>
            <li> After doing so much research i found this product and it worked really nice for my dry and damaged and chemically processed hair. It feels so good after shampooing and conditioning. This is my second set. My first set is getting over so i wanted to stock up this product. I have bought one more set of this product for my mom too..This shampoo claims it has very less chemicals. I hope it is true. I gave 4 stars to this product because this is unable to prevent split ends otherwise my hair feels really good.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product for colored hair.  My hair is now full of body and shines like the day it was colored.  I will buy this again...plus the holiday gift set is a nice size for the money.</li>
            <li> Make no sense to my hair. But a lot of ppl like it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, i love , love ,love it! makes your hair feel and look younger. I could tell a big difference after the fist time i used it, and there is no animal testing. worth the price.[[ASIN:B000VHH712 Alterna Caviar Seasilk Moist Shampoo, 8.5-Ounce Bottle]]</li>
            <li> I love all the products of alterna, use them for more than 2 years. previously used different expensive brands, but the best Alterna not found!!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested I try this shampoo when she noticed my hair had little natural shine.  I am in my early 40&#x27;s and I believe hormonal changes (hello, perimenopause!)are starting to effect my skin and hair.  In short, it is hard to believe how much difference these products made in the texture of my hair in just one use!  My hair felt silky and shiny, and I needed little additional product to make my hair sleek and non-frizzy while drying.  I am skeptical about spending a lot money on cosmetics, but I have always used salon shampoos to preserve my color, and this is unlike any other shampoo/conditioner I have used.  I would never have thought something you wash down the drain could make such a difference!</li>
            <li> Moisturizing but a little flat the second day. It smells wonderful for about 24 hours. I am interested to discover if the moisturizing is accumulative over repeated use as their other Caviar products are.</li>
            <li> Amazing !!! loved my hair after using this product .. Blow outs time was cut by half.. I recommend this product .. Must try  !!!!</li>
            <li> I do recommend Alterna Caviar as a product. It&#x27;s a great way to smooth out course, wavy hair like mine. Item was priced below all other online sellers and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> I absolutey love this shampoo and conditioner it has made my hair stop falling out and made so much new hair growth. My hair does not get damaged with this shampoo and the smell is great I also recommend the CC cream by alterna it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t get along...</li>
            <li> Had A problem with the cap on the shampoo bottle otherwise it is great</li>
            <li> This and Kerastase are the best products I&#x27;ve ever used. This one is a little more expensive but it works just as well (you get less w/Altena). Both of them help your dry damaged hair. U need to continue using it though.</li>
            <li> Needed something to help my over-processed, color treated hair. Tried this in their travel set, now I can&#x27;t be w/out them. Smell is light &amp; refreshing doesn&#x27;t over power. Leaves hair silky soft &amp; less frizzy. Got my sister hooked on this set too. Is expensive but worth it. Can find descent prices w/Amazon &amp; Haircare Outlet.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I love this shampoo and conditioner. I had inqured from my stylist a shampoo that would give me a salon effect, that I could use at home in between visits and Alterna was recommended. I can honestly say I don&#x27;t regret this choice at all. My hair feels and looks so healthy, its easier to manage and has a lasting affect on the hair. I&#x27;m so glad I decided to purchase this product. I get excited to wash my hair because I know the end results are going to be amazing.</li>
            <li> this is the best hair product!</li>
            <li> I decided to order this as a treat for my hair, I usually just buy products costing less than $5.00, but this time I wanted to see if you really do get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I am disappointed, it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel any different from the less expensive products I normally use.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again</li>
            <li> I learned about this product using a sample from a department store. This is a really nice product on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed at all by this product for the price. The conditioner did as good of job as a cheap bottle of suave. My hair was quite dried out after using this product.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo conditioner combo. It&#x27;s pricey but a small amount goes a long way and really repairs your hair! It so much cheaper on Amazon than Sephora!</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel coarse and thick</li>
            <li> Great value fast delivery!</li>
            <li> you will notice SIGNIFICANT results after ONE use! if you&#x27;re a platinum blonde and deal with dryness.. or just dryness in general, this is what you need! My hairdresser used it on my once and I immediately ordered it on here after. so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars b/c I love this product. I bought the travel size from Sephora. The smell is AMAZING but my hair dresser told me that buying from Amazon sometimes they put extra ingredients in the products that&#x27;s why they can sell them cheaper! well I tried Alterna shampoo last night and I did notice it had a little more lather then usual. I really hope Amazon isn&#x27;t doing that. I love shopping on Amazon and want to continue to do so.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing moisturizing hair product. A little bit goes a long way too do the bottle will last you a long time!</li>
            <li> Love this. The only brand that I can get away with a small amount if conditioner and it spreads through my thick hair easily.</li>
            <li> Recently I received a sample for this shampoo and conditioner and once I used it I was sold. These products have improved my hair 10 fold. It has controlled my frizz and makes it shiny and smooth. I recommend these products to anyone what wants great looking hair!</li>
            <li> These products make my hair noticeably smoother and healthier.  I have thin hair that is slightly fly away.  But with Alterna my hair looks smooth, shiny, and so much  better. I used to use Joico, which is not bad at all, but this stuff is kind of miraculous. Since my hair does need help on a regular basis, I will now need to open a special savings account so I can keep buying Alterna Caviar hair products.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I can really tell a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I just love all this Alterna Caviar...especially the smell!  A little bit goes a long way, you just need to make sure you use enough water.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Alterna Caviar through my hair dresser.  I initially bought a $40 gift set marked down to $24 for the holidays (40 % off sale).  Since then, I have gone back to purchase individual bottles only to find they are marked $30 / ea!!  Might as well get the same stuff off of Amazon for dirt cheap.  So happy I found this.  It leaves my hair silky soft &amp; the moisture control means less static, especially in the cold weather!</li>
            <li> Before using the Alterna Caviar Shampoo and Conditioner my hair felt coarse and looked dull.  I have been using the products for about a month and I&#x27;ve seen a significant improvement in the way my hair looks and feels.  My hair stylist and even the shampoo lady have complimented about how soft my hair feels.  I have relaxed hair so I needed a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner and this worked.  The smell is nice and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  Got my hair colored a few weeks ago and bought a trial pack at my salon.  Very expensive.  It made my hair more smooth than before I had my hair colored.  I also love how its very moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t way your hair down.  If I want to wear my hair curly I can and it looks amazing!</li>
            <li> Easy to buy. Great product.</li>
            <li> Alterna makes amazing hair products, and I love the way it makes my hair so soft and I don&#x27;t loose half of it combing it out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a shampoo that works for my hair for a long time.  Most shampoos would make my hair feel heavy or greasy.  This shampoo is great! It is light weight and washes clean every time.  My hair feels extremely soft now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I had to be aware of is how to properly use it.  I begin by putting a small amount of shampoo in the palm of my hands and rubbing it into a lather.  Then I work it onto my scalp really well.  Then I rinse.  After, I repeat the process with a little more shampoo and then work it into a lather down to the tips of my hair.  After I rinse that, I take a small amount of conditioner and work it in.  I let it sit in my hair for a minute or so before I rinse again.  This works great! The tangles just fall right now and my hair is extremely soft.</li>
            <li> This hair product is worth the money to repair unhealthy dry hair and restore its shine. My hair was soft and appeared healthy in the first couple of washes. I am reordering it because I am saitisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Love these products!  Makes my hair look great, very manageable.  Awesome for color treated hair.  Best I&#x27;ve found to date..would recommend highly to anyone!</li>
            <li> I am a 43 year old female with fine medium brown hair colored blonde and cut in a bob to my shoulders.  My hair is very dry, and does not hold color well.  I have used the Lanza and Matrix hair products and really love them.  But, I wanted to try something new so I ordered this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the reviews, I really expected to love this product.  A few nice things about it are that for my fine hair, it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down like some moisturzing shampoo/conditioners do which is great.  Also, the smell is pleasant - unisex smell that reminds me an \\&quot;ocean breeze\\&quot; scent if that makes any sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The things that I didn&#x27;t like were that the shampoo dried my hair out, even though it was very easy to lather and seemed very gentle to my hair.  The conditioner is very creamy, and did balance out the drying effect of the shampoo a bit.  But, when I dried my hair, it was a bit dry.  For a moisturizing set, I had expected for it not to be dry, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this will not apply to most people, but I found the bottles difficult to use.  They are very thick plastic, and since I have arthritis in my hands, I had a hard time squeezing them to get the product to come out.  Again, not really a factor for most people, but wanted to mention it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that based on the positive experience from the majority of other people, you may want to try it.  But, for me, I will stay with Lanza as this is more moisturizing for my hair type.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner.  Leaves my hair so silky and moisturized.  It could make your hair heavy.  I have thin hair but a lot of it and I love it.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo ever. My hair is so soft. I love this product. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> My hair is kind of wavy but is so fine it easily goes limp when weighed down by product.  This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair super soft and shiny with plenty of body (will hold a style all day with addition of a little texturizer).  As an added bonus, it smells amazing! (I&#x27;d describe the fragrance as somewhere between floral and rainy/ozone scent but no ooey-gooey sweetness.)  I love it even though it is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> What is there not to love about this product? Super moisturizing and made my curls come back to life (no frizz either).</li>
            <li> I am in the process of trying several products for my hair trying to add moisture to it.  This product was ok but didnt give me the moisture I was looking for.  So far Ojon is the only brand that works.  I am still looking though for something else because Ojon is really expensive.  I most likely wouldnt buy this again unless there was a really good deal on it.</li>
            <li> Normally a use whatever is at the hotel shampoo person and take my own conditioner for long hair.  got a sample of this and thought i&#x27;d use it just so it did not go to wasteâ€¦.WOW.  First off, did not take a lot of shampoo to get my long hair into a good lather and yet still clean feeling with out dryness.  The conditioner is first i&#x27;ve used ever where my hair is just as moisturized and shiny and healthy looking as when i deep condition and then have to add leave in conditioner too.  This stuff is more than I would ever have imagined paying for shampoo or conditioner, let alone both but I have to say, it lasts longer cause I use less, my hair looks better and i have no use for leave in conditioners/argan oils/ sprays anymore!</li>
            <li> I found it on here for a great price and with fast shipping. A really great value! If you&#x27;ve never tried this product you definantly should.</li>
            <li> Nothing special! Waste of money... L&#x27;OrÃ©al at Albertson isn&#x27;t the worst substitute to this overpriced &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really like this combo as opposed to a drugstore shampoo/conditioner. My hair is nice and soft and shiny. It&#x27;s not life changing, but definitely worth the investment. I like this equally as much as the pureology brand I have used in the past and both companies seem to keep a good mind about the ingredients they put into their product:)</li>
            <li> I almost don&#x27;t want to say how awesome this shampoo &amp; conditioner is only because I would like to keep it &amp;#34;A Well Kept Secret&amp;#34; for My Use Only!</li>
            <li> When I initially ordered this product, I had immediate buyers remorse. I normally use Redken products, and this was more expensive per fluid ounce, and seemed to be some \\&quot;no-name\\&quot; brand shampoo/conditioner. I was certain that I had just wasted my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...until it came in the mail and I used it for the first time. Holy cow, this stuff is AMAZING. I have been a high end shampoo/conditioner user for years, and have tried every salon brand under the sun, but nothing compares to this stuff. It feels like I used a deep conditioner EVERY time I use this! I have thick, curly, color treated and heat damaged hair, and I can not believe what this did to my hair. You would never guess that the bottom half of my hair has been bleached and then re-dyed about 7-10 times... depending on how far down the strands you go, and blow dried about 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> my hair always feels soft and my scalp does not get too dry, which happens with most over the counter shampoos. also the conditioner moisturizes without being too heavy</li>
            <li> After using the Brazilian Blowout and the Coppola shampoo and conditioner for my double processed hair and keratin treated hair, I was unimpressed with how it felt.  After reading the reviews, my very long hair has so much body and is silky smooth.  I don&#x27;t even need any additional product with it - looks like I stepped out of the salon letting it air dry!  Will definitely be using this from now on.</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo, reading reviews on Amazon. Very satisfied! I have very much hair fell out from stress. I drank vitamins and used this shampoo. Hair with it are just silk, smooth, shiny, easy to comb and style. And they have become much less fall out!</li>
            <li> Great products.  It has literally changed my hair.  I have never found anything comparable.  Best shampoo and conditioner ever.  Worth the price</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo and conditioner I have used...and trust I have used many! After a hairdresser fried my hair 6 months ago I&#x27;ve been on a mission to restore their beauty and health. I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars, tried brands like CHI,Milano, Morrocanoil and none of them had the wow effect on my hair. This product is awesome! SO glad I&#x27;ve ried it. I&#x27;ve used it once so far and my hair was incredibly soft after the first wash and a lot shinier! Highly reccomend this one!!!</li>
            <li> Absolute love this line...tried a friends finishing spray and was so impressed I bought the shamp/cond and am SO glad I did! As someone who blow drys, straightens, and in the summer does highlights, my hair really takes a beating...this product is improving the condition of my locks better than any other line has! The closest I can compare to is Nanoworks by pureology, which is much pricier.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is great, the bottles design I think is actually very smart, I haven&#x27;t had a hard time squeezing as some reviewers have said. And like any sulfate free product, the larger is less than low quality chemical shampoos, but I think it is actually great for this shampoo, and the conditioner is nourishing without creating bulk or grease! (I&#x27;ve never written this long a review, but this product deserves the recognition!:)</li>
            <li> The store is great. It&#x27;s just that one can get the product from so many places it&#x27;s hard to justify giving more than 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I tried a trial version of this shampoo and conditioner before buying the bigger sizes. A little background first, I have been battling what seems to be psoriasis on my scalp for many years. I have gone to countless dermatologists and hair stylists and tried more products than I can remember. After one use of this shampoo and conditioner I could feel a difference in my hair AND scalp. I don&#x27;t get that itchy feeling anymore and my scalp does not feel dry. I have been so embarassed of my scalp issue for too long and this product has finally helped me. To top off this amazing product, it leaves my hair feeling smooth and shiny. I have naturally wavy, fine, and thick hair. Usually when I air dry my hair it just looks like a frizz ball. With this product, I can actually style my hair when I&#x27;m in a hurry and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it looking like I just stepped out of Studio 57. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind spending money on great hair products but this is way over price....saw no difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> My best friend sells/ uses Alterna in her salon! I love the product but it is too expensive to be my everyday shampoo and conditioner along 2258th my other qualms. I used this exclusively when I bleached my naturally black hair to a beach blonde and it helped keep my hair nice and soft. After I grew out my roots a bit and did the ombre style it got too heavy (because of my natural oils) and I had to switch. If you have processed or dry hair would recommend. Also if you thinner hair it might weigh your hair down a bit. Also I think it smells incredible!!!!!</li>
            <li> thick long hair and this is the only stuff that really has me feel like it washed and conditioned my hair! also less tangles!</li>
            <li> Good deal prompt recomend</li>
            <li> i love alterna. my crazy colored curly hair seems to be less frizzy since i started using alterna!! don&#x27;t love the scent on this alterna as much as the scent on the lighter purple instant recovery alterna product. but this one still seems to be as good in terms of controlling the frizz.</li>
            <li> Went to a new salon and they used this on my dry damaged color treated hair. It changed my hair. I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it. It literally changed my hair into bouncy, healthy, shiny full of body hair that lost that frizzy damaged dry look. I really am amazed. Ordered it here and tried it again. Same results. I just keep running my hands through my hair because it feels so good. This might be the best condition my hair has ever been in. Great product!</li>
            <li> This was just not enough for my chemically treated hair. The shampoo does go far though, you can tell it&#x27;s concentrated. Unfortunately not moisturizing enough for my damaged hair. I did not feel a difference.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the transaction. Would do business with this seller again. However, I did not like the product, which is not a fault of the seller. The shampoo dried out my skin and the conditioner was so heavy that I could not style my hair. I gave the product to my hairdresser who recommended it to me because she loves it.</li>
            <li> I feel that my hair got smoother after using it. I was using Dove and this is at least three times better. Plus the price was a bargain. The package arrived promptly in good condition.</li>
            <li> I tell every woman I know about this shampoo. It&#x27;s AWESOME!!! Expensive, but totally worth the cost...it leaves my hair silky, shiny and soft - a noticable difference. Worth every penny, much better than WEN.</li>
            <li> After having used these products for many years, I switched to try another product. I noticed the difference in my hair texture (dry, stiff) and sheen not what it had been with Alterna products.  Went back to using the products and very happy I did. Recommend highly!!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!  Can&#x27;t remember how many times I have purchased this set but this is by far my favorite shampoo and conditioner.  Every hair stylist I have been to asks what I use.  Hate to be without it!</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner is great! It makes my hair super soft and silky after using it and it feels so much healthier now. I love that it&#x27;s free from all of the harmful chemicals!</li>
            <li> The shampoo/conditioner made my hair feel really greasy within hours of washing. I have dryer hair so I thought this would work for me. I will finish the bottles because it was expensive; however, I will not be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Great product but pricey.  I only purchase on sale.</li>
            <li> The product adds moisture to my hair and makes it act and feel great!</li>
            <li> I have baby fine graying hair and have recently gone gluten free.  My hair...who would have thought to look at hair products for gluten!  But it&#x27;s everywhere including hair products.  However, these products are wonderful...leave my hair very clean and after a few weeks of use it reminds me of when I was young...it&#x27;s shiny, bouncing, and deep with color...well I color my hair and this product does not strip the color either...says it extends the color and I was in the middle of a coloring cycle and I&#x27;ve already gone a week longer than normal to color.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The smell is a fresh clean citrus. Really light scent that does not linger. Everything was wondering and then I started noticing not really a build up but more of an odd greasy feeling around the scalp. I do have an oily scalp and this seemed to encourage it. The odd thing is my hair didn&#x27;t look greasy. I found I needed to clarify often which I don&#x27;t like to do because it removes hair color. The products have wonderful things for the hair and it was really hard for to me give up on using the shampoo and conditioner. Plus, I have allergies so the lack of scent is great.   As for the bottles the top twist up and the product comes out from the center. The conditioner can be a pain to get out at times.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so soft!!!!</li>
            <li> Less expensive and hassle free. This is a great product for dry hair. Makes my hair soft and manageable. It has shine and movement. I love this product. Make sure to rinse well. I alternate this product with Coppola shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> The only problem is bottle is tooooooo hard to squeeze. Will probably not buy again. The product needs new packaging.</li>
            <li> Another case where the sample was a lot better than the actual product.  Expensive and hair turned out limp and greasy.</li>
            <li> I have been using Alterna Caviar products for about five years. The first time my stylist recommended them, I was taken aback. \\&quot;Aren&#x27;t these products for white people?\\&quot; I asked (I am black). She told me to just use them and I did ... and was hooked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This duo has been an integral part of my healthy hair journey. The shampoo is sulfate-free (which is a requirement in my book) and the conditioner works like no other. I urge anyone thinking about trying Alterna to try the sample sizes. I am sure you will be hooked afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Healthy hair is an investment I am willing to pay a premium for! Alterna may be pricey ... but it is worth it!</li>
            <li> i have frizzy, dry, thin hair that breaks very easily... after much research i bit the bullet and bought this combo.  i don&#x27;t mind buying pricey shampoo &amp; conditioner, so after reading reviews on amazon and sephora i purchased it with high hopes.  the shampoo is extremely thick which is awesome, lathers very well and has a very nice clean scent to it - the conditioner was thick in texture and a little goes a long way.  after i took a shower and towel dried my hair, it felt very soft but it had an annoying waxy feel that left my hands with a sticky residue from the conditioner. after my hair had completely dried, it felt heavy and looked very thin and stringy.  the next day my scalp was dry and itchy causing me to have flakes.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this product to those who have unruly, thick hair that needs to be tamed.  not good for those with my hair type.  instead i recommend living proof or bumble &amp; bumble thickening shampoo/conditioner that leaves hair feeling thick, clean and full of body.</li>
            <li> This product was just ok for my transitioning hair. My hair is half natural and half relaxed as I am growing my relaxer out. The shampoo was wayyy too harsh on my hair. It made it hard and stiff. The conditioner however did compensate and made my hair soften back up, but for the price, you can find something a lot better. Maybe a better product for people that don&#x27;t have curly or coarse, dry hair....more so normal, straight hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Was shipped on time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo and conditioner!! I had originally just purchased the conditioner but my stylist who uses this on my hair (where I orig fell in love) said it works SO much better if used together. So now that I use it together, I realize she is SO right. I have dry hair and always have issues with finding a conditioner that doesnt weigh my hair down...and this doesnt! it doesnt leave it greasy at all!</li>
            <li> I have tried many higher end hair care products, and this is my favorite currently for shine, softness, manageability and a pleasant scent.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Awesome hair products!</li>
            <li> Excellent .prompt service</li>
            <li> I love this set! It&#x27;s so good I don&#x27;t always need the conditioner. I use this, The Body Shop, and sometimes PhytoNectar or a keratin based shampoo. I will always spend more if a product really works for me, and so far, this really does! I tried to use up the rest of the Wen I have, but my hair is so brittle and FULL of snarls, that I had to use a ton of my good Josie Maran Argan Oil , so I now feel I could be used for a surfboard. Can&#x27;t wait to get back to good old shampoo! I&#x27;m now buying my second set of this in 2 days-I can&#x27;t afford to run out! P.S. DON&#x27;T purchase this from QVC-they&#x27;re overpriced, and shipping and tax would be more that you&#x27;d really want to pay. They also have some ABSURD review requirements, and I have NO IDEA what those would be, except I actually put in some asinine ones, and they got posted because they had 5 stars. Preferring to purchase through Amazon, thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought this duo after seeing Katie Holmes in the commercial. Honestly I prefer the Morocan Oil Hydrating Shanpoo better for dry, coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;I will finish up products, but return to the Moroccan products. They are truly the best !!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. The shampoo and conditioner gives me a good hair day every time I use it. Not too heavyâ€¦ perfect for fine hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was my crowning glory until medications and hormonal changes from a Double Mastectomy and Double OOPHERECTOMY caused breakage and unruly hair. This shampoo and conditioner are wonderful. When I wish to return to my straight hair (pre-medication and surgery hair) I use Moroccan Oil before using the straight iron. Great product.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Best pack ever!</li>
            <li> I bought a trial-sized version of the shampoo &amp; conditioner and CC cream from Sephora and love it.  I could see results (smoother, shinier hair!) after the first use.  I really like the CC cream, too - it nourished my hair and made it so shiny and smooth without weighing down my fine locks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I am in my early 30&#x27;s and do get highlights and/or low-lights in my hair every few months.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and condtioner</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, LATHERS &amp; CLEANS GREAT.</li>
            <li> These products have been wonderful for my fine hair. Since using my hair looks healthier, fuller, and stronger.</li>
            <li> My hair is so smooth and has the appearance of thicker hair.  I have really curly and frizzy hair so after blow drying I always had to use a flat iron and now I can just blow dry my hair straight and no frizziness.  Got a sample (can&#x27;t remember from where), loved it so much had to buy the full sized bottles.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! Completely extends the life of my color. If you want a sulfate free shampoo, this one is great!</li>
            <li> My husband loves the shampoo and conditioner.  I have very different hair and it works for me.  Smells great; hair feels soft and clean.  No after film.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner are the best I have ever used.  Quality ingredients and it also smells great!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is healthy and full of body.  When I switch out this shampoo/cond combo&lt;br /&gt;for built up sake, I can tell the difference...no other shampoo makes my hair feel this healthy.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is fantastic.  I was buying it from my hairdresser,  but she quit carrying it.  It is really special and costs half of what I was buying it before.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I always think that the more expensive something is the better it will be.  So after reading all of the reviews and thinking that the cost must be representative of the quality, I ordered this shampoo and conditioner.  It&#x27;s not that the shampoo/conditioner duo damaged my hair, but it just hasn&#x27;t done much for it.  Additionally I believe it&#x27;s made my head itch - I don&#x27;t normally have an itchy scalp but I&#x27;ve had one since Sunday when I washed my hair with this for the first time.  I&#x27;m giving this product two stars because:  my scalp is dry, I saw no noticeable difference in my hair, and the bottles are ridiculously difficult to squeeze.  If they would use a softer bottle they may not need to charge as much. One note; however, when users say you don&#x27;t need to use much - believe it.  I have very thick, coarse hair and normally use a palm size measure of shampoo.  I used less than half of that with Alterna and still had way, way too much shampoo so while it is expensive it will last a lot longer than regular drugstore shampoo.  I can&#x27;t say the same about the conditioner.  I used a little more than I normally would of that.</li>
            <li> My hair is gray and this shampoo works for me.  My hair is more manageable and less dry.  Have tried many shampoos, in the past, but nothing worked like this one.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It makes hair so soft and manageable.  It also smells great and a little goes a long way.  Plus I like that you can unscrew the cap to put into a smaller bottle to take with you for traveling.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try Alterna given the lack of sulfates and other questionable ingredients.  So far the results have been excellent.  My hair now has more shine and is healthier and smoother.  Both the shampoo and conditioner have had positive results so I would definetly recommend the &amp;#34;duo&amp;#34;.  Compared to Aveda, my previous shampoo and conditioner regimen, I definetly, hands down, prefer Alterna.</li>
            <li> Fabulous and really makes a difference after using for about a week.  I will not go without it!</li>
            <li> I use it every other day and my hair already looks way shinier, healthier, and smoother. It smells so good and it really washes my hair. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I have been getting my colored since middle school and I naturally can have dry hair and this shampoo works great! It makes my hair feel instanly better. I would still recommend doing deep conditioning treatments every 1-2 weeks with my hair.</li>
            <li> I like it. I can put my hair in a pony and go to sleep and when I wake up I don&#x27;t have to straighten it. Works great!&lt;br /&gt;Mo.&lt;br /&gt;San Diego, Ca</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be 45 next month and you could tell my age by my hair. Split ends, frizzy, dull, lifeless. I thought my life was over. Until...I started using Alterna. My hair has never looked better! I have shine, luster, fullness, no frizzies...and a smile! Expensive, but never using anything else again.</li>
            <li> We would have to ask my wife.  I do know that she would not use anything else!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never want to use anything else for your hair. I have blonde colored / highlighted hair, and by using this shampoo religiously I am always complimented on how healthy my hair looks. People always ask me what I use, I proudly let them know my secret is Alterna Caviar.</li>
            <li> I really like this brand and line for shampoo and conditioner!! Too bad the bottles are soooo small!!!! It&#x27;s pricey but I can tell how it smooths  out my dry hair due to all the coloring that Ive done thru out the yrs. I&#x27;ll def buy this again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner I love it for my hair I have curly hair and in the summer gets frizzy so this helps a lot</li>
            <li> Just a great shampoo and conditioner,  never leaves my roots greasy but definitely conditions my hair.  Looks, feels great and is so much more healthy and manageable.  What a great product</li>
            <li> I think these were a knock-off. The scent was right, but the packaging and consistency of the products was not the same as the ones I bought in a salon.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner made my hair feel soft but it made my face break out (swelling and pimples) so I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this duo for almost a year now and it has made a world of difference to the feel and texture of may hair.  Unlike many other products I&#x27;ve purchased over the years, I use every last drop of this stuff.  Well worth the money!!</li>
            <li> Heard great reviews and decided to try it. I used it when I was transitioning and my hair loved it. Now that I am all natural my hair still love it. Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> I have tried every shampoo and conditioner for my extra long, wavy hair and nothing has ever seemed to tame my lion&#x27;s mane...especially living in the Florida humidity. However, this combo leaves my hair feeling silky and has seriously cut down the frizz factor. I ombre bleached and tinted my hair purple recently and this shampoo and conditioner does not strip the color out of my hair like other products I have used. It has been 4 weeks of washing every other day and my hair is still as purple as the day I tinted it.</li>
            <li> Wow! It&#x27;s really hard to get me to say \\&quot;I love\\&quot; a shampoo &amp; conditioner. I&#x27;m a very picky person...I bleach and color my hair every other month. The texture is very dry and brittle. I used this shampoo and conditioner last night and I literally felt the dry and brittle hair melt into this soft and silky texture while I was conditioning my hair. It was amazing! This particular line has truly earned the name \\&quot;Caviar\\&quot;! Products I&#x27;ve used are Matrix, Joico, Nexus and the list goes on. I&#x27;ve never been \\&quot;in love\\&quot; with any of them but this product has really changed the way my hair feels. It&#x27;s soft to the touch and very silky. I have not even added any other product to my hair either. I normally add Moroccan Oil but I haven&#x27;t had to. I&#x27;m so very happy with this purchase! I ended up buying the set at a near by salon supply store. I recently found it on Amazon for way cheaper than you can buy in the stores and I would recommend  buying off of Amazon instead. I paid in the store $32.00 per bottle!</li>
            <li> This line is a really great product.  I read the many reviews and decided to give it a try, as I wanted to make a switch from Purology Nano (that&#x27;s really great too).  I just like changing up shampoos every once in a while and I had bought a huge container of Purology, so it had been a while.&lt;br /&gt;I first saw this shampoo on the Neiman Marcus website and it had received  a beauty award.  I figured if they sell it, it must not be mediocre.  I looked around the web @ Sephora and Ulta and read reviews there and priced it too. Best price was Amazon by a landslide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first experience with an Alterna product. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a nice smell and leave my hair very soft and super shiny.  I color my hair auburn and I&#x27;m alway worried about shampoos stripping the red out.  Not a problem with this line.  I saw less color going down the drain when I used this shampoo combined with rinsing with cold water.  I&#x27;ve seen a visible difference in the shine  and the smoothness of my ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m loving this duo and will buy in a larger size next purchase.  I also want to try some of the other products in this Caviar line.</li>
            <li> By far the best shampoo and conditioner that I have ever used!! It is a bit expensive but it is totally worth it.  My hair is soft, shiny and feels amazing!</li>
            <li> I read about this shampoo in the London Daily Mail.  It is worth every cent--it is rich and gentle.  The conditioner is a must--it leaves hair silky and fragrant.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner! My favorite so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before, back when I was Anti-Aging Seasilk Moisture Shampoo and it made my hair super healthy but they&#x27;ve changed the look and when I use it in the shower it doesn&#x27;t feel great but afterwards my hair is soft and smells good. My hair is super curly and it&#x27;s very easy to brush it out after using this it&#x27;s worth the money (:</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo  and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it and buying it from another website for awhile now, but this was a great price.  I&#x27;ve often heard that shampoos and conditioners are all the same and I often use Suave anyway, because I think it&#x27;s a great shampoo.  But I LOVE this brand and this particular shampoo.  There is something different about it.  I don&#x27;t use it every day but I use it a couple of times a week.  It makes my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I actually love these products.  I usually purchase the products from my salon but it is at a much higher price.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. Soft, shiny, beautiful hair. I started using Alterna products 13 years ago and will not use anything else!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying to get this set for awhile, but at Sephora each bottle (s+c) is about 30$. So glad I found both to be cheaper altogether!</li>
            <li> This is by far the VERY best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  There are no &amp;#34;over the counter&amp;#34; hair products in our house as we always buy specialty salon products.  After looking through many reviews, I decided on this one.  I am 100% happy with it.  I realize it&#x27;s more costly than other brands but our house will be stocking this product from now on.  My wife has curly hair and I have natural waves.  We live in a humid climate and these products have complete gotten rid of any frizz left over after drying.  I HIGHLY recommend this product.  It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for great hair products.  My hair is thick and color treated, my daughter&#x27;s is thick, wavy and color treated.&lt;br /&gt;Alterna makes a really good product, but it&#x27;s not great, especially at this price point. I found that the shampoo left my hair feeling a little dry after I washed it.  The conditioner works really well and the smell is great.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s hair is different and these products may be great for your hair.  Worth trying.</li>
            <li> This shampoo/moisturizer is the best. It makes hair silky and smooth and it takes very little product when using. I go thru one conditioner to two shampoos so that helps cut the cost of the product. This pair is a dynamic duo, especially for probelm hair. It is very rich so a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I like this its good will buy again .got a sample of the product from sophora first then went on ahead and bought some .expensive but good</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo/condition.  I alternate between this and the moroccain oil repair combo.  I have very long dark hair that was formally blonde.  After many years of bleaching my hair, i decided to go dark (my natural color) and this stuff has really helped it get its healthiest.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product ,I have been using alterna products for eight years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Alterna for 3 years now.  I swear the product has improved the texture and strengthen of my hair.  My hair is ultra fine all my life and at 65 I feared balding.  But something happened to strengthen my hair and I think it was this product.</li>
            <li> Love it. Silky, worked great on my hair. A little price as anywhere.. Probably cheaper around here on amazon.. Research the price before buying it..</li>
            <li> Terrific! The BEST Shampoo and Conditioner I&#x27;ve ever found!</li>
            <li> I love this shanpoo and conditioner. I used it years back and had to switch because it&#x27;s so expensive, but I went back to it because it really is the best. I have naturally wavy and frizzy hair, and it makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for several years, after I started having allergic reactions to other products.  The products leave my hair clean, shiny and soft.  But I still can style my fine hair to have some body.  Does not weigh my hair down, like some other products I&#x27;ve tried.  Keeps away the flyaways.</li>
            <li> Great deal. These products moisturize dry hair. I have thin straight hair. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip and the conditioner isn&#x27;t greasy nor heavy.</li>
            <li> I really love the way my dry,coarse hair feels with this shampoo and conditioner.It actually feels stronger.Now the true test will be how my hair looks and manages in the heat of our humid Fla.summers.</li>
            <li> Alterna Caviar Anti-agin seasilk moisture shampoo and conditioner is the best product i have used in years and i use expensive salon products.  My students noticed the first day i used it that my hair looked really different and nice and it was smooth and shiny and silky like it hasn&#x27;t been in years.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Pure hair gold! I got a sample package of this from another store and figured I would use it a couple times and throw it out like all the rest. WRONG!! I was stunned at the difference after just one use. my hair went from super fine, dull, limp and lifeless to shiny, healthy and full of bounce. No joke-one use. I have never been able to skip a day washing my hair, but suddenly I can.I can also go much longer between hair color than I had been able to.  The product is definitely on the higher end of the price scale, but it is so worth it. My only complaint is the packaging...the bottles are a very hard plastic which is a little difficult to squeeze.</li>
            <li> Everyone seems to virtually LOVE this shampoo and conditioner. Although I do love the smell...It is just way too heavy for my hair. I have very thick, healthy, color treated hair. I heard that this shampoo and conditioner was fabulous. I do like the shampoo but the conditioner is just WAY TOO HEAVY. My hair was greasy after just a few hours and felt heavy while blow drying it. I do not like at all and unfortunately had to sell it on Ebay to get rid of it. :( I will use the shampoo but won&#x27;t buy again. Not worth the price. Does NOT work for everyone.</li>
            <li> Switching to Alterna Caviar Seasilk Shampoo and Conditioner has given me the hair that I thought I&#x27;d never have again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get my thick, baby fine hair cut at an Aveda salon and have been using their products as suggested by my stylist for the past year.  And even though the haircut is good, the hair goes flat the day after a shampoo.  And it has no shine at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Alterna my hair is now shiny.  May I say that again just for the joy of it?  My hair is shiny!  And no longer flat and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah!</li>
            <li> Good service and as described. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  50&#x27;s, coarse gray hair, mid-length. Left my normally rough hair feeling soft and yet still curly.</li>
            <li> The reviews for this shampoo and conditioner convinced me to buy it.  My hair had felt really damaged and dry and I wanted a quick fix.  The shampoo and conditioner work okay but I wouldn&#x27;t say it changed my hair.  The shampoo smells good, a little perfume like but that didn&#x27;t bother me. It just didn&#x27;t make my hair feel better.  For the price it should feel like silk, I still had straw!</li>
            <li> One of the best products of Alterna. My hair is like silk, shiny and soft. My boyfriend was away for almost three months, when we met and he touched my hair he said \\&quot;I&#x27;ve almost forgot how beautiful your hair is\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it as a gift for several of my friends. All of them loved  this product. They say that hair looks and \\&quot;feels\\&quot; different, hair-styling is much easier now.&lt;br /&gt;One important thing about Caviar, is that, it is not so expensive as Ten, which I love too, by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I surely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been buying from this vendor for a while and have never had a problem but recently the alterna products they sell look like knock offs.  It is not the packaging you would see in the store.  I am now questioning whether this product is real - I don&#x27;t know why alterna would manufacture their product in different packaging for certain vendors.</li>
            <li> These products help to keep my dry hair soft and manageable. Well worth the price.  However, I always decant the  products into more manageable bottles. These purple containers are attractive, but useless.</li>
            <li> I was in search of a shampoo and conditioner set that would help relieve my aging, frizzy, and dried hair. I love this set! Both the shampooo and conditioner goes a long way and the price on Amazon is better than other sites. I have seen improvements, my frizzy and dried hair is no longer. I have silky and shiney hair again. Thank you Alterna!</li>
            <li> Love this combo! Makes your hair smooth and smell great</li>
            <li> If you want shampoo with great scent and texture but without phthalates and other scent-enhancing chemicals known as &amp;#34;endocrine disruptors&amp;#34; try this shampoo. It&#x27;s way better than some of the natural food store house brands.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft! I can&#x27;t buy anything else! My hair was completely transformed! You can use the shampoo and conditioner seperately or together for pretty much the same results.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo alittle costly but worth it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this WAY overpriced shampoo and conditioner.  It works no better than the ION brand that I get for about $8 a bottle at Sally&#x27;s!  The worst part?  The bottles are made of a very dense stiff plastic that is very hard to squeeze and you MUST squeeze the livin&#x27; bejeezus out of these bottles to get any product (especially the conditioner because it&#x27;s so thick). And that&#x27;s even with storing them upside down!  Rethink your price point AND your packaging Alterna; I won&#x27;t be a return customer!</li>
            <li> Amazing products! Especially when paired with a sleek blow dry and straighten. They make your hair look so sleek and full.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this brand but I live in a small town.  It was great to find them for such a good price. This stuff is magic.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner are amazing!  I&#x27;ve tried SOOO many other brands (Pureology, WEN, Bumble and Bumble, Ojon, Fredric Fekkai, etc) and this beats them all hands down!  My hair feels like silk, actually it feels better than silk!  It&#x27;s unbelieveable!  I had originally gone to Sephora to buy this and it is more than double the price for the shampoo and conditioner there.  This stuff from this seller is the real deal and SOOO much cheaper!  I compared my bottles I bought at Sephora to the ones I purchased at amazon and they are exactly the same, the shampoo &amp; conditioner smell the same, are the same consistency and they work the same too.  I know before I purchased the shampoo &amp; conditioner from here I wondered if they would be authentic and I am so happy they are.  I hope this review helps someone wanting to know the same thing.  I will never be ripped off by paying more for it again.</li>
            <li> Thanks for affordable pricing and fast service!!! I would definately order again when I run out. I would love to order liter sizes!</li>
            <li> I go back to this brand after trying others.  It does a good job moisturizing and smells good.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is fantastic.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> gREAT COMBINATION. lEAVES MY Hair clean AND CONDITIONER SOFT AS SILK</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner money can buy and all you need is a drop!  Seriously, a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not wonderful like some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read!</li>
            <li> Amazing shampoo and conditioner ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸyour hair will be super soft and shiny and it works on all types of hair</li>
            <li> WOW!  Did you know that Gluten is found in many different products that you use every day??? This may not matter to many, however, if you have an allergy to Gluten like I do, this information is of mega importance!  Alterna is one of the very few companies who&#x27;s entire product line is Gluten Free!  I started using their line and stopped using another line that contained gluten (unbeknownst to me) and guess what - My hair started growing like a weed!!!  This product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> This hair product really does seem to moisturize your hair. I use it combined with other shampoos and conditioners, but this is my favorite. It is a little expensive but I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Alterna Caviar for about 2 years now and I can&#x27;t see myself ever switching to a new brand.  It is well worth every penny! I use a hair dryer and flat iron daily and this product keeps my hair from getting damaged.  I&#x27;ve recommended this to many friends who now say they are addicted too!</li>
            <li> Salon soft hair and helps maintain my color and highlights. A LITTLE goes a long way!  Been using this for a few years and WILL NOT  allow myself to run out.  My hair is sleek, smooth and shiny.  Worth every penny to me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of hair products and Alterna is one love for ever. I still can not believe a shampoo can be this good, it made my hair so different! It feels like i have a lot of hair and they are extremely moisturized. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 1 week and it seems to be working. My hair is easier to detangle after washing /conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very difficult to squeeze the product out of the bottles, especially when my hands are wet. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other types of Alterna shampoo and conditioners and I keep coming back to these.  My hair is straight and I have a lot of it and it&#x27;s very dry.  I also color my hair.  This makes my hair thick and healthy and so well conditioned!  These are such fabulous products that I am elated to have found them!  Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Love the smell!!  I really love the shampoo, it cleanses so well without stripping moisture.  The conditioner is not as intense as I need ( I have long thick hair).  Love that it&#x27;s free of parabens, etc.</li>
            <li> This product did not work well on my hair.  Sorry to have to return but it was not good.</li>
            <li> The best line of hair products. I&#x27;ve used others but always come back to Alterna Caviar. Love the feel of my hair when I se this product.</li>
            <li> I like the caviar. I used it once and my hair was nice to touch. It should of been a bigger bottle for the price but the product is great.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s and my hair has changed drastically over the past year. It is drier and courser than ever before. I have probably tried about 10 other shampoos with little to no benefit. But this shampoo has really worked. I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks now and have seen a nice improvement in texture and shine. I&#x27;m not sure any product will give me back my old hair, but this atleast given my hair some life back.</li>
            <li> This time I purchased it for my sister who says that she cannot live without this product. She uses it for almost 5 years and no complains so far!</li>
            <li> Too expensive for me to buy regularly, but I really LOVE them both.  It doesn&#x27;t take much as compared to all the cheaper products I&#x27;ve purchased, but still pretty pricey per use.  It was a nice splurge for sure for my normally dry hair and scalp!</li>
            <li> I have never tried any of the Alterna products before. I am in my 40&#x27;s and have blond colored hair and can sometimes get dry. I tried the shampoo and conditioner as soon as it came to my door. What a difference it made on my hair. I have been using Ojon Color shampoo and conditioner which is similar in price to the Alterna but certainly not the same results. I will be using Alterna from now on. Since I am so pleased with the shampoo and conditioner, I want to try some of their other styling products.</li>
            <li> I used to use Living Proof, but changed because I couldn&#x27;t stomach the price. I decided to try Alterna and it was okay. My hair is so knotted after I use the shampoo and conditioner and the conditioner smells strange. I&#x27;ll use it until it&#x27;s done, but I won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
            <li> When I first began using it I thought it was fabulous. My hair seemed softer and shinier. After a couple of months, I noticed my hair became drier. My hairstylist noticed it too. I switched to a Keratin infused shampoo and conditioner and my hair has regained its shine and lustre.</li>
            <li> I have aging hair that has the &amp;#34;Brillo&amp;#34; quality after washing and moisturizing.  These products, in combination, are excellent for replacing body and shine.</li>
            <li> only used a couple of times but so far so good; i fear that the factory is discontinuing this line</li>
            <li> I love love love this shampoo and conditioner. Best I have ever tried. Not only is the product great, but their customer service is awesome as well :D :D :D</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo and conditioner for about one month.  I&#x27;ve been busy and preoccupied with work in the last month, but recently realized my hair is dry and breaking.  What promised to replenish and restore dry hair actually has been depleting and destroying my hair.  This morning I used a conditioner I had bought at the local coop. My hair feels so much better.</li>
            <li> The product duo and the price are AWESOME!!! I have coarse hair and these two are by far the best I have used for my hair. They also have a serum that you put on before you blow dryand it&#x27;s also awesome I bought it to.These products was used on me in a salon and the results was amazing after just one use but the salon prices was high as a kite. When I got home the fist thing I done was check amazon and to my utter joy thry had it and the price is well below the salon. If you decide to get these dont forget about the serum to if you have coarse or unruly or frizzy hair then you to will love these products.Angela</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to start by saying that the price is ridiculous.  I never thought I would spend this much on shampoo and conditioner.  I bought it for $31.00 per bottle at Ultra.  $62.00 plus tax!  I bought both from amazon for about $45.00 and that&#x27;s still too much.&lt;br /&gt;That said, I really do love the product. When my hair started turning gray, it became even more coarse.  This shampoo and conditioner make it feel so much softer.  I think it looks shinier too.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;m willing to pay a crazy price, for now anyway!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Quite using it because I ran out and I could see a Hugh change in my hair. I had to order again.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo / conditioner out there!  Leaves hair soft and manageable.  Also love the mousse and hairspray.  I&#x27;ve tried their Bamboo line too, but I keep going back to the Caviar line.  Also, is safe for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Great product. Better priced than sephora.</li>
            <li> love how this makes my hair feel, and that it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals in it</li>
            <li> It makes your hair so soft and silky!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to any friend!&lt;br /&gt;So glad I found  this product.</li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo three years ago after getting turned onto it by an ex-girlfriend. It smells great, feels great in my hair, and keeps it looking good. (Sorry, I don&#x27;t know more technical ways of describing the quality of a shampoo.) But it was also highly recommended by a family friend/former stylist of mine. You need only a little dab, so it goes a long way, and three years in it&#x27;s still my favorite. (My local salon didn&#x27;t have it so I tried another conditioner -- not nearly as good.) Get it!</li>
            <li> This smells heavenly! It&#x27;s the perfect thing to help you rejuvenate and invigorate your senses. It is pricey, but well worth it. It works best when I wear my hair curly because it adds that extra layer of silkiness, but the same silkiness keeps my hair from holding a style when it is straight. The quality is great too, if you can&#x27;t afford both I would say at the least try out the shampoo because some other ones can be so drying. This will keep your hair moisturized, soft, and SIKLY!</li>
            <li> Received on time and was just as described.</li>
            <li> Item arrived and was as described.  I have had two complete washes and I have no complaints.  I have grown my hair out long and I am over it so I am hoping that when I cut my hair short again that I will notice a difference. The only complaint I have is with the actual container the items come in.  The shampoo works fine but something was wrong with the conditioner top and it won&#x27;t squeeze out (even turned upside down) so I had to unscrew the top</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo better than the conditioner.  The shampoo goes a long way and I like it not sure I would spend this much again because I don&#x27;t see much different than cheaper shampoos.  I am on a quest to find something that &amp;#34;wows&#x27; me.  This isn&#x27;t it.  Conditioner I do not like.</li>
            <li> Great product. Worth the extra price for an excellent result.</li>
            <li> I purchased the shampoo as well as the conditioner Alterna as a set.  Being an older person with longer hair it makes my hair shine and looks exceptionally extra healthy.  Also I have noticed a lot less hair loss after using these particular products.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. I have straight fine hair, and it has felt a little dry and frazzled over the past couple of years. I feel like the shampoo is good for my hair. It smells great and my hair is super easy to brush through after washing. As others said, a little goes a long way. The bottles are fairly small, so I may start ordering their super large size from now on to save the hassle and money. I also use Alterna&#x27;s Protein cream and 10-in-1 moisture leave-in. Love those too.</li>
            <li> product is great for my hair. it reduce frizz. but bottle design does not work with conditioner. I have to struggle to dispense conditioner from bottle</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner!  Leaves me hair so soft!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner it make my hair look shiny and healthy, considering I use a flat iron daily.</li>
            <li> Alterna does not deny that its products are tested on animals. Cruelty reigns at Alterna; stuff is ridiculously expensive and better cruelty-free alternatives are available.</li>
            <li> After using their trial kit I fell in love. This line offers some great product at a pretty reasonable price. I am always up for trying different brands down the road but for now Alterna is giving me great hair at a great price!!</li>
            <li> I read lots of the reviews before I made my purchase.  Everyone talked about the wonderful smell.....I don&#x27;t think it smells wonderful.  in fact, at times I think it smells like rotting grapefruit or something.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it the first time I tried it.  The very first time I used the shampoo I thought it made my hair feel much thicker.  But as I kept using it my hair got limper.  The conditioner is good as far as being able to comb out the tangles.  Just not happy with the smell since I was expecting so much more - especially since so many of the reviews raved about it.  Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy anymore</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the shampoo , I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
            <li> I love Alterna&#x27;s line of Caviar Replenishing shampoo and conditioner. Yes, it pricey but, well worth every penny. I feel as if I have a new healthy head of hair each time I use it.</li>
            <li> Good and fast device. I like the product as well.</li>
            <li> After switching from Matrix to Redken and Aveda, I was looking for something that was really going to remoisturize and soften my hair. Well, this stuff works. It makes my hair feel so light the second I get out of the shower and it stays soft all day. My ends are looking so much better and overall, this is a wonderful shampoo/ condition set.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner after needing a change from my Oribe products. I took a chance and I will say that with the first shampoo I could already tell a difference in my hair. The conditioner softened my hair and made it more managable. I would absolutely recommend these products. My hair is thanking me! I have highlights in my hair which has made my hair dry at times. The smell is nice and the lather is better than Oribe. Give these a try!</li>
            <li> Works like a dream when you need a little more moisture &amp; conditioning for your hair. Might be a little too heavy for daily use if your hair isn&#x27;t real dry. I change my shampoo &amp; conditioner on a regular basis,  &amp; use this about once a month or so. Very high quality</li>
            <li> The texture and body of my hair improved with the very first use.  The improvement was astounding.  I can hardly believe it!  Also, you need to use very little product and hair/scalp stay cleaner longer.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic shampoo and conditioner.  My daughter has red curly hair and I have searched forever for shampoo that would help with the frizziness.  This product worked great!  So worth every penny!</li>
            <li> makes my hair incredibly soft ...i have long blonde hilighted hair that was very knotty and dried out, especially from the summer at the beach and pool.. Definitely worth the investment and this is the best price I have found!</li>
            <li> The older I get, the worse my hair behaves.  This shampoo and conditioner have been the only products I&#x27;ve found that actually make my hair soft and manageable again.  Love it.  When I order the product, it always arrives in less than a week.  Good company, good product.</li>
            <li> I always use salon products on my hair. Alterna, Seasilk Caviar shampoo &amp; conditioner are one of the few products that leave my hair look great more than one day. It smells great. It feel lights and after you&#x27;re done, your hair feels soft, looks shiny and doesn&#x27;t get frizzy as often as it does with other shampoos. This product can be use for hair treated with Brazilian Blowout or keratin.  In general, Alterna has great series of products for all types of hair. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> At first my hair felt soft and shine, but after drying it, it was stiff and frizzy. My last hairdresser had recommended this product.  I have since switch to another brand. All I can say is that it did not work well for me....but may work great for you!</li>
            <li> Recommend by my hair stylist. This makes my frizzy hair so much softer and healthier. I flat iron daily so it needs the help.</li>
            <li> I had bought this at Sephora and loved it but never bought it again due to the high price. This was a great deal. This shampoo and conditioner makes my hair feel like baby hair even after all the sun damage and blow drying I put it through. It works miracles.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but the conditioner was open so about a weeks worth was spilled all over the bottle and packaging.  Kind of annoying since it&#x27;s such an expensive set!</li>
            <li> Finally a shampoo/rinse that leaves my hair looking like I just left the salon!  Usually the first shampoo following a trip to the salon leaves my hair dry and wiry looking.  I have been looking for a long time to find a product that will maintain that soft silky look.  Thank you Caviar!</li>
            <li> Used to buy these both from sephora for a whopping ~$65.  This is a much better deal and it&#x27;s literally the same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair feel light and moisturized - I have thick hair, so this product is great so that my hair feels weightless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind of a splurge for shampoo/conditioner, but my last order lasted me about half a year.  I&#x27;m a huge fan of alterna caviar products - their dry shampoo is also amazing and works great in a pinch when I&#x27;m working really long hours... just keep a bottle at the desk to refresh my hair.</li>
            <li> Best ever..resores thick hair and adds moisture without heaviness.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Makes your hair so soft and healthy. Well worth the cost. I would totally recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I try every shampoo and conditioner on the shelf from the pharmacy, grocery to the salon...this is awesome! I have used it twice and this is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some shampoos and conditioners add moisture but then my hair is heavy, coated and flat...and then I use something to add volume and it dries my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo gives me volume, softness and my hair feels .....healthier. This is just after two days...so hope this lasts.&lt;br /&gt;right now....worth the expense.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt better or looked healthier.  Makes my fine hair look thicker.  It conditions my color treated hair without making it limp and lifeless!  My hair has been totally transformed!</li>
            <li> Not great for the price - surprised because my hairdresser recommended it. Difficult to squeeze out the product, too.</li>
            <li> Although its a bit pricey this shampoo and conditioner combination works great in my thin wavy, color treated hair. Allows me to blow dry straight with ease and my hair straightens with a straight iron with just a few passes. Also, if I just let my hair air dry it&#x27;s straighter and smoother as well. Plus it leaves my hair super soft and smells great!</li>
            <li> Great stuff that makes your hair shine and feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner  - makes color treated hair very soft.  The only problem I have is getting the conditioner out of the bottle.  It&#x27;s practically impossible.  No problem with the shampoo - and bottles are identical.  Wish Alterna would redesign the bottle into a pump or something easier to get the thick conditioner out.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair.  I tried a tester of this and the shampoo in the test was clear and sulfate free - it did not lather - which is perfect.  This shampoo is not clear and provides a to of lather which tells me it is NOT sulfate free.</li>
            <li> I was VERY disappointed with the way this product was shipped. Sadly, both the shampoo AND conditioner leaked from faulty bottles........I&#x27;ve ordered this product from OTHER venders numerous times prior without ANY problems. Will not purchase from this vender again!</li>
            <li> Altera haircare is so wonderful.  Makes my hair feel so soft &amp; healthy.  Clears up the dry ends</li>
            <li> after I get it, I was so disappointed. It does not looks like the one sale in the store. After I used it, it made my hair even drier than before.</li>
            <li> Great product! The plastic bottles are not flexible, difficult to get the shampoo and cream rinse out of the bottles.</li>
            <li> Alterna Caviar is truly an amazing product. I love that it has UV protection because as we all know, the sun&#x27;s rays are so damaging to hair! It also provides protection for the scalp! My scalp always gets burnt when I go to football games during the day, but with this my scalp is burn free! The shampoo is decent, but the conditioner is what&#x27;s really special! My hair is SO soft, shiny, lustrous, and cooperative after using the conditioner! No other product has made my hair so soft. It keeps my hair neat and tame looking. Is it expensive? Yes. Is it worth the price? Absolutely! I truly think you&#x27;re getting what you pay for. Plus, $30 for BOTH the shampoo and conditioner is a steal because each one alone retails for $35!</li>
            <li> I love the Caviar. It is expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but cannot use them together as it causes my hair to flatten.</li>
            <li> Worked well on my hair. Didn&#x27;t seem to taste great on a cracker... so much for that dinner party cred. But my hair looked solid.</li>
            <li> The shampoo makes my hair feel like straw. The conditioner is my salvation from the shampoo! Definitely wouldn&#x27;t buy the shampoo without the conditioner. Not sure if I&#x27;ll repurchase.</li>
            <li> this is some wonderful stuff just a bit spendy.,you will see a change in your hair right away but ahter continued use its just awsome a little goes a long ways</li>
            <li> I wear my hair long and - due probably to a combination of the natural effects of getting older and using a straightening iron for the past several years - had been really frustrated lately with my dry, split-ended, lifeless hair.  I saw this product in a store first and since it is a bit more than I typically pay for shampoo, tried the small travel size first.  I have to say that the very first time I used it, I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the way it felt when I massaged it into my hair.  It just felt weird to me, it didn&#x27;t seem to lather and I actually double-checked to make sure I hadn&#x27;t mistakenly put the conditioner on first.  But I proceeded anyway and followed up with the conditioner.  At that point I still wasn&#x27;t hopeful of good results, but I was very pleasantly surprised as my hair dried - for the first time in a long time my hair felt soft, and had some shine.  And two different people actually complimented me on how pretty my hair looked after just that first use!  So I finished up the travel size and began purchasing the full size bottles here on Amazon (which is significantly more cost-effective than purchasing at the store where I first purchased it).  And I continue to be pleased with the results - my hair is soft and shiny, the product has a nice but very subtle scent, and I continue to get compliments on how beautiful my hair looks.  I recommended this product to a (younger) friend and she loves it too.</li>
            <li> The shampoo, conditioner and rapid Repair Spray are fine products and I achieve good results. My hair is shiny and the fragrance is light and wonderful. The cost is high. Is it worth it? I&#x27;m not sure, but I will continue using Alterna Caviar products.</li>
            <li> So far I like the shampoo but I have a sensitive scalp and I still get some burning sensation in my scalp.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product.  I can only compare this to products I&#x27;ve used so in comparison to Living Proof, Pureology, Bumble and Bumble, Alterna Bamboo, Biolage, Frederic Fakkai, Alterna Caviar Moisture Shampoo tops my list.  As a product junkie, I&#x27;m constantly trying out different lines, but because I&#x27;ve received so many compliments after using caviar, I&#x27;m afraid to switch.</li>
            <li> Makes the texture of my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for over 10 years.  Good as ever.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  My daughter uses it and her hair looks great.  I like it, but wouldn&#x27;t rush to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Uses only a small bit of product and cleans and shines hair very well.  I love the scent--spicy sweet.  It has no sulfur-type chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> I read mixed reviews but decided to give it a try and what a misleading product it turned out to be. I don&#x27;t know if it was defective or just inaccurate claims from Alterna but instead of being moisturizing it dried out my hair, it did not smell good at all, and was not volumizing.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair so silky and smooth! Use very little in your hand, it will last much longer.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to change shampoo and conditioner after years of using products that were custom packaged for my beauty salon.  After reading Amazon and other Internet reviews,  I settled on the Alterna Anti-aging (that caught my eye!) shampoo and conditioner (it&#x27;s made for &amp;#34;mature hair&amp;#34;).  The duo was well priced so I got that, plus I bought the hair spray.  I definitely was influenced by the rave reviews and I have not been disappointed.  The shampoo lathers up well and leaves my 64-year-old hair nice and soft, and fluffy, too.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice but it seems to me that it makes my thinning hair feel fuller.  The fragrance is nice, too.  I had a hard time rinsing out the conditioner from my hair so I&#x27;m now using just a dab.  I haven&#x27;t used the hair spray yet.  I&#x27;m very happy I made the change and am very pleased with these products, and plan to keep using them.</li>
            <li> Great products.Will reorder.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. Just after the first wash I already felt a difference in my hair. It makes it feel very soft, and my ends a lot less dry. I also love the smell and the design of the bottle. It has a nice twist to open top. You also cannot beat this price! $40 for both the shampoo and conditioner, when at sephora it is $38 for each one. You also don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it which I also love. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The best hair care products I&#x27;ve ever used.  My hair is so much shinier and healthy looking.  And I noticed it grows faster too...  This product gives me glamorous look :)</li>
            <li> I am in 40&#x27;s and chopped off my hair because it was breaking and becoming frizzy.  I have always had fine hair, but with age it is very weak.  This product has made my hair appear fuller and healthier, even my hairdresser noticed.  I may now be able to grow my hair out again if I choose.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shampoo/conditioner..! It&#x27;s smells amazing, kind of lemongrass-citrusy. It makes my hair so soft, shiny &amp; manageable. I have straight fine hair that is dyed and this combo makes my hair color glisten..! Totally amplifys the color of my hair even when the dye has faded. I love love love it. So worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love the scent</li>
            <li> Been using this for couple years now.&lt;br /&gt;Totally love it and it agrees with me.</li>
            <li> Possibly the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. I have hair down to my waist and I am 50 years old, ... so some of you know by personal experience that my hair is not what it used to be 20 years ago. :) After a month of using these two products,it is back to being soft and manageable and gorgeous (yes, yes, I love my hair!) following a nasty long cold winter which made it look like straw!  Worst ever.  It was recommended by good friend who is a hair stylist.  So thankful for her advice, she was totally right.  There is nothing like it. I also use the Masque!  A put a little bit on the ends, and I do not rinse it at all.  Great results and it smells amazing too.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo and conditioner - LOVE !!!</li>
            <li> I purchased these bottles and they do not have the same consistency, color, or smell as my bottles purchased from Ulta. My hair also does not feel the same. I don&#x27;t believe it is the same product.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  The condition of my hair has improved since I started using it a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Great products for my hair! It is healthy and shiny! Best shampoo and conditioner that I have ever used. I have tried all the best stuff too.</li>
            <li> the best stuff, loved how it made my hair shine</li>
            <li> Awesome products! Made my hair very soft and smooth.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter who has very long hair. I have since purchased more...........she loves it.</li>
            <li> I love it! It is probably the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used in my life. It makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful for your hair</li>
            <li> This is the best I have found for my dry, wavy/ curly hair. It is expensive but you really don&#x27;t need much each time, so I can make a bottle last about 6-7 months!</li>
            <li> Best hair cleansing and repair system I have ever used!  and i have used plenty.  Wish it was more affordable, its alot of money for only 8 onz but the product itself is outstanding and does instant repair.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser turned me on to this product because my hair was pretty damaged! It has really helped make my hair healthier! Love this product!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much so it lasts a long time &amp; does a good job.  You only need a &amp;#34;nickel&amp;#34; size for shampoo &amp; &amp;#34;dime&amp;#34; size for conditioner &amp; my hair is not short.  I have VERY fine hair and am finally able to keep it longer (mid-back) than I&#x27;ve been able to in years (only cause I&#x27;m no longer working in a large office) and this product was recommended by hair gal.  Been using it for over a year now &amp; still happy.</li>
