    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The gloves are perfect for work and over night for protection.  </li>
            <li>Not the best for my needs....</li>
            <li>Perfect for the look</li>
            <li>The company sent a lotion because the gloves weren&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li>BUT AMAZON WAS THE BEST DEAL</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t wear these to a ball, but to bed to cover hand lotion - perfect!</li>
            <li>I chose this brand because, of all the brands sold in bulk here, these seemed to have the best reviews.</li>
            <li>DID NOT LOOK APPROPRIATE TO WEAR OUT!!!</li>
            <li>I WASN&#x27;T HAPPY WITH THESE GLOVES, BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT STAY ON MY HANDS &amp; THEY</li>
            <li>Great gloves.</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>Great if you want one time use disposable gloves.</li>
            <li>Also great to sleep in.</li>
            <li>so I was happy when I found these on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The company made good on their product.</li>
            <li>Good for what it was purchased.</li>
            <li>Gloves fit the need an excellent product.</li>
            <li>Works good for night time keeping hand cream on.</li>
            <li>These have no spandex in them, so the fit is not so great (although it&#x27;s a stretchy cotton).</li>
            <li>I really liked it.</li>
            <li>so I also wanted to just be able to throw them out after one wearing.</li>
            <li>needs more length in the fingers and wrist</li>
            <li>Satisfied for the price, does the job.</li>
            <li>Thought they were of better material, they looked better on screen.  </li>
            <li>Wish they were tighter around the wrist so they would stay on better.</li>
            <li>the gloves were ok...</li>
            <li>Good quality and washes very well.  </li>
            <li>If I took a pencil, I could easily stick the tip through the gloves and touch my hand.</li>
            <li>These gloves would work fine as inspection gloves, but not as \\&quot;spa\\&quot; gloves.</li>
            <li>They might fit a child&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using them anyway, because I need them for medicinal application, but they don&#x27;t stay on well because of the fit.</li>
            <li>so I think that they should have fit....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering better gloves right now.</li>
            <li>These arrived in timely fashion but that was the only thing I consider good about the gloves.  </li>
            <li>I like a tighter glove but the fabric is fine and the product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>These are light yet warm enough that I have learned to type with them and to write with them.  </li>
            <li>Positive points: they are cotton and relatively cheap.</li>
            <li>THEY ARE NOT HEAVY ON MY HANDS, VERY COMFORTABLE AND KEEP MEDICINE OFF THINGS.</li>
            <li>but the price was right</li>
            <li>It was not that they were too large for my hands, they fit very well,  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and the unit is marked what to do first.</li>
            <li>You refunded my first order of this brand.</li>
            <li>But if you want something to handle delicate things without fingerprinting/oiling, then these would make great inspection gloves for you.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what my wife wanted and she is using them to keep medication on her hands and to protect them while she works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll only be able to wear them once, or maybe twice.  </li>
            <li>I recommend placing them in a lingerie bag and washing them in warm wash in the washing machine wit other whites.  </li>
            <li>Only thing could easily be removed by patient.</li>
            <li>and I really hope you STOP ordering from them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>too short and too light, feels disposable.</li>
            <li>I really like this knife sharpener.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These wouldn&#x27;t protect your hands against much.</li>
            <li>I WOULD RECOMMEND THE LIGHT WEIGHT WHITE GLOVES</li>
            <li>Very Flimsy.  </li>
            <li>These are very flimsy and fall apart if washed.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable in buying a dozen pair of gloves.</li>
            <li>So, I was really hoping to find a cheaper source to buy them in bulk.</li>
            <li>I wear cotton gloves most of the time, due to side effects from medication.</li>
            <li>barely covered the top part of my palm and the fingers are short............</li>
            <li>so I would think that they would fall apart very easily after a few times of wearing them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received these and while this may be what others are expecting, I was expecting gloves - these are more or less a cotton sheathing - (see through).</li>
            <li>but I guess ok for the price as I only use them for facial exdecises....</li>
            <li>Very useful cotton gloves - my wife wears them at night after applying lotion to her hands for dry hands</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made and don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>I am not sure what they would be suitable for.  </li>
            <li>cheap enough you can throw them away when they get gross.</li>
            <li>I have small hands and they really don&#x27;t even fit all the way on.</li>
            <li>To excuse myself for purchasing them, I thought that they were cheap enough that I would just dispose of them after a use or two without laundering them.  </li>
            <li>On the negative side: the material is flimsy, the seams are rather large and the wrists are unfinished, which means that they feel like they don&#x27;t fit (though they do).</li>
            <li>completely covered.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money because I don&#x27;t believe I can return them since I used a couple already.</li>
            <li>From Amazon.com, I purchased reasonably priced white cotton gloves to protect my hands while sleeping.  </li>
            <li>I put medicated ointments and moisturizing creams for sensitive skins on my hands.  </li>
            <li>When I&#x27;ve purchased these @ Walgreens, they&#x27;re about $6/pr, are much heavier and are hemmed -- in fact I&#x27;ve washed them numerous times before they fell apart.</li>
            <li>Once they are stretched out to fit over your hands, the wrist part is so wide that they don&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li>Kind of flimsy very thin</li>
            <li>Does exactly what they said it would it do, picture is slightly misleading if you are expecting them to come down to your wrists, other than that performed well, comfortable, on and off multiple time without a problem.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s becoming very hard to find white cotton gloves</li>
            <li>However, they are so inconsistently sewn that at least half had one or more fingers with a maximum 1/2 inch diameter.</li>

            <li> The gloves are durable (last for a long time with daily use).</li>
            <li> They are so small to be listed as large, that my palm was&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li> My preferred treatment for occasional dry skin on hands is Vasoline and white cotton gloves over night.</li>
            <li> If it were possible, I wouldn&#x27;t give them even a single star.</li>
            <li> They get dirty and worn out pretty fast.</li>
            <li> There is no hemming around the wrists at all, and after washing them once, the wrists have frayed and are so stretched out I can practically pull them over my head.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long it takes for my (modest-length) nails to poke thru these...</li>
            <li> Too thin, the lotion seeped right thru.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands, I put a heavy amount of hand lotion on my hands at night and put the gloves on and wear them overnight, in the morning my hands are soft again.</li>
            <li> These gloves were such a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;gloves&amp;#34; are like a single layer of gauze formed into a glove shape.  </li>
            <li> They are so thin and flimsy that one got a hole in it while I was putting it on for the first time.</li>
            <li> Rough, single layer flimsy cheese cloth or gauze.  </li>
            <li> I bought them for overnight treatment of my very dry hands.</li>
            <li> I HAVE TO USE CREAMS ON MY HANDS BECAUSE OF VERY DRY SKIN</li>
            <li> If you have large hands not a great product</li>
            <li> Thought these were like the little cotton glove we wore for Easter back in the 60&amp;#34;s.</li>
            <li> They run very small and are really thin and tear easily.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> They are of a very loose weave, I will keep looking for something with a tighter weave, but they are working for now.</li>
            <li> total shapeless junk - they don&#x27;t stay on my hands</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel they are heavy enough for the purpose.</li>
            <li> so I got what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in these particular gloves - the fabric was more like gauze than lisle and they were so skimpy that they didn&#x27;t come up to my wrist even...................</li>
            <li> These gloves are very thin and of low quality, but that&#x27;s really what I was after.</li>
            <li> I periodically get flare ups of excema and the gloves help to keep the ointment and moisturizer on my hands rather than my sheets and to keep me from scratching my hands and other excema sites on my arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> Handcream seeps thru onto other fabrics.  </li>
            <li> Thin and only last for one wearing</li>
            <li> not worth the price ...........................and not a quality product</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just an average size woman.</li>
            <li> In fact, they are about the thickness of a facial tissue and they peel off of the hand with the least bit of movement.  </li>
            <li> Not useful.</li>
            <li> They are thin enough to work in, but also protect with medication over night.</li>
            <li> I hang them on hangers for drying and they are dried in about 6 hours</li>
            <li> However, after jjust a few hours of trying to keep them on, I just gave up.  </li>
            <li> waste you time or money on these.</li>
            <li> not sure how they will survive the laundry .</li>
            <li> These gloves are VERY thin and short.</li>
            <li> It worked so well on my dull knives that I cut myself three times since sharpening them.</li>
            <li> This makes them hard to keep on unless you are not moving at all.</li>
            <li> This is a late re-review.</li>
            <li> Small and thin</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was shocked by how crappy these gloves actually were.</li>
            <li> These gloves were disappointing; they were very thin and very short.  </li>
            <li> The gloves are poor quality.  </li>
            <li> The gloves were too thin.</li>
            <li> Extremely poor quality.  </li>
            <li> These gloves are so thin that I can see my hands through them.</li>
            <li> These gloves are extremely thin and there is no finishing at the wrist which means these gloves will unravel and fall apart after a couple of washings.</li>
            <li> The ones I received is so thin that you can see the skin through the gloves.  </li>
            <li> Material too thin.  </li>
            <li> These are too thin for me.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed with product and picture is deceiving as it does not match the actual item received.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the material is rather lax and as a result, the gloves would slip off my hands during the night.</li>
            <li> I am wondering if I received the wrong item as the picture noted a thicker gloves.  </li>
            <li> Uncomfortable on tender skin.  </li>
            <li> So sorry I bought them.</li>
            <li> They are not hemmed, and are very thin knit.</li>
            <li> These are very thin, almost like cheese cloth.  </li>
            <li> These arrived today and I am shocked by the poor quality of these gloves.  </li>
            <li> I plan to use them under surgical gloves at night during the winter to keep my fingers from cracking during cold weather..............</li>
            <li> Offered them to others- ended up throwing away because packaging tore destructively on opening.</li>
            <li> Too bad because otherwise these would have done the trick.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> These are terrible gloves - they are extremely thin (you can see through them!), and do not hold moisture well.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed with the quality of these.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> this is the worst product i have ever ordered...</li>
            <li> The picture is a terrible representation of what you get.  </li>
            <li> Awful!  </li>

            <li> Disappointed.  Thought these were like the little cotton glove we wore for Easter back in the 60&amp;#34;s.</li>
            <li> The gloves are durable (last for a long time with daily use). I bought them for overnight treatment of my very dry hands. Unfortunately, the material is rather lax and as a result, the gloves would slip off my hands during the night. My hands are small/medium so perhaps someone with bigger hands would not have the same problem.</li>
            <li> Kind of flimsy very thin and they tend to come off during the night.</li>
            <li> You refunded my first order of this brand. Thank you! The second order was also by this Lisle brand and I really hope you STOP ordering from them.&lt;br /&gt;Terrible gloves in every way. I hope they hold up to the washing machine!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these gloves to keep cream on hands and not furniture. I&#x27;m doing chemo and this helps with hand foot syndrome so I also wanted to just be able to throw them out after one wearing. These gloves are very thin and of low quality, but that&#x27;s really what I was after. However, they are so inconsistently sewn that at least half had one or more fingers with a maximum 1/2 inch diameter. Too bad because otherwise these would have done the trick.</li>
            <li> The gloves are perfect for work and over night for protection.  They would work for any size hands.  They are thin enough to work in, but also protect with medication over night.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in these particular gloves - the fabric was more like gauze than lisle and they were so skimpy that they didn&#x27;t come up to my wrist even...................barely covered the top part of my palm and the fingers are short............I plan to use them under surgical gloves at night during the winter to keep my fingers from cracking during cold weather..............I would not order these again...............not worth the price ...........................and not a quality product</li>
            <li> These gloves would work fine as inspection gloves, but not as \\&quot;spa\\&quot; gloves. I use gloves occasionally when I sleep after putting on lotion to lock in the moisture. These have no spandex in them, so the fit is not so great (although it&#x27;s a stretchy cotton). Once they are stretched out to fit over your hands, the wrist part is so wide that they don&#x27;t stay on. Not the best for my needs.... But if you want something to handle delicate things without fingerprinting/oiling, then these would make great inspection gloves for you.</li>
            <li> The gloves are poor quality.  They are so small to be listed as large, that my palm was&lt;br /&gt;not completely covered.  When you wash them they shrink to nothing.</li>
            <li> I WASN&#x27;T HAPPY WITH THESE GLOVES, BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT STAY ON MY HANDS &amp; THEY DID NOT LOOK APPROPRIATE TO WEAR OUT!!!</li>
            <li> Great gloves. I used them for my class dance. I really liked it. Thank you so much. Perfect for the look</li>
            <li> This is a late re-review. The company made good on their product. The gloves were too thin. The company sent a lotion because the gloves weren&#x27;t the best. I have since bought additional lotion,</li>
            <li> this is the worst product i have ever ordered...the material feels like sandpaper not 100% cotton!</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!!!  These &amp;#34;gloves&amp;#34; are like a single layer of gauze formed into a glove shape.  I have no idea what use they would have for anyone. Not at all as pictured.  Very disappointed.  I am returning them.</li>
            <li> Product arrived within the allotted time and was in the condition that the seller stated. Product was exactly what my wife wanted and she is using them to keep medication on her hands and to protect them while she works.</li>
            <li> I have a circulation problem with my hands and wrists.  These are light yet warm enough that I have learned to type with them and to write with them.  Good quality and washes very well.  I recommend placing them in a lingerie bag and washing them in warm wash in the washing machine wit other whites.  I hang them on hangers for drying and they are dried in about 6 hours</li>
            <li> too short and too light, feels disposable. needs to be longer and wider. is meant for tiny hands. needs more length in the fingers and wrist</li>
            <li> They run very small and are really thin and tear easily. I just received and have gone through 2 pair already!!</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made and don&#x27;t last long. They strecth out at the bottom and do not hold their shape. WILL NOT buy them again and I recommend that no one else do either.</li>
            <li> I really like this knife sharpener. It is so easy to use and the unit is marked what to do first. So there should be no mistakes. It worked so well on my dull knives that I cut myself three times since sharpening them. LOL</li>
            <li> These gloves were disappointing; they were very thin and very short.  I could not keep them on my hands; they didn&#x27;t even cover my wrists and I&#x27;m just an average size woman.</li>
            <li> Good for what it was purchased. Only thing could easily be removed by patient.</li>
            <li> Gloves fit the need an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Thin and only last for one wearing</li>
            <li> I have small hands and they really don&#x27;t even fit all the way on. They might fit a child&#x27;s hand. I&#x27;m using them anyway, because I need them for medicinal application, but they don&#x27;t stay on well because of the fit.</li>
            <li> I should have paid attention to the reviews and not purchased them.  The picture shown makes them look like they have a firmness that would cling to your hand.  In fact, they are about the thickness of a facial tissue and they peel off of the hand with the least bit of movement.  To excuse myself for purchasing them, I thought that they were cheap enough that I would just dispose of them after a use or two without laundering them.  However, after jjust a few hours of trying to keep them on, I just gave up.  It was not that they were too large for my hands, they fit very well,  It was the quality of they product that was at fault.</li>
            <li> Extremely poor quality.  Great if you want one time use disposable gloves.</li>
            <li> Very useful cotton gloves - my wife wears them at night after applying lotion to her hands for dry hands</li>
            <li> These are terrible gloves - they are extremely thin (you can see through them!), and do not hold moisture well.  They have no elastic, so they stretch out and don&#x27;t stay on after one or two nights.  You CANNOT wash them.  There is no hemming around the wrists at all, and after washing them once, the wrists have frayed and are so stretched out I can practically pull them over my head.  The picture is a terrible representation of what you get.  Stay away!</li>
            <li> They are of a very loose weave, I will keep looking for something with a tighter weave, but they are working for now.</li>
            <li> Too thin, the lotion seeped right thru.</li>
            <li> These gloves are so thin that I can see my hands through them. If I took a pencil, I could easily stick the tip through the gloves and touch my hand. They are so thin and flimsy that one got a hole in it while I was putting it on for the first time. There isn&#x27;t a hem at the bottoms so I would think that they would fall apart very easily after a few times of wearing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These wouldn&#x27;t protect your hands against much. The only reason I can think to buy these is if you wanted them as part of a costume.</li>
            <li> I HAVE TO USE CREAMS ON MY HANDS BECAUSE OF VERY DRY SKIN AND IT WOULD GET ON EVERYTHING TILL I PURCHASED THESE GLOVES. THEY ARE NOT HEAVY ON MY HANDS, VERY COMFORTABLE AND KEEP MEDICINE OFF THINGS. I WOULD RECOMMEND THE LIGHT WEIGHT WHITE GLOVES TO EVERYONE JUST FOR COMFORT BUT ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE TO APPLY CREAMS TO HANDS. LOOKED ON SEVERAL SIGHTS BUT AMAZON WAS THE BEST DEAL</li>
            <li> The picture is deceiving. These gloves are extremely thin and there is no finishing at the wrist which means these gloves will unravel and fall apart after a couple of washings. If you are looking for disposable gloves these will serve the purpose.</li>
            <li> Very Flimsy.  Returned</li>
            <li> I like a tighter glove but the fabric is fine and the product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The gloves that arrived looked like cheese cloths.  I am wondering if I received the wrong item as the picture noted a thicker gloves.  The ones I received is so thin that you can see the skin through the gloves.  I read that it can be washed and re-use.  I don&#x27;t believe so because after using one time, it does not seems reusable.  Very disappointed with product and picture is deceiving as it does not match the actual item received.  Do not waste your money because I don&#x27;t believe I can return them since I used a couple already.</li>
            <li> These gloves are VERY thin and short. They do not come up to the wrist as shown in the photo. This makes them hard to keep on unless you are not moving at all. I would not buy them again, nor would I recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> These are very flimsy and fall apart if washed.</li>
            <li> I received these and while this may be what others are expecting, I was expecting gloves - these are more or less a cotton sheathing - (see through).</li>
            <li> From Amazon.com, I purchased reasonably priced white cotton gloves to protect my hands while sleeping.  I put medicated ointments and moisturizing creams for sensitive skins on my hands.  I periodically get flare ups of excema and the gloves help to keep the ointment and moisturizer on my hands rather than my sheets and to keep me from scratching my hands and other excema sites on my arms and legs.  The price was reasonable in buying a dozen pair of gloves.</li>
            <li> Works good for night time keeping hand cream on. cheap enough you can throw them away when they get gross.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands, I put a heavy amount of hand lotion on my hands at night and put the gloves on and wear them overnight, in the morning my hands are soft again.</li>
            <li> Awful!  Texture of gauze or cheep cheesecloth.  Gave it one star so review would be posted.  Rough, single layer flimsy cheese cloth or gauze.  Uncomfortable on tender skin.  Handcream seeps thru onto other fabrics.  Offered them to others- ended up throwing away because packaging tore destructively on opening.</li>
            <li> I occasionally use gloves for hand medication.  These arrived today and I am shocked by the poor quality of these gloves.  I&#x27;ll only be able to wear them once, or maybe twice.  In 2011 ordered the &amp;#34;10 Pairs of Ladies Coin Inspection Gloves Solid White&amp;#34;. With occasional washing, that pack lasted for 2 years. I&#x27;m ordering better gloves right now.</li>
            <li> Did not stay on my hands~ would roll up.</li>
            <li> total shapeless junk - they don&#x27;t stay on my hands</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t wear these to a ball, but to bed to cover hand lotion - perfect!</li>
            <li> These gloves were such a huge disappointment. I wear cotton gloves most of the time, due to side effects from medication. They get dirty and worn out pretty fast. So, I was really hoping to find a cheaper source to buy them in bulk. I chose this brand because, of all the brands sold in bulk here, these seemed to have the best reviews. ( Which isn&#x27;t saying much.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked by how crappy these gloves actually were. Cheese cloth would be a generous description. I can&#x27;t imagine who&#x27;s hands they were meant for. The fingers are really short, the bottom edge is not hemmed, and they shed bits of string all over as soon as I pulled them out of the package. If it were possible, I wouldn&#x27;t give them even a single star. I returned them for a refund immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste you time or money on these.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed with the quality of these. They are not hemmed, and are very thin knit. When I&#x27;ve purchased these @ Walgreens, they&#x27;re about $6/pr, are much heavier and are hemmed -- in fact I&#x27;ve washed them numerous times before they fell apart. I didn&#x27;t think these would be &amp;#34;wear once &amp; toss&amp;#34;, but that&#x27;s what they look like! We&#x27;ll see how long it takes for my (modest-length) nails to poke thru these...</li>
            <li> Small and thin but I guess ok for the price as I only use them for facial exdecises....not sure how they will survive the laundry .</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis on my hands, sometimes the skin splits and bleeds.  These gloves are a godsend.  Put on prescription ointment and these gloves and I can do housework again.  Also great to sleep in.</li>
            <li> The wrist of the glove tends to stretch out and then the glove does not stay on well.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what they said it would it do, picture is slightly misleading if you are expecting them to come down to your wrists, other than that performed well, comfortable, on and off multiple time without a problem. Satisfied for the price, does the job.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed.  Can&#x27;t use.  Material too thin.  Thought they were of better material, they looked better on screen.  So sorry I bought them.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they were lightweight &amp;#34;GLOVES&amp;#34;.  They are NOT!  They are GLOVE LINERS!!  How about truth in advertising?????</li>
            <li> I bought the gloves to wear with hand and cuticle conditioner.  These are very thin, almost like cheese cloth.  I don&#x27;t feel they are heavy enough for the purpose.</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for, they are throw away gloves, when you wash them they fall apart, the person I bought them for is not a throw away person.</li>
            <li> These are too thin for me.  I have eczema and when I use my med cream I need something to wear throughout the day.  These are to thin &amp; cheap to last throughout the day!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this glove to use at night.  I read the reviews so I got what I expected.  Wish they were tighter around the wrist so they would stay on better.</li>
            <li> the gloves were ok...A bit short in the fingers but the price was right and I will make do. If you have large hands not a great product but my hands are a medium so I think that they should have fit....I&#x27;m just stretching them as I wear them ....</li>
            <li> These arrived in timely fashion but that was the only thing I consider good about the gloves.  I am not sure what they would be suitable for.  I wanted to wear to keep lotion on hands or to protect nylons when dressing.  Not useful.</li>
            <li> My preferred treatment for occasional dry skin on hands is Vasoline and white cotton gloves over night. It&#x27;s becoming very hard to find white cotton gloves so I was happy when I found these on Amazon. Positive points: they are cotton and relatively cheap. On the negative side: the material is flimsy, the seams are rather large and the wrists are unfinished, which means that they feel like they don&#x27;t fit (though they do). Cotton and cheap beats flimsy and poorly finished any day.</li>
