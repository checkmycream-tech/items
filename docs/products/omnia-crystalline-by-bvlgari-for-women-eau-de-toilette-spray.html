            <li>Great product fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I love this scent and was very happy and surprised when my husband bought me a brand new, beautiful bottle for Christmas.</li>
            <li>It is very light, seductive and sexy.</li>
            <li>The scent is very elegant and unique, you will fall in love with it   </li>
            <li>Great smell, check who you are buying it from to make sure is the real deal, this one was.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>On top of that, there were scratch marks on the bottle as if someone dropped it on asphalt.</li>
            <li>What does a stone (semi precious at that) smell like?</li>
            <li>I like it more than the softer perfume that I just purchased(Juicy)</li>
            <li>Anyway, I love this perfume and don&#x27;t have to ask anyone if you smell this perfume on me.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Sincerely,  Alvaro from Costa Rica</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this when I smelled it in the perfume shop in the Italy Pavilion in Epcot, where it costs $65</li>

            <li>Smells fantastic!     </li>
            <li>I like most of this scent.</li>
            <li>a more sophisticated fragrance.\\&quot; \\&quot;Something you would wear when dressing up...not with jeans\\</li>
            <li>This is the most refreshing perfume ever.  </li>
            <li>I could not say more about this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this perfume back in 2008 as a gift from my best friend.</li>
            <li>I love this product..</li>
            <li>Her top two favorite scents are this, the Bulgari Amethyst, and Giorgio of Beverly Hills.  </li>
            <li>She can&#x27;t decide which she likes better.  </li>

            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>one of my favorite scents by bvlgari.  </li>
            <li>glad i can still buy it online since i can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite perfumes.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll always include it in my wish list. :)</li>
            <li>Very suttle and great for day or evening.</li>
            <li>I wear it mostly at daytime because its light, fresh,and lovely.</li>
            <li>Thank you for selling this fabulous perfume; at such a Magnificent rate!!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light sexy scent.</li>
            <li>I wanted to get my bridesmaids something useful and something I knew all girls liked.</li>
            <li>got this for my moms birthday good price and really seemed to like it.</li>
            <li>When I first applied Amethyste it had a bright floral scent that was fresh and appropriate for daytime wear.</li>
            <li>so it was an easy choice - its fragrance is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>it is the most beautiful scent i&#x27;ve smelled in a long time.</li>
            <li>I liked the light and fresh scent but it seemed like it wore off quite easily.  </li>
            <li>My husband likes it a lot because it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>At that time I thought it was too strong &amp; not too keen on it.</li>
            <li>I love Versace&#x27;s Bright Crystal, and I was told this was similar but better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering and have a cool powdery smell which I love.</li>
            <li>I got this wonderfull fragrance in a nice package and really fast.</li>
            <li>she said light scent</li>
            <li>I wear this in the morning on important days or days</li>
            <li>This is one of my top 5 favorite scents in the whole world.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend loves this scent and the price was very good based on other vendors.</li>
            <li>The con is that this scent has been done to death and it smells exactly like a very popular perfume by Dolce and Gabbana, &#x27;Light Blue&#x27;, which may be more readily available and cheaper.</li>
            <li>This perfume is light and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>the original one.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the scent, ever since I first smelled it.</li>
            <li>When I was reading the reviews, I got soooo excited about my Omnia Amethyste purchase.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure she loves</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance so much!</li>
            <li>Not disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li>The perfume is not heavy and is never smells stagnant, but does have a nice, light, lingering fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The white fragrance was my favorite however this one smells nice as well.  </li>
            <li>The smell was not quite pleasant, something like acetone mixed with perfume.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume and it&#x27;s super reasonable in price I always purchase is on amazon!</li>
            <li>Certainly I would recommend,  shipping was accurate!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gift for someone special</li>
            <li>Just right!</li>
            <li>which has the same box as the ones I had before and loved..  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has good lasting power.  </li>
            <li>It is sweet, but not overpowering.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If your lady likes sweet, but not over-powering smells, she&#x27;ll like this.</li>
            <li>I need something to instantly make me feel good.</li>
            <li>It makes you feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>High-quality, scent warms to the skin, subtle and perfect.</li>
            <li>this has quickly become my signature fragrance.</li>
            <li>The product came on time, the packaging was also nice, but the bottle itself looked a bit cheap and fragile.</li>
            <li>Fragrant and mild cologne that stays all day.</li>
            <li>Paid nearly double that at the mall so to find it for that cheap was amazing</li>
            <li>One of my very favorites although wears off very quickly</li>
            <li>Such a lovely smell!</li>
            <li>Is ok , the smells is little strong for my taste , but is ok if you use little&lt;br /&gt;have</li>
            <li>I was on the airport and was about to buy this perfume in the duty free, but desided to wait and buy it through Amazon, the price is much better and the perfume is the same as always.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li>I love this scent, I get lots of compliments, it has a soft scent nothing overpowering, that people know you are coming before you get in the room.</li>
            <li>Will order more later love it and delivery was fast</li>
            <li>This perfume is by far, my favorite from all the perfumes I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>this particular one is so light and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this light floral scent which I usually don&#x27;t where because most floral scents smell like that old fashioned rose perfume which I dislike so much because some of the women in my grandmothers old church would wear it all the time.</li>
            <li>Romantic and refreshing fragrance smells.</li>
            <li>u won&#x27;t regret hahahaa XDD  Fast shipment!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love this perfume eversince!been buying this personally..</li>
            <li>this one on amazon is more like watery!!;(((and dnt even last</li>
            <li>you so much!</li>
            <li>It is a light soft scent it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>My ultimate favorite.</li>
            <li>It is very light, but stays for a long period of time.</li>
            <li>Green Sap, Pink Grapefruit, Iris Flower, Bulgarian Rosebud, Heliotrope, Solar Wood&#x3D; wonderful!</li>
            <li>This knockoff with all the packaging, labels, design etc comes very close at first smell.  </li>
            <li>I received my order very rapidly and the product was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Although it smells good, the scent does not last long.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this perfume, it&#x27;s light scent is long lasting, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Because it is right what i was looking for, and the fragance is very soft an femenine.</li>
            <li>planning on getting the whole selection eventually&lt;</li>
            <li>very well i will buy this again.</li>
            <li>It is soothing and comforting, and very feminine.</li>
            <li>Without the sourness I&#x27;d really like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, she really likes it and also likes the packaging and bottle.</li>
            <li>&amp; she really likes it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely adore this scent, but it fades within moments of usage.</li>
            <li>This perfume is a grown-up, lightly floral, romantic scent.</li>
            <li>so we hope she likes it as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>I wish they would clearly say it on the listing, because I would have purchased the one from the link I posted eve if it&#x27;s only a couple dollars more.</li>
            <li>Is it possible that we got a class A, not the original one?</li>
            <li>would highly recommend you try a sample of this on your skin before buying a medium to large size.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like a heavy scent and this one is light and sweet.</li>
            <li>My new go-to scent!</li>
            <li>I particularly like it for its optimistic lightness.</li>
            <li>The one i received is obviously the old/bad one because the scent is \\&quot;off\\&quot; and smells more like alcohol than the actual fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Bvlgari Omnia Amethyste is a decent perfume.</li>
            <li>The only reason redeeming factor in the recent purchase was that I was refunded by an Amazon agent promptly after notifying them.</li>
            <li>The product scent was not as strong as expected..</li>
            <li>the priced is too high here in us</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.    </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone to buy.  </li>
            <li>The bulk of it is floral and clean notes, somewhat rosy, a little bit herbal and fresh.</li>
            <li>&quot; But this one, Amethyste, while it still has those characteristics, also has \\&quot;a little more impact, it&#x27;s a little more formal...</li>
            <li>She says all the Bvlgari perfumes (at least the six or seven she owns) are \\&quot;light and clean and fresh.\\</li>
            <li>Since then, I didn&#x27;t replace it because it was just too expensive, but I happened to look for it on amazon and couldn&#x27;t believe the great price.  </li>
            <li>I love this fragrance - it&#x27;s one of the few that does not give me a headache.  </li>
            <li>Saved a few bucks and was able to avoid the hassle of going to a mall.</li>
            <li>It did not look like a brand new item at all.</li>
            <li>The products arrive sealed and brand new.  </li>
            <li>my old ones tht i bought in jpan is more cozy and one spray</li>
            <li>Good price and fast shipping and without the worries of buying a fake product.</li>
            <li>I had BVL Blue in the past, and it smelled absolutely amazing, to the extent that I used to wear it everyday and all my colleagues were able to tell whenever I was around.</li>
            <li>The after scent is repugnant though, so be safe just to use a small amount - a squirt will do.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell what it is, but when I sniff my wrists I get fresh florals followed by this sour note.</li>
            <li>Although a pleasant fragrance, don&#x27;t plan on standing out; six ladies in the line behind you are probably wearing the same scent.</li>
            <li>My day wouldnt be complete without it.</li>
            <li>quality and price was great, much less expensive than the stores and the service from the seller was first class too.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve purchased 3 of these from Amazon last year and they were all great, I ran out recently and ordered another one however the new one that arrived has a different box, the fragrance is weak and reeks of alcohol.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>This is the second time I ordered this particular perfume from Amazon</li>
            <li>No other perfume can compete with this, a perfume &amp; a mood lifter!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s different from Bvlgari Omnia Amethyst from the mall that definitely smells stronger and lasted a whole lot longer.</li>
            <li>And the font style pictured on the box here is not the one I got; both of the ones I received have &amp;#34;Omnia&amp;#34; in cursive so I can only assume that the ones sent to me are different from the real product.</li>
            <li>Exactly as it is supposed to smell, and for half the price.</li>
            <li>I think is not original because when I use it the odor goes away very fast..</li>
            <li>At first I thought Amazon was selling fakes, but apparently they have different stocks and they are selling the older one which are no good anymore.  </li>
            <li>and I am getting a refund, the rep also explained that there are two editions, even though they are the same brand and same line and same name, basically one is old and the other one is new.  </li>
            <li>Apparently it appeals to a broad demographic and a wide range of ages.  </li>

            <li> Great product fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I love this scent and was very happy and surprised when my husband bought me a brand new, beautiful bottle for Christmas.</li>
            <li> It is very light, seductive and sexy.</li>
            <li> The scent is very elegant and unique, you will fall in love with it   </li>
            <li> Great smell, check who you are buying it from to make sure is the real deal, this one was.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> On top of that, there were scratch marks on the bottle as if someone dropped it on asphalt.</li>
            <li> What does a stone (semi precious at that) smell like?</li>
            <li> I like it more than the softer perfume that I just purchased(Juicy)</li>
            <li> Anyway, I love this perfume and don&#x27;t have to ask anyone if you smell this perfume on me.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Sincerely,  Alvaro from Costa Rica</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this when I smelled it in the perfume shop in the Italy Pavilion in Epcot, where it costs $65</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE Bulgari Omnia Amethyste</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll come in a store to check out whether that is the authentic smell of this line.</li>

            <li> Smells fantastic!     </li>
            <li> I like most of this scent.</li>
            <li> a more sophisticated fragrance.\\&quot; \\&quot;Something you would wear when dressing up...not with jeans\\</li>
            <li> This is the most refreshing perfume ever.  </li>
            <li> I could not say more about this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this perfume back in 2008 as a gift from my best friend.</li>
            <li> I love this product..</li>
            <li> Her top two favorite scents are this, the Bulgari Amethyst, and Giorgio of Beverly Hills.  </li>
            <li> She can&#x27;t decide which she likes better.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume of all time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite scents by bvlgari.  </li>
            <li> glad i can still buy it online since i can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll always include it in my wish list. :)</li>
            <li> Very suttle and great for day or evening.</li>
            <li> I wear it mostly at daytime because its light, fresh,and lovely.</li>
            <li> Thank you for selling this fabulous perfume; at such a Magnificent rate!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light sexy scent.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get my bridesmaids something useful and something I knew all girls liked.</li>
            <li> got this for my moms birthday good price and really seemed to like it.</li>
            <li> When I first applied Amethyste it had a bright floral scent that was fresh and appropriate for daytime wear.</li>
            <li> so it was an easy choice - its fragrance is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> it is the most beautiful scent i&#x27;ve smelled in a long time.</li>
            <li> I liked the light and fresh scent but it seemed like it wore off quite easily.  </li>
            <li> My husband likes it a lot because it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> At that time I thought it was too strong &amp; not too keen on it.</li>
            <li> I love Versace&#x27;s Bright Crystal, and I was told this was similar but better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering and have a cool powdery smell which I love.</li>
            <li> I got this wonderfull fragrance in a nice package and really fast.</li>
            <li> she said light scent</li>
            <li> I wear this in the morning on important days or days</li>
            <li> This is one of my top 5 favorite scents in the whole world.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this scent and the price was very good based on other vendors.</li>
            <li> The con is that this scent has been done to death and it smells exactly like a very popular perfume by Dolce and Gabbana, &#x27;Light Blue&#x27;, which may be more readily available and cheaper.</li>
            <li> This perfume is light and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> the original one.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the scent, ever since I first smelled it.</li>
            <li> When I was reading the reviews, I got soooo excited about my Omnia Amethyste purchase.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure she loves</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance so much!</li>
            <li> Not disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li> The perfume is not heavy and is never smells stagnant, but does have a nice, light, lingering fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The white fragrance was my favorite however this one smells nice as well.  </li>
            <li> The smell was not quite pleasant, something like acetone mixed with perfume.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume and it&#x27;s super reasonable in price I always purchase is on amazon!</li>
            <li> Certainly I would recommend,  shipping was accurate!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift for someone special</li>
            <li> Just right!</li>
            <li> which has the same box as the ones I had before and loved..  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has good lasting power.  </li>
            <li> It is sweet, but not overpowering.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your lady likes sweet, but not over-powering smells, she&#x27;ll like this.</li>
            <li> I need something to instantly make me feel good.</li>
            <li> It makes you feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> High-quality, scent warms to the skin, subtle and perfect.</li>
            <li> this has quickly become my signature fragrance.</li>
            <li> The product came on time, the packaging was also nice, but the bottle itself looked a bit cheap and fragile.</li>
            <li> Fragrant and mild cologne that stays all day.</li>
            <li> Paid nearly double that at the mall so to find it for that cheap was amazing</li>
            <li> One of my very favorites although wears off very quickly</li>
            <li> Such a lovely smell!</li>
            <li> Is ok , the smells is little strong for my taste , but is ok if you use little&lt;br /&gt;have</li>
            <li> I was on the airport and was about to buy this perfume in the duty free, but desided to wait and buy it through Amazon, the price is much better and the perfume is the same as always.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, I get lots of compliments, it has a soft scent nothing overpowering, that people know you are coming before you get in the room.</li>
            <li> Will order more later love it and delivery was fast</li>
            <li> This perfume is by far, my favorite from all the perfumes I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> this particular one is so light and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this light floral scent which I usually don&#x27;t where because most floral scents smell like that old fashioned rose perfume which I dislike so much because some of the women in my grandmothers old church would wear it all the time.</li>
            <li> Romantic and refreshing fragrance smells.</li>
            <li> u won&#x27;t regret hahahaa XDD  Fast shipment!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume eversince!been buying this personally..</li>
            <li> this one on amazon is more like watery!!;(((and dnt even last</li>
            <li> you so much!</li>
            <li> It is a light soft scent it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> My ultimate favorite.</li>
            <li> It is very light, but stays for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> Green Sap, Pink Grapefruit, Iris Flower, Bulgarian Rosebud, Heliotrope, Solar Wood&#x3D; wonderful!</li>
            <li> This knockoff with all the packaging, labels, design etc comes very close at first smell.  </li>
            <li> I received my order very rapidly and the product was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Although it smells good, the scent does not last long.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this perfume, it&#x27;s light scent is long lasting, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Because it is right what i was looking for, and the fragance is very soft an femenine.</li>
            <li> planning on getting the whole selection eventually&lt;</li>
            <li> very well i will buy this again.</li>
            <li> It is soothing and comforting, and very feminine.</li>
            <li> Without the sourness I&#x27;d really like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, she really likes it and also likes the packaging and bottle.</li>
            <li> &amp; she really likes it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely adore this scent, but it fades within moments of usage.</li>
            <li> This perfume is a grown-up, lightly floral, romantic scent.</li>
            <li> so we hope she likes it as much as I do.  </li>
            <li> I wish they would clearly say it on the listing, because I would have purchased the one from the link I posted eve if it&#x27;s only a couple dollars more.</li>
            <li> Is it possible that we got a class A, not the original one?</li>
            <li> would highly recommend you try a sample of this on your skin before buying a medium to large size.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like a heavy scent and this one is light and sweet.</li>
            <li> My new go-to scent!</li>
            <li> I particularly like it for its optimistic lightness.</li>
            <li> The one i received is obviously the old/bad one because the scent is \\&quot;off\\&quot; and smells more like alcohol than the actual fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Bvlgari Omnia Amethyste is a decent perfume.</li>
            <li> The only reason redeeming factor in the recent purchase was that I was refunded by an Amazon agent promptly after notifying them.</li>
            <li> The product scent was not as strong as expected..</li>
            <li> the priced is too high here in us</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.    </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone to buy.  </li>
            <li> The bulk of it is floral and clean notes, somewhat rosy, a little bit herbal and fresh.</li>
            <li> &quot; But this one, Amethyste, while it still has those characteristics, also has \\&quot;a little more impact, it&#x27;s a little more formal...</li>
            <li> She says all the Bvlgari perfumes (at least the six or seven she owns) are \\&quot;light and clean and fresh.\\</li>
            <li> Since then, I didn&#x27;t replace it because it was just too expensive, but I happened to look for it on amazon and couldn&#x27;t believe the great price.  </li>
            <li> I love this fragrance - it&#x27;s one of the few that does not give me a headache.  </li>
            <li> Saved a few bucks and was able to avoid the hassle of going to a mall.</li>
            <li> It did not look like a brand new item at all.</li>
            <li> The products arrive sealed and brand new.  </li>
            <li> my old ones tht i bought in jpan is more cozy and one spray</li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipping and without the worries of buying a fake product.</li>
            <li> I had BVL Blue in the past, and it smelled absolutely amazing, to the extent that I used to wear it everyday and all my colleagues were able to tell whenever I was around.</li>
            <li> The after scent is repugnant though, so be safe just to use a small amount - a squirt will do.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell what it is, but when I sniff my wrists I get fresh florals followed by this sour note.</li>
            <li> Although a pleasant fragrance, don&#x27;t plan on standing out; six ladies in the line behind you are probably wearing the same scent.</li>
            <li> My day wouldnt be complete without it.</li>
            <li> quality and price was great, much less expensive than the stores and the service from the seller was first class too.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve purchased 3 of these from Amazon last year and they were all great, I ran out recently and ordered another one however the new one that arrived has a different box, the fragrance is weak and reeks of alcohol.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> This is the second time I ordered this particular perfume from Amazon</li>
            <li> No other perfume can compete with this, a perfume &amp; a mood lifter!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s different from Bvlgari Omnia Amethyst from the mall that definitely smells stronger and lasted a whole lot longer.</li>
            <li> And the font style pictured on the box here is not the one I got; both of the ones I received have &amp;#34;Omnia&amp;#34; in cursive so I can only assume that the ones sent to me are different from the real product.</li>
            <li> Exactly as it is supposed to smell, and for half the price.</li>
            <li> I think is not original because when I use it the odor goes away very fast..</li>
            <li> At first I thought Amazon was selling fakes, but apparently they have different stocks and they are selling the older one which are no good anymore.  </li>
            <li> and I am getting a refund, the rep also explained that there are two editions, even though they are the same brand and same line and same name, basically one is old and the other one is new.  </li>
            <li> Apparently it appeals to a broad demographic and a wide range of ages.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last long - thus 4 not 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> The smell is different and does not stay long as the one I purchased from Nordstorm.</li>
            <li> Long lasting,  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last really long at all!</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> last til i woke up the other day..</li>
            <li> I do not have to spray several times, so it stays on with just a few sprays.</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday and get constant compliments.</li>
            <li> After a few hours of wear while running errands, I could still smell the fragrance -- only now it smelled like Ivory soap.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but the smell was not quite something that I expected.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive, but worth it.  </li>
            <li> Quality is not as expected.</li>
            <li> Everything as expected</li>
            <li> Floral without being too poofy, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Just what I expected, and at a bargain too!</li>
            <li> ,bcz i dnt knw if they sent me a fake one,cz my old ones scent last longer</li>
            <li> I got it for at least 50% off the regular price.  </li>
            <li> Later, after a few attempts to wear it as I don&#x27;t like to waste my perfume, I noticed I got complimented a lot for this!</li>
            <li> The problem for me is that there&#x27;s one note going sour on me.</li>
            <li> but I found it here for about $40 less.</li>
            <li> Both perfumes I got from here seem &amp;#34;watered&amp;#34; down and it literally flies away in just a few moments after application.</li>
            <li> and u are getting this one for half price!  </li>
            <li> but at the end i will preferer not to by for this way because it was expensive perhaps try next wuith other products.</li>
            <li> My usual experience with perfume is that it evaporates before I leave the house</li>
            <li> I was confused on which one to order because Amazon has two listings, the other one is [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Hardly recommend it.</li>
            <li> We saw this on a cruise and it was much less expensive here, my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> If you notice the word \\&quot;Omnia\\&quot; on the box, the one is cursive is the bad one and thats what I just received.  </li>
            <li> ,im confused when i gt it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never get tired of this scent.</li>
            <li> Seriously get it!</li>
            <li> My friends, my co-workers, random people on the bus compliment this perfume.  </li>
            <li> I like it, my wife says it is a fake.</li>
            <li> I found the scent to be too tame and a bit boring.</li>
            <li> i hve to spray a lot and the box is ugly..</li>
            <li> It took 10 days :(&lt;br /&gt;Although, it was specified up front.</li>
            <li> Greatly disappointed.</li>
            <li> However, when I opened it today, I was disappointed.</li>

            <li> Great smell, check who you are buying it from to make sure is the real deal, this one was.</li>
            <li> wife birthday gift  she loved it !!!!</li>
            <li> she loves everything Bvlgari so it was an easy choice - its fragrance is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;- planning on getting the whole selection eventually&lt;br /&gt;sppedy delivery!</li>
            <li> This perfume is her preferred scent and I keep her well stocked with it. It smells very nice on her and she uses it almost daily. I don&#x27;t like a heavy scent and this one is light and sweet.</li>
            <li> I bought for my girlfriend, and she loves it, of course for me it&#x27;s a pleasure that she wear the perfume.</li>
            <li> I love it. i received a lot compliments from my coworkers both male and female. My day wouldnt be complete without it. I wear it mostly at daytime because its light, fresh,and lovely.</li>
            <li> One of my very favorites although wears off very quickly</li>
            <li> This fragrance is one of my favorites, and I ordered one 2.2 oz for myself and another for my mom. When my mom opened her perfume, the wrap was not even properly sealed, and we could already smell the perfume just by unwrapping it. On top of that, there were scratch marks on the bottle as if someone dropped it on asphalt. It did not look like a brand new item at all. The content is still there and the smell is the same so I guess she&#x27;s rather gonna keep it than going through all the refund/exchange process.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!  It makes you feel fresh and clean. You won&#x27;t notice it though, after wearing it for some time...but others do!! I&#x27;ve had good compliments from it. My husband likes it a lot because it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> My friends, my co-workers, random people on the bus compliment this perfume.  Apparently it appeals to a broad demographic and a wide range of ages.  I particularly like it for its optimistic lightness. The bottle is reasonably attractive. My usual experience with perfume is that it evaporates before I leave the house but Amethyste lasts for several hours. My only criticism is its name.  It isn&#x27;t evocative of anything.  What does a stone (semi precious at that) smell like?</li>
            <li> I do not have to spray several times, so it stays on with just a few sprays. I always get complements about this perfume every time I wear it. I like it more than the softer perfume that I just purchased(Juicy) the original one. Anyway, I love this perfume and don&#x27;t have to ask anyone if you smell this perfume on me. I walk in the room and then people say what smells sooo good, and um I am delighted to say,oh that is me&#x3D;) Great perfume you will love it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. It is very light, seductive and sexy. I will buy again and recommend to friends and relatives.</li>
            <li> Great price and Great gift!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect gift for Christmas!!!</li>
            <li> I was on the airport and was about to buy this perfume in the duty free, but desided to wait and buy it through Amazon, the price is much better and the perfume is the same as always.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> Everything is ok! Nice purchase,  I&#x27;m satisfied with this one! Sincerely,  Alvaro from Costa Rica</li>
            <li> it is the most beautiful scent i&#x27;ve smelled in a long time.</li>
            <li> I wore this perfume on my wedding day four years ago.  Since then, I didn&#x27;t replace it because it was just too expensive, but I happened to look for it on amazon and couldn&#x27;t believe the great price.  I got it for at least 50% off the regular price.  The item was in great condition when it arrived.  Would purchase this product again from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance - it&#x27;s one of the few that does not give me a headache.  The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last long - thus 4 not 5 stars.  Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li> very light and delicious to wear</li>
            <li> This us my favorite perfume!!-</li>
            <li> One of my closest and dearest friends came for a visit one weekend and I couldn&#x27;t help but smell her cologne. I had to have it!  I love it!</li>
            <li> The product scent was not as strong as expected..</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this when I smelled it in the perfume shop in the Italy Pavilion in Epcot, where it costs $65+. (It&#x27;s also $65 at Ulta and Dillard&#x27;s.) Finally decided to go for it and buy here to save some money. Received it tonight and it smells heavenly! Exactly as it is supposed to smell, and for half the price. I&#x27;m so very pleased!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume.  The perfume is not heavy and is never smells stagnant, but does have a nice, light, lingering fragrance.  I am always complimented when I wear this scent.  LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> this has quickly become my signature fragrance. I LOVE LOVE LOVE Bulgari Omnia Amethyste and this is my 4th bottle i believe. I use to buy it in the stores but I found it here for about $40 less.</li>
            <li> My Wife Smells Great!</li>
            <li> One of the best of the Bulgari series</li>
            <li> I think is not original because when I use it the odor goes away very fast..</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume in my collection. I wear it everyday and get constant compliments. So glad I found it and for a better price than in the department store,</li>
            <li> I love this scent, I get lots of compliments, it has a soft scent nothing overpowering, that people know you are coming before you get in the room. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I got this wonderfull fragrance in a nice package and really fast. The smell is whatIwant.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife.  Although it smells good, the scent does not last long.  Is it possible that we got a class A, not the original one?</li>
            <li> Great product fast delivery! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Romantic and refreshing fragrance smells.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve purchased 3 of these from Amazon last year and they were all great, I ran out recently and ordered another one however the new one that arrived has a different box, the fragrance is weak and reeks of alcohol. clearly different from what I had before.  I was confused on which one to order because Amazon has two listings, the other one is [[ASIN:B00137Q98G Bvlgari Toilette Spray Bulgari Amethyste]] which has the same box as the ones I had before and loved..  Why are there two different listings for the same product? if in fact they are the same.  If you notice the word \\&quot;Omnia\\&quot; on the box, the one is cursive is the bad one and thats what I just received.  I spoke to a customer rep and I am getting a refund, the rep also explained that there are two editions, even though they are the same brand and same line and same name, basically one is old and the other one is new.  The one i received is obviously the old/bad one because the scent is \\&quot;off\\&quot; and smells more like alcohol than the actual fragrance.  At first I thought Amazon was selling fakes, but apparently they have different stocks and they are selling the older one which are no good anymore.  I wish they would clearly say it on the listing, because I would have purchased the one from the link I posted eve if it&#x27;s only a couple dollars more.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Love this scent a lot my boyfriend just love it!  The scent is very elegant and unique, you will fall in love with it   Great Deal! I have been looking at Sephora, Nordstrom and fragrance store...2.2oz is regularly 80 bucks  and u are getting this one for half price!  great deal isn&#x27;t it?  Seriously get it! u won&#x27;t regret hahahaa XDD  Fast shipment! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Bvlgari Omnia Amethyste is a decent perfume. When I first applied Amethyste it had a bright floral scent that was fresh and appropriate for daytime wear. It has good longevity so there&#x27;s no reason to douse. After a few hours of wear while running errands, I could still smell the fragrance -- only now it smelled like Ivory soap. The con is that this scent has been done to death and it smells exactly like a very popular perfume by Dolce and Gabbana, &#x27;Light Blue&#x27;, which may be more readily available and cheaper. Although a pleasant fragrance, don&#x27;t plan on standing out; six ladies in the line behind you are probably wearing the same scent.</li>
            <li> Of the three Bulgari made this one is the nicest.  Floral without being too poofy, and a little goes a long way.  A seductive scent. Nice to spray in your hair too.</li>
            <li> este perfume es excelente me encanto y lo recomiendo lo volveria a comprar, is a good perfume smell very well i will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Saved money and gave my wife the fragrance she loves. Better than buying flowers and lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this fragrance.  It is floral and fruity, and does remind me of amethysts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has good lasting power.  It is sweet, but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received many compliments while wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;New condition, factory sealed.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is the delivery time. It took 10 days :(&lt;br /&gt;Although, it was specified up front.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this scent and the price was very good based on other vendors.</li>
            <li> This knockoff with all the packaging, labels, design etc comes very close at first smell.  The after scent is repugnant though, so be safe just to use a small amount - a squirt will do.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but the smell was not quite something that I expected. I had BVL Blue in the past, and it smelled absolutely amazing, to the extent that I used to wear it everyday and all my colleagues were able to tell whenever I was around. I ran out of that, and decided to try another BVL product, which is this Omnia Amethyste. The product came on time, the packaging was also nice, but the bottle itself looked a bit cheap and fragile. The smell was not quite pleasant, something like acetone mixed with perfume. I don&#x27;t wear it so often, but am not planning to return it either. I&#x27;ll come in a store to check out whether that is the authentic smell of this line. I hope I am just being picky.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as it did in store but has a very good smell overall. Doesn&#x27;t last really long at all!</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift. I&#x27;m inlove with the smell.. It&#x27;s not overpowering and have a cool powdery smell which I love. Definitely gonna buy again!</li>
            <li> I wanted to get my bridesmaids something useful and something I knew all girls liked. I wasn&#x27;t familiar with the product, but I bought 5 of these for my bridesmaids and they loved it! I will also be ordering for me soon :)</li>
            <li> I love this perfume eversince!been buying this personally..bt the priced is too high here in us so i decide to order online,im confused when i gt it,bcz i dnt knw if they sent me a fake one,cz my old ones scent last longer this one on amazon is more like watery!!;(((and dnt even last i hve to spray a lot and the box is ugly..my old ones tht i bought in jpan is more cozy and one spray last til i woke up the other day..uhm for tht i would nver buy perfumes here</li>
            <li> Im happy with this purchase, good product at a good price. I would definitely buy it again and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great price and smells awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never get tired of this scent.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume and it&#x27;s super reasonable in price I always purchase is on amazon! Comes sealed and it&#x27;s the best perfume!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of all BVGARI products!  A bit expensive, but worth it.  Packaging is good, and love the looks of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the scent, ever since I first smelled it. It is soothing and comforting, and very feminine. I deem it as a must-have.</li>
            <li> but at the end i will preferer not to by for this way because it was expensive perhaps try next wuith other products. Tahnks anyway</li>
            <li> to my friendï¼Œshe love it</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. Amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li> Quality is not as expected. The smell is different and does not stay long as the one I purchased from Nordstorm.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD QUALITY BRAND. I RECOMEND FOR EVERYBODY.</li>
            <li> Very good quality product. Excellent presentation shipping</li>
            <li> It is my favorite purfume! I Was able to buy 2 bottles because of the price and no shipping feesThank you so much! Amazon rocks!</li>
            <li> It is a light soft scent it lasts all day. I love it!</li>
            <li> This perfume is light and clean smelling. I have had people stop me to ask me what I was wearing.  I&#x27;d say that is a good thing!!</li>
            <li> Everything arrived in a timely fashion and just as ordered. This is one of my top 5 favorite scents in the whole world. People ALWAYS comment when I wear it. I will never stop buying this product. Great job, great scent!</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic!     A neighbor would wear it and I finally had to ask her what it was and this was it! Lasts a long time. It&#x27;s strong but not overwhelming.  Highly recommend.    Perfume Notes: Green Sap, Pink Grapefruit, Iris Flower, Bulgarian Rosebud, Heliotrope, Solar Wood&#x3D; wonderful!</li>
            <li> I like most of this scent. The bulk of it is floral and clean notes, somewhat rosy, a little bit herbal and fresh. It&#x27;s a really nice summer scent, like a garden on a not-too-hot, not-too-cool summer day. The problem for me is that there&#x27;s one note going sour on me. I can&#x27;t really tell what it is, but when I sniff my wrists I get fresh florals followed by this sour note. Without the sourness I&#x27;d really like it.</li>
            <li> Smells great. I feel as if I just came out if the shower when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. She says all the Bvlgari perfumes (at least the six or seven she owns) are \\&quot;light and clean and fresh.\\&quot; But this one, Amethyste, while it still has those characteristics, also has \\&quot;a little more impact, it&#x27;s a little more formal...a more sophisticated fragrance.\\&quot; \\&quot;Something you would wear when dressing up...not with jeans\\&quot; That&#x27;s how she described it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, she really likes it and also likes the packaging and bottle.</li>
            <li> I gave my host family to present for the Christmas they like it! Because of the smell I think! They said it !&#x27;s good smell</li>
            <li> Because it is right what i was looking for, and the fragance is very soft an femenine. Also the price.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Great Price!</li>
            <li> Everything as expected</li>
            <li> Seems to wear off after awhile. When I purchased a bottle last time it was way stronger.  It has all the correct labels but still seems fishy.</li>
            <li> It came on time ,according to my friend  she said light scent &amp; she really likes it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely adore this scent, but it fades within moments of usage. Greatly disappointed. I&#x27;ll try it on a department store, but is a 5 start accent.</li>
            <li> This is the most refreshing perfume ever.  I smelled it on my sister and had to have some so I looked on Amazon. Thankfully it was on here and I am in awe of it.</li>
            <li> I love it on my wife!</li>
            <li> My favorite winter fragrance!</li>
            <li> When I was reading the reviews, I got soooo excited about my Omnia Amethyste purchase. I love Versace&#x27;s Bright Crystal, and I was told this was similar but better. However, when I opened it today, I was disappointed. I found the scent to be too tame and a bit boring. Perhaps it&#x27;s just how it mixes with my skin, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend you try a sample of this on your skin before buying a medium to large size.</li>
            <li> Perfect scent! Everyone who smells it would ask what it was..</li>
            <li> Will order more later love it and delivery was fast</li>
            <li> Great smellimg perfume</li>
            <li> Wife loves the fragrance, as do I.  She wears it all the time now (guess I&#x27;ll have to buy another bottle!)</li>
            <li> The perfume arrived in perfect condition. It is a delicious aroma</li>
            <li> I love this light floral scent which I usually don&#x27;t where because most floral scents smell like that old fashioned rose perfume which I dislike so much because some of the women in my grandmothers old church would wear it all the time.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, well packed, nice presentation, nice aroma, good quality, and Mon liked it a lot. Hardly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wifes favorite perfume at a great price. Saved a few bucks and was able to avoid the hassle of going to a mall.</li>
            <li> Is ok , the smells is little strong for my taste , but is ok if you use little&lt;br /&gt;have great price , come on time</li>
            <li> This is the best perfume and my signature brand! Thank you for selling this fabulous perfume; at such a Magnificent rate!!!!!</li>
            <li> I could not say more about this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bvlgari are famous for some of the most beautiful perfumes and this particular one is so light and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality and price was great, much less expensive than the stores and the service from the seller was first class too.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. It smells good and it came nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> I like it, my wife says it is a fake. Good price.</li>
            <li> I received this perfume back in 2008 as a gift from my best friend. At that time I thought it was too strong &amp; not too keen on it. Later, after a few attempts to wear it as I don&#x27;t like to waste my perfume, I noticed I got complimented a lot for this! Then I started changing my mind. Today, I&#x27;m on my third bottle already &amp; will keep buying it, its a must have in my collection!!! No other perfume can compete with this, a perfume &amp; a mood lifter! I used to wear it when I go out at night &amp; clubbing but now I wear it for work too!</li>
            <li> You know you have a winner when people stop you in a department store or at a grocery store and ask you what scent you are wearing. It is very light, but stays for a long period of time. I do have respiratory concerns with scents, this was the one scent that I have no concerns with.</li>
            <li> Fragrant and mild cologne that stays all day.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I ordered this particular perfume from Amazon but it&#x27;s different from Bvlgari Omnia Amethyst from the mall that definitely smells stronger and lasted a whole lot longer. Both perfumes I got from here seem &amp;#34;watered&amp;#34; down and it literally flies away in just a few moments after application. And the font style pictured on the box here is not the one I got; both of the ones I received have &amp;#34;Omnia&amp;#34; in cursive so I can only assume that the ones sent to me are different from the real product. The only reason redeeming factor in the recent purchase was that I was refunded by an Amazon agent promptly after notifying them. Well, lesson learned. Next time, I will just buy from the mall.</li>
            <li> We saw this on a cruise and it was much less expensive here, my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this product..I will buy again!</li>
            <li> I received my order very rapidly and the product was exactly what I wanted. I an very pleased with it! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I liked the light and fresh scent but it seemed like it wore off quite easily.  The bottle was nice, for those of you who collect bottles.</li>
            <li> I brought this item back to Korea to give to my wife as a gift.  This year, I&#x27;ve given her about 5 bottles of cologne.  Her top two favorite scents are this, the Bulgari Amethyst, and Giorgio of Beverly Hills.  She can&#x27;t decide which she likes better.  That means I&#x27;ll have to get her both next time.  I got them both from Amazon.  I have no complaints.  The products arrive sealed and brand new.  Don&#x27;t worry, the colognes from Amazon are great quality and are perfectly genuine.  I can&#x27;t complain about the price either.  It was a good deal all the way around.</li>
            <li> I love Bvlgari but especially love Amethyste!  This is a scent that attracts attention - people always ask the name and where I got it.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and was very happy and surprised when my husband bought me a brand new, beautiful bottle for Christmas. This perfume is a grown-up, lightly floral, romantic scent. If your lady likes sweet, but not over-powering smells, she&#x27;ll like this. It makes me feel fresh and beautiful. High-quality, scent warms to the skin, subtle and perfect.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume of all time. I wear this in the morning on important days or days I need something to instantly make me feel good.</li>
