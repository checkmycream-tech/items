            <li> I find making shakes to be messy, with these tablets you can eat them like candy and get the grams of protein you require, the slight taste of honey makes them tolerable, it would be like eating the powder alone without it, everyone has their way</li>
            <li> The most nasty tasting I have ever had and to chew six tablets no thanks</li>
            <li> it was a waste of time and money</li>
            <li> Horrible, and very chalky tasting.</li>

            <li> Only 1/2 of a gram of protein per tablet!</li>
            <li> Horrible, and very chalky tasting.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Taste great too!</li>
            <li> I purchased these because I wasn&#x27;t getting enough protein in my diet. They taste good and I seem to have a spike in energy after I eat them which is great. For some reason, I pictured them looking almost like jelly candies lol They are actually round, solid and chewable kind of like a rolaid. I wish there were a little more protein in one serving (you have to eat 6 of these for 3g of protein) but other than that, they&#x27;re great!</li>
