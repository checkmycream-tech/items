            <li>It is, however a beautiful cool toned</li>
            <li>This color stands up nicely just by itself...</li>
            <li>I do my own shellac nails at home and this polish lasts almost 2 weeks before showing any wear.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous color, goes on smooth and lasts for two weeks.</li>
            <li>Great color for fall, goes on nicely and evenly, really like the shellac CND line, do it myself at home which saves me a lot of money and time!  </li>
            <li>I love this CND Shellac color.</li>
            <li>i use OPI top coat gel.</li>
            <li>, wish there were more colors.</li>
            <li>; I think it will work for many skin tones, against my plae skin</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This is a sophisticated color.</li>
            <li>and I love this color.</li>
            <li>I have had many compliments.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, this brand paints on like a dream; showing no bumps, streaks, or mistakes.</li>
            <li>Very nice red.</li>
            <li>think this is fast becoming my favorite Shellac color</li>
            <li>So just make sure you really want it!  </li>
            <li>Great color, like a red wine- burgundy color almost looks raisin in certain light.</li>
            <li>Color is true to its picture.</li>
            <li>This Tinted Love color is very in style this fall season.  </li>
            <li>I love the whole shellac system.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>good for pale cool skin tones!</li>
            <li>but well worth the investment if you are in to doing home manicure/pedicures.</li>
            <li>this was just this right</li>
            <li>Color more red than burgundy.</li>
            <li>Pretty color, but accidentally ordered duplicate colors and discovered that Amazon can&#x27;t take returns on items that pose shipping hazards - like nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Similar to decadence, but maybe more of a purple undertone, however not purple in color by any means.</li>
            <li>and that is exactly what this is.  </li>
            <li>Nail polish lasts two weeks or more as long as you refrain from picking at your nails.</li>
            <li>Looks a little bit brighter than on the picture but still very elegant and modern.</li>
            <li>It does not lift like other gel nailpolishes and has a nice smooth regular nail polish texture.</li>
            <li>Would absolutely buy again and recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not clownish red or old lady red either, it&#x27;s gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Just be certain you have the CND base and top coats and the curing lamp, and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li>I personally like getting a flat (but very shiny) color like this because you can always add a top coat that has more flare while still having the option of keeping it simple.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To get the perfect look I start with a super thin base coat from Shellac, two minutes to cure, two coats of Tinted Love  - it really needs both to develop into the color you see in the bottle, each for a trwo minute cure, then a generous swipe of the Shellac top coat for three minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It can be a little bright in the sunlight, and very deep indoors.</li>
            <li>a really different shade of red, like a good bottlee of red wine, a deep claret hue!</li>
            <li>This was a new try for me.</li>
            <li>Such a pretty color.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that comment on other colors and thought that couldn&#x27;t be true, but it is.  </li>
            <li>Sort of like a blood red but a little more on the raspberry side.</li>
            <li>While the color selection for Shellac is a bit more limited than other brands they&#x27;ve been doing much better lately with their color collections.</li>
            <li>It is clearly stated, but I still missed it in my rush of Christmas ordering.</li>
            <li>I can peel itnoff after a weekmorntwo with no damage ronthe natural nail.</li>
            <li>I have zero damage to my natural nails since switching to this CND brand.</li>
            <li>With one coat it does look far lighter than the bottle, like a deep fushia almost but with two coats, you get a deep dark claret red that is so perfect for the fall and winter season, and frankly, a little different to all the other red varieties out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tinted Love is a little thinner than some of my other CND polishes.  </li>
            <li>Will last easily two weeks per manicure (but i usually end up changing colors each week becuse</li>
            <li>I fins this MUCH preferable to other formpas/ brands that must be soaked off.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great color for fall.</li>
            <li> I love this CND Shellac color. Color is true to its picture. Nail polish lasts two weeks or more as long as you refrain from picking at your nails. This brand is probably the best brand out there. It does not lift like other gel nailpolishes and has a nice smooth regular nail polish texture.</li>
            <li> Color more red than burgundy. Great formula. I can peel itnoff after a weekmorntwo with no damage ronthe natural nail.I fins this MUCH preferable to other formpas/ brands that must be soaked off. I worry about soaking my hands in nail,polish remover chemicals for 15-20 minutes. With this brand, I just run a fingernail uner the esge of the gel and,most of the time, I can peel it off a nail in one piece. I have zero damage to my natural nails since switching to this CND brand. i use OPI top coat gel.</li>
            <li> Pretty color, but accidentally ordered duplicate colors and discovered that Amazon can&#x27;t take returns on items that pose shipping hazards - like nail polish.  So just make sure you really want it!  It is clearly stated, but I still missed it in my rush of Christmas ordering.</li>
            <li> best gel with light nail polish ever.  Its the only brand i will now buy.  I like this line, wish there were more colors.</li>
            <li> I have a bunch of Shellac pinks and reds, but wanted something a little different for Fall - this was just this right fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a really different shade of red, like a good bottlee of red wine, a deep claret hue! With one coat it does look far lighter than the bottle, like a deep fushia almost but with two coats, you get a deep dark claret red that is so perfect for the fall and winter season, and frankly, a little different to all the other red varieties out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the perfect look I start with a super thin base coat from Shellac, two minutes to cure, two coats of Tinted Love  - it really needs both to develop into the color you see in the bottle, each for a trwo minute cure, then a generous swipe of the Shellac top coat for three minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is fast becoming my favorite Shellac color; I think it will work for many skin tones, against my plae skin it is very striking and bold, and a perfect pop of color for the Fall!</li>
            <li> I love this CND Shellac Power Polish!  It stays on for 2 weeks and stays shiny.  This Tinted Love color is very in style this fall season.  It looks great on my nails!</li>
            <li> Tinted Love is a little thinner than some of my other CND polishes.  I&#x27;ve read that comment on other colors and thought that couldn&#x27;t be true, but it is.  Use two coats, a coat of Millionaire over the top is candy apple awesome.</li>
            <li> Great color, and product works as it should</li>
            <li> Great color for fall, goes on nicely and evenly, really like the shellac CND line, do it myself at home which saves me a lot of money and time!  Takes about the same amount of application time however, none of that dreaded drying time!</li>
            <li> As always CND shellac is a great quality and this color is beautiful! Looks a little bit brighter than on the picture but still very elegant and modern. Usually I don&#x27;t wear the same color multiple weeks in a row, but this one I&#x27;ve already had for 4 weeks and putting it on again now. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is a sophisticated color. Very nice red. It can be a little bright in the sunlight, and very deep indoors. It&#x27;s not clownish red or old lady red either, it&#x27;s gorgeous. After 3 coats it definitely matches the color on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Just want I needed without hitting the beauty shop... Saves me a trip to the beauty salon.. I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> Great color, like a red wine- burgundy color almost looks raisin in certain light. Amazing fall color! Just be certain you have the CND base and top coats and the curing lamp, and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> Best shellac/gel polish brand I have tried and I love this color. The color paints on as pictured. There is no shimmer/sparkle/iridescence in the shellac - something that I wanted to know before I ordered it and I had trouble figuring out. I personally like getting a flat (but very shiny) color like this because you can always add a top coat that has more flare while still having the option of keeping it simple. Most importantly, this brand paints on like a dream; showing no bumps, streaks, or mistakes. Oh, and it shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I adore Shellac. I know it&#x27;s a bit more on the expensive side for gel polish, but well worth the investment if you are in to doing home manicure/pedicures. Saves a ton on trips to the salon (going upwards of $70 for a gel mani and pedi). Will last easily two weeks per manicure (but i usually end up changing colors each week becuse I have manicure ADD). While the color selection for Shellac is a bit more limited than other brands they&#x27;ve been doing much better lately with their color collections. I have people compliment my maincures all the time, and have directed them to Shellac time and time again.</li>
            <li> I love shellac! This color is not as dark or berry colored as I was expecting. It is, however a beautiful cool toned red- good for pale cool skin tones! Sort of like a blood red but a little more on the raspberry side. Very pretty. It&#x27;s a little darker than it looks in the photo.</li>
            <li> color looks great and covers well and lasts</li>
            <li> I love this color!  It was perfect for Valentine&#x27;s day.  It would change shades of red in different lighting, but overall it was a maroon!</li>
            <li> This color stands up nicely just by itself...I tried layering iced coral over it and didn&#x27;t like the effect at all.  I do my own shellac nails at home and this polish lasts almost 2 weeks before showing any wear.</li>
            <li> This was a new try for me. Like the color. Definitely a deep Merlot color. Very pretty. Similar to decadence, but maybe more of a purple undertone, however not purple in color by any means. Very pretty if your a red girl like me, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color, goes on smooth and lasts for two weeks. Would absolutely buy again and recommend to anyone. Very Happy</li>
            <li> Excellent service, love this color.</li>
            <li> Such a pretty color.  I have had many compliments.  I was looking for a &amp;#34;berry&amp;#34; type color and that is exactly what this is.  I love the whole shellac system.</li>
