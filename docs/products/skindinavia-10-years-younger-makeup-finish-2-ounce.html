            <li>Win some lose some!</li>
            <li>am very wonderful wonderful performance&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple of setting spray and this one is the best of all.</li>
            <li>I keep it in my purse at all times, and apply as needed to look my best always!</li>
            <li>From blush to washable mascara all my makeup was perfect.  </li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>Omg this is amazing!</li>
            <li>I have tried most setting sprays, but their &amp;#34;10 Years Younger&amp;#34; finishing spray I find evens out powder and liquid makeup the best.</li>
            <li>loved this product.</li>
            <li>The good reviews, I guess.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this product.....</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t believe I fell for it,</li>
            <li>It felt nice going on, have a cooling sensation.  </li>
            <li>This warm weather makes me sleepy.  </li>
            <li>Much better stay power with out all the &amp;#34;girl &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>more wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li>no matter how many sprays you put on.</li>
            <li>It was just ok.  </li>
            <li>Any make-up we use, no matter how lightly or tastefully applied, compounds in those creases, aging the way we look.  </li>
            <li>It feels light &amp; doesn&#x27;t make me break out at all.</li>
            <li>I have fair, sensitive, acne-prone, combination/dry skin.</li>
            <li>advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it</li>
            <li>He was right!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t look 10 years younger;) but it is great spray that gives powdered face glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I thought this was fantastic.</li>
            <li>but it really does make your makeup stay on all day even in heat and humidity!!</li>
            <li>Fun while it lasted.</li>
            <li>I use it to keep my foundation fresh all day.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to achieve long lasting &amp; flawless makeup.</li>
            <li>just finished my first bottle</li>
            <li>I have received so many complements from co-workers and friends about how much younger I look since I began using Skindinavia</li>
            <li>As we age, even if they&#x27;re not terribly visible to the naked eye, creases start to appear in our not-so-taut skin.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this &amp; will be purchasing more when I run out.</li>
            <li>is really moisturizing and refreshing, but Skindinavia makes make up last longer, including mascara (so I always spray at the end of the make up routine).</li>
            <li>It goes on easy, and dry pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>I really like this set.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t  take much spraying .  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this setting spray</li>
            <li>but I guess I lack the control and really would rather just reapply a layer of powder.</li>
            <li>I am a 42-year-old woman who often gets mistaken for being a college student, and I owe much of it to Skindinavia</li>
            <li>This product does absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>I expected way more from this product.</li>
            <li>and I am ready to order new one.</li>
            <li>This just didn&#x27;t work  as advertised  no matter how more or less you use save your money</li>
            <li>This makes my makeup stay on all day-which is at least 14 hours or more!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Certainly did not make me look 10 years younger!</li>
            <li>why would they put glitter in an adult finishing spray.....</li>
            <li>I did notice that it has alcohol in it and as a person with sensitive skin, that&#x27;s something I try to stay away from...</li>
            <li>mist is very fine and usually 3 sprays are enough.</li>
            <li>I live in CT &amp; I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Also with age comes added dry skin, and dry skin unequivocally makes one look older.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Skindinavia contains some alcohol but it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out like Urban Decay sprays did.</li>
            <li> Mac or Make Up For Ever have a bigger nozzle and that makes skin very wet (especially MUFE).</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 tries and a big fat</li>

            <li> my make up stays on even when I sweat!</li>
            <li> I bought this because the guy named GossMakeupArtist on youtube recommended it. Wow! He was right! It works so well! This makes my makeup stay on all day-which is at least 14 hours or more!</li>
            <li> Absolute crap. I honestly can&#x27;t believe I fell for it, lol. It went into the trash after a few applications.</li>
            <li> I really like this set. just finished my first bottle and I am ready to order new one. I bought MAC make up spray at the same time and still have 80% left.&lt;br /&gt;Mac is really moisturizing and refreshing, but Skindinavia makes make up last longer, including mascara (so I always spray at the end of the make up routine). I don&#x27;t look 10 years younger;) but it is great spray that gives powdered face glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skindinavia contains some alcohol but it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out like Urban Decay sprays did. Mac and MUFE are moisturizing and make skin look dewy. Skindinavia gives luminous finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mist is very fine and usually 3 sprays are enough. Mac or Make Up For Ever have a bigger nozzle and that makes skin very wet (especially MUFE). But I like 3 of them.</li>
            <li> I wish they would have told me I was going to be spraying heavy sticky,sparkle Ke$ha crap on my freshly done make up.....why would they put glitter in an adult finishing spray.....I have used products with &amp;#34;light reflecting&amp;#34; bits in it....but this is terrible. Nor did the sparkle spray make me look a day younger!! Stick to urban Decays &amp;#34;all nighter&amp;#34; spray. Much better stay power with out all the &amp;#34;girl &amp;#34; power built in!! Win some lose some!</li>
            <li> Product more wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Product beyond description&lt;br /&gt;I advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it personally&lt;br /&gt;I am very wonderful wonderful performance&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy, and dry pretty fast.  Doesn&#x27;t  take much spraying .  Will keep on ordering this when needed.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this setting spray but I didn&#x27;t feel like it did what I purchased it to do...I wanted to get rid if the powdery look that you can sometimes get after applying powders but I couldn&#x27;t see a difference.  It felt nice going on, have a cooling sensation.  I did notice that it has alcohol in it and as a person with sensitive skin, that&#x27;s something I try to stay away from...it did dry me out some, so if you have extremely dry skin I&#x27;d avoid it.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this was fantastic. I sprayed it on, went about my day with my makeup intact for hours and hours. One day I looked in the mirror and saw little spots all over, like droplets of water had landed on my face and dried up. Huh, so I cleaned my face, reapplied and sprayed. I checked again....little droplets. The next day, droplet look again. So I have stopped using this, maybe I am spraying it on too heavily but I guess I lack the control and really would rather just reapply a layer of powder. Fun while it lasted.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this product..... I have received so many complements from co-workers and friends about how much younger I look since I began using Skindinavia</li>
            <li> This product is a must to have in your makeup arsenal. I&#x27;ve tried a couple of setting spray and this one is the best of all.</li>
            <li> It works.  I use it to keep my foundation fresh all day.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference after about a week of use.</li>
            <li> I am a 42-year-old woman who often gets mistaken for being a college student, and I owe much of it to Skindinavia 10 Years Younger Makeup Finish.  As we age, even if they&#x27;re not terribly visible to the naked eye, creases start to appear in our not-so-taut skin.  Any make-up we use, no matter how lightly or tastefully applied, compounds in those creases, aging the way we look.  Also with age comes added dry skin, and dry skin unequivocally makes one look older.  What Skindinavia does is release that buildup from the creases, give you a fresh and moist look (without looking greasy), and literally takes AT LEAST 10 years off of your face and neck.  I keep it in my purse at all times, and apply as needed to look my best always!</li>
            <li> This spray doesn&#x27;t make you look younger but it really does make your makeup stay on all day even in heat and humidity!! I love it!!</li>
            <li> This just didn&#x27;t work  as advertised  no matter how more or less you use save your money Makes a real mess of foundation</li>
            <li> I do not know what possessed me to buy this. The good reviews, I guess. This product does absolutely nothing for me.  It is just like spraying water on my face. And it uncurls my eyelashes!  I gave it 3 tries and a big fat nothign - my makeup does not last any longer than it did before.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to achieve long lasting &amp; flawless makeup. I have tried most setting sprays, but their &amp;#34;10 Years Younger&amp;#34; finishing spray I find evens out powder and liquid makeup the best. My makeup lasted 10+ hours and with no signs of oily skin.</li>
            <li> Omg this is amazing! It gives your face like a invisible mask so literally it will not melt off! And it doesnt make you look wet or oily no matter how many sprays you put on.</li>
            <li> I expected way more from this product. It was just ok.  Certainly did not make me look 10 years younger!</li>
            <li> I live in CT &amp; I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s. I have fair, sensitive, acne-prone, combination/dry skin. This stuff holds my makeup in place all day without fail. It feels light &amp; doesn&#x27;t make me break out at all. I definitely recommend this &amp; will be purchasing more when I run out.</li>
            <li> makes your skin look dewy but does not make makeup last longer...disappointing.</li>
            <li> This warm weather makes me sleepy.  I was reading a book this afternoon.  I fell asleep.  About 90 minutes later I woke up and looked in the mirror.  I said Whaaat?!  From blush to washable mascara all my makeup was perfect.  Too unreal.  I call that nap the acid test.  This stuff rocks!</li>
            <li> Works well.  Make up lasts for 10+ hours.  Will buy again.</li>
