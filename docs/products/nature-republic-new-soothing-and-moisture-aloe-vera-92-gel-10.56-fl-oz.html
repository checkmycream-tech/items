            <li>Pleasant smell, although a bit strong.</li>
            <li>Very good, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It smells good and it looks huge.</li>
            <li>They also give you lots of free samples with it too so that was good.</li>
            <li>I dont see any improvements or anything special about this product except the calming pleasant perfume and its cooling effect :)</li>
            <li>I really love this one and</li>
            <li>I am enjoying it now.</li>
            <li>i always love the aloe product</li>
            <li>This stuff feels so refreshing and works</li>
            <li>I really love this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me it took more than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>but overall this is a wonderful product</li>
            <li>The tub is not the most hygienic.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>but I use this on my hair mostly.</li>
            <li>It smells good and fresh</li>
            <li>lovely on the face and neck</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this store.</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>I think is working ok.</li>
            <li>Would buy this product again. :)</li>
            <li>I brought it with Rohto Hadalabo Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Lotion, and I feel that one is more moisturize.</li>
            <li>Love, Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a very popular product, but it didn&#x27;t do much for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Pretty good moisture content.</li>
            <li>, even i leave it for a whilee and it still looks so good , C: 5 stars for this ;)</li>
            <li>Feels extremely nice and cool on the skin.</li>
            <li>I love this aloe vera gel, works great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is a very light and fresh cream texture suitable for people with very very oily skin (my case) and gives the pot to a fair amount.</li>
            <li>Good price and very decent portion&lt;br /&gt;Shipping ?</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite gel moisturizers, the tub is HUGE.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and not overly powerful.</li>
            <li>It has an abundant volume and the gel can be absorbed very quickly.</li>
            <li>Light smell and perfect for dry or combination skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;d be best to use a little spatula to get the product. :)</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the appearance, but I use a special tool to scoop the aloe vera out because of hygienic concerns.</li>
            <li>its nice n light , doesn&#x27;t give a deep moisture feeling but its still good .</li>
            <li>It smells pretty nice.</li>
            <li>it feels so fresh and cool when you apply it to your face after washing it, i love it!</li>
            <li>The tub is huge</li>
            <li>Lotion is greasy and as a guy, I don&#x27;t enjoy the greasy feeling lotion gives my skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves a matte smooth finish that&#x27;s non-sticky</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smooth and shiny with no oil residue.</li>
            <li>i like it because of its gel form and its some how moisturizing but not all of that!&lt;br /&gt;its soothing when u apply it and when ur skin suck it all up it leaves it really smooth</li>
            <li>I bought this product on a whim in the duty free shop at the Incheon airport in Korea because it was on sale.</li>
            <li>: The formula is NEITHER alcohol free NOR fragrance free.</li>
            <li>- I find it&#x27;s more useful for its cooling properties than anything else.</li>
            <li>Use it once a day is good for my drought face in winter and early spring.</li>
            <li>Would have given 5 stars but the scent, while not bad, is too strong for me</li>
            <li>Love it so much! ,</li>
            <li>Bought it originally after being recommended by a youtuber who was using it for hair gel.</li>
            <li>Nice light not a heavy feel at all.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li>I love how they give you so much of it.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and refreshing to my skin</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s full of aloe gel.</li>
            <li>Very useful for freshly shaved skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The gel comes in a really large tub (but it goes really fast if you use it a lot), and it feels really cool on application which makes it really nice during the summertime.</li>
            <li>and it look so fresh and clean</li>
            <li>I not only use this as a facial moisturizer, but also as a body lotion and it works great bot ways!</li>
            <li>Super Hydrating to the skin.</li>
            <li>high quality, hope it can be cheaper and better packed.</li>
            <li>its huge than my imaged, really nature and feels so fresh and cool when you apply it to your face after washing it</li>
            <li>It takes it away and leaves it soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>The clean smell, light gel, and cool sensation is invigorating and relaxing at the same time.  </li>
            <li>It is very soothing and it makes my skin feel so smooth, cool, and soft.</li>
            <li>He uses it much for his skin too, and loves it!</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick because of Amazon prime and the product was brand new in its wrapping.</li>
            <li>Your facial skin becomes so smooth, fresh...</li>
            <li>You can probably get a similar gel for cheaper; this one isn&#x27;t particularly special or extraordinary.</li>
            <li>Will keep buying as long as it is available!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not pungent and overwhelming, lightly scented and matches the transparent gel, however the amount of alcohol in the product becomes increasingly noticeable after constant usage (not simply the scent, but the effect on skin.)</li>
            <li>Pure aloe  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying it again unless I want to shell out the money for a cooling facial pack (which is kind of unlikely, considering there&#x27;s a lot of other gels on the market which I honestly find superior).</li>
            <li>This is a nice little moisturizer for the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very allergic to everything with alcohol</li>
            <li>with added chemicals- very soothing and silky moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping .I</li>
            <li>Very fast&lt;br /&gt;Product/</li>
            <li>Absorbs fast and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>is now much thicker than before</li>
            <li>Very soothing</li>
            <li>I had really high expectations for this product!</li>
            <li>But in the end, I can&#x27;t really say it lived up to the glowing reviews on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t really get sticky unless you PILE IT ON.</li>
            <li>It also really isn&#x27;t that moisturizing for skin or hair</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this</li>
            <li>(Yeah, a real work).</li>
            <li>However it doesn&#x27;t do much in any of those categories.</li>
            <li>it very watery</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t do much to it.</li>
            <li>at first i was a little worried because shipping did take more than a month, and when i received my package, some product was leaked out although the tub was sealed.</li>
            <li>Avoid and get a decent 84% aloe vera lotion from Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>Given the fact that it is mailed from Korea directly, I should say the shipping speed is quite fast!</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used it 3 different ways: as an aloe vera pack on my face for 15 minutes, body moisturizer, and mixed it with my own face moisturizer which is 2:1 ratio I believe.</li>
            <li>Really doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype that surrounded it.</li>
            <li>It is quick to absorb and works well underneath liquid/cream foundation routines (through personal experience after 1 - 2 months of usage.)</li>
            <li>Not only for the face, but I use this for the ends of my hair, and it really gives it some good moisture, especially for dry hair in the morning.</li>
            <li>It also tastes really chemical, and its ingredient list is far from \\&quot;pure\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>and I use it mostly on my face and dry parts of my body such as my elbows.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it ..</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a little sticky at first before it completely absorbs, but that goes away, without any sticky or greasy feeling at all once it&#x27;s compleyely absorbed!</li>
            <li>its very natural and tender and smells so</li>
            <li>I put this on immediately after showering and it leaves me ridiculously soft!</li>
            <li>I really like this skin care product with decent content , especially work well after sun exposure!</li>
            <li>It sinks in really quickly, and it&#x27;s lightweight.</li>
            <li>also use it under lotion right after shaving to help with irritation and dry skin</li>
            <li>It also leaves my skin soft for a longer time as opposed to my body lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it was shipped from Korea, which means it takes pretty long to your home.</li>
            <li>my skin is so soft heehhehe</li>
            <li>then I feel my skin is young hahhaaha</li>
            <li>/&gt;i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Aids in working with natural skin chemistry/ oils and provides 24-hour moisture.</li>
            <li>I feel that since Aloe Vera traps moisture in the skin, my combination skin is no longer producing oil as much on the t-zone so instead of using 2 blotting sheets a day, I only use 1 if I have to.</li>
            <li>it is soft and gives shine without the stickiness of a hair gel.</li>
            <li>More watery than I expected, and probably not moisturizing enough to replace regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The seller (A-Poly) is also quite nice and gave me quite a few samples (I bought two products from them, though, so I&#x27;m not sure how much they would give if you only bought one).&lt;br</li>
            <li>i was so surprised when i open it</li>
            <li>the package makes me feel it can fall out of the box on the way of shipping because the box is not seald by tape or even not totally closed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also mixed it in with my body lotion, and it really helps with dry and itchy skin.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy and the cooling/healing properties from the high aloe content help circulate blood underneath the skin&#x27;s surface to reduce dark circles and redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The container is kind of hard to get the product out of, too, because there are two lids (which is frustrating straight out of the shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put the gel on my face and before it becomes dry completely .</li>
            <li>If you put on too much you will feel a little sticky, but it will go away once it absorbs into your skin.</li>

            <li> This stuff feels so refreshing and works</li>
            <li> I really love this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me it took more than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> but overall this is a wonderful product</li>
            <li> The tub is not the most hygienic.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> but I use this on my hair mostly.</li>
            <li> It smells good and fresh</li>
            <li> lovely on the face and neck</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love this store.</li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> I think is working ok.</li>
            <li> Would buy this product again. :)</li>
            <li> I brought it with Rohto Hadalabo Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Lotion, and I feel that one is more moisturize.</li>
            <li> Love, Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a very popular product, but it didn&#x27;t do much for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> Pretty good moisture content.</li>
            <li> , even i leave it for a whilee and it still looks so good , C: 5 stars for this ;)</li>
            <li> Feels extremely nice and cool on the skin.</li>
            <li> I love this aloe vera gel, works great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is a very light and fresh cream texture suitable for people with very very oily skin (my case) and gives the pot to a fair amount.</li>
            <li> Good price and very decent portion&lt;br /&gt;Shipping ?</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite gel moisturizers, the tub is HUGE.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and not overly powerful.</li>
            <li> It has an abundant volume and the gel can be absorbed very quickly.</li>
            <li> Light smell and perfect for dry or combination skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;d be best to use a little spatula to get the product. :)</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the appearance, but I use a special tool to scoop the aloe vera out because of hygienic concerns.</li>
            <li> its nice n light , doesn&#x27;t give a deep moisture feeling but its still good .</li>
            <li> It smells pretty nice.</li>
            <li> it feels so fresh and cool when you apply it to your face after washing it, i love it!</li>
            <li> The tub is huge</li>
            <li> Lotion is greasy and as a guy, I don&#x27;t enjoy the greasy feeling lotion gives my skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves a matte smooth finish that&#x27;s non-sticky</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair smooth and shiny with no oil residue.</li>
            <li> i like it because of its gel form and its some how moisturizing but not all of that!&lt;br /&gt;its soothing when u apply it and when ur skin suck it all up it leaves it really smooth</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim in the duty free shop at the Incheon airport in Korea because it was on sale.</li>
            <li> : The formula is NEITHER alcohol free NOR fragrance free.</li>
            <li> - I find it&#x27;s more useful for its cooling properties than anything else.</li>
            <li> Use it once a day is good for my drought face in winter and early spring.</li>
            <li> Would have given 5 stars but the scent, while not bad, is too strong for me</li>
            <li> Love it so much! ,</li>
            <li> Bought it originally after being recommended by a youtuber who was using it for hair gel.</li>
            <li> Nice light not a heavy feel at all.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li> I love how they give you so much of it.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and refreshing to my skin</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s full of aloe gel.</li>
            <li> Very useful for freshly shaved skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The gel comes in a really large tub (but it goes really fast if you use it a lot), and it feels really cool on application which makes it really nice during the summertime.</li>
            <li> and it look so fresh and clean</li>
            <li> I not only use this as a facial moisturizer, but also as a body lotion and it works great bot ways!</li>
            <li> Super Hydrating to the skin.</li>
            <li> high quality, hope it can be cheaper and better packed.</li>
            <li> its huge than my imaged, really nature and feels so fresh and cool when you apply it to your face after washing it</li>
            <li> It takes it away and leaves it soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> The clean smell, light gel, and cool sensation is invigorating and relaxing at the same time.  </li>
            <li> It is very soothing and it makes my skin feel so smooth, cool, and soft.</li>
            <li> He uses it much for his skin too, and loves it!</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick because of Amazon prime and the product was brand new in its wrapping.</li>
            <li> Your facial skin becomes so smooth, fresh...</li>
            <li> You can probably get a similar gel for cheaper; this one isn&#x27;t particularly special or extraordinary.</li>
            <li> Will keep buying as long as it is available!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not pungent and overwhelming, lightly scented and matches the transparent gel, however the amount of alcohol in the product becomes increasingly noticeable after constant usage (not simply the scent, but the effect on skin.)</li>
            <li> Pure aloe  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying it again unless I want to shell out the money for a cooling facial pack (which is kind of unlikely, considering there&#x27;s a lot of other gels on the market which I honestly find superior).</li>
            <li> This is a nice little moisturizer for the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very allergic to everything with alcohol</li>
            <li> with added chemicals- very soothing and silky moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping .I</li>
            <li> Very fast&lt;br /&gt;Product/</li>
            <li> Absorbs fast and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> is now much thicker than before</li>
            <li> Very soothing</li>
            <li> I had really high expectations for this product!</li>
            <li> But in the end, I can&#x27;t really say it lived up to the glowing reviews on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t really get sticky unless you PILE IT ON.</li>
            <li> It also really isn&#x27;t that moisturizing for skin or hair</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this</li>
            <li> (Yeah, a real work).</li>
            <li> However it doesn&#x27;t do much in any of those categories.</li>
            <li> it very watery</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t do much to it.</li>
            <li> at first i was a little worried because shipping did take more than a month, and when i received my package, some product was leaked out although the tub was sealed.</li>
            <li> Avoid and get a decent 84% aloe vera lotion from Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> Given the fact that it is mailed from Korea directly, I should say the shipping speed is quite fast!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it 3 different ways: as an aloe vera pack on my face for 15 minutes, body moisturizer, and mixed it with my own face moisturizer which is 2:1 ratio I believe.</li>
            <li> Really doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype that surrounded it.</li>
            <li> It is quick to absorb and works well underneath liquid/cream foundation routines (through personal experience after 1 - 2 months of usage.)</li>
            <li> Not only for the face, but I use this for the ends of my hair, and it really gives it some good moisture, especially for dry hair in the morning.</li>
            <li> It also tastes really chemical, and its ingredient list is far from \\&quot;pure\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> and I use it mostly on my face and dry parts of my body such as my elbows.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it ..</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little sticky at first before it completely absorbs, but that goes away, without any sticky or greasy feeling at all once it&#x27;s compleyely absorbed!</li>
            <li> its very natural and tender and smells so</li>
            <li> I put this on immediately after showering and it leaves me ridiculously soft!</li>
            <li> I really like this skin care product with decent content , especially work well after sun exposure!</li>
            <li> It sinks in really quickly, and it&#x27;s lightweight.</li>
            <li> also use it under lotion right after shaving to help with irritation and dry skin</li>
            <li> It also leaves my skin soft for a longer time as opposed to my body lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it was shipped from Korea, which means it takes pretty long to your home.</li>
            <li> my skin is so soft heehhehe</li>
            <li> then I feel my skin is young hahhaaha</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Aids in working with natural skin chemistry/ oils and provides 24-hour moisture.</li>
            <li> I feel that since Aloe Vera traps moisture in the skin, my combination skin is no longer producing oil as much on the t-zone so instead of using 2 blotting sheets a day, I only use 1 if I have to.</li>
            <li> it is soft and gives shine without the stickiness of a hair gel.</li>
            <li> More watery than I expected, and probably not moisturizing enough to replace regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The seller (A-Poly) is also quite nice and gave me quite a few samples (I bought two products from them, though, so I&#x27;m not sure how much they would give if you only bought one).&lt;br</li>
            <li> i was so surprised when i open it</li>
            <li> the package makes me feel it can fall out of the box on the way of shipping because the box is not seald by tape or even not totally closed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also mixed it in with my body lotion, and it really helps with dry and itchy skin.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy and the cooling/healing properties from the high aloe content help circulate blood underneath the skin&#x27;s surface to reduce dark circles and redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The container is kind of hard to get the product out of, too, because there are two lids (which is frustrating straight out of the shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put the gel on my face and before it becomes dry completely .</li>
            <li> If you put on too much you will feel a little sticky, but it will go away once it absorbs into your skin.</li>
            <li> and i was wayyyyyyy bigger than i expected.</li>
            <li> buy it again, even if it takes a long time to get it from Korea.</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t apply to dry skin, it won&#x27;t work as well), and can also be used on your hair and body.</li>
            <li> If you have really dry skin</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, oily in the T-zone and dry on the cheeks, but throughout the day, the surface of my cheeks tend to get oily while my chin gets flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One time after showers while my skin was still damp and in the morning on dry skin.</li>
            <li> I used it on dry skin</li>
            <li> If anything, the oil has cut down by half, and my face is still reasonably soft.</li>
            <li> If you only use it for your face daily, it should last at least a year.</li>
            <li> My face is sensitive with oily/dry skin with few acne spots, and my cheeks are blemished and red from past acne scars.</li>
            <li> I follow an asian skincare routine and use it after my toner &amp; emulsion, but before my heavy moisturizer and it traps everything in and helps my moisturizer sink in better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does come in a big container, but since I use it everyday for both, I will need to replenish soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my tub about 3 months now and have only reached a little over half way, a little goes a long long way!</li>
            <li> Gel- like formula, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this for summer seasons, with no more than a 3 month usage period.</li>
            <li> But after I applied it, I feel little bit dry on my skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, so I use this everyday after the shower.</li>
            <li> The redness has gone down as well and have gotten fewer acnes.</li>
            <li> It make my skin less oily</li>
            <li> I also like the little gifts shipped with those products,감사합니다. ^^</li>
            <li> And when I use this mask my face feel a little bit biting.</li>
            <li> The gel leaked a little bit otherwise</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products that doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> I can use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Bought it for mi bf, and he seemed a little disappointed at first to use it for hair styling.</li>
            <li> After using this gel, I&#x27;ve noticed that my face isn&#x27;t as oily as it usually would be during the day.</li>
            <li> I am not sure whether is fake or not because after using this my skin have some problem.</li>
            <li> I am saving this for a bad sunburn down the road.</li>
            <li> use this as a base before putting on moisturizer, after my toner and serum.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really love this one and almost all my friends r using it. It smells good and it looks huge. I also like the little gifts shipped with those products,감사합니다. ^^</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite a while, but I just cannot find it in any local Korean supermarkets. Then I tried my luck on Amazon, and I won. Given the fact that it is mailed from Korea directly, I should say the shipping speed is quite fast! And all the stuff inside is safe and good. I am enjoying it now. In a word, awesome!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizer. But after I applied it, I feel little bit dry on my skin</li>
            <li> i was so surprised when i open it cauz it comes in such a big size! &lt;3 i love it! its very natural and tender and smells so good~ i always love the aloe product but this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Nature Republic really outdid themselves with this wonderful gel! It is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. So far I&#x27;ve used it 3 different ways: as an aloe vera pack on my face for 15 minutes, body moisturizer, and mixed it with my own face moisturizer which is 2:1 ratio I believe. This stuff feels so refreshing and works wonders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention it&#x27;s a really big tub? Also, it smells amazing. Try it! Please buy from A-Poly too! Awesome customer service unlike others I&#x27;ve tried from Korea. You won&#x27;t regret it^^</li>
            <li> Pretty good moisture content. Use it once a day is good for my drought face in winter and early spring.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much it is really amazing. I&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
            <li> So awesome I love this product!!</li>
            <li> I like this one. Already used three packs</li>
            <li> Best product ever... Your facial skin becomes so smooth, fresh...you can feel relax when u apply it to ur face. Besides, i can u it for my hair, and it is also a body lotion...&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to my friends..</li>
            <li> Good for all types of skin</li>
            <li> This is a great way to moisturize and repair skin without using lotion. Lotion is greasy and as a guy, I don&#x27;t enjoy the greasy feeling lotion gives my skin. This is also great to help soothe sun burns. The scent reminds me of cucumbers.</li>
            <li> Had to return. I&#x27;m very allergic to everything with alcohol</li>
            <li> I just love this product! I wear it almost everytime after I wash my face. It of course moisturizes my skin!</li>
            <li> I put this on immediately after showering and it leaves me ridiculously soft! It also leaves my skin soft for a longer time as opposed to my body lotion. If you put on too much you will feel a little sticky, but it will go away once it absorbs into your skin. It smells good too.</li>
            <li> That is the best aloe gel I ever used. It has an abundant volume and the gel can be absorbed very quickly. I really love this product.&lt;br /&gt;However, it was shipped from Korea, which means it takes pretty long to your home. For me it took more than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizes by trapping water in your skin (don&#x27;t apply to dry skin, it won&#x27;t work as well), and can also be used on your hair and body. It leaves a matte smooth finish that&#x27;s non-sticky so it&#x27;s great for under makeup. I follow an asian skincare routine and use it after my toner &amp; emulsion, but before my heavy moisturizer and it traps everything in and helps my moisturizer sink in better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it under lotion right after shaving to help with irritation and dry skin and it&#x27;s great! I&#x27;ve had my tub about 3 months now and have only reached a little over half way, a little goes a long long way!</li>
            <li> this product is amazing!! at first i was a little worried because shipping did take more than a month, and when i received my package, some product was leaked out although the tub was sealed. but overall this is a wonderful product and i definitely recommend. my skin is so soft heehhehe</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soothing but it&#x27;s nothing special. It smells nice and not overly powerful. The tub is not the most hygienic.</li>
            <li> its nice n light , doesn&#x27;t give a deep moisture feeling but its still good .</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick because of Amazon prime and the product was brand new in its wrapping. I read about this gel on a lot of blogs, so I decided to try it for myself. I love this aloe vera gel, works great for my sensitive skin. There are 8 ways to use it according to Nature Republic and I use it mostly on my face and dry parts of my body such as my elbows. The tub is huge so there is a lot of product and it&#x27;d be best to use a little spatula to get the product. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this to use while making face creams but have found that it is excellent to use right out of the package as well.  The clean smell, light gel, and cool sensation is invigorating and relaxing at the same time.  So glad I picked this brand!!  My daughter was suffering with Acne and I had her put this on after her nightly cleansing routine.  Quite a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Very good, highly recommend! This gel Helps keeping my face moist in winter. I love it</li>
            <li> Amazing!! I know everyone uses this on their skin but I use this on my hair mostly. It leaves my hair smooth and shiny with no oil residue. Best leave in conditioner replacement!</li>
            <li> It smells good and fresh&lt;br /&gt;and I use this aloe gel as a mask&lt;br /&gt;haha  I put the gel on my face and before it becomes dry completely . I wash it  then I feel my skin is young hahhaaha</li>
            <li> i like it because of its gel form and its some how moisturizing but not all of that!&lt;br /&gt;its soothing when u apply it and when ur skin suck it all up it leaves it really smooth&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this after shaving or waxing&lt;br /&gt;its lovely on the face and neck&lt;br /&gt;i have sensitive skin so yeah ...&lt;br /&gt;its a good product</li>
            <li> Good stuff.It keeps the dryness away from my skin.My skin is not oily after using it.Love it so much! ,</li>
            <li> Made in China junk.  Irritated my skin.  Beware.  Avoid and get a decent 84% aloe vera lotion from Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Very refreshing and soothing.</li>
            <li> I love how they give you so much of it. It make my skin less oily and I&#x27;m so happy about it.</li>
            <li> I just use twice of this product. I am not sure whether is fake or not because after using this my skin have some problem. And when I use this mask my face feel a little bit biting.</li>
            <li> Excellent! I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and refreshing to my skin and it feel great on my skin.I love it</li>
            <li> Pure aloe  with added chemicals- very soothing and silky moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a ideal product for hydrating skin both face and body.And it feels great use before or after the mist.</li>
            <li> high quality, hope it can be cheaper and better packed. the package makes me feel it can fall out of the box on the way of shipping because the box is not seald by tape or even not totally closed.</li>
            <li> I not only use this as a facial moisturizer, but also as a body lotion and it works great bot ways! It is very soothing and it makes my skin feel so smooth, cool, and soft. I have very dry skin, so I use this everyday after the shower. I apply this on my face after washing and before applying sunblock. It does come in a big container, but since I use it everyday for both, I will need to replenish soon. If you only use it for your face daily, it should last at least a year.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little moisturizer for the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s a little sticky at first before it completely absorbs, but that goes away, without any sticky or greasy feeling at all once it&#x27;s compleyely absorbed! You get a HUGE tub of it for a great price!</li>
            <li> not use. but looks great</li>
            <li> I love this store. Fast shipping .I love this is so good</li>
            <li> So far so good! I think is working ok.</li>
            <li> Smells really good!! Works great!!!!</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever!! I bought this product on a whim in the duty free shop at the Incheon airport in Korea because it was on sale. I saw the commercial and said why not! Best purchase ever! If you have really dry skin this is the stuff you need! It takes it away and leaves it soft and smooth! It is great for your face as well!! Will keep buying as long as it is available!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this product.&lt;br /&gt;Why? Good price and very decent portion&lt;br /&gt;Shipping ? Very fast&lt;br /&gt;Product/ It smells pretty nice. I&#x27;m using it for my face and hands. Gel texture. No allergic reaction</li>
            <li> This was absolutely amazing. I just got this today and i was wayyyyyyy bigger than i expected. They also give you lots of free samples with it too so that was good. I just haven&#x27;t tried it out yet.</li>
            <li> I dont see any improvements or anything special about this product except the calming pleasant perfume and its cooling effect :)</li>
            <li> NOTE: I have combination skin, oily in the T-zone and dry on the cheeks, but throughout the day, the surface of my cheeks tend to get oily while my chin gets flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for reducing inflammation and hyperpigmentation while adding moisture. It is quick to absorb and works well underneath liquid/cream foundation routines (through personal experience after 1 - 2 months of usage.) It is not heavy and the cooling/healing properties from the high aloe content help circulate blood underneath the skin&#x27;s surface to reduce dark circles and redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: The formula is NEITHER alcohol free NOR fragrance free. The fragrance is not pungent and overwhelming, lightly scented and matches the transparent gel, however the amount of alcohol in the product becomes increasingly noticeable after constant usage (not simply the scent, but the effect on skin.) I would only recommend this for summer seasons, with no more than a 3 month usage period. The formula is simply too drying and can damage the lower layers of skin (which it did to me and caused dehydration.)</li>
            <li> Absorbs fast and moisturizes well. Big enough size to use as a body lotion. Would buy this product again. :)</li>
            <li> Smell good. Moisturize well. I brought it with Rohto Hadalabo Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Lotion, and I feel that one is more moisturize.</li>
            <li> The gel leaked a little bit otherwise it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> This aloevera gel is the best product I ever used for my hair it stoped my hair from falling my hair is now much thicker than before</li>
            <li> Excellent product, which gives a very nice feeling on my skin. Pleasant smell, although a bit strong. Great for both skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy it again, even if it takes a long time to get it from Korea.</li>
            <li> Nice light not a heavy feel at all. Would have given 5 stars but the scent, while not bad, is too strong for me and I would have loved a pump. I use it on my clients after waxing. Very soothing</li>
            <li> the container is bigger than it looks. it feels so fresh and cool when you apply it to your face after washing it, i love it!</li>
            <li> i got this moisture aloe vera omgg it work wondersss i use it for 15 mins in my face and it look so fresh and clean , even i leave it for a whilee and it still looks so good , C: 5 stars for this ;)</li>
            <li> its huge than my imaged, really nature and feels so fresh and cool when you apply it to your face after washing it</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it ..</li>
            <li> Love, Love this stuff. Super Hydrating to the skin. I used this twice a day. One time after showers while my skin was still damp and in the morning on dry skin. Works excellently. Light smell and perfect for dry or combination skin. Aids in working with natural skin chemistry/ oils and provides 24-hour moisture. Gel- like formula, but a little goes a long way. I would consider repurchases for sure!</li>
            <li> I really like this skin care product with decent content , especially work well after sun exposure! On time shipping, recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I had really high expectations for this product! But in the end, I can&#x27;t really say it lived up to the glowing reviews on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the pros! The gel comes in a really large tub (but it goes really fast if you use it a lot), and it feels really cool on application which makes it really nice during the summertime. It sinks in really quickly, and it&#x27;s lightweight. It also doesn&#x27;t really get sticky unless you PILE IT ON. The seller (A-Poly) is also quite nice and gave me quite a few samples (I bought two products from them, though, so I&#x27;m not sure how much they would give if you only bought one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now, the cons. You can probably get a similar gel for cheaper; this one isn&#x27;t particularly special or extraordinary. It also really isn&#x27;t that moisturizing for skin or hair - I find it&#x27;s more useful for its cooling properties than anything else. It also tastes really chemical, and its ingredient list is far from \\&quot;pure\\&quot;. The container is kind of hard to get the product out of, too, because there are two lids (which is frustrating straight out of the shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying it again unless I want to shell out the money for a cooling facial pack (which is kind of unlikely, considering there&#x27;s a lot of other gels on the market which I honestly find superior).</li>
            <li> Feels extremely nice and cool on the skin. I feel that since Aloe Vera traps moisture in the skin, my combination skin is no longer producing oil as much on the t-zone so instead of using 2 blotting sheets a day, I only use 1 if I have to. My go-to product ^^</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite gel moisturizers, the tub is HUGE. I scoop some of it out into a smaller tub to avoid contamination. After I apply my serums, essence, and moisturizer I pack it on my face as a sleeping mask and wash it off in the morning. I won&#x27;t have to repurchase for awhile because this tub will probably last me until next year. This is one of the few products that doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> One of the best products I&#x27;ve ever bought!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as a base before putting on moisturizer, after my toner and serum. My face is sensitive with oily/dry skin with few acne spots, and my cheeks are blemished and red from past acne scars. (Yeah, a real work). After using this gel, I&#x27;ve noticed that my face isn&#x27;t as oily as it usually would be during the day. If anything, the oil has cut down by half, and my face is still reasonably soft. The redness has gone down as well and have gotten fewer acnes. I use this on my chest and back acne, and those are disappeared as well. It works nicely on my armpit as well. I pluck the hair so I have &amp;#34;scars&amp;#34; from that too, and the redness has reduced. I also have oily lids, and using this product around my eyes has shot the oilyness for that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about aloe is that it has many uses. Not only for the face, but I use this for the ends of my hair, and it really gives it some good moisture, especially for dry hair in the morning. I&#x27;ve also mixed it in with my body lotion, and it really helps with dry and itchy skin. Very useful for freshly shaved skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend storing this in the refrigerator for best results. My seller was Enospring, and my product came with a safety seal.</li>
            <li> this is so good!!!!!!!! I can use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Bought it originally after being recommended by a youtuber who was using it for hair gel. Bought it for mi bf, and he seemed a little disappointed at first to use it for hair styling. After a while he loved it! it is soft and gives shine without the stickiness of a hair gel. He uses it much for his skin too, and loves it!</li>
            <li> I bought this and the foaming face cleanser gel. It seems to be a very popular product, but it didn&#x27;t do much for me.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a container that screws off and it&#x27;s full of aloe gel. It can be ysed on face, body, hair. However it doesn&#x27;t do much in any of those categories. It doesnt make skin or hair softer. I am saving this for a bad sunburn down the road. Overall i would recommend an aloe plant or the aloe cleanser. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> it very watery but it smell great and made my face feel so smooth</li>
            <li> More watery than I expected, and probably not moisturizing enough to replace regular moisturizer. Really doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype that surrounded it. I used it on dry skin and it didn&#x27;t do much to it. I love the smell and the appearance, but I use a special tool to scoop the aloe vera out because of hygienic concerns.</li>
            <li> it takes a month!! omg</li>
            <li> It is a very light and fresh cream texture suitable for people with very very oily skin (my case) and gives the pot to a fair amount. Very good, but does nothing more</li>
