            <li> I liked but it&#x27;s very expensive for give it again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be &amp;#34;72hr extreme control&amp;#34;, but it doesn&#x27;t even cover 24hrs.</li>
            <li> They like it and prefer this brand over any other Deodorants out there.</li>
            <li> Subtle scent, long lasting protection, and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Used this same product when I lived overseas, but it&#x27;s hard to find here in the US.  </li>
            <li> then I&#x27;ve paid in the past</li>
            <li> Hard to come by in the US but kudos to Amazon for stocking it.</li>
            <li> which is the only thing I can say bad about this product.</li>
            <li> This product does not work as advertised, which leads me to conclude that either I received a fake, or it is just awful.  </li>

            <li> The price fluctuates a LOT on this product. When it&#x27;s cheap, its totally worth buying. When they jack the price up, not so much.</li>
            <li> Price is steeper then I&#x27;ve paid in the past which is the only thing I can say bad about this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best. I first found this product on a recent trip to Spain after running out of my usual American deodorant/anti-perspirant. I haven&#x27;t found a product that&#x27;s both light, fragrance free, and does an adequate job for a full day. This does and it will be what I use until they stop making it.</li>
            <li> Been using this deo for years. Tried others but none compare. Its solid</li>
            <li> I like this item nice.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Subtle scent, long lasting protection, and does not irritate my skin. Just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...perhaps, just wish there was a larger size</li>
            <li> Received the item as expected, match the exact site description with ok packaging, will recommend it for every one looking for it</li>

            <li> great product! i buy it all the time. Although shipping needs to improve</li>
            <li> Smells really really good, like a cologne, and works great.</li>
            <li> Best ever! Other brands don&#x27;t even have a tiny chance!!! once you&#x27;ve used this you will never go back!!!</li>
            <li> As advertised! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I buy this for my husband and my son. They like it and prefer this brand over any other Deodorants out there.</li>
            <li> I purchased this the 1st time at a pharmacie in St. Barths because I couldn&#x27;t find the brand I had been using. I was so pleased with it that when I got back home I purchased more from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
