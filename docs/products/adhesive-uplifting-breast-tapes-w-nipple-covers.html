            <li>Great product for the money</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do a good job for cup size D.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 3 weeks since using the product and most of the blemishes have faded</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this type of breast tape works</li>
            <li>Oh, and for better perspective, I&#x27;m a C cup.</li>
            <li>I bought these thinking that they would be great for a few backless tops I bought for summer.</li>
            <li>So get it right the first time, every time.</li>
            <li>Might have worked better if applied properly.</li>
            <li>The adhesive held without any slippage or failure during my 6-hour formal event so the product&#x27;s functional performance was great.  </li>
            <li>and I were ready to go.</li>
            <li>I am a b32 cup, but it didn&#x27;t  hold ogive me any much support</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t really help in lifting that much.</li>
            <li>The material is that shiny, almost hard kind of plastic that makes noise so the entire purpose is defeated.</li>
            <li>I ended up using some old fashion duct tape.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay, not great</li>
            <li>I was Wong, these are awful the adhesive that the use doesn&#x27;t even stick, they&#x27;re made out of a clear plastic which may have been OK, but they sound like your crumpling paper when your putting them on and they probably sound the same when wearing a shirt, I wouldn&#x27;t know though because the adhesive didn&#x27;t stick long enough for me to put a shirt on.</li>
            <li>I placed the first one and tried to re-place it by just moving it over a little &#x3D; adhesive gone.</li>

            <li> but they are not completely gone.  </li>
            <li> It was an epic fail.</li>
            <li> what a waste.</li>
            <li> The perforated line, I&#x27;m not sure what purpose it serves, just tears as you try to apply it.</li>
            <li> Weird stiff plastic that doesn&#x27;t adhere well to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps my daughter &amp; I were doing something wrong, the small instruction paper was vague.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stick at all .. not worth buying again :(</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work at all horrible not worth the money</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t matte the way it looks in the photo which makes it impossible to conceal.</li>
            <li> This product does not do what it claims to do, one of the worst Amazon purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>

            <li> The perforated line, I&#x27;m not sure what purpose it serves, just tears as you try to apply it. Perhaps my daughter &amp; I were doing something wrong, the small instruction paper was vague. Might have worked better if applied properly.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stick at all .. not worth buying again :(</li>
            <li> The instructions were inspanish! But once I figured it out my girls and I were ready to go. Great product for the money</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a good job for cup size D.</li>
            <li> If you are bigger than a D and have a problem with sagging, this product is not for you. I am a 36D. I bought it hoping it would help with my infinity dress. It was an epic fail. I need another solution!</li>
            <li> Works great. I reorder this every time I run out.</li>
            <li> Bought them for my sister to wear under her portion dress. It was backless, open sides, and v neck. She is a double d but petite in size. They didn&#x27;t last through the dancing.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking that they would be great for a few backless tops I bought for summer. I was Wong, these are awful the adhesive that the use doesn&#x27;t even stick, they&#x27;re made out of a clear plastic which may have been OK, but they sound like your crumpling paper when your putting them on and they probably sound the same when wearing a shirt, I wouldn&#x27;t know though because the adhesive didn&#x27;t stick long enough for me to put a shirt on. This product does not do what it claims to do, one of the worst Amazon purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> Might as well use duct tape...what a waste.</li>
            <li> didnt work at all dont buy</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t expect these to work. I ended up using some old fashion duct tape.</li>
            <li> Weird stiff plastic that doesn&#x27;t adhere well to my skin.  I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> The adhesive held without any slippage or failure during my 6-hour formal event so the product&#x27;s functional performance was great.  However, I only gave this product 2 stars because I discovered that my skin was allergic to the adhesive after removing it...the affected breast skin areas were red and looked like bruises and was itchy.  It&#x27;s been 3 weeks since using the product and most of the blemishes have faded but they are not completely gone.  I never realized before using this product that I had skin allergies to ANY adhesive, therefore going forward I will only use CLINICALLY APPROVED hypo-allergenic adhesives.</li>
            <li> Worked well for my wife.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  It&#x27;s just okay, not great</li>
            <li> I am a b32 cup, but it didn&#x27;t  hold ogive me any much support</li>
            <li> Not all the adhesive sticked properly. And it doesn&#x27;t really help in lifting that much. I&#x27;m 34 DD.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work at all horrible not worth the money</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t matte the way it looks in the photo which makes it impossible to conceal. The material is that shiny, almost hard kind of plastic that makes noise so the entire purpose is defeated. The adhesive isn&#x27;t as durable as they let on either. I placed the first one and tried to re-place it by just moving it over a little &#x3D; adhesive gone. So get it right the first time, every time. I&#x27;m sure this type of breast tape works but I urge you not to buy this one or from this vendor. Keep shopping around. Oh, and for better perspective, I&#x27;m a C cup. My breast size didn&#x27;t present any issues.</li>
