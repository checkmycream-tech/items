    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I did!!!!  </li>
            <li>For best results apply an l-ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) serum to you</li>
            <li>I learned that LACTICacid is the best for those of us with color.   </li>
            <li>These are wonderful products that work as stated.</li>
            <li>This is awesome, but you&#x27;ll need 3-4 days to deal with the peeling.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent peel at a very good price.</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>I am so, so, happy with the outcome.  </li>
            <li>If anyone could give me some advice, i would greatly appreciate it.</li>
            <li>but when you face looks good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned, and completed this peel about a week ago.</li>
            <li>I had been loyally ordering from another company which offered wonderful products but their prices keep going up.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied and will continue using this product!</li>
            <li>I am the exact color of Queen Latifah, flawless caf√© au lait; I look well under my 40 years and thought I&#x27;d use a peel to maintain that edge.</li>
            <li>Make sure you pay close attention to read the directions!</li>
            <li>This product did smooth out the texture very nicely but it also burned my skin at the chin and nasal folds.</li>
            <li>you feel a lot more confident and better about yourself and these two bottles have help me more than all the products I&#x27;ve used over the years!</li>
            <li>My peels come out very light</li>
            <li>My age spots have faded which has resulted in a more even skin tone throughout.  </li>
            <li>When I wake the marks are even more faded.</li>
            <li>UNT SPF 50 works better for a quarter of the price (I got mine on Ebay).</li>
            <li>I love the way my face feels and looks after each peel.  </li>
            <li>I love this company, and I LOVE these products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i love love this product and the seller shipment</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just utterly pleased with everything.</li>
            <li>I love this \\&quot;at home\\&quot; peel.  </li>
            <li>I found that surprising because TCA should be a much stronger acid than the Jessner&#x27;s solution.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend that you do some research (I read portions of dermatology procedure texts) before attempting this to prevent complications.</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars not to discourage lighter women for whom it may work just fine.</li>
            <li>My last recommendation was to get a chemical peel, which was going to run me close to 1,00 just to see if it would work lol.</li>
            <li>My complexion is spotty and the texture isn&#x27;t smooth.</li>
            <li>I purchased the 35% Lactic Acid peel from Skin Laboratory, available here on AMAZON.</li>
            <li>I love it &#x27;cause it really works like the professional kind!</li>
            <li>With the PSC peel, I get a nice even peel in 2-3 days, and it&#x27;s easy to remove the peeled skin, leaving my skin looking smooth and young.  </li>
            <li>I wash with Kinerase PhotoFacial Cleanser from Sephora; it leaves my face incredibly bright, and youthful like no other product.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I found out that they sell this without a prescription.  </li>
            <li>I lightly wiped it off with a cool compress.     </li>
            <li>My acne scars have made a remarkable improvement since using the product and it has only been about a week.</li>
            <li>and i had clear, beautiful vibrant</li>
            <li>sure you have that hair dryer set to cool and a cool towel right on hand.</li>
            <li>Be careful and the follow directions, if you do the results are wonderful; really improved the quality and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>It is not painful and overtime the results will improve as you patiently continue to use the product as directed.</li>
            <li>After FOUR weeks the dark chocolate stains remained, deepened even, on my once beautiful even-toned complexion.</li>
            <li>By the way, if your skin is used to chemical peels (like mine), you won&#x27;t get the full peel effect like the directions say you would.  </li>
            <li>When it says have your hair dryer on a cool setting on stand by.</li>
            <li>It took about 7 full days for all the brown scab to fall off.</li>
            <li>Might sound counterintuitive, but sometimes gradual, consistent application at lower strength can be more effective--unless you have the time to let your skin recover from what can really be medium-level trauma (chemical burn).  </li>
            <li>I was super gald to come across this product...</li>
            <li>I first tried applying the TCA with a cheapie art store fan brush lightly over my face.  </li>
            <li>I googled acid peels and read much of the literature available, some of it advising Africans to stay away from peels altogether.</li>
            <li>I apply the UNT, then top it with Smashbox Photo Finish Primer or Avon Magix--both of which have additional SPF and make the UNT completely disappear.</li>
            <li>To be honest, the only reason ive given it a 3 is because i dont know if its done anything...  </li>
            <li>I also tried the TCA higher strength one for a full 2 minutes, and still no burning and no redness....</li>
            <li>The price is great, the packaging is perfect because it is environmentally friendly (overpackaging drives me CRAZY), and I received my peels in 3 days after ordering!!!!  </li>
            <li>To this day, I have severe redness over my temporal areas on my face, and a now brown spot under my right eye.</li>
            <li>I may need to go up in % TCA next order, but I still love the way my face feels after.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it will cost you 1000% more, but you wont have the emotional distress of the scars this stuff can leave.    </li>
            <li>skin looks like it can glow in the dark lol its so soft as a babies butt and</li>
            <li>She was supposed to use a pointed wooden applicator for more precision.</li>
            <li>Especially if you&#x27;re trying this out and are worried about hyperpigmentation, it might be best to start out slow.</li>
            <li>The products arrived exactly as described, very well packaged, and way quicker than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>and I tried that with my favorite Cetaphil lotion (not cream) and after a few days my skin was dramatically more even-toned, soft, and translucent looking.  </li>
            <li>I put the Jessner peel on first and WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll wait a month, get more PSC peel, and see if I can get back to looking normal.</li>
            <li>The application methods, the stay on time, the recovery time and projected results for the TCA 20% + Jessner&#x27;s peel (all acid peels actually), are not calculated with regard for our melanin, which reacts strongly against peels.</li>
            <li>Wore no makeup except mascara, and while my face felt really tight, one of my patients said I looked especially &#x27;fresh&#x27;.</li>
            <li>This TCA-lotion mixture also seemed to clear up my acne scars (including that TCA-induced blotch which is gone now) much more quickly than when I tried direct application of TCA alone, and without such dramatically flaky results (though there is a bit, nothing my Clarisonic can&#x27;t remove).  </li>
            <li>The item really works.</li>
            <li>One important point, I don&#x27;t recommend this product for face treatment, because of the red scab that forms as the skin heal.</li>
            <li>Before applying the peel I had on hand a bottle of Vitamin E capsules (two capsules pricked with a pin readily within reach).</li>
            <li>this peel since it is a 20% solution only helps with light scars but it does work if you have lights scars.</li>
            <li>whole process of scabbing took about 5days</li>
            <li>The doctor put too much acid on the cotton applicator and it ran, causing the depigmentation.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how much it evened out my skin.  </li>
            <li>When I found this Perfect solutions I was a little reluctant because they were a lot cheaper than my usual</li>
            <li>The red scab will eventually come off leaving smooth skin, but it would take a few days to safely peel it off.</li>
            <li>but after only 1 application, it lighted this scar tremendously.</li>
            <li>In two small places the acid had completely lifted  the top layer of skin to expose the flesh beneath--and boy did it hurt (hot spots, according to the product pamphlet).   </li>
            <li>The only thing is, I have to plan my week around when I do it because the transition time is not pretty lol but other than that, no complaints at all.</li>
            <li>Yes I live in NY</li>
            <li>I just turned 40 and was thinking I was going to have to just get used to these new sun/age spots that creep up, but now that I&#x27;ve discovered this peel, I know I don&#x27;t have to.  </li>
            <li>I did not want to use a guaze pad as I felt that I only wanted a light peel and had to return to work the next day.</li>
            <li>WOW - this stuff is powerful - especially the TCA.</li>
            <li>I like that I can do it myself, when I want and can apply it to my trouble spots, better than a professional, who often isn&#x27;t as thorough as I can be.</li>
            <li>Overall, I feel comfortable using this in a larger area of my face since I know how my skin reacts.</li>
            <li>There was even a slight reduction in fine lines.</li>
            <li>I plan on completing this peel every month or so, and might even try a slightly higher concentration of TCA next time.</li>
            <li>However, after using the products, wow!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend that you try this first on a test area, because the results can be variable.</li>
            <li>(and he was teasing me about it while I was \\&quot;molting\\&quot;), but now he has been complimenting me the past few days and saying how great my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>This TCA 20% + Jessner&#x27;s peel, left on for less time than suggested by the enclosed directions, 2 minutes at most, proceeded to bubble, then frost and burn on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I only peel in certain areas on my face.  </li>
            <li>The bumps went away and my acne is nearly gone with one treatment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been two weeks since I began the Lactic Acid peel regimen, four mini-peels so far, and the stains are almost gone.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m East Asian with skin that is very prone to hyperpigmentation; blemishes can leave darkened marks for weeks if not months.  </li>
            <li>Please save your money and see a professional.</li>
            <li>The shipment arrived 2 days early.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a clue why this isn&#x27;t working like it&#x27;s supposed to, and I&#x27;m definitely not affiliated with PSC, don&#x27;t even particularly like their customer care, but I&#x27;ll stick with the one that delivers for me.</li>
            <li>It causes me to wear makeup every single day, which  I really don&#x27;t like to do but have to.</li>
            <li>I found that applying the Jessner&#x27;s solution alone caused some Level II frosting (white frosting with red area showing through) with pretty intense stinging, but following with the TCA did not really increase the depth of peeling.</li>
            <li>Definitely helped clear up my acne</li>
            <li>Wow, to think I was going to spend at the Dr.&#x27;s office $1,500 for a TCA Peel or $4,000 for a Total FX Laser treatment for my skin.</li>
            <li>I figure in another 4 weeks the marks will be entirely gone--and I&#x27;ll have my confidence back by New Years 2010.</li>
            <li>From the other reviews it should be obvious that TCA seems like a very unpredictable peel; for some reason a portion of my chin peeled way more than others</li>
            <li>treatment immediately after the other) and did not notice much peeling or tightness.</li>
            <li>I am a 44 year old African American who had suffered from acne for years.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant about buying this at first.</li>
            <li>I did my face, chest, upper shoulders, arms and hands, so it&#x27;s pretty much a mess.  </li>
            <li>The sebaceous bumps did go away, but a few months later I developed large white scars everywhere</li>
            <li>I had also at hand, a small bottle of castor oil, as I&#x27;d noticed that in some of the peel products I&#x27;d researched AND in more than a few high-end cosmetics castor oil is a key ingredient.   </li>
            <li>And beginners need to be extremely careful, because this is really professional grade!   </li>

            <li> I just turned 40 and was thinking I was going to have to just get used to these new sun/age spots that creep up, but now that I&#x27;ve discovered this peel, I know I don&#x27;t have to.  </li>
            <li> I did not want to use a guaze pad as I felt that I only wanted a light peel and had to return to work the next day.</li>
            <li> WOW - this stuff is powerful - especially the TCA.</li>
            <li> I like that I can do it myself, when I want and can apply it to my trouble spots, better than a professional, who often isn&#x27;t as thorough as I can be.</li>
            <li> Overall, I feel comfortable using this in a larger area of my face since I know how my skin reacts.</li>
            <li> There was even a slight reduction in fine lines.</li>
            <li> I plan on completing this peel every month or so, and might even try a slightly higher concentration of TCA next time.</li>
            <li> However, after using the products, wow!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend that you try this first on a test area, because the results can be variable.</li>
            <li> (and he was teasing me about it while I was \\&quot;molting\\&quot;), but now he has been complimenting me the past few days and saying how great my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> This TCA 20% + Jessner&#x27;s peel, left on for less time than suggested by the enclosed directions, 2 minutes at most, proceeded to bubble, then frost and burn on my skin.</li>
            <li> and I only peel in certain areas on my face.  </li>
            <li> The bumps went away and my acne is nearly gone with one treatment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been two weeks since I began the Lactic Acid peel regimen, four mini-peels so far, and the stains are almost gone.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m East Asian with skin that is very prone to hyperpigmentation; blemishes can leave darkened marks for weeks if not months.  </li>
            <li> Please save your money and see a professional.</li>
            <li> The shipment arrived 2 days early.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a clue why this isn&#x27;t working like it&#x27;s supposed to, and I&#x27;m definitely not affiliated with PSC, don&#x27;t even particularly like their customer care, but I&#x27;ll stick with the one that delivers for me.</li>
            <li> It causes me to wear makeup every single day, which  I really don&#x27;t like to do but have to.</li>
            <li> I found that applying the Jessner&#x27;s solution alone caused some Level II frosting (white frosting with red area showing through) with pretty intense stinging, but following with the TCA did not really increase the depth of peeling.</li>
            <li> Definitely helped clear up my acne</li>
            <li> Wow, to think I was going to spend at the Dr.&#x27;s office $1,500 for a TCA Peel or $4,000 for a Total FX Laser treatment for my skin.</li>
            <li> I figure in another 4 weeks the marks will be entirely gone--and I&#x27;ll have my confidence back by New Years 2010.</li>
            <li> From the other reviews it should be obvious that TCA seems like a very unpredictable peel; for some reason a portion of my chin peeled way more than others</li>
            <li> treatment immediately after the other) and did not notice much peeling or tightness.</li>
            <li> I am a 44 year old African American who had suffered from acne for years.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about buying this at first.</li>
            <li> I did my face, chest, upper shoulders, arms and hands, so it&#x27;s pretty much a mess.  </li>
            <li> The sebaceous bumps did go away, but a few months later I developed large white scars everywhere</li>
            <li> I had also at hand, a small bottle of castor oil, as I&#x27;d noticed that in some of the peel products I&#x27;d researched AND in more than a few high-end cosmetics castor oil is a key ingredient.   </li>
            <li> And beginners need to be extremely careful, because this is really professional grade!   </li>
            <li> Just remember that a little goes a long way and to wait 12 hours before you reapply a third spot treatment, as some light brown scabs have formed on my trouble spots.</li>
            <li> After the healing, I saw some moderate improvement in texture and minor improvement in scarring.</li>
            <li> Beneath, it left taupe colored stains that over the THIRD week deepened to a dark chocolate--and this was without sun exposure, as I was embarrassed to show my face in public.   </li>
            <li> I just applied the lower strength one today, for 5 minutes, and i felt absolutely no burning whatsoever, and the was no white frosting, and no redness, so i dont think anything happened.  </li>
            <li> Where there is red--the melanin has already been alarmed--the red will turn deep brown, or black.  </li>
            <li> The first two days following the peel my skin looked red like I&#x27;d gotten a sunburn, and starting on the third day it began to peel like crazy, which stopped after about day five or six.</li>
            <li> I need only reapply the peel, very carefully in graduating stages, always with the castor oil, and afterwards apply the Vitamin E.    </li>
            <li> Patted dry, looked in the mirror.</li>
            <li> and I was left with a 3/4\\&quot;x1/2\\&quot; long dark blotch for weeks.      </li>
            <li> clear.&lt;br /&gt;i still have a few spots left under my chin and will be doing another treatment in 3weeks which will be next week.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li> With this one, it has been a week, and my skin is rough, itchy, and looks old and thick, but there has been minimal peeling and only in patches.  </li>
            <li> There is a previous post on here, from a \\&quot;sister\\&quot; who recommended the product which is actually what prompted me to get it.</li>
            <li> It left black burns on my face.</li>
            <li> Such uneven melanin concentration would take a year to eighteen months to fade--naturally.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;re talking serious professional strength!   </li>
            <li> I was careful and just tested it in a small area on my upper cheek bones and waited a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> Even with Lactic acid, I&#x27;ve learned we women with color must proceed with extreme care.   </li>
            <li> I never used these products due to concerns about causing damage to my skin.</li>
            <li> If you are not experienced in getting spa treatments, be careful, as this is professional grade and can sting quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> I figured there wasn&#x27;t much difference in brands, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> and that has faded any dark spots caused by the peel.</li>
            <li> The dark marks had lifted some.  </li>
            <li> I squeezed Vitamin E from one of the capsules and dabbed it on the dark areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i am also dark skin</li>
            <li> so dark skin sistas please dont hesitate to use</li>
            <li> I used the Jessner and the 20% TCA Peel in very small amounts on my Sebaceous Hyperplasia (facial bumps created by oily skin) and acne with a couple drops on a cotton qtip.</li>
            <li> The chemical peel treatments I typically receive from my esthetician were so expensive that I began searching for a comparable product..just without the high costs associated.  </li>
            <li> Folks, let me tell you, this stuff can seriously mess up your skin.</li>
            <li> Its not worth it!</li>
            <li> I have been using chemical peels for the past 15 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid 250.00 for a peel this strength, in the past.    </li>
            <li> I applied a very thin layer of castor oil to the dark areas and waited a few minutes for it to sink in.</li>
            <li> We have a hard time finding products that work for us</li>
            <li> It hardly burned at all, perhaps because of the castor oil.</li>
            <li> the tx was applied, and these are NOT going to go away, so it&#x27;s just as bad a mess as the bumps were.</li>
            <li> The other two products in the Kinerase PhotoFacial line, the night moisturizer and the day moisturizer with SPF 50 are worthless.</li>
            <li> Which for those of us with skin whose melanin goes crazy after a wound, is probably not good.  </li>
            <li> This has been so devastating, it has caused me suicidal thoughts several times.</li>
            <li> I immediately rinsed thoroughly with cold water.  </li>
            <li> and I was getting so frustrated with what would work on my skin and what wouldn&#x27;t.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a 20% TCA from Platinum Skin Care for 6 months or so, and when I accidentally spilled it, I decided to try a cheaper brand.  I figured there wasn&#x27;t much difference in brands, but I was wrong.  With the PSC peel, I get a nice even peel in 2-3 days, and it&#x27;s easy to remove the peeled skin, leaving my skin looking smooth and young.  With this one, it has been a week, and my skin is rough, itchy, and looks old and thick, but there has been minimal peeling and only in patches.  I did my face, chest, upper shoulders, arms and hands, so it&#x27;s pretty much a mess.  I&#x27;ve been applying emu oil and copper as before, but it&#x27;s not helping.  I guess I&#x27;ll wait a month, get more PSC peel, and see if I can get back to looking normal. I don&#x27;t have a clue why this isn&#x27;t working like it&#x27;s supposed to, and I&#x27;m definitely not affiliated with PSC, don&#x27;t even particularly like their customer care, but I&#x27;ll stick with the one that delivers for me.</li>
            <li> I am African American female of the darker complexion. We have a hard time finding products that work for us and I was getting so frustrated with what would work on my skin and what wouldn&#x27;t. I have had an acne scar on my face from college, for almost 7 years now and I have tried everything. It causes me to wear makeup every single day, which  I really don&#x27;t like to do but have to. My last recommendation was to get a chemical peel, which was going to run me close to 1,00 just to see if it would work lol. Yes I live in NY but no, I don&#x27;t have that type of money. I decided to look on line and thought, why not try to do this my self. At this point, it can&#x27;t hurt. There is a previous post on here, from a \\&quot;sister\\&quot; who recommended the product which is actually what prompted me to get it. I&#x27;m so happy I did!!!!  THIS STUFF WORKS!!! now I only used it on a scar that was about the size of a quarter but after only 1 application, it lighted this scar tremendously. To think, I was going to pay over 1,000 for 4 treatments at the dermatologist! No way. The only thing is, I have to plan my week around when I do it because the transition time is not pretty lol but other than that, no complaints at all. I am not soo superficial but when you face looks good you feel a lot more confident and better about yourself and these two bottles have help me more than all the products I&#x27;ve used over the years!</li>
            <li> The chemical peel treatments I typically receive from my esthetician were so expensive that I began searching for a comparable product..just without the high costs associated.  I was super gald to come across this product...I have age spots and some sun damaged skin.  I began using the TCA and Jessner&#x27;s peels and they have worked wonders for me since...after two weeks, I noticed an improvement in my skin condition!! My age spots have faded which has resulted in a more even skin tone throughout.  I am satisfied and will continue using this product!</li>
            <li> I have been spending $200 a month for microderms and facials. I may not have to get another microderm or facial ever. I used the Jessner and the 20% TCA Peel in very small amounts on my Sebaceous Hyperplasia (facial bumps created by oily skin) and acne with a couple drops on a cotton qtip. I did not want to use a guaze pad as I felt that I only wanted a light peel and had to return to work the next day. I also applied a second coating of the TCA with the qtip on some areas an hour later. The bumps went away and my acne is nearly gone with one treatment. Just remember that a little goes a long way and to wait 12 hours before you reapply a third spot treatment, as some light brown scabs have formed on my trouble spots. I anticipate they will peel and fade. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend a stronger percentage, since I don&#x27;t want to burn my skin and take two weeks off from work. I don&#x27;t have the time to spare. Wow, to think I was going to spend at the Dr.&#x27;s office $1,500 for a TCA Peel or $4,000 for a Total FX Laser treatment for my skin. This is the answer to my skin problems at a fraction of the price in a Dr.&#x27;s or Aestheticians&#x27; office.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent peel at a very good price. I&#x27;m fair skinned, and completed this peel about a week ago. The first two days following the peel my skin looked red like I&#x27;d gotten a sunburn, and starting on the third day it began to peel like crazy, which stopped after about day five or six. Once the peeling was over my skin looked radiant, and still does. There was even a slight reduction in fine lines. I plan on completing this peel every month or so, and might even try a slightly higher concentration of TCA next time. For best results apply an l-ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) serum to you skin in the evenings to help the recovery process.</li>
            <li> The item really works. It is not painful and overtime the results will improve as you patiently continue to use the product as directed. One important point, I don&#x27;t recommend this product for face treatment, because of the red scab that forms as the skin heal. The red scab will eventually come off leaving smooth skin, but it would take a few days to safely peel it off.</li>
            <li> I am a 44 year old African American who had suffered from acne for years. My complexion is spotty and the texture isn&#x27;t smooth. This product did smooth out the texture very nicely but it also burned my skin at the chin and nasal folds. However a week after I did the peel I started using obagi 20% C-serum and that has faded any dark spots caused by the peel.</li>
            <li> Women with color: This peel is not for us. I gave it four stars not to discourage lighter women for whom it may work just fine. We with the melanin compliment should use the LACTIC acid peels. The application methods, the stay on time, the recovery time and projected results for the TCA 20% + Jessner&#x27;s peel (all acid peels actually), are not calculated with regard for our melanin, which reacts strongly against peels. Even with Lactic acid, I&#x27;ve learned we women with color must proceed with extreme care.   I am the exact color of Queen Latifah, flawless caf√© au lait; I look well under my 40 years and thought I&#x27;d use a peel to maintain that edge. This TCA 20% + Jessner&#x27;s peel, left on for less time than suggested by the enclosed directions, 2 minutes at most, proceeded to bubble, then frost and burn on my skin. I immediately rinsed thoroughly with cold water.  Patted dry, looked in the mirror. In two small places the acid had completely lifted  the top layer of skin to expose the flesh beneath--and boy did it hurt (hot spots, according to the product pamphlet).   Overall, the cheeks, forehead, and chin were deeply flushed red. And my heart sank. Where there is red--the melanin has already been alarmed--the red will turn deep brown, or black.  Which it proceeded to do.  Over the course of TWO WEEKS the red skin flaked and fell off in scales. Beneath, it left taupe colored stains that over the THIRD week deepened to a dark chocolate--and this was without sun exposure, as I was embarrassed to show my face in public.   After FOUR weeks the dark chocolate stains remained, deepened even, on my once beautiful even-toned complexion. I looked like a Halloween character. Such uneven melanin concentration would take a year to eighteen months to fade--naturally.  I set to work reading all the reviews on acid peels here on Amazon. I googled acid peels and read much of the literature available, some of it advising Africans to stay away from peels altogether. I learned that LACTICacid is the best for those of us with color.   I purchased the 35% Lactic Acid peel from Skin Laboratory, available here on AMAZON. Before applying the peel I had on hand a bottle of Vitamin E capsules (two capsules pricked with a pin readily within reach). I had also at hand, a small bottle of castor oil, as I&#x27;d noticed that in some of the peel products I&#x27;d researched AND in more than a few high-end cosmetics castor oil is a key ingredient.   I applied a very thin layer of castor oil to the dark areas and waited a few minutes for it to sink in. Then I applied the 35% Lactic Acid peel. I left the Lactic Acid peel on for 4 minutes. It hardly burned at all, perhaps because of the castor oil. I rinsed and looked in the mirror. EUREKA!! The dark marks had lifted some.  I squeezed Vitamin E from one of the capsules and dabbed it on the dark areas. I felt hope. Hope that I wouldn&#x27;t have to walk around spotted for 18 months.  I need only reapply the peel, very carefully in graduating stages, always with the castor oil, and afterwards apply the Vitamin E.    And that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing, twice a week. It&#x27;s been two weeks since I began the Lactic Acid peel regimen, four mini-peels so far, and the stains are almost gone.   I put one tiny drop of Lactic Acid peel into a gob of castor oil, mix it in the palm of my hand and apply that at bedtime. When I wake the marks are even more faded. I wash with Kinerase PhotoFacial Cleanser from Sephora; it leaves my face incredibly bright, and youthful like no other product. The other two products in the Kinerase PhotoFacial line, the night moisturizer and the day moisturizer with SPF 50 are worthless. UNT SPF 50 works better for a quarter of the price (I got mine on Ebay). I apply the UNT, then top it with Smashbox Photo Finish Primer or Avon Magix--both of which have additional SPF and make the UNT completely disappear. I figure in another 4 weeks the marks will be entirely gone--and I&#x27;ll have my confidence back by New Years 2010. I hope my drama helps you avoid the trauma.</li>
            <li> I have been using chemical peels for the past 15 years.  I love the way my face feels and looks after each peel.  I had been loyally ordering from another company which offered wonderful products but their prices keep going up.  When I found this Perfect solutions I was a little reluctant because they were a lot cheaper than my usual co.  However, after using the products, wow! I am so, so, happy with the outcome.  The price is great, the packaging is perfect because it is environmentally friendly (overpackaging drives me CRAZY), and I received my peels in 3 days after ordering!!!!  I love this company, and I LOVE these products.  By the way, if your skin is used to chemical peels (like mine), you won&#x27;t get the full peel effect like the directions say you would.  My peels come out very light and I only peel in certain areas on my face.  I may need to go up in % TCA next order, but I still love the way my face feels after.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> WOW - this stuff is powerful - especially the TCA. I did the Jessner&#x27;s peel twice(one treatment immediately after the other) and did not notice much peeling or tightness. The next evening I did the TCA as a stand alone peel, leaving it on for 4 minutes. FOLLOW DIRECTIONS NO KIDDING - make sure you have that hair dryer set to cool and a cool towel right on hand. It burns but the dryer alleviates alot of the discomfort. You might want a skin neutralizer to use immediately after, it seemed to help. I did the TCA peel Tuesday night, went back to work Thurs (always have WED off), and work in a dental office. Wore no makeup except mascara, and while my face felt really tight, one of my patients said I looked especially &#x27;fresh&#x27;. I can&#x27;t wait to see the final post peel results. The products arrived exactly as described, very well packaged, and way quicker than I anticipated. 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> this peel since it is a 20% solution only helps with light scars but it does work if you have lights scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m East Asian with skin that is very prone to hyperpigmentation; blemishes can leave darkened marks for weeks if not months.  I first tried applying the TCA with a cheapie art store fan brush lightly over my face.  From the other reviews it should be obvious that TCA seems like a very unpredictable peel; for some reason a portion of my chin peeled way more than others and I was left with a 3/4\\&quot;x1/2\\&quot; long dark blotch for weeks.      I read in another review of TCA (different brand though) of someone adding some drops of it to their moisturizer.  So I gave this another shot and I tried that with my favorite Cetaphil lotion (not cream) and after a few days my skin was dramatically more even-toned, soft, and translucent looking.  This TCA-lotion mixture also seemed to clear up my acne scars (including that TCA-induced blotch which is gone now) much more quickly than when I tried direct application of TCA alone, and without such dramatically flaky results (though there is a bit, nothing my Clarisonic can&#x27;t remove).  No scabbing.      Might sound counterintuitive, but sometimes gradual, consistent application at lower strength can be more effective--unless you have the time to let your skin recover from what can really be medium-level trauma (chemical burn).  Which for those of us with skin whose melanin goes crazy after a wound, is probably not good.  Especially if you&#x27;re trying this out and are worried about hyperpigmentation, it might be best to start out slow.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful products that work as stated. Be careful and the follow directions, if you do the results are wonderful; really improved the quality and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I found out that they sell this without a prescription.  I love it &#x27;cause it really works like the professional kind!</li>
            <li> I did a 35% chemical peel about 1-1 1/2 yrs ago at home. Folks, let me tell you, this stuff can seriously mess up your skin. To this day, I have severe redness over my temporal areas on my face, and a now brown spot under my right eye. Following the sellers recommendations, a 10% TCA was done to follow-up. This made no difference to improve my condition. Then seller recommended a 50% lactic acid, to lighten the redness and brown areas.    Since this has all happened, I have seen a plastic surgeon and a dermatologist at the University of Iowa.    Please realize this stuff can PERMANENTLY damage your skin. Its not worth it! Please save your money and see a professional. Yes, it will cost you 1000% more, but you wont have the emotional distress of the scars this stuff can leave.    This has been so devastating, it has caused me suicidal thoughts several times. I beg you, learn from my mistake.</li>
            <li> I just gave myself the peel last night.   I have had treatments since I was in my 20&#x27;s. You name it, I&#x27;ve used it; retin A to Fraxel, and everything in between.  I put the Jessner peel on first and WOW!!! We&#x27;re talking serious professional strength!   When it says have your hair dryer on a cool setting on stand by. DO IT!!   I followed instructions and did the Jessner, then, the TCA Peel and after it had cooled, I reapplied, since I&#x27;m a pro at this.  I lightly wiped it off with a cool compress.     I&#x27;ve paid 250.00 for a peel this strength, in the past.    This is awesome, but you&#x27;ll need 3-4 days to deal with the peeling.  And beginners need to be extremely careful, because this is really professional grade!   I like that I can do it myself, when I want and can apply it to my trouble spots, better than a professional, who often isn&#x27;t as thorough as I can be.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend that you try this first on a test area, because the results can be variable. I used this on a 3\\&quot;x3\\&quot; area on my temples which is scarred from years of acne.  I prepared the area about 1 week in advance with tretinoin 1% cream for increased depth of peeling and to prevent any hyperpigmentation.  After cleaning the area thoroughly with soap and water, I followed with isopropyl alcohol 70% to degrease the area, since surface oil can hinder the penetration of the acids. I found that applying the Jessner&#x27;s solution alone caused some Level II frosting (white frosting with red area showing through) with pretty intense stinging, but following with the TCA did not really increase the depth of peeling. I found that surprising because TCA should be a much stronger acid than the Jessner&#x27;s solution. The frosting went away after about 30 minutes, which was replaced by redness.  It took about 7 full days for all the brown scab to fall off. After the healing, I saw some moderate improvement in texture and minor improvement in scarring. Overall, I feel comfortable using this in a larger area of my face since I know how my skin reacts. I strongly recommend that you do some research (I read portions of dermatology procedure texts) before attempting this to prevent complications.</li>
            <li> To be honest, the only reason ive given it a 3 is because i dont know if its done anything...  I just applied the lower strength one today, for 5 minutes, and i felt absolutely no burning whatsoever, and the was no white frosting, and no redness, so i dont think anything happened.  I also tried the TCA higher strength one for a full 2 minutes, and still no burning and no redness.... i also tried applying it directed onto the skin, instead of on a cotton pad to see if it would make a difference, but still nothing. If anyone could give me some advice, i would greatly appreciate it.</li>
            <li> ladies and gentlemen forget going to the spa for the same facial treatment and spending hundred of dollars that something even a baby can do.&lt;br /&gt;i left this one for only one minute as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;2days later my face started to scab, trust me it wasnt the prettiest thing, but i kept my face moisturised.&lt;br /&gt;the whole process of scabbing took about 5days and i had clear, beautiful vibrant skin.&lt;br /&gt;my skin looks like it can glow in the dark lol its so soft as a babies butt and clear.&lt;br /&gt;i still have a few spots left under my chin and will be doing another treatment in 3weeks which will be next week.&lt;br /&gt;BUT please do not hesitate to get this product, it doesnt take a genious to put it on your face for one minute and wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love love this product and the seller shipment was quick.&lt;br /&gt;i am also dark skin so dark skin sistas please dont hesitate to use</li>
            <li> If you are not experienced in getting spa treatments, be careful, as this is professional grade and can sting quite a bit.  Definitely helped clear up my acne and I can probably move up to a stronger solution next time, but that will be a while as this stuff lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about buying this at first. Since I bought it, I haven&#x27;t had one regret. The package comes with two bottles; this stuff seems like it will just last forever. My acne scars have made a remarkable improvement since using the product and it has only been about a week. I will continue to apply this product every 4-6 weeks as suggested and spot treat as needed. Make sure you pay close attention to read the directions! This seller is phenomonal! The shipment arrived 2 days early. I&#x27;m just utterly pleased with everything.</li>
            <li> I never used these products due to concerns about causing damage to my skin. (Subsequently had gone to a medical spa to get a Bichloroacetic Acid treatment for sebaceous hyperplasia, because I thought it would be safer. The sebaceous bumps did go away, but a few months later I developed large white scars everywhere the tx was applied, and these are NOT going to go away, so it&#x27;s just as bad a mess as the bumps were. The doctor put too much acid on the cotton applicator and it ran, causing the depigmentation. She was supposed to use a pointed wooden applicator for more precision. So though these two products are a different type of Acid, you can understand my fear!)</li>
            <li> I love this \\&quot;at home\\&quot; peel.  I was careful and just tested it in a small area on my upper cheek bones and waited a couple of days.  I can&#x27;t tell you how much it evened out my skin.  I was raving to my husband about it (and he was teasing me about it while I was \\&quot;molting\\&quot;), but now he has been complimenting me the past few days and saying how great my skin looks.  I just turned 40 and was thinking I was going to have to just get used to these new sun/age spots that creep up, but now that I&#x27;ve discovered this peel, I know I don&#x27;t have to.  I&#x27;m going to do it again in a week or so as there&#x27;s still room for improvement.</li>
            <li> It left black burns on my face.</li>
