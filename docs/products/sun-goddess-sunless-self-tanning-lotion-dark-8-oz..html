            <li>Absolutely love this product!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly for the price, and how it helps you look beautiful and bronzed without spending tons of money monthly in tanning salons dealing with sharky customer service tan techs, it&#x27;s a perfect buy.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m very fair skinned</li>
            <li>I would definately recommend this to anyone even if you have a very fair skin tone.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to use.</li>
            <li>This self tanner did not make me orange at all, the tan is, well, amazing!</li>
            <li>And gives you a nice color, it is NOT orange at all, thank goodness!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I am blond and fair skinned</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair toned skin.</li>
            <li>and everything was okay!&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a good while, even with shaving and showering.</li>
            <li>That lasts a good 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;*Easy</li>
            <li>Easy to apply!!</li>
            <li>Love the color!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this!</li>
            <li>solution or formula is amazing.</li>
            <li>It kind of has a reddish undertone like you&#x27;ve been out in the Sun</li>
            <li>reason why I gave this product 2 stars instead of 1 is because it smells quite nice</li>
            <li>reason why I gave this product 2 stars instead of 1 is because it smells quite nice</li>
            <li>just ok, you can spend the same amount and get a huge botle of sunlabs tanning lotion which is awesome, or tanwise mouse which is also awesome.</li>
            <li>I first ordered this after watching YouTube videos of it and the girls rating it as the best, even above Fakebake Flawless, which is what i was using before.</li>
            <li>I now use TANWISE LOTION, which can be bought at Sally Beauty Supply, it&#x27;s cheap, often it&#x27;s even on sale for like 7.99, it smells good</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than using a popular drug store tanning lotion</li>
            <li>What I like to do to make sure I get the best coverage without any streaks and to make it very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with this tanning</li>
            <li>first comes out great.</li>
            <li>I love it  </li>
            <li>I try to wear sandals mostly in the summer</li>
            <li>Anyways, I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Better off going with Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>Just make sure you wear gloves to apply.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the color</li>
            <li>I am hoping to find a foam or spray that I can work with better.</li>
            <li>The product now comes with a mitt, which would probably help apply it better.</li>
            <li>Love this self tanner</li>
            <li>I will be repurchasing when mine is all gone! :)</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would look on me, 1)</li>
            <li>I really love the color it gave me after just one application</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with Sun Goddess and will definitely be buying it again!</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I take more showers than most people.</li>
            <li>I have literally tried so many self tanners.  </li>
            <li>Mine lasted for one week :)</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t lie, I love beds and I will tan 1 or 2 times a week ..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Sunless to me is more control than tanning.</li>
            <li>You get instant gratification &amp;you are the one who sees your tan more than anyone else, so you know where you messed up or where to put it to look perfect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Get more of:&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;First time self tanners, with the right tools, glove, mitt, kabuki brush, you will get asked all the time just like I do, Where did you get that gorgeous tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Those 2 tanning machines are highly recommended and you can get a great tan</li>
            <li>It is a good tanning lotion, and it doesnt turn you that orange color like most do, and it fades really well.</li>
            <li>It gives a great natural look and no streaks!</li>
            <li>The results will be a rich deep flawless tan, that</li>
            <li>But overall I loved this product!</li>
            <li>Dries very quick.</li>
            <li>on just out of shower because it doesn&#x27;t spread easily</li>
            <li>I find this self tanner so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Product is easy to apply and does not streak.  </li>
            <li>and I find it easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>but I blotched so easily from each</li>
            <li>and it is easily</li>
            <li>But it does even out and correct easily.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best self tanner I have ever used!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m also a huge tester for anything and everything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Loves - so this stuff is great for a lot of color in a short time, you can shower about 3 hours post application and the color will still continue to develop</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this and figured I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous.</li>
            <li>and you have a great tan left over.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, ive used this product twice and works amazing and lasts a long time, way better than sun labs</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not too orange in most lighting, it appears even the next day for the most part, it lasts longer than most, it&#x27;s not too stinky</li>
            <li>The best technique I&#x27;ve found it to mix it with a small amount of lotion and apply sparingly.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll worth the money!</li>
            <li>I also watched a lot of YouTube videos on how to apply this product specifically so that I would feel confident using it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I gave it four stars only because you have to rub it in really good and fast because it dries so quick ( which is kind of a plus)</li>
            <li>This product is a great alternative to spray tanning (which I also tried for the first time recently).  </li>
            <li>Tips: exfoliate, use a good moisturizer (I used Vaseline Intensive Care or Nivea Essentially Enriched)</li>
            <li>Love this product works really well.</li>
            <li>Before application, I always make sure to exfoliate in the shower with a pair of exfoliating gloves, and I apply moisturizer to my face, ears, neck, hands, feet, elbows, knees, and underarms, to prevent too much color from sticking to those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was recommended this product and loved it after I first applied, but after my first shower it was very orangey, not the olive color I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>Make sure you exfoliate really well before you apply it.</li>
            <li>a good lotion on prior.</li>
            <li>This was better then million dollar tan but not by much.</li>
            <li>Tan lasts for a few days and it smells good after applying!</li>
            <li>It is probably the best color I have tried to date (better than fake bake, mystic, jergens or sublime).</li>
            <li>I have used many tanning products and sometimes &amp;#34;more expensive&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t always equal better.</li>
            <li>on quickly, and dries quickly too.&lt;br /&gt;Dark</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t give me bumps, fades relatively well, the color is the best I&#x27;ve used as far as looking like a real tan not orange.</li>
            <li>The color this self tanning lotion gives is great, however I am having trouble getting a good even application especially on my feet.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this along with 3 other self tanners this year and so far like this one the best.  </li>
            <li>If you are fair to pink toned this is probably not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have found that the best way to exfoliate is with a thin folded wash cloth.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a nice color if you can actually apply it before it dries.</li>
            <li>If you apply just a tiny bit of lotion on your area, beforehand, the product will go on more smoothly.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice candy, caramel, vanilla smell like Lucky Brand perfume and then a strange plasticky, burning smell.</li>
            <li>As promised it is a beautiful, dark brown, realistic tan.  </li>
            <li>ALSO-I would not apply this right before heading out</li>
            <li>Still working on getting it right</li>
            <li>You have to use the right products that work with your sunless tanner (this applies to those having problems with fading and turning orange).  </li>
            <li>but right under my breast it would never stay</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hands and feet, first apply a good lotion, or mix part self tanner little more regular lotion then use a mitt, palms will be free of self tanner.</li>
            <li>you look good brown and dark, have experience with blending sunless tanners</li>
            <li>this self tanner dries super fast.</li>
            <li>It is very natural and streak free.</li>
            <li>No streaks very fast shipping</li>
            <li>First..</li>
            <li>Thanks sun goddess!</li>
            <li>I am an avid self tanner, i spray or use lotion once a week</li>
            <li>However, keep in mind that this was my first-ever actual self-tanning experience, so I wasn&#x27;t sure of what to expect.  </li>
            <li>, Sun Goddess is the first self tanner I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to apply regular lotion (or body butter) to wrists for blending.  </li>
            <li>so much she encouraged her friends to try it on facebook!</li>
            <li>Like me the first time, I&#x27;m exhibit</li>
            <li>A (: put too much on and had a fun shower with a shower puff.</li>
            <li>Sun Goddess Self Tanner has great smell, not the usual burnt self tanner smell, No streaks!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will still keep trying other tanners, but as of right now this is my favorite in the color category</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel super soft and I will be repurchasing this product after I run out.</li>
            <li>sure your dry and get at it.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, shipping extremely fast, dry in couple</li>
            <li>But as I did my whole body I got used to it.</li>
            <li>I really do.</li>
            <li>how much I blend it in and this one did not leave me orange nor streaked.</li>
            <li>and the application was very streaky and the lotion is on the thinner side.</li>
            <li>I thought this would make application much easier, but</li>
            <li>Dries so fast and leaves streaks.</li>
            <li>My tan is very even, no streaking or blotchy spots.  </li>
            <li>The gloves and mitt that were included were very helpful in ensuring an even tan.  </li>
            <li>and you may put on too much to \\&quot;correct\\&quot;</li>
            <li>knowing how it&#x27;s really going to come out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After that, I started using Jergens Instant Sun in Light Bronze, and from time to time, the St. Tropez Classic mousse or the St. Tropez Express.  </li>
            <li>Gives super dark and even results... worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It looks good on people with dark brown hair or plat blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this, I vought all of the tanners that are popular online, this one makes you very dark, but YEP too orange!</li>
            <li>I think this gives me a very natural looking color, but I also tan very easily and have a naturally slightly darker complexion.</li>
            <li>The most annoying thing I&#x27;ve had experienced with all sunless tanners is that the color rubs off faster on your feet when you wear socks and tennis shoes.</li>
            <li>and it does give a decent tone.  </li>
            <li>and it does give a decent tone.  </li>
            <li>, want something that will tan you in one try, only takes 2 applications to be really dark, lasts for about 3 days of full color and 5 days before really looking faded, this is worth it for you!</li>
            <li>Some chemical that they normally use in self tanners.</li>
            <li>:) my fav and the colour last a long time</li>
            <li>This is a thick lotion, that is probably why it delivers such a gorgeous tan, no orange, no streaks.  </li>
            <li>Also I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It is very natural looking and it lasts up to 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>It is a very natural looking tan and does not look orange what-so-ever.  </li>
            <li>first time trying this product, I didn&#x27;t have a proper tanning mitt, so I used latex gloves.  </li>
            <li>or you can get super dark by buying a bottle of kahuna melange spray tan solution and applying it with gloves or a mitt (highly recommend) .</li>
            <li>I also bought a pack of tight fitting latex gloves for applying all my tanning lotions which helps enormously.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Dries very quickly&lt;br /&gt;There is an odor the next day</li>
            <li>this was the same over my whole body.</li>
            <li>However, considering that a full-size bottle costs a whopping $45.99 on Amazon, it definitely is worth paying either about the same price for an equal amount of St. Tropez mousse ($41 for 8 oz.</li>

            <li>I do not suggest it for anyone who doesn&#x27;t look good with green tinted sunless tanners (all sunless tanners tend to be be either green or reddish orange</li>
            <li>The next day, I did come out with some really brown legs, due to the guide color, and once I washed it off, I got a pretty decent tan that lasted about a week.  </li>
            <li>I have only tried one &amp;#34;coat&amp;#34; so far, and the color is very natural looking.</li>
            <li>it had more of a sweet smell and wasnt too bad on the normal self tan</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize they don&#x27;t all do that at first, because it&#x27;d been a long time since the last time I had put on tanner.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference in my skin tone right after applying it and after a few hours my tan was fully developed.  </li>
            <li>Much much longer than my old tanner or any other tanner that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>) green works well with dark haired, more olive skin tones.</li>
            <li>Be careful of streaking and control how much you put in one application, you can turn up to look like a Florida orange.</li>
            <li>because I&#x27;ve never used a self tanner and 2) because I barely even tan in the sun.  </li>
            <li>where apparently there is no sun.  </li>
            <li>Color was good, but I found it very difficult to even out the look to make it appear natural.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, there really aren&#x27;t clear instructions on the packaging of this product, so I would definitely suggest reading/watching reviews and demos if you aren&#x27;t familiar with using self</li>
            <li>Gives deep dark color in one application that is very realistic looking brown tan.</li>
            <li>second (and last) time trying this product, a few months after my first time, I&#x27;d already had a bit of experience with self-tanner.  </li>
            <li>gave it 3 stars because it does deliver a dark relatively realistic tan.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is you have to work fast because it dries fast, but at least you don&#x27;t have to walk around naked and not touch anything while you wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li>I even tried finishing up the blending with my hands, then had to wash them very well even though I had just done a small amount of rubbing in with my bare hands.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> just ok, you can spend the same amount and get a huge botle of sunlabs tanning lotion which is awesome, or tanwise mouse which is also awesome.</li>
            <li> I first ordered this after watching YouTube videos of it and the girls rating it as the best, even above Fakebake Flawless, which is what i was using before.</li>
            <li> I now use TANWISE LOTION, which can be bought at Sally Beauty Supply, it&#x27;s cheap, often it&#x27;s even on sale for like 7.99, it smells good</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than using a popular drug store tanning lotion</li>
            <li> What I like to do to make sure I get the best coverage without any streaks and to make it very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with this tanning</li>
            <li> first comes out great.</li>
            <li> I love it  </li>
            <li> I try to wear sandals mostly in the summer</li>
            <li> Anyways, I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Better off going with Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> Just make sure you wear gloves to apply.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the color</li>
            <li> I am hoping to find a foam or spray that I can work with better.</li>
            <li> The product now comes with a mitt, which would probably help apply it better.</li>
            <li> Love this self tanner</li>
            <li> I will be repurchasing when mine is all gone! :)</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would look on me, 1)</li>
            <li> I really love the color it gave me after just one application</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with Sun Goddess and will definitely be buying it again!</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure I take more showers than most people.</li>
            <li> I have literally tried so many self tanners.  </li>
            <li> Mine lasted for one week :)</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie, I love beds and I will tan 1 or 2 times a week ..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Sunless to me is more control than tanning.</li>
            <li> You get instant gratification &amp;you are the one who sees your tan more than anyone else, so you know where you messed up or where to put it to look perfect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Get more of:&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;First time self tanners, with the right tools, glove, mitt, kabuki brush, you will get asked all the time just like I do, Where did you get that gorgeous tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those 2 tanning machines are highly recommended and you can get a great tan</li>
            <li> It is a good tanning lotion, and it doesnt turn you that orange color like most do, and it fades really well.</li>
            <li> It gives a great natural look and no streaks!</li>
            <li> The results will be a rich deep flawless tan, that</li>
            <li> But overall I loved this product!</li>
            <li> Dries very quick.</li>
            <li> on just out of shower because it doesn&#x27;t spread easily</li>
            <li> I find this self tanner so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Product is easy to apply and does not streak.  </li>
            <li> and I find it easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> but I blotched so easily from each</li>
            <li> and it is easily</li>
            <li> But it does even out and correct easily.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best self tanner I have ever used!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m also a huge tester for anything and everything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Loves - so this stuff is great for a lot of color in a short time, you can shower about 3 hours post application and the color will still continue to develop</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this and figured I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous.</li>
            <li> and you have a great tan left over.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, ive used this product twice and works amazing and lasts a long time, way better than sun labs</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not too orange in most lighting, it appears even the next day for the most part, it lasts longer than most, it&#x27;s not too stinky</li>
            <li> The best technique I&#x27;ve found it to mix it with a small amount of lotion and apply sparingly.</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll worth the money!</li>
            <li> I also watched a lot of YouTube videos on how to apply this product specifically so that I would feel confident using it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I gave it four stars only because you have to rub it in really good and fast because it dries so quick ( which is kind of a plus)</li>
            <li> This product is a great alternative to spray tanning (which I also tried for the first time recently).  </li>
            <li> Tips: exfoliate, use a good moisturizer (I used Vaseline Intensive Care or Nivea Essentially Enriched)</li>
            <li> Love this product works really well.</li>
            <li> Before application, I always make sure to exfoliate in the shower with a pair of exfoliating gloves, and I apply moisturizer to my face, ears, neck, hands, feet, elbows, knees, and underarms, to prevent too much color from sticking to those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product and loved it after I first applied, but after my first shower it was very orangey, not the olive color I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Make sure you exfoliate really well before you apply it.</li>
            <li> a good lotion on prior.</li>
            <li> This was better then million dollar tan but not by much.</li>
            <li> Tan lasts for a few days and it smells good after applying!</li>
            <li> It is probably the best color I have tried to date (better than fake bake, mystic, jergens or sublime).</li>
            <li> I have used many tanning products and sometimes &amp;#34;more expensive&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t always equal better.</li>
            <li> on quickly, and dries quickly too.&lt;br /&gt;Dark</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t give me bumps, fades relatively well, the color is the best I&#x27;ve used as far as looking like a real tan not orange.</li>
            <li> The color this self tanning lotion gives is great, however I am having trouble getting a good even application especially on my feet.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this along with 3 other self tanners this year and so far like this one the best.  </li>
            <li> If you are fair to pink toned this is probably not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have found that the best way to exfoliate is with a thin folded wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a nice color if you can actually apply it before it dries.</li>
            <li> If you apply just a tiny bit of lotion on your area, beforehand, the product will go on more smoothly.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice candy, caramel, vanilla smell like Lucky Brand perfume and then a strange plasticky, burning smell.</li>
            <li> As promised it is a beautiful, dark brown, realistic tan.  </li>
            <li> ALSO-I would not apply this right before heading out</li>
            <li> Still working on getting it right</li>
            <li> You have to use the right products that work with your sunless tanner (this applies to those having problems with fading and turning orange).  </li>
            <li> but right under my breast it would never stay</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hands and feet, first apply a good lotion, or mix part self tanner little more regular lotion then use a mitt, palms will be free of self tanner.</li>
            <li> you look good brown and dark, have experience with blending sunless tanners</li>
            <li> this self tanner dries super fast.</li>
            <li> It is very natural and streak free.</li>
            <li> No streaks very fast shipping</li>
            <li> First..</li>
            <li> Thanks sun goddess!</li>
            <li> I am an avid self tanner, i spray or use lotion once a week</li>
            <li> However, keep in mind that this was my first-ever actual self-tanning experience, so I wasn&#x27;t sure of what to expect.  </li>
            <li> , Sun Goddess is the first self tanner I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to apply regular lotion (or body butter) to wrists for blending.  </li>
            <li> so much she encouraged her friends to try it on facebook!</li>
            <li> Like me the first time, I&#x27;m exhibit</li>
            <li> A (: put too much on and had a fun shower with a shower puff.</li>
            <li> Sun Goddess Self Tanner has great smell, not the usual burnt self tanner smell, No streaks!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will still keep trying other tanners, but as of right now this is my favorite in the color category</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel super soft and I will be repurchasing this product after I run out.</li>
            <li> sure your dry and get at it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, shipping extremely fast, dry in couple</li>
            <li> But as I did my whole body I got used to it.</li>
            <li> I really do.</li>
            <li> how much I blend it in and this one did not leave me orange nor streaked.</li>
            <li> and the application was very streaky and the lotion is on the thinner side.</li>
            <li> I thought this would make application much easier, but</li>
            <li> Dries so fast and leaves streaks.</li>
            <li> My tan is very even, no streaking or blotchy spots.  </li>
            <li> The gloves and mitt that were included were very helpful in ensuring an even tan.  </li>
            <li> and you may put on too much to \\&quot;correct\\&quot;</li>
            <li> knowing how it&#x27;s really going to come out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After that, I started using Jergens Instant Sun in Light Bronze, and from time to time, the St. Tropez Classic mousse or the St. Tropez Express.  </li>
            <li> Gives super dark and even results... worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It looks good on people with dark brown hair or plat blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this, I vought all of the tanners that are popular online, this one makes you very dark, but YEP too orange!</li>
            <li> I think this gives me a very natural looking color, but I also tan very easily and have a naturally slightly darker complexion.</li>
            <li> The most annoying thing I&#x27;ve had experienced with all sunless tanners is that the color rubs off faster on your feet when you wear socks and tennis shoes.</li>
            <li> and it does give a decent tone.  </li>
            <li> and it does give a decent tone.  </li>
            <li> , want something that will tan you in one try, only takes 2 applications to be really dark, lasts for about 3 days of full color and 5 days before really looking faded, this is worth it for you!</li>
            <li> Some chemical that they normally use in self tanners.</li>
            <li> :) my fav and the colour last a long time</li>
            <li> This is a thick lotion, that is probably why it delivers such a gorgeous tan, no orange, no streaks.  </li>
            <li> Also I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It is very natural looking and it lasts up to 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It is a very natural looking tan and does not look orange what-so-ever.  </li>
            <li> first time trying this product, I didn&#x27;t have a proper tanning mitt, so I used latex gloves.  </li>
            <li> or you can get super dark by buying a bottle of kahuna melange spray tan solution and applying it with gloves or a mitt (highly recommend) .</li>
            <li> I also bought a pack of tight fitting latex gloves for applying all my tanning lotions which helps enormously.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Dries very quickly&lt;br /&gt;There is an odor the next day</li>
            <li> this was the same over my whole body.</li>
            <li> However, considering that a full-size bottle costs a whopping $45.99 on Amazon, it definitely is worth paying either about the same price for an equal amount of St. Tropez mousse ($41 for 8 oz.</li>
            <li> However, considering that a full-size bottle costs a whopping $45.99 on Amazon, it definitely is worth paying either about the same price for an equal amount of St. Tropez mousse ($41 for 8 oz.</li>
            <li> I do not suggest it for anyone who doesn&#x27;t look good with green tinted sunless tanners (all sunless tanners tend to be be either green or reddish orange</li>
            <li> The next day, I did come out with some really brown legs, due to the guide color, and once I washed it off, I got a pretty decent tan that lasted about a week.  </li>
            <li> I have only tried one &amp;#34;coat&amp;#34; so far, and the color is very natural looking.</li>
            <li> it had more of a sweet smell and wasnt too bad on the normal self tan</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize they don&#x27;t all do that at first, because it&#x27;d been a long time since the last time I had put on tanner.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in my skin tone right after applying it and after a few hours my tan was fully developed.  </li>
            <li> Much much longer than my old tanner or any other tanner that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> ) green works well with dark haired, more olive skin tones.</li>
            <li> Be careful of streaking and control how much you put in one application, you can turn up to look like a Florida orange.</li>
            <li> because I&#x27;ve never used a self tanner and 2) because I barely even tan in the sun.  </li>
            <li> where apparently there is no sun.  </li>
            <li> Color was good, but I found it very difficult to even out the look to make it appear natural.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there really aren&#x27;t clear instructions on the packaging of this product, so I would definitely suggest reading/watching reviews and demos if you aren&#x27;t familiar with using self</li>
            <li> Gives deep dark color in one application that is very realistic looking brown tan.</li>
            <li> second (and last) time trying this product, a few months after my first time, I&#x27;d already had a bit of experience with self-tanner.  </li>
            <li> gave it 3 stars because it does deliver a dark relatively realistic tan.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is you have to work fast because it dries fast, but at least you don&#x27;t have to walk around naked and not touch anything while you wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> I even tried finishing up the blending with my hands, then had to wash them very well even though I had just done a small amount of rubbing in with my bare hands.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to apply around hands and feet without looking too dark or blotchy even with my most careful efforts.</li>
            <li> Also, if you want your self tan to last long exfoliate prior to application and moistrize daily after.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only purchased a couple of their samples in the dark, and have yet to get a bottle, but I will.  </li>
            <li> With one application I have a dark natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> , it was a pain to get rubbed in though and has a strange gritty texture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It does last a long time, not the easiest to correct.</li>
            <li> And you&#x27;d have to have a certain level of your base tan to even be able to keep up with the Versa ..</li>
            <li> It totally lasts long too!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> I would not use this product with my bare hands because it dries quickly and would be difficult to get off.  </li>
            <li> Applied exactly as instructed and was still streaky, very hard to apply, drips constantly.  </li>
            <li> so I realize that beds artificial UV rays are more damaging to aging the skin ..</li>
            <li> It just rubbed on strange.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how long this tan lasted.  </li>
            <li> If you have red or golden blonde hair, this is going to be the wrong color for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time</li>
            <li> can take a shower after 3 hours, still lasts just as long (7-10 days), but I recommend doing it at night and sleeping through it.</li>
            <li> It was a little too dark and a few streaks but a quick shower with a shower puff</li>
            <li> /&gt;Strong dislikes - it is really hard to rub it in all the way, the thickness and just flat out strange texture makes it hard to apply lightly to hands, feet, elbows, knees.</li>
            <li> You should use regular lotion first because this stuff is very thick and sticks to dry skin.</li>
            <li> The only plus is the scent, it&#x27;s the only tanner I&#x27;ve ever used to not give the typical repulsive smell.</li>
            <li> a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For body, doesn&#x27;t take that long.  </li>
            <li> The 8oz bottle lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> For people having problems with streaks and uneven application, if you mix the tanner with a little bit of lotion before you apply it makes it much easier to blend in.</li>
            <li> Or use gloves that are mostly dry from applying gel on another part of body and rub seemingly dry gloves on feet and ankles.</li>
            <li> Remember to pre moisturize your dry areas and mix the tanner with your face lotion for your face.</li>
            <li> My legs were extremely dark, but my feet were starkly different-</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with Sun Goddess which means the 8oz bottle should last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure whether it was the gloves or the product itself, but this product dried way too quickly and blended horribly!  </li>
            <li> I have had it for a little over a month now and still have about 5 tans left!</li>
            <li> Sungoddess is made without it and that is why it does not smell bad like most tanners do.</li>
            <li> More permanent is sometimes bad, just because of mistakes.</li>
            <li> Because it applied so unevenly, I had to use some of my Jergens Instant Sun mousse to go over a couple of areas.  </li>
            <li> Because it applied so unevenly, I had to use some of my Jergens Instant Sun mousse to go over a couple of areas.  </li>
            <li> A few things, I do not suggest it to anyone who is inexperienced with sunless tanners, and who doesn&#x27;t have time to mess around with blending and using hydrogen peroxide to lighten areas as you go, use jergens for low maintenance quickies.</li>
            <li> And I was putting it on every other day.</li>
            <li> While the specks were gone, the tan was just so-so, compared to my results with my other self-tanners.  </li>
            <li> While the specks were gone, the tan was just so-so, compared to my results with my other self-tanners.  </li>
            <li> I will never buy any other sunless tanner again.</li>
            <li> Just stand for a little bit let it dry, takes no time at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes it is runny and very dark looking out of the container, but once it is a bit dry then you can even it out.  </li>
            <li> Sun Goddess in dark, leaves me looking brown</li>
            <li> the face, and neck (simple), use a thick kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> : I love the way it lasts, but I hate the way it lasts.</li>
            <li> Love, hate relationship.</li>
            <li> but no more going in every single day.</li>
            <li> less fuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If i could give it a half a star i would.</li>
            <li> Typically I use st tropez tanning mousse, now I know never to stray away.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the black lotion intimidate you</li>
            <li> and then you can shower, and I woulddefinitely shower because it will make a mess of your clothes</li>
            <li> The other 3 were either to light, or had that orange cast that I just hate.  </li>
            <li> So I put a about the size of a nickle of the Sun Goddes and then a little less of the lotion in my hand and then rub it all over my leg.  </li>
            <li> Another thing I don&#x27;t like is when I applied it it stung a little like it had alcohol in it.</li>
            <li> (I have a little can of</li>
            <li> Pump a little lotion on the brush and apply to face and neck in a swirl motion.  </li>
            <li> For hands and feet a little goes</li>
            <li> I usually have trouble with other products streaking no matter</li>
            <li> So it takes maybe a few times to get it down!</li>

            <li> Background on my skin tone: Asian, yellow undertones.   Follow directions and color does appear in an hour.. Be careful of streaking and control how much you put in one application, you can turn up to look like a Florida orange. 🍊 The color appears in an hour but I cannot stand the smell. First.. It gives a nice candy, caramel, vanilla smell like Lucky Brand perfume and then a strange plasticky, burning smell. The color stays for a week, if properly maintained and moisturized. I also used it for my upper body and works well. The product gave me a sun kissed beach glow... I love it  but the smell is holding me back to keep using it.   Tips: exfoliate, use a good moisturizer (I used Vaseline Intensive Care or Nivea Essentially Enriched) .. Let your skin absorb the lotion and begin applying the self tanner.. Or else little flecks of skin cells will rub off!  Not for people with sensitivity to smells.</li>
            <li> Loves - so this stuff is great for a lot of color in a short time, you can shower about 3 hours post application and the color will still continue to develop, it&#x27;s not too orange in most lighting, it appears even the next day for the most part, it lasts longer than most, it&#x27;s not too stinky and I don&#x27;t get the dreaded sunless tanner bumps from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strong dislikes - it is really hard to rub it in all the way, the thickness and just flat out strange texture makes it hard to apply lightly to hands, feet, elbows, knees. The tint that they use is about the color of molasses, that color washes off except it gets into my pores on my face (nose) and does not wash out, so it makes all of the pores look like tiny blackheads (I don&#x27;t think it is intended for facial use, but I am not buying a separate face tanner, I never have before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 3 stars because it does deliver a dark relatively realistic tan. It is probably the best color I have tried to date (better than fake bake, mystic, jergens or sublime). A few things, I do not suggest it to anyone who is inexperienced with sunless tanners, and who doesn&#x27;t have time to mess around with blending and using hydrogen peroxide to lighten areas as you go, use jergens for low maintenance quickies. I do not suggest it for anyone who doesn&#x27;t look good with green tinted sunless tanners (all sunless tanners tend to be be either green or reddish orange) green works well with dark haired, more olive skin tones. If you are fair to pink toned this is probably not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you look good brown and dark, have experience with blending sunless tanners, want something that will tan you in one try, only takes 2 applications to be really dark, lasts for about 3 days of full color and 5 days before really looking faded, this is worth it for you! ALSO-I would not apply this right before heading out, I have yet to find a sunless tanner that I would, the directions say 3 hours and then you can shower, and I woulddefinitely shower because it will make a mess of your clothes and you will look dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will still keep trying other tanners, but as of right now this is my favorite in the color category and I will buy it again if I can&#x27;t find something with similar color, less fuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE! a few weeks after doing this review I stopped using Sun Goddess, the reason being I started to get the dreaded itchy bumps on my skin. I also did not like the way this faded it makes you think you have a terrible skin issue. Another thing I don&#x27;t like is when I applied it it stung a little like it had alcohol in it. I didn&#x27;t realize they don&#x27;t all do that at first, because it&#x27;d been a long time since the last time I had put on tanner. But after a while I was kinda like, wait a minute I don&#x27;t remember this ever happening. I now use TANWISE LOTION, which can be bought at Sally Beauty Supply, it&#x27;s cheap, often it&#x27;s even on sale for like 7.99, it smells good, it doesn&#x27;t give me bumps, fades relatively well, the color is the best I&#x27;ve used as far as looking like a real tan not orange. It kind of has a reddish undertone like you&#x27;ve been out in the Sun, the only downside to this lotion is I feel like it doesn&#x27;t give you a lot of color with just one application but repeating application after 3 hours or doing it for a couple days in a row gives you plenty of color.</li>
            <li> Pump stops working, and the labeling on bottle peels off on your hands when applying and gets all over. Doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Gives deep dark color in one application that is very realistic looking brown tan. It is hard to apply around hands and feet without looking too dark or blotchy even with my most careful efforts. The best technique I&#x27;ve found it to mix it with a small amount of lotion and apply sparingly. Or use gloves that are mostly dry from applying gel on another part of body and rub seemingly dry gloves on feet and ankles. The most annoying thing I&#x27;ve had experienced with all sunless tanners is that the color rubs off faster on your feet when you wear socks and tennis shoes. I think because your feet sweat and are rubbing against the shoe. I try to wear sandals mostly in the summer but when I exercise an hour a few times a week it always results in the same problem leaving splotchy feet and a dead-sign of fake and baked skin at the beach. Since I&#x27;m very fair skinned it is very obvious.</li>
            <li> this self tanner dries super fast. And gives you a nice color, it is NOT orange at all, thank goodness!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!!! Remember to pre moisturize your dry areas and mix the tanner with your face lotion for your face. If you can get a Mit this product will be a lot easier to use v.s. just gloves! Thanks sun goddess!</li>
            <li> If i could give it a half a star i would. Or no star at all. It doesnt blend hardly at all. Was a hassle and a mistake. Couldnt wait for it to get off of my skin. Way to expensive for such a poor result. Get st moriz instead..</li>
            <li> I first ordered this after watching YouTube videos of it and the girls rating it as the best, even above Fakebake Flawless, which is what i was using before. So when I got it and put it on the first time I hated it. I squirted some on my hand and rubbed it on my leg. It just rubbed on strange. But as I did my whole body I got used to it. I think I was just used to Fakebake which had a spray nozzle. Anyways, I love this product. I really do. It is the best tanner I have ever used. And it lasts a while. Much much longer than my old tanner or any other tanner that I&#x27;ve ever used. And it doesn&#x27;t smell bad either like other tanners. I think the you tube video girls said this product is made without DHA or something. Some chemical that they normally use in self tanners. Sungoddess is made without it and that is why it does not smell bad like most tanners do. I love it. The 8oz bottle lasts a long time too! Lasted me about 4-5 months I think. And I was putting it on every other day.</li>
            <li> Love the color! Dries very quick. Easy to apply!! I will keep buying this product for future desires! Thank you</li>
            <li> Applied exactly as instructed and was still streaky, very hard to apply, drips constantly.  Not what it&#x27;s cracked up to be.  Better off going with Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I love the smell it&#x27;s the best smelling self tanner ever! No streaks very fast shipping I ordered on Friday and it was here by Wednesday! Will buy again!!!! Very happy and would recommend!</li>
            <li> Took me some time to get the hang of applying it but once you get it, you get it!! Worth the money! It totally lasts long too! Just make sure you wear gloves to apply.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the color&lt;br /&gt;Dries very quickly&lt;br /&gt;There is an odor the next day&lt;br /&gt;Put on just out of shower because it doesn&#x27;t spread easily</li>
            <li> The color this self tanning lotion gives is great, however I am having trouble getting a good even application especially on my feet.  I have found that the best way to exfoliate is with a thin folded wash cloth.  Still working on getting it right but dont think I will buy again.  I am hoping to find a foam or spray that I can work with better.</li>
            <li> I find this self tanner so easy to use. I usually have trouble with other products streaking no matter how much I blend it in and this one did not leave me orange nor streaked. It makes my skin feel super soft and I will be repurchasing this product after I run out. I have recommended it to everyone I know who uses self tanners!</li>
            <li> I used the mitt from sunlabs as well and I found the application of this horrible! It is basically impossible to apply it evenly, and if you rub too hard it gets even worse. Nice colour and smell but horrible application.</li>
            <li> Left me streaky :/ I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product ever again!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This is not for fair skinned people at all!!!!</li>
            <li> I am an avid self tanner, i spray or use lotion once a week and i have tried and reviews almost everything.&lt;br /&gt;First thing is this tanner smells like a mix of alcohol and a cookie, by the end of the day it had more of a sweet smell and wasnt too bad on the normal self tan smell.&lt;br /&gt;When i got this product i received gloves with it and the application was very streaky and the lotion is on the thinner side. It did even out by the following morning and did not look streaky once it set and i showered the excess off, it was a pain to get rubbed in though and has a strange gritty texture. The product now comes with a mitt, which would probably help apply it better. However iI just don&#x27;t see spending $40 on a product that is only 8 oz and just ok, you can spend the same amount and get a huge botle of sunlabs tanning lotion which is awesome, or tanwise mouse which is also awesome. or you can get super dark by buying a bottle of kahuna melange spray tan solution and applying it with gloves or a mitt (highly recommend) . Just my opinion but its just not great for the price....</li>
            <li> Love this product works really well.</li>
            <li> This is the worst self tanner I have every used. I received a free sample of this and figured I&#x27;d try it. Typically I use st tropez tanning mousse, now I know never to stray away. This tanner is streaky, difficult to blend and gives a terrible orange based tan. The only plus is the scent, it&#x27;s the only tanner I&#x27;ve ever used to not give the typical repulsive smell.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best self tanner I have ever used! It is very natural and streak free. I gave it four stars only because you have to rub it in really good and fast because it dries so quick ( which is kind of a plus) but it&#x27;s also on the expensive side. I would definately recommend this to anyone even if you have a very fair skin tone.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this! I use it about every 5 days ! I have had it for a little over a month now and still have about 5 tans left! I will definitely purchase it again! We&#x27;ll worth the money! I am a religious self tanner and have used LOTS of different ones, from over the counter to Victoria secrets.Sun Goddess Self Tanner has great smell, not the usual burnt self tanner smell, No streaks! And best of all.... Doesn&#x27;t rub of on to your clothes!</li>
            <li> Showered, prepped accordingly, protected knees, elbows, toes, used glove, even watched video application method. Color was good, but I found it very difficult to even out the look to make it appear natural. My legs were extremely dark, but my feet were starkly different- this was the same over my whole body. Was unfortunate as no matter what I did it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;go on smoothly&amp;#34; or blend perfectly. I have used many tanning products and sometimes &amp;#34;more expensive&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t always equal better. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this self tanner I was sent it to review I do have a youtube video with a review and giveaway for this lotion check it out[...]</li>
            <li> Sun Goddess is actually the first-ever &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; self-tanner that I&#x27;ve used (as opposed to gradual self-tanning lotions).  I got two sample packets from the manufacturer, and unfortunately, I ended up really not liking it either time I tried it, despite trying different application methods.  I&#x27;ve found that one packet will be enough to tan the legs and feet, or the arms, hands, neck, chest, shoulders, and upper back.  Before application, I always make sure to exfoliate in the shower with a pair of exfoliating gloves, and I apply moisturizer to my face, ears, neck, hands, feet, elbows, knees, and underarms, to prevent too much color from sticking to those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first time trying this product, I didn&#x27;t have a proper tanning mitt, so I used latex gloves.  I applied the self-tanner to my legs and feet.  I wasn&#x27;t sure whether it was the gloves or the product itself, but this product dried way too quickly and blended horribly!  I even tried finishing up the blending with my hands, then had to wash them very well even though I had just done a small amount of rubbing in with my bare hands.  The next day, I did come out with some really brown legs, due to the guide color, and once I washed it off, I got a pretty decent tan that lasted about a week.  However, keep in mind that this was my first-ever actual self-tanning experience, so I wasn&#x27;t sure of what to expect.  After that, I started using Jergens Instant Sun in Light Bronze, and from time to time, the St. Tropez Classic mousse or the St. Tropez Express.  (I have a little can of each.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second (and last) time trying this product, a few months after my first time, I&#x27;d already had a bit of experience with self-tanner.  This time around, I used a St. Tropez velour mitt and applied it to my arms, hands, neck, chest, shoulders, and upper back.  I thought this would make application much easier, but no.  It still was way too fast-drying, looked horribly streaky, and I noticed that my skin looked like it had a bunch of tiny specks, probably from the product settling into my pores.  Because it applied so unevenly, I had to use some of my Jergens Instant Sun mousse to go over a couple of areas.  I left it on overnight, and washed it off the next morning.  While the specks were gone, the tan was just so-so, compared to my results with my other self-tanners.  Unfortunately, the difficult application makes it not worth using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I gave this product 2 stars instead of 1 is because it smells quite nice and it does give a decent tone.  However, considering that a full-size bottle costs a whopping $45.99 on Amazon, it definitely is worth paying either about the same price for an equal amount of St. Tropez mousse ($41 for 8 oz. on Amazon), or a mere $12 or so on Amazon or at the drugstore for 6 fl. oz. of Jergens Instant Sun.d like it had a bunch of tiny specks, probably from the product settling into my pores.

            <li> For people having problems with streaks and uneven application, if you mix the tanner with a little bit of lotion before you apply it makes it much easier to blend in. I think this gives me a very natural looking color, but I also tan very easily and have a naturally slightly darker complexion. Also I have very sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t make me break out, even on my face.</li>
            <li> It was awful!! Never buying again, tried to get a refund but no luck it wouldn&#x27;t let me.</li>
            <li> Dries so fast and leaves streaks. Leaves a nice color if you can actually apply it before it dries. Mitt does not help rub in at all.</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner on the market bar none! The only drawback is you have to work fast because it dries fast, but at least you don&#x27;t have to walk around naked and not touch anything while you wait for it to dry. It is very natural looking and it lasts up to 2 weeks. I will never buy any other sunless tanner again.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product and loved it after I first applied, but after my first shower it was very orangey, not the olive color I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> This self tanner did not make me orange at all, the tan is, well, amazing! It gives me that perfect glow! Using this for my wedding day tan! I will be repurchasing when mine is all gone! :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good. It will tan you and and last 7-10 days. Make sure you exfoliate really well before you apply it.</li>
            <li> Product is easy to apply and does not streak.  Tan lasts for a few days and it smells good after applying!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than using a popular drug store tanning lotion, Sun Goddess is the first self tanner I have ever tried.  I saw a difference in my skin tone right after applying it and after a few hours my tan was fully developed.  It is a very natural looking tan and does not look orange what-so-ever.  I am blond and fair skinned and I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would look on me, 1) because I&#x27;ve never used a self tanner and 2) because I barely even tan in the sun.  I really love the color it gave me after just one application and I will definitely be using this regularly to maintain it (probably twice a week). This product is a great alternative to spray tanning (which I also tried for the first time recently).  My tan is very even, no streaking or blotchy spots.  The gloves and mitt that were included were very helpful in ensuring an even tan.  I would not use this product with my bare hands because it dries quickly and would be difficult to get off.  A little goes a long way with Sun Goddess which means the 8oz bottle should last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before purchasing this product I did a lot of research on self tanners.  I also watched a lot of YouTube videos on how to apply this product specifically so that I would feel confident using it for the first time.  Unfortunately, there really aren&#x27;t clear instructions on the packaging of this product, so I would definitely suggest reading/watching reviews and demos if you aren&#x27;t familiar with using self tanners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with Sun Goddess and will definitely be buying it again!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, shipping extremely fast, dry in couple mn! :) my fav and the colour last a long time</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how long this tan lasted.  As promised it is a beautiful, dark brown, realistic tan.  The smell is absolutly delicious.  This has yet to come off on clothes or sheets.  I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the face, and neck (simple), use a thick kabuki brush. Pump a little lotion on the brush and apply to face and neck in a swirl motion.  The results will be a rich deep flawless tan, that lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands and feet, first apply a good lotion, or mix part self tanner little more regular lotion then use a mitt, palms will be free of self tanner. Be sure to apply regular lotion (or body butter) to wrists for blending.  For hands and feet a little goes a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For body, doesn&#x27;t take that long.  This is a thick lotion, that is probably why it delivers such a gorgeous tan, no orange, no streaks.  Glove, with small circular motions, then, use a mitt to lighly buff any areas you feel you didn&#x27;t blend well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time self tanners, with the right tools, glove, mitt, kabuki brush, you will get asked all the time just like I do, Where did you get that gorgeous tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. If you remember to apply regular lotion or body butter to knees and elbows, your application will be a breeze.  Also, if you want your self tan to last long exfoliate prior to application and moistrize daily after.  You have to use the right products that work with your sunless tanner (this applies to those having problems with fading and turning orange).  You cannot use just any mousturizer or exfoliatant. They themselves are what can cause your sunless tanner to steak and fade.</li>
            <li> It works, just a lot of maintenance. Just watch the youtube videos on it, and you will see. They make it seem simple, but it sometimes just gets everywhere!</li>
            <li> Got it for my daughter who lives in Wa. where apparently there is no sun.  SHe like it so much she encouraged her friends to try it on facebook!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, ive used this product twice and works amazing and lasts a long time, way better than sun labs</li>
            <li> Best self tanner out there! Gives super dark and even results... worth every penny!</li>
            <li> If you want to look like a middle-eastern person, this is perfect. I has a green base to the stain to cancel out the orange of the self tanner. The end result is dirt brown. It lasted 3 days for me and I&#x27;m sure I take more showers than most people. You should use regular lotion first because this stuff is very thick and sticks to dry skin. If you have red or golden blonde hair, this is going to be the wrong color for you. It looks good on people with dark brown hair or plat blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I have literally tried so many self tanners.  All told probably 20 to 25 different ones.  I definitely like Sun Goddess ALOT !  So far I&#x27;ve only purchased a couple of their samples in the dark, and have yet to get a bottle, but I will.  I purchased this along with 3 other self tanners this year and so far like this one the best.  The color on my skin is a medium brown, with no orange shades to it.  The other 3 were either to light, or had that orange cast that I just hate.  Sun Goddess in dark, leaves me looking brown and I find it easy to apply.  Yes it is runny and very dark looking out of the container, but once it is a bit dry then you can even it out.  I also bought a pack of tight fitting latex gloves for applying all my tanning lotions which helps enormously.  I don&#x27;t need to hurry, in order to wash my hands.  I didn&#x27;t find that Sun Goddess had a horrible smell either.  Some of them do, but not this one.  I&#x27;m pretty happy with this tanning lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps  I notice some people have trouble with application of this product.  If you apply just a tiny bit of lotion on your area, beforehand, the product will go on more smoothly.</li>
            <li> best sunless tanner ever! Does not smell bad like other sunless tanning products. Does not cause break out. Not orange.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous. When you apply, and wait 3 hours to fully set, the product may be grainy on the skin in some areas, but it does not effect the evenness of the application. I was afraid that my chest and shoulder area would be splotchy, because the tanner left a lot of dry dirt-like particles in that are while drying. Once you wash off, your skin is silky, and color is even. I have only tried one &amp;#34;coat&amp;#34; so far, and the color is very natural looking. This will be great for the transition from colder months to bathing suit season!</li>
            <li> This product is great!  I use it all the time!  What I like to do to make sure I get the best coverage without any streaks and to make it very natural looking.  Is I add a little lotion to it!  So I put a about the size of a nickle of the Sun Goddes and then a little less of the lotion in my hand and then rub it all over my leg.  Then I repeat for the rest of my body.  It gives a great natural look and no streaks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair toned skin. With one application I have a dark natural looking tan. You have to exfoliate and shower first comes out great. Also for face mix with moisturizer. Mine lasted for one week :) Don&#x27;t let the black lotion intimidate you it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use. I&#x27;m a long time tanner and tanning beds are my home away from home personally. The only thing is, I did study skin so I realize that beds artificial UV rays are more damaging to aging the skin ..I&#x27;m not a fan of that and have been developing freckles so I say sunless. I won&#x27;t lie, I love beds and I will tan 1 or 2 times a week ..but no more going in every single day. Especially since it doesn&#x27;t clog pores or irritate the skin, I can use it all over face and body ..never having to worry about streaks or acne. I agree you need to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Obviously exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;*Rub a good lotion on prior. I like my Dove Cream Oil, Shae formula.&lt;br /&gt;*Make sure your dry and get at it. Rub like you&#x27;ve never rubbed before, this product dries so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;*You can take a shower after 3 hours, still lasts just as long (7-10 days), but I recommend doing it at night and sleeping through it. Unless you double dip and you can do it during the day to see if there are any mistakes and do the second go around at night! Wake up a glowing goddess. (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be afraid of the guide you just look like you&#x27;re a bikini mud wrestling type of a girlie. But it goes away and you have a great tan left over. Another problem is, is that everyone tans differently and or, reacts differently. I&#x27;ve seen a dark bronze woman, then I&#x27;ve seen an oompla loompa type woman and was very confused on how it would react to me. I&#x27;m Norwegian, the whitest of white so of course I was hesitant but I&#x27;m also a huge tester for anything and everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to take your mind off of:&lt;br /&gt;Goes on quickly, and dries quickly too.&lt;br /&gt;Dark lusty tan takes over the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;Guide washes off and all your fears are put to rest.&lt;br /&gt;You can try doing a double dip. (Twice in one day)&lt;br /&gt;^ I did this. It was a little too dark and a few streaks but a quick shower with a shower puff and everything was okay!&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a good while, even with shaving and showering.I shave every other day, hate hair, and the tan stayed.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clog pores, I did put it on my face and no streaks, no breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;You can sleep in this to set the tan without thinking of streaking. Just stand for a little bit let it dry, takes no time at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Sunless to me is more control than tanning. You get instant gratification &amp;you are the one who sees your tan more than anyone else, so you know where you messed up or where to put it to look perfect. Can&#x27;t always trust a Versa or Mystic.&lt;br /&gt;Those 2 tanning machines are highly recommended and you can get a great tan but I blotched so easily from each, I look like I had some skin disease or was deserted on an island for a bit! And you&#x27;d have to have a certain level of your base tan to even be able to keep up with the Versa ..really irritating when all I wanted was a glow or a bronze. So I get both now! (:&lt;br /&gt;The solution or formula is amazing. Except for the drying part. It dries so quickly, so insane. So just rub, rub, rub!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect color, but every skin tone is different.&lt;br /&gt;No odor that is screaming tan. Or any other weird smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It does last a long time, not the easiest to correct. So it takes maybe a few times to get it down! No worries, you&#x27;re the only one who sees the mistakes (: and it is easily corrected.&lt;br /&gt;^Meaning: I love the way it lasts, but I hate the way it lasts. Love, hate relationship. More permanent is sometimes bad, just because of mistakes. ((:&lt;br /&gt;With the guide it does leave streaks, just when you&#x27;re applying and setting. Being that it makes it hard to judge and you may put on too much to \\&quot;correct\\&quot; what doesn&#x27;t need correcting. Like me the first time, I&#x27;m exhibit A (: put too much on and had a fun shower with a shower puff. But it does even out and correct easily. So don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly for the price, and how it helps you look beautiful and bronzed without spending tons of money monthly in tanning salons dealing with sharky customer service tan techs, it&#x27;s a perfect buy.&lt;br /&gt;No more:&lt;br /&gt;*Tan techs that are harassing you to buy.&lt;br /&gt;*Tanning lotions that keep going up in price every couple weeks.&lt;br /&gt;*UV Rays that harmful to your specific aging process.&lt;br /&gt;*Not knowing how it&#x27;s really going to come out.&lt;br /&gt;*Blotch and streak. Peel and white spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get more of:&lt;br /&gt;*Beautiful tan. That lasts a good 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;*Easy application and drying time. 3 hours and you can shower!&lt;br /&gt;*Even tone that glows.&lt;br /&gt;*Control on how you wish to look.&lt;br /&gt;*Longer lasting tan.&lt;br /&gt;*Saving money of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps &amp;thank you, Sun Goddess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Dollie Face</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this, I vought all of the tanners that are popular online, this one makes you very dark, but YEP too orange! Yuck! The two that do not are St tropez and Fake bake. This was better then million dollar tan but not by much.</li>
            <li> It is a good tanning lotion, and it doesnt turn you that orange color like most do, and it fades really well. Only thing that I notice, I dont know if it&#x27;s just my skin or what but right under my breast it would never stay so it looked like i had a really bad tan line. But overall I loved this product!</li>
