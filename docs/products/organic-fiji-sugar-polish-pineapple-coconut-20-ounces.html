            <li>but it really does a great job of exfoliating &amp; softening the skin.  </li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t love the smell, but everything else about this is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Love that you can massage in the oils afterwards for a smooth finish.</li>

            <li>Not only does it smell great</li>
            <li>I scrub it on then lightly rinse and shave.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to get on here and write a review because I was so taken back by how great it works.</li>
            <li>The sugar seems superfine as the scrubbing agent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am happy to say I&#x27;ve finally found it.  </li>
            <li>The scent is amazing and it really makes me feel like I am on a tropical island.</li>

            <li>I will only be buying this because nothing really compares to how wonderful it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li>fun and smells so yummy!</li>
            <li>Great for dry winter skin, &amp; summer sun &amp; pool chemical re-moisturizer.</li>
            <li>True coconut oil only melts in warm temps, so the product may mix together better after being heated.</li>
            <li>Used a Thone of different exfoliators, and this just leaves my skin feeling good.</li>
            <li>The warm oil and soft scrub polished my skin</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good about this scrub, I don&#x27;t think I will ever use another.</li>
            <li>I love it so much..</li>
            <li>I love the smell - very tropical.  </li>
            <li>Regardless of age, who wants to fall in their tub????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love body products</li>
            <li>Great for winter dry skin!!</li>
            <li>Organic, nice gritty scrub, leaves your body with a light boiled moisturized feel.</li>
            <li>Killer price on Amazon too because this stuff is super exspensive anywhere else.</li>
            <li>The oils are great in the product but it takes forever to get the excess to dissolve and go down the drain.</li>
            <li>I love how clean and soft I feel afterwards.  </li>
            <li>This is the first winter where I havent felt the need to use lotion!  </li>
            <li>My teen daughters love it too!</li>
            <li>Living in a warm state, I don&#x27;t have the same solidification problem the previous posters have experienced.  </li>
            <li>It feels fresh and cool!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t try it with a razor that isn&#x27;t one of the disposable kind that you only use a couple times anyway.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s that soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>believing I&#x27;d  have  success.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>As we age, our skin gets dry and cracked, but this wonderful scrub helps to combat the dry hands of time.  </li>
            <li>It said right on the page</li>
            <li>but this one is not the right one for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not know, first soak in a big bowl of warm water to melt the oil.</li>
            <li>Just be careful you don&#x27;t slip in your tub or shower, but this is the best rescue for any dry skin.</li>
            <li>By the time I&#x27;m ready to use this scrub (I take very hot showers, about 15 minutes)</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower and it leaves my skin extremely soft and my entire bathroom smells delightful for a long while after.  </li>
            <li>first of all ladies, once you are over forty years of age, it is all about the cellular turnover.</li>
            <li>The gentle scrub helps to \\&quot;awake\\&quot; my skin and it improved the appearance immediately!  </li>
            <li>Leave the area soft and smooth</li>
            <li>This scrub really works!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Plus, the fact that it exfoliates, I have found I have a much closer shave!</li>
            <li>so much I am thinking of giving it to extended family members and close friends as gifts!</li>
            <li>The scent is divine, and the scrub leaves my skin so soft, smooth, and glowing.  </li>
            <li>I use it in the shower every morning and it makes my skin feel soft and smooth, eliminating the winter flakey skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It feels nice on your skin, a little oily but it drys into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>Warm product by submerging in warm to make product easier to dip into,  A little go a long way.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice but not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li>it was 20 ounces, but I didn&#x27;t realize just how much that was until I saw the product.  </li>
            <li>A very generous amount of scrub for your money.  </li>
            <li>Like, FAST.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>this stuff works very well.</li>
            <li>I so intensely cannot imagine putting that on my skin again.</li>
            <li>and she loves it so much.</li>
            <li>The smell is absolutely divine.</li>
            <li>and I am ready to exfoliate, the coconut oil has already warmed up and it is no longer solidified.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Really has helped.</li>
            <li>and I did read that this product caused the bathtub to be very slippery</li>
            <li>I highly recommend thus scrub!  </li>
            <li>Not only does it smell fabulous</li>
            <li>If your normally put lotion on after you shower it is not needed if you use this product!</li>
            <li>Not worth the price for sure.</li>
            <li>I think I have found my new staple!</li>
            <li>: the main ingredient is coconut oil, so it&#x27;ll make your shower build up with oil/get slippery.</li>
            <li>As an experiment, after I washed off the scrub, I decided to shave, sans soap (mainly because there&#x27;s no way</li>
            <li>Oh, and I really appreciate that it is made of all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for an all natural scrub!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li>I have pretty large breasts, something I did not have until recently.</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re looking for a soft exfoliation, this may be too much.</li>
            <li>Not thick like others I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>I love the coconut oil, and it is heavy on that.</li>
            <li>I normally buy my scrubs at sephora or dillards</li>
            <li>The texture of the sugar is so fine, it doesn&#x27;t feel abrasive like other scrubs.  </li>
            <li>this was just what i new it would be and stood up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Very soft.  </li>
            <li>wherever you like it extremely soft!</li>
            <li>I felt so young!  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>For skin this smooth, I couldn&#x27;t care less.</li>
            <li>My entire family likes this product so much that I signed up for Subscribe and Save to get a new one monthly</li>
            <li>It exfoliated the dry skin and left it feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I literally pat dry and get dressed right out of the shower...</li>
            <li>After using a similar product for years, I was so happy to find this at less than half the price!  </li>
            <li>The sugar doesn&#x27;t  dissolve quickly like with other scrubs.</li>
            <li>At first, I was afraid that the shower would be too slippery after using it, but it wasn&#x27;t (very bizarre!).  </li>
            <li>Oh wow....</li>
            <li>The scrub itself works well and leaves my skin just as soft as can be.</li>
            <li>Skin is really soft after use.</li>
            <li>my face is so sensitive..</li>
            <li>live in Texas and my jar arrived in quite a liquid state, so be careful when opening it for the first time if you do too.</li>
            <li>My skin was dry from hot baths &amp; sunning &amp;</li>
            <li>It does make the bottom of my shower kind of slick, so be careful after use.  </li>
            <li>but I would highly recommend and will definitely be purchasing again when it goes on sale.</li>
            <li>I have to very gently rub this on me, as it&#x27;s very rough otherwise.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I was a tad upset when it arrived because the lid was not tightly closed and some of the oil had leaked out into the packaging.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s soft enough to where I can spoon out some of the scrub and start using on my body.  </li>
            <li>If you live in a cold climate you may have to warm up the jar as the coconut oil can solidify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the shower can get really slippery after using this so be careful, watch your step,  and warn hubby too!</li>
            <li>I live in Alaska and our weather makes our skin sO dry!</li>
            <li>that my dry skin  has nearly  recovered.  </li>
            <li>It is also pretty rough compared to other scrubs.</li>
            <li>Just pat dry after and no other moisturizer needed after this!</li>
            <li>I have a small bottle of organic coconut oil that I use for moisturizing super dry parts of my skin</li>
            <li>Unlike some of the other products out there on the market this one penetrates well, leaving your skin very soft.</li>

            <li> fun and smells so yummy!</li>
            <li> Great for dry winter skin, &amp; summer sun &amp; pool chemical re-moisturizer.</li>
            <li> True coconut oil only melts in warm temps, so the product may mix together better after being heated.</li>

            <li> The warm oil and soft scrub polished my skin</li>

            <li> I love the smell - very tropical.  </li>
            <li> Regardless of age, who wants to fall in their tub????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love body products</li>
            <li> Great for winter dry skin!!</li>
            <li> Organic, nice gritty scrub, leaves your body with a light boiled moisturized feel.</li>
            <li> Killer price on Amazon too because this stuff is super exspensive anywhere else.</li>
            <li> The oils are great in the product but it takes forever to get the excess to dissolve and go down the drain.</li>
            <li> I love how clean and soft I feel afterwards.  </li>
            <li> This is the first winter where I havent felt the need to use lotion!  </li>
            <li> My teen daughters love it too!</li>
            <li> Living in a warm state, I don&#x27;t have the same solidification problem the previous posters have experienced.  </li>
            <li> It feels fresh and cool!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t try it with a razor that isn&#x27;t one of the disposable kind that you only use a couple times anyway.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s that soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> believing I&#x27;d  have  success.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> As we age, our skin gets dry and cracked, but this wonderful scrub helps to combat the dry hands of time.  </li>
            <li> It said right on the page</li>
            <li> but this one is not the right one for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not know, first soak in a big bowl of warm water to melt the oil.</li>
            <li> Just be careful you don&#x27;t slip in your tub or shower, but this is the best rescue for any dry skin.</li>
            <li> By the time I&#x27;m ready to use this scrub (I take very hot showers, about 15 minutes)</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower and it leaves my skin extremely soft and my entire bathroom smells delightful for a long while after.  </li>
            <li> first of all ladies, once you are over forty years of age, it is all about the cellular turnover.</li>
            <li> The gentle scrub helps to \\&quot;awake\\&quot; my skin and it improved the appearance immediately!  </li>
            <li> Leave the area soft and smooth</li>
            <li> This scrub really works!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Plus, the fact that it exfoliates, I have found I have a much closer shave!</li>
            <li> so much I am thinking of giving it to extended family members and close friends as gifts!</li>
            <li> The scent is divine, and the scrub leaves my skin so soft, smooth, and glowing.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the shower every morning and it makes my skin feel soft and smooth, eliminating the winter flakey skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It feels nice on your skin, a little oily but it drys into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> Warm product by submerging in warm to make product easier to dip into,  A little go a long way.  </li>
            <li> The smell is nice but not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> it was 20 ounces, but I didn&#x27;t realize just how much that was until I saw the product.  </li>
            <li> A very generous amount of scrub for your money.  </li>
            <li> Like, FAST.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> this stuff works very well.</li>
            <li> I so intensely cannot imagine putting that on my skin again.</li>
            <li> and she loves it so much.</li>
            <li> The smell is absolutely divine.</li>
            <li> and I am ready to exfoliate, the coconut oil has already warmed up and it is no longer solidified.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Really has helped.</li>
            <li> and I did read that this product caused the bathtub to be very slippery</li>
            <li> I highly recommend thus scrub!  </li>
            <li> Not only does it smell fabulous</li>
            <li> If your normally put lotion on after you shower it is not needed if you use this product!</li>
            <li> Not worth the price for sure.</li>
            <li> I think I have found my new staple!</li>
            <li> : the main ingredient is coconut oil, so it&#x27;ll make your shower build up with oil/get slippery.</li>
            <li> As an experiment, after I washed off the scrub, I decided to shave, sans soap (mainly because there&#x27;s no way</li>
            <li> Oh, and I really appreciate that it is made of all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for an all natural scrub!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> I have pretty large breasts, something I did not have until recently.</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re looking for a soft exfoliation, this may be too much.</li>
            <li> Not thick like others I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> I love the coconut oil, and it is heavy on that.</li>
            <li> I normally buy my scrubs at sephora or dillards</li>
            <li> The texture of the sugar is so fine, it doesn&#x27;t feel abrasive like other scrubs.  </li>
            <li> this was just what i new it would be and stood up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Very soft.  </li>
            <li> wherever you like it extremely soft!</li>
            <li> I felt so young!  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> For skin this smooth, I couldn&#x27;t care less.</li>

            <li> After using a similar product for years, I was so happy to find this at less than half the price!  </li>
            <li> The sugar doesn&#x27;t  dissolve quickly like with other scrubs.</li>
            <li> At first, I was afraid that the shower would be too slippery after using it, but it wasn&#x27;t (very bizarre!).  </li>
            <li> Oh wow....</li>
            <li> The scrub itself works well and leaves my skin just as soft as can be.</li>
            <li> Skin is really soft after use.</li>
            <li> my face is so sensitive..</li>
            <li> live in Texas and my jar arrived in quite a liquid state, so be careful when opening it for the first time if you do too.</li>
            <li> My skin was dry from hot baths &amp; sunning &amp;</li>
            <li> It does make the bottom of my shower kind of slick, so be careful after use.  </li>
            <li> but I would highly recommend and will definitely be purchasing again when it goes on sale.</li>
            <li> I have to very gently rub this on me, as it&#x27;s very rough otherwise.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I was a tad upset when it arrived because the lid was not tightly closed and some of the oil had leaked out into the packaging.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s soft enough to where I can spoon out some of the scrub and start using on my body.  </li>
            <li> If you live in a cold climate you may have to warm up the jar as the coconut oil can solidify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the shower can get really slippery after using this so be careful, watch your step,  and warn hubby too!</li>
            <li> I live in Alaska and our weather makes our skin sO dry!</li>
            <li> that my dry skin  has nearly  recovered.  </li>
            <li> It is also pretty rough compared to other scrubs.</li>
            <li> Just pat dry after and no other moisturizer needed after this!</li>
            <li> I have a small bottle of organic coconut oil that I use for moisturizing super dry parts of my skin</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other products out there on the market this one penetrates well, leaving your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I live in an area where the average temperature is in the 70s.  </li>
            <li> Also I found that the moisture come from the coconut doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> A lot of people complain that the scrub is solid and takes too long to soften up.  </li>
            <li> It slows down considerably and so BELIEVE me when I say, sugar and salt scrub should be used liberally.</li>
            <li> As long as you are not allergic to coconut</li>
            <li> It was packed with an electronic piece of equipment, so I was relieved that the oil only saturated the cardboard and had not yet reached my other item.  </li>
            <li> As one of the other reviewers said, the scrub is hardened, because as it says on the jar, organic coconut oil is a solid at room temperature.  </li>
            <li> Over time it began to actually dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other scrubs before and usually thought they were &amp;#34;just OK.&amp;#34; The only reason I bought this was because of reviews I&#x27;d read about coconut oil and scrubs helping out with keratosis pilaris, and I&#x27;ve recently decided that I&#x27;ve had it with the &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; on my legs and upper arms getting in the way of my tank tops and sleeveless</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but so far after using this product for about a week</li>
            <li> I decided  that I&#x27;d  try  to work harder  on my ultra dry  skin with this  product, not  </li>
            <li> it did have a slight coconut smell but not nearly enough for me!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then rub this stuff on your face and chest and rest of body and be clean, scrubbed and off with the nasty old clingy cells and reveal the new baby skin!</li>
            <li> It also is a rough grit</li>
            <li> Just be careful because it can make your shower floor quite slippery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just be careful because when it says it&#x27;s exfoliating, it&#x27;s no joke.  </li>
            <li> This was something I so longed to love after missing the Islands during this long, cold Winter!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure the MFG # means date of expiration, but if so, it expired several months ago.</li>
            <li> It is also extremely oily and leaves alot of residue in the shower.</li>
            <li> The days I use this product, I do not need to use any other lotions.  </li>
            <li> And, for those who shave, I use this scrub before-hand, rinse it off, then I can shave without the need for any shave cream, lather, soap, or any other medium to keep from razor burn associated with &amp;#34;dry shaving.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> There is one ingredient on the list that is not listed as organic, I forgot which one it was but just a heads up that this product is not 100% organic, although all of the other ingredients are organic.</li>
            <li> so I have to be very careful not to increase that production..</li>
            <li> It is rock solid and hard to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of a luscious summer dessert, or long lazy days at the beach.  </li>
            <li> It has really helped with eczema and combatting the cold weather and dry air.</li>
            <li> Be careful in the shower !!</li>
            <li> A previous reviewer mentioned that they didn&#x27;t even need to use lotion after using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  used  it less than two  weeks  </li>
            <li> complain&#x27;t about mess.  </li>
            <li> I had to stir it a little because the coconut oil separated a little.</li>
            <li> It takes just a little bit and your body, elbows, feet or</li>
            <li> The grit is a little courser than I like.</li>
            <li> Does leave shower floor a little oily but all oils do.</li>
            <li> But it dried out after 1st use</li>
            <li> may be because it&#x27;s 100%organic, it was a little hard to use.</li>
            <li> The sugar definitely exfoliates, but the toxic smell is frightening.</li>
            <li> I basically keep this container in the shower with a small spoon.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t look like the ingredients are mixed well in the container; difficult to remove product from jar.</li>
            <li> it is very heavy and</li>
            <li> My cupboards  are an array  of expensive  dry skin  products that do not  work.</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive</li>
            <li> I would give this product 5 stars except the coconut oil was so hard that it was difficult to scoop the prepackaged spoon out.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is addicted to this product.</li>
            <li> Needless to say when I saw this I had to have it.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to use in this state.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is coconut oil which coats the tub.</li>
            <li> product is a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I was WRONG!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely obsessed!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m sad that this product was so not what I hoped for and thought I&#x27;d share my experience in case it helps someone else!</li>
            <li> 34;how bad can it</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how slippery this product was</li>
            <li> I just wish Amazon would offer it with Prime again :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get better. Organic, nice gritty scrub, leaves your body with a light boiled moisturized feel. Just be careful you don&#x27;t slip in your tub or shower, but this is the best rescue for any dry skin. Used a Thone of different exfoliators, and this just leaves my skin feeling good. But you will have oil on your skin after the fact. It also is a rough grit so if you&#x27;re looking for a soft exfoliation, this may be too much.</li>
            <li> I just used this! my skin feels good. It feels fresh and cool!&lt;br /&gt;It has a tropical smell to it that reminds me of the beach. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend.</li>
            <li> may be because it&#x27;s 100%organic, it was a little hard to use. Also I found that the moisture come from the coconut doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!!  Smells delicious, is made without harmful ingredients and leaves my skin so soft and smooth.  My husband even uses it now and reminds me when it&#x27;s time to buy more.  :)</li>
            <li> The smell is lovely!! But it dried out after 1st use, I tried to add some water that doesn&#x27;t work, so I have nearly a full jar that I can&#x27;t use!!</li>
            <li> This is amazing. I have a small bottle of organic coconut oil that I use for moisturizing super dry parts of my skin and I love it. Needless to say when I saw this I had to have it.  The smell is like being on a tropical vacation.  It said right on the page it was 20 ounces, but I didn&#x27;t realize just how much that was until I saw the product.  A very generous amount of scrub for your money.  I would definitely recommend as either a gift or a great way to pamper yourself.  I don&#x27;t think there are softer or better smelling legs this side of the Mississippi!</li>
            <li> I would give this product 5 stars except the coconut oil was so hard that it was difficult to scoop the prepackaged spoon out. True coconut oil only melts in warm temps, so the product may mix together better after being heated. It is great to use in the winter because it will lubricate your skin better than any lotion. It smells wonderful and exfoliates as well. I would order it again.</li>
            <li> This is such a great exfoliator, it smells amazing and works great (even on your face). I love the coconut oil, and it is heavy on that. But, because of this it leaves your skin super moisturized, soft and smelling wonderful!</li>
            <li> Oh wow....first of all ladies, once you are over forty years of age, it is all about the cellular turnover. It slows down considerably and so BELIEVE me when I say, sugar and salt scrub should be used liberally. Now THIS stuff smells SOOOOOO heavenly if you like coconut and pineapple which I do. I did not know, first soak in a big bowl of warm water to melt the oil. Then rub this stuff on your face and chest and rest of body and be clean, scrubbed and off with the nasty old clingy cells and reveal the new baby skin!</li>
            <li> Great product that smells so good.  This is the third time ordering this product.</li>
            <li> When the product arrived there had been separation between the oils and salts. To even use it I&#x27;ve had to use a knife to break through and try and mix it all together again. The oils are great in the product but it takes forever to get the excess to dissolve and go down the drain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other scrubs before and usually thought they were &amp;#34;just OK.&amp;#34; The only reason I bought this was because of reviews I&#x27;d read about coconut oil and scrubs helping out with keratosis pilaris, and I&#x27;ve recently decided that I&#x27;ve had it with the &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; on my legs and upper arms getting in the way of my tank tops and sleeveless dresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is AMAZING!!! It really does smell like coconut and pineapple, feels nice to scrub with, doubles as shaving cream for super smooth legs (surprise!), and best of all, helped get rid of the bumps!!! I was so happy. I had literally been resigned to just having dotty, bumpy skin all my life. This scrub, in combination with the Exfoliator Loofah Sponge that I also found on Amazon, left me with smoother skin than I&#x27;ve ever had after JUST ONE SHOWER. A previous reviewer mentioned that they didn&#x27;t even need to use lotion after using this product. Now, if you&#x27;re at all like me, lotion is a must. Skipping lotion after a shower?? Welcome to ashy. But GET THIS--those reviews aren&#x27;t lying!!! This product gives you the exfoliation of the sugar scrub, and then locks in the moisture with incredibly emollient coconut oil. I literally pat dry and get dressed right out of the shower...no lotion necessary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should point out that there are two drawbacks: the main ingredient is coconut oil, so it&#x27;ll make your shower build up with oil/get slippery. Also, if you do choose to use this to shave, it will clog up your razor. Like, FAST. I wouldn&#x27;t try it with a razor that isn&#x27;t one of the disposable kind that you only use a couple times anyway. For skin this smooth, I couldn&#x27;t care less. I definitely will always keep this on hand from now on.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the coconut smell - it&#x27;s one of my favorites. The scrub itself works well and leaves my skin just as soft as can be.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I had to stir it a little because the coconut oil separated a little. But after using it..wow! I have a very smooth face. I use my clarisonic brush regularly..but the softness from this stuff was just amazing. I have very oily skin so I have to be very careful not to increase that production..this stuff works very well. I will be using this on my entire body. I think I have found my new staple!</li>
            <li> I love this product! Smells awesome! It takes just a little bit and your body, elbows, feet or wherever you like it extremely soft! I would buy again!  Great for winter dry skin!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells fantastic &amp; feels great on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I &#x27;ll buy this again</li>
            <li> Love this scrub!  The smell reminds me of being on vacation, which mentally prepares me for a great day!  As we age, our skin gets dry and cracked, but this wonderful scrub helps to combat the dry hands of time.  Living in a warm state, I don&#x27;t have the same solidification problem the previous posters have experienced.  In fact, I was a tad upset when it arrived because the lid was not tightly closed and some of the oil had leaked out into the packaging.  It was packed with an electronic piece of equipment, so I was relieved that the oil only saturated the cardboard and had not yet reached my other item.  At first, I was afraid that the shower would be too slippery after using it, but it wasn&#x27;t (very bizarre!).  I love how clean and soft I feel afterwards.  The gentle scrub helps to \\&quot;awake\\&quot; my skin and it improved the appearance immediately!  As an experiment, after I washed off the scrub, I decided to shave, sans soap (mainly because there&#x27;s no way you can \\&quot;soap up\\&quot; after you use this).  The results were amazing!  This was the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had!  I felt so young!  Additionally, the following day, I STILL didn&#x27;t need to shave... it was that close of a shave.    WARNING!  You may find your self subconsciously rubbing your skin... it&#x27;s that soft and smooth!  I just wish Amazon would offer it with Prime again :(</li>
            <li> I live in an area where the average temperature is in the 70s.  It is rock solid and hard to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> Great, great stuff.....worth the money!</li>
            <li> I cannot express how much I love this scrub.  I opened the tub and breathed in, and it was like being in Hawaii on a beach.  As one of the other reviewers said, the scrub is hardened, because as it says on the jar, organic coconut oil is a solid at room temperature.  At first this was upsetting because it is a pain to warm the jar up in a bowl full of water, however, after I did it, I was thrilled.  The warm oil and soft scrub polished my skin so well it glowed the entire day.  The texture of the sugar is so fine, it doesn&#x27;t feel abrasive like other scrubs.  I cannot say enough good about this scrub, I don&#x27;t think I will ever use another.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, Scrub is easy to apply and rinse off, not at all harsh, and it leaves the skin well moisturized without feeling greasy.  Skin is really soft after use. I will buy this product again.  Worth the price. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other products out there on the market this one penetrates well, leaving your skin very soft.The scent (pineapple coconut) is also very nice.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful product this is.  The scrubbing action and beautiful aroma is exception.  I will be purchasing this on Subscribe and Save!</li>
            <li> This is a super Great body scrub. It smells awesome. Skin feels like velvet after you use it.</li>
            <li> good body scrub not for face.. my face is so sensitive.. so im not use any scrub.. but this is all natural ingredient.. good for body..</li>
            <li> I decided  that I&#x27;d  try  to work harder  on my ultra dry  skin with this  product, not  believing I&#x27;d  have  success. I was WRONG! I&#x27;ve  used  it less than two  weeks  and I&#x27;m  delighted  that my dry skin  has nearly  recovered.  The delightful  fresh  fragrance lingers  gently  on my skin  and in my bathroom.  I&#x27;ve  had compliments  and questions  about  what  fragrance am I wearing. The RN that gives  me B-12 injectons  will  be  gifted  with  my  second  order  of this  amazing  product. I&#x27;m  sold  on it forever. If it can  revive my skin  I have to declare  it miracle-like. My cupboards  are an array  of expensive  dry skin  products that do not  work.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, all natural, organic, non-toxic, makes your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Scrub had solidified upon arrival.  Difficult to use in this state. The smell is nice but not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> This was something I so longed to love after missing the Islands during this long, cold Winter! Was it the aluminum seal on the jar that caused the scrub to smell toxic? I so intensely cannot imagine putting that on my skin again. I&#x27;m not sure the MFG # means date of expiration, but if so, it expired several months ago. Is that the problem. The sugar definitely exfoliates, but the toxic smell is frightening.</li>
            <li> This polish is magical. I&#x27;m soooo happy I found this stuff. I love it so much.. the smell is awesome, my skin is so soft after using it. I bought some for my daughter for Christmas because she was using all mine and she loves it so much. I love all Fiji products. Killer price on Amazon too because this stuff is super exspensive anywhere else.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is addicted to this product. She smells soooo good when she uses it after a shower. Her skin smells wonderful and feels so smooth using this polish.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this product, you feel like you are sinking into a Pina Coolada.  It feels nice on your skin, a little oily but it drys into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> This scrub is fantastic; I have tried a bunch of different scrubs, and I make my own a lot, but it gets really boring if you always use the same one, so I bought this to try. It has a fantastic smell and feel, and does a great job exfoliating gently. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely obsessed! It feels fantastic gliding on, does a good job of exfoliating and moisturizing, and stays silky on your skin for hours afterwards. The smell is absolutely divine. I love the smell of coconut as well as pineapple and together (hello, pi&amp;ntilde;a colada) they&#x27;re heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Texas and my jar arrived in quite a liquid state, so be careful when opening it for the first time if you do too. Soon after, the contents settled into a semi-liquid state that&#x27;s easy to scoop onto your body. If you live in a cold climate you may have to warm up the jar as the coconut oil can solidify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite a good value for the price. Just be careful because it can make your shower floor quite slippery.</li>
            <li> Great exfoliator!  I love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel.  I keep it in my shower so by the time I have washed my hair and I am ready to exfoliate, the coconut oil has already warmed up and it is no longer solidified.  It does make the bottom of my shower kind of slick, so be careful after use.  I don&#x27;t even have to use lotion after showing because the coconut oil is so moisturizing--not just oily.  Just rub it in when you get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I have pretty large breasts, something I did not have until recently. Using this around my cleavage has done miracles for my skin I didn&#x27;t think were possible. I don&#x27;t love the smell, but everything else about this is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful but very oily. Be careful in the shower !!</li>
            <li> Absolutely great product overall. It leaves my skin feeling very soft and moisturized. Plus the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my skin ultra soft and it smells fantastic!!! Summer in a jar! If your normally put lotion on after you shower it is not needed if you use this product!</li>
            <li> Smells great. Feels good on skin.</li>
            <li> I used this for about 2 months and I like it initially. Over time it began to actually dry out my skin. It is also extremely oily and leaves alot of residue in the shower. It is also pretty rough compared to other scrubs.</li>
            <li> Good, this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. My skin feels silky smooth</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely wonderful. Love love this stuff! I&#x27;m a licensed Esthetician and I will be using this and recommending it to my clients.  Not only does it smell great, it feels great and leaves your skin so smooth and soft and with yummy scent!</li>
            <li> The sugar doesn&#x27;t  dissolve quickly like with other scrubs. Love that you can massage in the oils afterwards for a smooth finish. Exfoliated off a rough spot I had developed on my ankle form sitting on the floor with my toddler all the time. Will buy again once I run out.</li>
            <li> Works and smells nice. Leave the area soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Love the scent. The grit is a little courser than I like.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my arms for my Keratosis pilaris and it has been great! It takes a couple weeks to see results, but by far the best thing I have used for it. It smells great and I even use it on my face too as an exfoliator. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> This scrub is amazing. It is all natural, smells wonderful and really works.</li>
            <li> I use this after I cleanse my body. I scrub it on then lightly rinse and shave. Works great Super mousturizing! Doesn&#x27;t come in the container pictured and doesn&#x27;t smell of pineapple but still a great buy I love that It is organic. I live in Alaska and our weather makes our skin sO dry! Really has helped.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!!  A lot of people complain that the scrub is solid and takes too long to soften up.  Well, if you know anything about coconut oil.......you should already know this people.  I basically keep this container in the shower with a small spoon.  By the time I&#x27;m ready to use this scrub (I take very hot showers, about 15 minutes), it&#x27;s soft enough to where I can spoon out some of the scrub and start using on my body.  I love the smell - very tropical.  Personally, I smell pineapple with a hit of coconut so if you don&#x27;t like the pineapple smell, I would not recommend.  For me.....LOVE IT!!  I just wish the smell would last longer though.  I&#x27;ve only had it for about 2 weeks and have used it 3 times.  I cannot believe the difference of my skin.  Very soft.  The days I use this product, I do not need to use any other lotions.  It is a little expensive but I would highly recommend and will definitely be purchasing again when it goes on sale.</li>
            <li> This scrub is absolutely the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It leaves your skin so polished you don&#x27;t need lotion or oil afterwards. It smells wonderful and the 20 oz&#x27;s will definitely go along way. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get on here and write a review because I was so taken back by how great it works. I normally buy my scrubs at sephora or dillards but I will never again. I will only be buying this because nothing really compares to how wonderful it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. smells wonderful and you get a lot for your money. I have no complaints, because it is that good :-)</li>
            <li> this was just what i new it would be and stood up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;It was an easy buy.</li>
            <li> Great for dry winter skin, &amp; summer sun &amp; pool chemical re-moisturizer. Nice beach-tropical fragrance!  Exfoliates and leaves skin with moisture and glow.  Great price and wonderful product!  Warm product by submerging in warm to make product easier to dip into,  A little go a long way.  Wipe out shower &amp; tub to avoid slips :-0</li>
            <li> This scrub really works!  Makes your skin incredibly soft and smells great!  I would highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  The sugar seems superfine as the scrubbing agent.&lt;br /&gt;Getting more.  So good for feet &amp; the rest of the body!&lt;br /&gt;Not so fancy jar, but what a surprise inside.</li>
            <li> Not thick like others I&#x27;ve used before. Smell not as great as others have stated. Not worth the price for sure.</li>
            <li> I like  this.  Wonderful fragrance.  I see complain&#x27;t about mess.  Nothing that can&#x27;t be washed  off at end of  shower.  Does a great  job of exfoliating and makes my dry skin feel  great</li>
            <li> So I always read the Amazon reviews on a product before I buy and I did read that this product caused the bathtub to be very slippery but I thought &amp;#34;how bad can it be?&amp;#34;  Well, I should have listened!  I was shocked at how slippery this product was and I couldn&#x27;t even step out of the bathtub without my husbands help...it was that dangerous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I didn&#x27;t like the way my skin felt after using this product...it is very heavy and it felt like I had just rolled in a tub of butter.  Ugh!  Even the fragrance wasn&#x27;t what I had hoped for...it did have a slight coconut smell but not nearly enough for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m sad that this product was so not what I hoped for and thought I&#x27;d share my experience in case it helps someone else!</li>
            <li> The smell is very strong. It actually gives me headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, perhaps because it&#x27;s organic - I don&#x27;t know, but it leaves an oily, sticky residue on your skin that does not wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want the coconut oil, but I want it to wash off.</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas and it is awesome. My skin feels incredible. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Wow! My entire family likes this product so much that I signed up for Subscribe and Save to get a new one monthly (with three users, we go through a jar a month).  It has really helped with eczema and combatting the cold weather and dry air. I prefer a sugar polish over a salt polish, and I appreciate that this product is organic! Thus, I feel good about children being able to utilize this as well.  This is the first winter where I havent felt the need to use lotion!  And, for those who shave, I use this scrub before-hand, rinse it off, then I can shave without the need for any shave cream, lather, soap, or any other medium to keep from razor burn associated with &amp;#34;dry shaving.&amp;#34; Plus, the fact that it exfoliates, I have found I have a much closer shave! I have nothing but praise for this product.  I like it so much I am thinking of giving it to extended family members and close friends as gifts!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scrub!  The scent is divine, and the scrub leaves my skin so soft, smooth, and glowing.  After using a similar product for years, I was so happy to find this at less than half the price!  I highly recommend thus scrub!  Heavenly!  Oh, and I really appreciate that it is made of all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> smells great, skin feels good after using. but it doesn&#x27;t look like the ingredients are mixed well in the container; difficult to remove product from jar.</li>
            <li> As long as you are not allergic to coconut this is heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;Safe ingredients, yummy product, &amp; delicious scent!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This sugar scrub is quite possibly the best scrub I have ever used.  Not only does it smell fabulous but it really does a great job of exfoliating &amp; softening the skin.  I always buy sugar scrubs searching for &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;.  I am happy to say I&#x27;ve finally found it.  Don&#x27;t even think twice about buying this product.  It&#x27;s so worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Great product with a delicious fragrance.  It leaves the skin incredible soft and smooth that no cream is needed afterwards. I use it each time I take a shower even on my face, the fragrance is incredible.</li>
            <li> Think pineapple/coconut flavored vegetable shortening... that&#x27;s what happens when this scrub is exposed to temperatures lower than 76 degrees.  It SOLIDIFIES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like you get a much better product from any of the bath and body line, or even Tree Hut -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a disappointment.  I don&#x27;t want to have to scrub my bathtub out every time I use this but you have to or you will slip all over the place next time you shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after drying off, my feet were still slippery on the tile floors.  Of course they warn you on the label about the oil making surfaces slippery, but it doesn&#x27;t take away the fact that it&#x27;s a safety problem.  Regardless of age, who wants to fall in their tub????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love body products but this one is not the right one for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars for the concept and the timely processing of my order and the nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I use it in the shower every morning and it makes my skin feel soft and smooth, eliminating the winter flakey skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a wonderful product in many ways. It smells great and made her skin really nice. Unfortunately, it is coconut oil which coats the tub. Not only does that make it a slip and fall hazard, but it requires actual detergent scrubbing to remove it.</li>
            <li> My skin was dry from hot baths &amp; sunning &amp; this polish did the trick.  It exfoliated the dry skin and left it feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This is heavenly! Leaves my skin so smooth and soft. I love it! My teen daughters love it too! Smells like a pi&amp;ntilde;a colada! Does leave shower floor a little oily but all oils do. Just pat dry after and no other moisturizer needed after this! Planning on giving one to my mother in law for her birthday!</li>
            <li> Love this scrub!  It smells divine and makes my skin silky.  Honestly, I don&#x27;t have to lotion up after my shower, it&#x27;s that emollient. Wonderful stuff. I have it on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this stuff !</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this sugar polish.  I use it in the shower and it leaves my skin extremely soft and my entire bathroom smells delightful for a long while after.  I plan on buying these as Christmas gifts for family.  There is one ingredient on the list that is not listed as organic, I forgot which one it was but just a heads up that this product is not 100% organic, although all of the other ingredients are organic.</li>
            <li> this scrub smells so good and leaves your body feeling smooth and gives the skin a nice, healthy and natural glow. I&#x27;ve used it a lot and my boyfriend loves it that he started using it as well..fun and smells so yummy!</li>
            <li> I Absolutely love this product. It smells great, feels wonderful and works great to keep my skin smooth and exfoliated. Love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in feb and received the jar with an expiration date dec 2014.</li>
            <li> This product smells so good it makes my mouth water :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels great on your skin during and after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful because when it says it&#x27;s exfoliating, it&#x27;s no joke.  I have to very gently rub this on me, as it&#x27;s very rough otherwise.  It leaves a \\&quot;film\\&quot; on you after you rinse, which I was kind of thrown off about at first, but I decided I like it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost a lot, but I only use it once in awhile.  I would buy this again and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but so far after using this product for about a week I am absolutely in love with it! The scent is amazing and it really makes me feel like I am on a tropical island. It is also great at exfoliating and makes my skin feel so soft! I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for an all natural scrub!</li>
            <li> I love this product and leaves your skin so soft and smells wonderfully.  I use on my legs before shaving and it helps them stay smooth.  Wish it was a bit cheaper, but still use 2-3 times a week</li>
            <li> This is great, the classic pineapple coconut scent that reminds you of the beach.  Good combination of oil and sugar, some grit, some slide.  I got this to use at the shower at the gym, where they are washed out each day - I wouldn&#x27;t use this type of product at home because of the (advertised) issue of oily residue.  Used in the right place, it&#x27;s great, a wonderful post work out treat!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing!  It reminds me of a luscious summer dessert, or long lazy days at the beach.  The sugar is great for sloughing off any roughness, and the coconut oil leaves my skin so moist and dewy that I find it&#x27;s not even necessary to follow up with lotion.  It&#x27;s THAT good.  Coconut oil is so great for your skin, and this organic product is a wonderful alternative to all those chemical-laden lotions and bath products out there.  A word of caution:  the shower can get really slippery after using this so be careful, watch your step,  and warn hubby too!</li>
