            <li> Awesome color, great formula. I love China Glaze!</li>
            <li> The color is noce. But it doesn&#x27;t look anything like the picture does, which sort of bummed me out. But owell.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed once i recieved this product. Not at all the same color shown on here. It ended up being a dull baby blue.</li>
            <li> This color is nothing like what it shows online.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color.. Love it!</li>
            <li> Not as neon as I was hoping</li>
            <li> Color is exact. Lasts as long as anything that&#x27;s not gel.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a bright Aqua like color. It is pretty drab. Not at ALL like the color shown.</li>
            <li> Color isn&#x27;t as bright as it appears on the screen, although still a nice color.</li>
            <li> Color isn&#x27;t the same as picture</li>
            <li> Like this polish, was on time but the color is not as bright as pictured.</li>
            <li> O my god this is such a pretty bright blue it looks just like the picture i have it on now make it really pop put on a base coat of white first i&#x27;ve had this on a whole week with no chipping love it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful !&lt;br /&gt;(Wish it was a bit thicker)</li>
            <li> I exspected a really bright blue like the picture, but it is darker than I exspected. Happy with the quality of the polish though. But I wish It was as bright as the picture.</li>
            <li> This color is one of my ultimate favorite blues. I have a lot of blue in my collection since it is my favorite color but the formula on this one is top notch. Perfect for nail art or just every day wear. I enjoyed the giver collection but this baby is the best shade in the bunch.</li>
            <li> this color looked nothing like the picture when it arrived.  It&#x27;s just a dull regular turquoiseish blue, not pretty.  The advertising is deceptive.  You think you are getting a carribean blue.  But that&#x27;s not the case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the entire the giver collection. The polishes have a better formula than most china glaze ones. If you like sky blue you have to get this shade. It is very bright and has a great formula. I really love it.</li>
            <li> Not as pictured. Totally muddy, grayish and not a bright blue polish. If you are looking for a bright, clean, turquoise this is NOT it! So disappointed to get this ugly blueish color.</li>
            <li> The color is not as flashy as the pictures show.  However, I still liked it.  It&#x27;s the 2 swatches on the left on my posted picture, natural light on a cloudy day.</li>
            <li> I think this color is beautiful but it&#x27;s not opaque enough for a quick paint job. I loved For Audrey because it was so opaque the furt coat. This one not so much. I also feel dry time is just too long for my personal preference. I also bought the shade Salsa by China Glaze and am smitten by it. One coat looks fantastic and dries very quickly. However this color is lovely and if you&#x27;re patient enough to allow it to dry and apply enough coats it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this color but it is so sheer. I needed 3 coats for it look decent. It&#x27;s not a good coverage and when you apply it, it leaves streaks. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> A lot lighter blue than in the picture. More cloud or baby blue than the neon turquoise I was going for.</li>
