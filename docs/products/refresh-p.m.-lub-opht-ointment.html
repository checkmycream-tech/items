    <ol>
            <li>Best for eye floaters</li>
            <li>great product recommended by ophthalmologist!</li>
            <li>this is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT SERVICE GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>so I am happy to recommend them.</li>
            <li>works OK, but liked B&amp;L Muro 128 better</li>
            <li>The best for my dry eyes.</li>
            <li>These are delicate and bright - a warm bright - and just what I envisioned for the area I was decorating.  </li>
            <li>I am allergic to preservatives and this ointment is preservative free.  </li>
            <li>Refresh products have been problem free</li>
            <li>Great product for dry eyes at bed time</li>
            <li>Great to assist in dry eye condition...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for dry eyes, and I often it during the days also if I&#x27;m at home.</li>
            <li>In that case, dear company, why don&#x27;t you say that up front - on the box!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to anyone seeking to patronize Allergen, just consider there are companies out there with superior products who are actually consumer friendly.</li>
            <li>It would be worth the hassle if the product really worked, but I didn&#x27;t notice that eyes were any more moist in the morning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product for people with dry eyes to use at night .  </li>
            <li>Only one was good for my sensitive eyes, but hey, there are good products by other brands out there!</li>
            <li>Better than the generic versions.</li>
            <li>Your eyes are very important, you want to be very careful with them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;One thing I would love is if they could make these connect-able so two or three sets can be strung together for larger areas without the long, cord-only run between where the lights start and the plug is.</li>
            <li>And no, I do not mean Theratears, having had the same experience with them, of grittiness to my sensitive eyes, and non-refund.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I thought i&#x27;d try this one (bought locally) since it stated it&#x27;s for Dry Sensitive Eyes.&lt;br</li>

            <li> It takes some getting used to as you cannot see clearly with the product in your eyes, but you wake up with eyes that are not all dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That dept. then bombarded me with a long list of questions, after which she stated it&#x27;s their policy not to refund.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Especially when I am getting sleepy or tired, this helps restore the oils our eyes, naturally create!</li>
            <li> However, it works extremely well, my medications dry out my eyes!</li>
            <li> Use this every night and it cuts down on my use of other products.  </li>
            <li> Until my Dr, recommended this, I was not aware of a ointment for your eyes!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Imagine my disgust when I phone Allergen hoping for a refund, only to run into a complex phone menu (ugh!)</li>
            <li> and then when it is in, I must go to bed right away because it is impossible to see with this stuff in my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Like all ointments it is not suitable for daytime use because it blurs vision.</li>
            <li> It is hard to use because it is so thick.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed at the different prices.</li>
            <li> Broke out into awful hives, eyes glued shut.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Use this every night and it cuts down on my use of other products.  It is a bit gooey, so only use it at bedtime after you read.</li>
            <li> These are delicate and bright - a warm bright - and just what I envisioned for the area I was decorating.  I wanted to check out one before I bought 5 sets but bummed b/c now they are sold out!&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would love is if they could make these connect-able so two or three sets can be strung together for larger areas without the long, cord-only run between where the lights start and the plug is.</li>
            <li> Yet despite the irritation, Allergan does not send refund! I&#x27;ve tried several eye products from Allergen. Only one was good for my sensitive eyes, but hey, there are good products by other brands out there! Anyway, I thought i&#x27;d try this one (bought locally) since it stated it&#x27;s for Dry Sensitive Eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, it was like putting in Petroleum jelly, causing my lids to stick together, and after a short while, my eyes actually felt gritty &amp; uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine my disgust when I phone Allergen hoping for a refund, only to run into a complex phone menu (ugh!) then finally an operator got on who then transferred me to what I believe was the medical dept. That dept. then bombarded me with a long list of questions, after which she stated it&#x27;s their policy not to refund. \\&quot;Oh yes? In that case, dear company, why don&#x27;t you say that up front - on the box!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to anyone seeking to patronize Allergen, just consider there are companies out there with superior products who are actually consumer friendly. And no, I do not mean Theratears, having had the same experience with them, of grittiness to my sensitive eyes, and non-refund.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry eyes at bed time</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT SERVICE GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li> Great to assist in dry eye condition...</li>
            <li> I use this nightly. works well. No complaints. Better than the generic versions. Lasts a long time. I like it</li>
            <li> Until my Dr, recommended this, I was not aware of a ointment for your eyes! However, it works extremely well, my medications dry out my eyes! Especially when I am getting sleepy or tired, this helps restore the oils our eyes, naturally create! This helps keep your eyes from over tearing up, has our eyes try to overcompensate for the lost oils? ( what my Dr. told me??)</li>
            <li> Best for eye floaters</li>
            <li> Great product. Disappointed at the different prices. Thought I was getting a larger amount of product but it was the same amount. Shame on me for not knowing the amount.</li>
            <li> works OK, but liked B&amp;L Muro 128 better</li>
            <li> great product recommended by ophthalmologist!</li>
            <li> It is hard to use because it is so thick.  It does not want to stick to my eye and then when it is in, I must go to bed right away because it is impossible to see with this stuff in my eyes.  It would be worth the hassle if the product really worked, but I didn&#x27;t notice that eyes were any more moist in the morning.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to preservatives and this ointment is preservative free.  It&#x27;s a good product for people with dry eyes to use at night .  Like all ointments it is not suitable for daytime use because it blurs vision.</li>
            <li> My ophthalmologist recommended Refresh P.M. ointment because it doesn&#x27;t contain any preservatives.  It&#x27;s great for dry eyes, and I often it during the days also if I&#x27;m at home.</li>
            <li> The best for my dry eyes.</li>
            <li> Already reviewed.  Again???</li>
            <li> Your eyes are very important, you want to be very careful with them.  For those who have problems with eyes that do not close all the way at night this is an excellent product.  It takes some getting used to as you cannot see clearly with the product in your eyes, but you wake up with eyes that are not all dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Refresh products have been problem free so I am happy to recommend them.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t say that lanolin is an ingredient. Broke out into awful hives, eyes glued shut. Works well if you aren&#x27;t allergic, otherwise stick with another brand like B&amp;L.</li>
