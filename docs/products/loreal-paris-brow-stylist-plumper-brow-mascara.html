            <li>THE BEST!!!!  </li>
            <li>so I re purchased the lighter shade and its perfect</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT!!  </li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>IT LOOKS SOOOO GOOD!</li>
            <li>Lol.</li>
            <li>If you have thinning brows, this is a great product for you to try.  </li>
            <li>If you are not born with good eyebrows, L&#x27;Oreal Brow Plumper will help&lt;br /&gt;nature</li>
            <li>Yeah, this is a good product.  </li>
            <li>and this is a good color for me.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just as good</li>
            <li>Makes my brows full and with great shape!</li>
            <li>and I am very glad this is the one I got, this is recommended by a youtuber beauty guru that i sometimes watch, and so i put my faith into this and purchased it.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>:) a great boon to those with sparse eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I was very, VERY pleased at how effective this is.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Benefit Gimme Brow until now, and decided to try this after reading rave reviews - I love it!  </li>
            <li>How glad I am that I did!  </li>
            <li>its great, its easy, it stays....</li>
            <li>Amazing product..keeps my brows in place with a hint of tint</li>
            <li>Kind of like mascara.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to apply in this form.</li>
            <li>color and it was perfect and natural.</li>
            <li>I think though that eyebrow dyeing might be the best solution for the most natural look and color</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know how I could be more pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Those being said, I still think it&#x27;s a good product, specially since I think as I keep using it</li>
            <li>Love it when I just want a quick application before the gym or something when I&#x27;m not looking to really fill in perfectly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>This guy does both, but better.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;is more noticable than the brown.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I like it much better than my brow powder and brush.</li>
            <li>With that said, using this eyebrow mascara helps to fill in areas where I want more eyebrow definition.</li>
            <li>Still, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It would also help if they redesigned the applicator to be either angled or to resemble more of a ball shape, because this would make it easier to apply to the brows without getting it where you don&#x27;t want it.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>It separates your browns so that each precious hair counts.</li>
            <li>I love the color and the way this product styles</li>
            <li>Love this for my eye brows...</li>
            <li>In my opinion it is even better than Lancome.  </li>
            <li>This goes on good the first time.</li>
            <li>This has became my easy go to eyebrow routine</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic.</li>
            <li>So, I use it light</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more an ash-brown color, if you have thick eyebrow hair I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for you, however, to wear it best</li>
            <li>Great product...grooms my eyebrows quickly and the color is just enough to fill in my brows.</li>
            <li>help restore some of the original texture and beauty to them.  </li>
            <li>Thus, you need to make sure you wipe the applicator on the edge of the container to ensure that you don&#x27;t get too much at first,</li>
            <li>Excellent -- I was shocked at what a great job this does...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit tricky to coat the hair and not get it on the skin around, specially in the sparse areas, where I need the product the most.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but it takes a steady hand to apply.</li>
            <li>I love it and use it pretty much every day.</li>
            <li>It gives a natural appearance and a more youthful look for a fading brow that comes with age.  </li>
            <li>Avon used to carry a product similar to this, but they stopped making it, so I was thrilled to see this come out.</li>
            <li>I have to use a brush after application to separate them to make it look more natural.</li>
            <li>it got all over my brow, but now that i got used to the amount it is perfect, the brush is about half the size of a regular mascara wand</li>
            <li>More like plain ole mascara, unlike a better product produced by Lancome.</li>
            <li>Smudges easily when initially applied, but dries rather quickly.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a eyebrow gel</li>
            <li>In fact, I now wipe almost all of it off against the edge and if I need more, I&#x27;ll just dip back into the excess remaining on the lip of the container.</li>
            <li>(See my first encounter with this product).</li>
            <li>If you apply it backwards first, and then forwards, you can intensify the effect.</li>
            <li>Really does &amp;#34;plum&amp;#34; your brow!</li>
            <li>Use sparingly at first.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday natural makeup.</li>
            <li>I am older, maybe it&#x27;s fine for young girls who still have their brows.</li>
            <li>It lasts most of the day (depending on how long your day is)</li>
            <li>but this went on super natural</li>
            <li>The Mascara sized wands do NOT work for regular eyebrows unless yours are huge and bushy.</li>
            <li>I really like this brow mascara.</li>
            <li>, it does thicken your brow, however i can&#x27;t say much about lengthening though.</li>
            <li>but they show up much lighter on the eyelash than the brow for some reason, and</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have thin eyebrows from waxing so this was a great find until i can grow out my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>so much that they almost vanish on my face.</li>
            <li>But too much product is on the brush when you take it out of the tube, and that gets on the skin around my brow.</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>I actually like it better than the Lancome products since that one was very cloudy and had a whipped or fluffy appearance whereas this one is more clear.  </li>
            <li>It looks natural and not fake</li>
            <li>I particularly like the brush</li>
            <li>I found and used a product very similar to this by Lancome called &amp;#34;Mod√©le Sourcils Brow Expert&amp;#34; (sells for $25) for several years but after becoming a mother I just couldn&#x27;t justify the expense.  </li>
            <li>This is quick and easy for natural makeup, just give yourself a few tries to get it right.</li>
            <li>looks very natural and makes my brows look neater</li>
            <li>It looks very natural and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>of course it doesn&#x27;t keep the curl on my lash so this will just have to stay as a brow mascara only, but yes it does do everything it is advertised for, my brow is definitely more defined and sharp looking.</li>
            <li>BUT if you go slow and stay neat, it really gives a more natural brow look.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t clump or go on heavy at all.</li>
            <li>Make it simple, if you have long but thin hair, it works perfectly, but if the eyebrow is short (left/right direction), it does not help a lot, and you still need eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li>but once you do it a few times it feels totally fine.</li>
            <li>I needed a couple of tries before I got the right amount on my brows but that may be because this is a totally new concept to me.  </li>
            <li>It makes your brows look fuller and offers some hold, as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not using it much yet because I worry about summer sweat possibly causing it to run - it&#x27;s not waterproof.</li>
            <li>Lasts all day and looks natural.</li>
            <li>Now, keep in mind that I&#x27;m all about natural makeup and look.</li>
            <li>The smaller wand is so much easier to use and the color lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Covers completely.  </li>
            <li>Much bigger tube, very natural (you have to use a light hand to apply and just add layers), and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>I have black eyebrows, but this dark brown works nicely.</li>
            <li>I love the small brush!</li>
            <li>With pencil thin eyebrows out and fuller more natural eyebrows in fashion I needed a way to fill out my brows.  </li>
            <li>As a Black woman I needed something more dark.  </li>
            <li>but you have to be careful to make sure there isn&#x27;t too much on the brush before applying because it will stick your eyebrow hairs together to make them look even worse.</li>
            <li>A light touch fills in aging, sparse brows and covers a few grey hairs.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and can usually only wear Cover Girl or Almay eye makeup</li>
            <li>This does not give a hint of fullness on bare skin where brows have been plucked over years.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s less product in the tube, it will get easier to apply and my first problem goes away.</li>
            <li>I used Benefit&#x27;s Gimme Brow for a while, but at $23 for a tiny tube, it seemed silly to keep using, so I looked for a dupe, and I found something even better!  </li>
            <li>I was using smart bro but for half the price you can get this</li>
            <li>It only takes a little to work so the first time i applied it</li>
            <li>, I would liken it to Benjamin Moore Mocha Brown straight out of the tube, and it dries slightly</li>
            <li>I have to wipe it off a bit first, which is the bother of a second step and seems like a waste of product.</li>
            <li>I can use the wand to shape and comb the arch of my brow and even draw a little more brow on at the outside corners where I have very few hairs.  </li>
            <li>Very nice I have dark hair but the dark one was too dramatic</li>
            <li>have liked using clear mascara in the past to both tame my eyebrows as well as with them a little punch of color after applying foundation.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different &amp;#34;name&amp;#34; brand brow plumper/color and this one works good.&lt;br</li>

            <li> a little thicker, stiffer and darker than expected</li>

            <li> The gel is quite thick, so I would last all day.  </li>
            <li> You would think the shade medium to dark is going to be a bit lighter to serve both as a medium shade for brunettes and as a dark shade for people with black hair.</li>

            <li> I have dark brown hair and almost black brows</li>

            <li> In fact, it does its job a little</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> its great, its easy, it stays.... only complaint is it is a bit dark.  i usually pat with a tissue after application.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but it takes a steady hand to apply.</li>
            <li> I really like this brow mascara. It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t clump or go on heavy at all. I&#x27;m glad I tried it. Will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a eyebrow gel and I am very glad this is the one I got, this is recommended by a youtuber beauty guru that i sometimes watch, and so i put my faith into this and purchased it. The color i got is dark brown, i do have black hair but this went on super natural, it does thicken your brow, however i can&#x27;t say much about lengthening though. It only takes a little to work so the first time i applied it it got all over my brow, but now that i got used to the amount it is perfect, the brush is about half the size of a regular mascara wand, i tried applying this on my eyelash as well but they show up much lighter on the eyelash than the brow for some reason, and of course it doesn&#x27;t keep the curl on my lash so this will just have to stay as a brow mascara only, but yes it does do everything it is advertised for, my brow is definitely more defined and sharp looking.</li>
            <li> looks very natural and makes my brows look neater</li>
            <li> With pencil thin eyebrows out and fuller more natural eyebrows in fashion I needed a way to fill out my brows.  The plumper works by thickening your existing eyebrows making them look fuller, just like eyelash mascara.  I needed a couple of tries before I got the right amount on my brows but that may be because this is a totally new concept to me.  I prefer of the brow plumper over eyebrow pencils, which look too drawn, or eyebrow powders that don&#x27;t stay in place or work with your existing brows.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this stuff. I&#x27;ve always been put off by things like brow pencils, Dipbrow, brow shadow kits - it just seems like a lot of pointless work for eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have liked using clear mascara in the past to both tame my eyebrows as well as with them a little punch of color after applying foundation. This guy does both, but better. It&#x27;s a little weird to use the first few times, because it is almost exactly like mascara. I was not at all used to the sensation of having wet, thick, cold stuff on my eyebrows that I had to wait to dry - but once you do it a few times it feels totally fine.</li>
            <li> This product is the best for great looking eyebrows!</li>
            <li> Excellent -- I was shocked at what a great job this does... I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s too dark at all as some have said, I would liken it to Benjamin Moore Mocha Brown straight out of the tube, and it dries slightly darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Anastasia Dipbrow to fill in some of the sparse areas of my brows and then go over it with this. It looks very natural and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It grooms your brows too, except for totally wayward hairs. I give it a thumbs up and will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work well on brows that have areas of sparse growth. It&#x27;s difficult to add color to these areas without putting too much product on the fuller areas of the brow. Makeup remover is needed to neaten the application, which appears too dark and heavy to be natural.</li>
            <li> when you brush it on it gets clumpy. would not buy again</li>
            <li> I have thin eyebrows from waxing so this was a great find until i can grow out my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Makes my brows full and with great shape!</li>
            <li> If you have thinning or oper plucked eyebrows like I do, this product&lt;br /&gt;will help restore some of the original texture and beauty to them.  Also,&lt;br /&gt;in between hair coloring, the eyebrow seems to grow in faster, and the grey color&lt;br /&gt;is more noticable than the brown.  This product remedies this unattractive feature.&lt;br /&gt;I love it. If you are not born with good eyebrows, L&#x27;Oreal Brow Plumper will help&lt;br /&gt;nature out a bit!!</li>
            <li> Great product...grooms my eyebrows quickly and the color is just enough to fill in my brows.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and can usually only wear Cover Girl or Almay eye makeup but this works for me. I like it much better than my brow powder and brush. I am brunette with red hues.</li>
            <li> Runny product that clogs pores! Buy the brow drama by maybeline instead.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why the word &amp;#34;plumper&amp;#34; is in the description. With that said, using this eyebrow mascara helps to fill in areas where I want more eyebrow definition. Smudges easily when initially applied, but dries rather quickly. I have black eyebrows, but this dark brown works nicely. You cannot tell where I have it on unless, of course, you&#x27;re inches from my face and staring. Lol. Within 30-45 seconds after it dries, I use an eyebrow brush to help blend it in. If I make a mistake, I use a QTip to wipe off.</li>
            <li> More like plain ole mascara, unlike a better product produced by Lancome.</li>
            <li> A light touch fills in aging, sparse brows and covers a few grey hairs. Pleased with purchase for price as previous purchase of other brand contained very small amount of product with cheaper brush.</li>
            <li> Yeah, this is a good product.  It gives a natural appearance and a more youthful look for a fading brow that comes with age.  I think though that eyebrow dyeing might be the best solution for the most natural look and color that&#x27;s there even when not wearing makeup.  Still, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> IT LOOKS SOOOO GOOD! adds volume to brow while keeping its shape</li>
            <li> I use this as an extra to my eyebrow pencil. What the pencil doesn&#x27;t cover well, this does. I don&#x27;t use it alone because I like to smudge in the pencil a bit to enhance my thin brows. But this covers those little grays you don&#x27;t want to pull out. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> a little thicker, stiffer and darker than expected</li>
            <li> This product definitely does what it says. It makes your brows look fuller and offers some hold, as well. In fact, it does its job a little *too* well, because if you touch the peach fuzz hairs above or below your brow line, it will darken and thicken them. Thus, you need to make sure you wipe the applicator on the edge of the container to ensure that you don&#x27;t get too much at first, lest you get a Joan Crawford look. In fact, I now wipe almost all of it off against the edge and if I need more, I&#x27;ll just dip back into the excess remaining on the lip of the container. It would also help if they redesigned the applicator to be either angled or to resemble more of a ball shape, because this would make it easier to apply to the brows without getting it where you don&#x27;t want it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more an ash-brown color, if you have thick eyebrow hair I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for you, however, to wear it best you should use eyebrow shadow then apply it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite hard to apply, clumpy and messy</li>
            <li> It is darker than I expected, but it works well with my black eyebrows. Very easy to apply in this form. I&#x27;m not using it much yet because I worry about summer sweat possibly causing it to run - it&#x27;s not waterproof. I hope to update this fall/winter season.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the brand I usually buy.</li>
            <li> I love this and I will definitely purchase it again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> THE BEST!!!!  I used Benefit&#x27;s Gimme Brow for a while, but at $23 for a tiny tube, it seemed silly to keep using, so I looked for a dupe, and I found something even better!  Much bigger tube, very natural (you have to use a light hand to apply and just add layers), and long lasting.  Booyah!</li>
            <li> makes my brows look fuller and they stay groomed all day!</li>
            <li> Too gunky and unnatural looking. I threw it away.</li>
            <li> If you have thinning brows, this is a great product for you to try.  I am in my late 50&#x27;s and bought it to help fill in a few areas that have no hair and color the few gray brow hairs I have gotten.  I was very, VERY pleased at how effective this is.  It also keeps those unruly brow hairs in line all day.  Great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this. It&#x27;s almost a dupe for Benefit gimme brows. Lasts all day and looks natural.</li>
            <li> Very nice I have dark hair but the dark one was too dramatic so I re purchased the lighter shade and its perfect</li>
            <li> I really like this. It separates your browns so that each precious hair counts. :) a great boon to those with sparse eyebrows. It also stays on all day!</li>
            <li> I procured the medium to dark brown shade! Well, its neither.  As a Black woman I needed something more dark.  This falls short.  Will not be procuring this item again.&lt;br /&gt;T</li>
            <li> This can get crazy quickly if you&#x27;re too excited and use a heavy time. (See my first encounter with this product). BUT if you go slow and stay neat, it really gives a more natural brow look. Great for everyday natural makeup. I was getting tired of using ABH brow powder every day, and it was just too sculpted of a look if I was just going to the gym. This is quick and easy for natural makeup, just give yourself a few tries to get it right. I have dark brown hair and almost black brows and this is a good color for me.</li>
            <li> not perfect but it will do</li>
            <li> I hate lining my eyebrows, but they&#x27;ve thinned (and gone white) so much that they almost vanish on my face. Avon used to carry a product similar to this, but they stopped making it, so I was thrilled to see this come out. I love it and use it pretty much every day. If you apply it backwards first, and then forwards, you can intensify the effect. I have particularly thin eyebrows (ironic, since as a girl mine looked like Brooke Shields&#x27;), so I sometimes do that technique and then apply a second coat in the forward direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can&#x27;t seem to line your eyebrows without looking like Lana Turner, try this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the small brush! Hello makeup manufacturers....The Mascara sized wands do NOT work for regular eyebrows unless yours are huge and bushy. We need small brushes like this (almost like a lower lash mascara size) for colored brow gel or else you can end up looking like Groucho Marx. This is fantastic. Wish I found it years ago. Love it when I just want a quick application before the gym or something when I&#x27;m not looking to really fill in perfectly.</li>
            <li> This has became my easy go to eyebrow routine and I like it. It doesn&#x27;t move, smudge or fallout IF you don&#x27;t rub it. However there are two downfalls:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s a bit tricky to coat the hair and not get it on the skin around, specially in the sparse areas, where I need the product the most.&lt;br /&gt;2. You would think the shade medium to dark is going to be a bit lighter to serve both as a medium shade for brunettes and as a dark shade for people with black hair. I have black hair and still feel this is a bit dark to appear natural. Now, keep in mind that I&#x27;m all about natural makeup and look. So, I use it light handed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those being said, I still think it&#x27;s a good product, specially since I think as I keep using it and there&#x27;s less product in the tube, it will get easier to apply and my first problem goes away.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT!!  I used to use Anastasia Brow Gel and I will NEVER go back.  The smaller wand is so much easier to use and the color lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t TERRIBLE. It lasts most of the day (depending on how long your day is) but after a while it will stick to your skin in clumps which looks quite weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little easier to apply than my last product but you have to be careful to make sure there isn&#x27;t too much on the brush before applying because it will stick your eyebrow hairs together to make them look even worse. I have to use a brush after application to separate them to make it look more natural. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
            <li> Sorry, all I get is a mess. I am older, maybe it&#x27;s fine for young girls who still have their brows. This does not give a hint of fullness on bare skin where brows have been plucked over years.</li>
            <li> I love the color and the way this product styles but it flakes all over. I had brown spots all over my face all three times I used it. I suppose it could work if you didn&#x27;t have it on longer than a few hours.</li>
            <li> Easy to use but the downside is that it sort of crumbles up as it dries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different &amp;#34;name&amp;#34; brand brow plumper/color and this one works good.&lt;br /&gt;The others were not worth the time to put on (standby pencil!), I was always rubbing&lt;br /&gt;off and reapplying. This goes on good the first time. I particularly like the brush end -&lt;br /&gt;that makes the ease of applying.</li>
            <li> Love this for my eye brows... It looks natural and not fake</li>
            <li> I have been using Benefit Gimme Brow until now, and decided to try this after reading rave reviews - I love it!  Saves me about $20 and works just as well!</li>
            <li> Really does &amp;#34;plum&amp;#34; your brow! But too much product is on the brush when you take it out of the tube, and that gets on the skin around my brow. I have to wipe it off a bit first, which is the bother of a second step and seems like a waste of product. I&#x27;ve had a similar issue before with low quality mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of drawing in brows with a pencil - way too time consuming with often uneven results!  I found and used a product very similar to this by Lancome called &amp;#34;Mod√©le Sourcils Brow Expert&amp;#34; (sells for $25) for several years but after becoming a mother I just couldn&#x27;t justify the expense.  While reading some fashion magazines (Glamour, Allure), I noticed that when they gave the product list for various photo shoots they kept listing this product.  Since it looked like the Lancome product I tried it out.  How glad I am that I did!  In my opinion it is even better than Lancome.  You just brush on the gel with a mascara like wand and it smooths, shapes and fills in your brows all at once.  I have very pale sparse brows but this adheres to you skin really well and I have no noticeable wear at the end of the day.  No flaking or fading.  I actually like it better than the Lancome products since that one was very cloudy and had a whipped or fluffy appearance whereas this one is more clear.  I can use the wand to shape and comb the arch of my brow and even draw a little more brow on at the outside corners where I have very few hairs.  I honestly don&#x27;t know how I could be more pleased with this product.  I am a blond so I got the product in the &amp;#34;light to medium&amp;#34; color and it was perfect and natural.</li>
            <li> Make it simple, if you have long but thin hair, it works perfectly, but if the eyebrow is short (left/right direction), it does not help a lot, and you still need eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> Amazing product..keeps my brows in place with a hint of tint</li>
            <li> You can use it after applying the pomade or without</li>
            <li> Very good product. I was using smart bro but for half the price you can get this and it&#x27;s just as good</li>
            <li> Covers completely.  Use sparingly at first.</li>
            <li> The gel is quite thick, so I would last all day.  I just didn&#x27;t like the feeling of it on my eyebrows.  Kind of like mascara.  Might work for others, I just personally didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
