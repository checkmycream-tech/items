            <li> Love this product!  My daughter&#x27;s and I use it all the time and it moisturizes our face perfectly</li>
            <li> How could water in a spray can be so helpful? It is. Don&#x27;t question it. Just buy.</li>
            <li> nice and hydrating to set makeup</li>

            <li> Great product. Very useful</li>
            <li> I used this for barely a week and the spray nozzle stopped working. The bottle is still full but I can&#x27;t use any of it anymore, since the bottle is under pressure and there is no way to open it and put the content into another spray bottle. This was an absolute waste of money, I would estimate that I got about 10 sprays out of it, which makes each spray very, very expensive.</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin use. Especially during the winter time to keep the skin moisturing and it&#x27;s convinent to use.</li>

            <li> Leaves your skin moist and cool. Very refreshing specially on a very hot day.  I use it at night before going to bed for extra moist.</li>

            <li> Cool and refreshing, mildly hydrating. My dermatologist recommended this for my rosacea prone skin. I started using it during a bad flare up and it helped cool my skin. I now use it daily for extra moisture and cooling benefits. I like it better than toners, which can have ingredients that irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent!</li>
            <li> I got it 4 days earlier than the delivery estimate.I hope it works for my skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin softer and smooth!</li>
