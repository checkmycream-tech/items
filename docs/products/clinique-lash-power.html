    <ol>
            <li>Great mascara...looked forever for one that didn&#x27;t smear or create racoon eyes and this is it!</li>
            <li>Sometimes buying online is not always the best option!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find a product that works perfectly and then the company decides to discontinue it.</li>
            <li>This is awesome!!!</li>
            <li>and it was a pleasant surprise!</li>
            <li>Waterproof, long-lasting, doesn&#x27;t smudge, but incredibly clumpy.</li>
            <li>Color is great.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes and works great with contacts.</li>
            <li>Happy that it doesn&#x27;t smudge and washes off with soap and water.</li>
            <li>This mascara is great to lengthen the lashes, but when it comes to taking it off boy does it come off in chunks and clumps.</li>
            <li>The wand is my favorite skinny style, which gives the best control and even application by wiggling the bristles through my lashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful. :)</li>
            <li>good choice</li>
            <li>This mascara has great coverage, stays on until removed with warm water- no oily makeup remover needed, and, as with all Clinique products, is hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>Looks good .</li>
            <li>I have super watery eyes and this mascara lasts through the day perfectly!!!</li>
            <li>love this mascara!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>Rinses off nicely in water.</li>
            <li>my favorit mascara wont rub off but comes off with warm water.  </li>
            <li>Stays on all day and washes off with warm water - no make remover required.</li>
            <li>By far the best mascara on the market!  </li>
            <li>By far, the very best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>While a nice product, it does tend to flake easily as the day wears on.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>I have pulled out many eyelashes trying to get rid of clumps.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I decided to try Clinique&#x27;s mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this mascara.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I love Clinique mascara.  </li>
            <li>I love all the Clinique products.  </li>
            <li>I just love, love, love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>although it&#x27;s still better then most</li>
            <li>In fact, the only way to remove it is with a liberal application of very warm water, at which time it kind flakes</li>
            <li>Stays on all day, no smears, flakes or smudges, but comes off easily with just soap and water.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove, but never giving you the raccoon mask, this is a staple for me.</li>
            <li>This is my go to mascara... stays on and comes off relatively easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a waterproof mascara, but its incredibly easy to take off.</li>
            <li>it NEVER clumps - very good on long lashes.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone who would like beautiful lashes without much fuss!</li>
            <li>They do just fine with this.  </li>
            <li>Just bought some at Nordstrom for $14.85 plus free shipping.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Lash Power Mascara Long-Wearing because it was advertised to go on smoothly without clumping.  </li>
            <li>Definitely the best I&#x27;ve found so far!</li>
            <li>Lash Power is my current favorite tubing mascara (washes off with warm water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clinique got it right with this mascara!</li>
            <li>Great product, but can be harsh on eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Makes eyes look nice and big.</li>
            <li>I got hooked on this, though, because of the price, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the $14 when I think about buying mascara</li>
            <li>Lots of people think that the bigger the brush the more volume you get, but that simply isn&#x27;t true in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Recently, I tried to go back to cheap drugstore mascara and was reminded of how great this product really is.</li>
            <li>gave it four stars because, even though I love the wand, if the wand was just a little longer then I could cover more lashes at once.</li>
            <li>Excellent at being waterproof and long lasting, just not for those with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>quality product guaranteed 100% recommended best next purchase will be impossible with your company merry christmas and happy new year</li>
            <li>I love Amazon and it is definitely my go to place just not for this mascara.</li>
            <li>Apparently this mascara is meant to replace Clinique&#x27;s waterproof mascara which is not longer available.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t smear- and still comes off easily with makeup remover and facial cleanser at night.</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer stated, the price on Amazon is very inflated.</li>
            <li>Still very burnie and itchy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other Clinique mascaras and had much better experiences.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products but hoping this would not make my eyes itch.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like thick, clumpy mascara, and this one is really light and easily applied.</li>
            <li>I never used this particular mascara before, so I don&#x27;t know what it is supposed to be like.  </li>
            <li>The main selling point for me is that this stuff does not smudge, smear, or run.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look fake or overdone, just natural but beautifully</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several mascaras and this is the first that I really like.</li>
            <li>I use pretty much everything Clinique as far as my facial wash and treatment goes, and I use their eye shadows as well.</li>
            <li>While this is pretty good and works well enough, it is a poor substitute for the one they no longer make.  </li>
            <li>My eyes are very sensitive to chemicals or fragrances.  </li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to mascaras.</li>
            <li>It was dried out and did not go easily onto my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>however I think amazon sometimes sells OLD ones</li>
            <li>It was as if it were old.  </li>
            <li>Just pretty lashes that always get me comments about how long my lashes look.</li>
            <li>I have often had to wash the mascara off to complete my make up.  </li>
            <li>I actually bought this at my local Sephora, so when I went on here to review it, I noticed it is selling for $25 right now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used only this mascara the past 4 years, and really love it.</li>
            <li>formula is rather dry &amp; thick, so there&#x27;s elbow grease involved in applying it fully, but I love the lashes it gives me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not long wear as the name states.</li>
            <li>love this because not only do you not have to worry about ending up looking like you have a black eye by the end of work, it also helps me avoid that late day &amp;#34;burning eye&amp;#34; feeling you get when it seems like all your makeup is sliding off into your eyeballs.</li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone who wants to get all their stingy little lashes in the corners and also to anyone who coats and coats like I do but doesn&#x27;t want to deal with clumps or having spidery eyes.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m kind of mad</li>
            <li> Not very confident I would buy this particular product again.</li>
            <li> I have searched a long time for a mascara that works but wont turn you into a raccoon.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to let you gals know that it is only $15 at the store, so be careful with price.</li>
            <li> It gives me soft, fluffy lashes.</li>
            <li> Also, this stuff really lasts through tears without giving you black tracks down your face, and it even lasted through a nap with my face half on the pillow squishing one of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only non-smear mascara I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t leave a black mark under my eyes by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected</li>
            <li> The product that I received was unlike any other mascara I had used in my life.  </li>
            <li> I have only worn Clinque mascara for the past 30 years due to eye allergies.</li>
            <li> It has endured crazy amounts of wear, harsh conditions, and always looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> Not worth it for me.</li>
            <li> I search it down to find it.</li>
            <li> With this mascara, I get longer, fuller lashes with a slight curl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased less costly mascaras</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m always trying to get a mascara that will darken and lengthen a bit with little thickening.  </li>
            <li> The removal is just a pain you have little round pieces of mascara coming off and going all over the place even with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s depressing enough working ten hours without looking like a raccoon too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a brush this small</li>
            <li> The small diameter of the applicator makes it easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Dried up !</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for years, and have never been disappointed with it!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Was not what I expected</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara. Not clumpy or sticky. Makes eyes look nice and big. Stays on all day, no smears, flakes or smudges, but comes off easily with just soap and water. Like another reviewer stated, the price on Amazon is very inflated. Just bought some at Nordstrom for $14.85 plus free shipping. I love Amazon and it is definitely my go to place just not for this mascara.</li>
            <li> I have searched a long time for a mascara that works but wont turn you into a raccoon. THIS is it. Easy to remove, but never giving you the raccoon mask, this is a staple for me. A few swipes of this, some red lipstick and you are ready to hit the town. It has endured crazy amounts of wear, harsh conditions, and always looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not long wear as the name states. Lasts approx five hours. Not very confident I would buy this particular product again.</li>
            <li> Waterproof, long-lasting, doesn&#x27;t smudge, but incredibly clumpy. I have pulled out many eyelashes trying to get rid of clumps. Not worth it for me. I&#x27;ve tried other Clinique mascaras and had much better experiences.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I decided to try Clinique&#x27;s mascara. I use pretty much everything Clinique as far as my facial wash and treatment goes, and I use their eye shadows as well. With this mascara, I get longer, fuller lashes with a slight curl. I&#x27;m kind of mad I got hooked on this, though, because of the price, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the $14 when I think about buying mascara only every two or three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get all their stingy little lashes in the corners and also to anyone who coats and coats like I do but doesn&#x27;t want to deal with clumps or having spidery eyes. Also, this stuff really lasts through tears without giving you black tracks down your face, and it even lasted through a nap with my face half on the pillow squishing one of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because, even though I love the wand, if the wand was just a little longer then I could cover more lashes at once.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a brush this small and it was a pleasant surprise! I&#x27;m in love with this mascara.</li>
            <li> good choice however I think amazon sometimes sells OLD ones</li>
            <li> While a nice product, it does tend to flake easily as the day wears on.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It&#x27;s the only non-smear mascara I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t leave a black mark under my eyes by the end of the day. It stays on even when you get in the pool- doesn&#x27;t smear- and still comes off easily with makeup remover and facial cleanser at night. I don&#x27;t like thick, clumpy mascara, and this one is really light and easily applied. I&#x27;ve used only this mascara the past 4 years, and really love it.</li>
            <li> Great product, but can be harsh on eyelashes.  Excellent at being waterproof and long lasting, just not for those with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara I have ever used that didn&#x27;t smudge or run, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of mascaras in my 40+ years. The small diameter of the applicator makes it easier to apply. Lots of people think that the bigger the brush the more volume you get, but that simply isn&#x27;t true in my opinion. If you are looking for a waterproof mascara, look no further!</li>
            <li> Great mascara...looked forever for one that didn&#x27;t smear or create racoon eyes and this is it!</li>
            <li> I never used this particular mascara before, so I don&#x27;t know what it is supposed to be like.  The product that I received was unlike any other mascara I had used in my life.  It was as if it were old.  It was dried out and did not go easily onto my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Clinique got it right with this mascara! I buy a lot of mascara because I can never find what I wanted...but not anymore! The brush is slim and can lift and separate the lashes making them look fuller and longer....love this mascara!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this at my local Sephora, so when I went on here to review it, I noticed it is selling for $25 right now. Just wanted to let you gals know that it is only $15 at the store, so be careful with price. Sometimes buying online is not always the best option!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great mascara. It gives me soft, fluffy lashes. Not the flaky, clumpy ones I used to get from drugstore mascaras.</li>
            <li> I have only worn Clinque mascara for the past 30 years due to eye allergies. Have never found another product that does not cause my eyes to swell and turn red. Strictly a Clinque lady..</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products but hoping this would not make my eyes itch.I was wrong. Still very burnie and itchy.</li>
            <li> This is my go to mascara... stays on and comes off relatively easily.  Doesn&#x27;t smudge or run and holds up for a day at the beach.  Definitely the best I&#x27;ve found so far!</li>
            <li> I have super watery eyes and this mascara lasts through the day perfectly!!! It&#x27;s a waterproof mascara, but its incredibly easy to take off. I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> quality product guaranteed 100% recommended best next purchase will be impossible with your company merry christmas and happy new year</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for years, and have never been disappointed with it!  This mascara has great coverage, stays on until removed with warm water- no oily makeup remover needed, and, as with all Clinique products, is hypoallergenic. By far the best mascara on the market!  I would highly recommend to anyone who would like beautiful lashes without much fuss!</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely. Color is great. Stays on my lashes not in my eyes or anywhere else it isn&#x27;t suppose to be.  Rinses off nicely in water. Doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes and works great with contacts.</li>
            <li> my favorit mascara wont rub off but comes off with warm water.  no extera cleaners needed.</li>
            <li> Lash Power is my current favorite tubing mascara (washes off with warm water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is rather dry &amp; thick, so there&#x27;s elbow grease involved in applying it fully, but I love the lashes it gives me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No smudging, no clumps, no flaking, no smearing. Just pretty lashes that always get me comments about how long my lashes look. They don&#x27;t look fake or overdone, just natural but beautifully enhanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like the formula to be a bit but wetter or thinner for easier application, but otherwise it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can go to a Sephora to test it out, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Apparently this mascara is meant to replace Clinique&#x27;s waterproof mascara which is not longer available.  While this is pretty good and works well enough, it is a poor substitute for the one they no longer make.  This always happens to me.  I find a product that works perfectly and then the company decides to discontinue it.</li>
            <li> I love Clinique mascara.  My eyes are very sensitive to chemicals or fragrances.  They do just fine with this.  No clumps either.</li>
            <li> I love all the Clinique products.  I am in the water a lot and this stilled stayed on even though it does not say, &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34;.  I will always buys this.</li>
            <li> I just love, love, love this mascara.  Stays on all day and washes off with warm water - no make remover required.</li>
            <li> Finally a mascara that doesn&#x27;t run if you have watery eyes!  Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> it NEVER clumps - very good on long lashes.  I&#x27;ve tried several mascaras and this is the first that I really like.</li>
            <li> Happy that it doesn&#x27;t smudge and washes off with soap and water. The wand is my favorite skinny style, which gives the best control and even application by wiggling the bristles through my lashes.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Lash Power Mascara Long-Wearing because it was advertised to go on smoothly without clumping.  I have often had to wash the mascara off to complete my make up.  I finally gave up and bought another product at a reduced price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several years. Recently, I tried to go back to cheap drugstore mascara and was reminded of how great this product really is. The main selling point for me is that this stuff does not smudge, smear, or run. In fact, the only way to remove it is with a liberal application of very warm water, at which time it kind flakes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this because not only do you not have to worry about ending up looking like you have a black eye by the end of work, it also helps me avoid that late day &amp;#34;burning eye&amp;#34; feeling you get when it seems like all your makeup is sliding off into your eyeballs. It&#x27;s depressing enough working ten hours without looking like a raccoon too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Clinique makes this forever.</li>
            <li> Dried up ! Disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> By far, the very best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  No smudging, smearing or wearing off.  Lasts the entire day.  I&#x27;ve purchased less costly mascaras but they do not add up.  I always keep coming back for this one.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to mascaras. I actually had to stop wearing it at all. I found Clinique lash power and I can wear mascara again! It stays on even when I cry. Looks good . I search it down to find it.</li>
            <li> although it&#x27;s still better then most I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always trying to get a mascara that will darken and lengthen a bit with little thickening.  This is the closest I have found.</li>
            <li> This is awesome!!! That&#x27;s all I have to say.&lt;br /&gt;And it does not smudge later on the bottom of your eyes. It&#x27;s wonderful. :)</li>
            <li> This mascara is great to lengthen the lashes, but when it comes to taking it off boy does it come off in chunks and clumps. The removal is just a pain you have little round pieces of mascara coming off and going all over the place even with eye makeup remover.</li>
