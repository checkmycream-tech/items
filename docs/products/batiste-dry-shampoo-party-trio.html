            <li>Not a lot of product in each can, but still a good value for the price.  </li>
            <li>The products are good</li>
            <li>Smells great, zaps oil and refreshes hair better then anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It also happens to smell amazing, all of it.</li>
            <li>maybe that was my own fault.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair a nice lift if it&#x27;s been under a hat or in the rain as well.</li>
            <li>Small and perfect for travel, great scents and cute case.</li>
            <li>The size is so cute</li>
            <li>But they ended up smelling more &amp;#34;old</li>
            <li>Would buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>I love sleeping in and crashing before I have the chance to get a shower.</li>
            <li>Overall the product is great!</li>
            <li>They have the best dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo out there.</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The best Dry Shampoo ever!</li>
            <li>Fun scents, cute design, and it absorbs all of that pesky unneeded oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You feel clean and you look clean.</li>
            <li>Great way to sample some of Batiste&#x27;s dry shampoo scents!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best brand of dry shampoo out there.</li>
            <li>my hair smells and looks fresh again.</li>
            <li>It really works, keep hair clean without water - my wife&#x27;s words.</li>
            <li>Just be aware that you can&#x27;t use this all the time, like try not to use it twice in a row.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend really likes these, uses them at work even!</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more a fun and girly scents for the dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>problem with this set is that the bottles were really small - each can was good for 3, maybe 4 uses at most!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After I spray it my hair is full of volume and last for at last two more days before needing to wash it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>These guys smell great and they add a little &#x27;umph to my hair between treatments to get the extra oily out.</li>
            <li>Does the job without leaving too much powder after restyling.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump and really saved me when i put too much straightening oil in my hair after washing it.</li>
            <li>The value is pretty crappy compared to a regular full size can.</li>
            <li>The scents are a bit much, but I like how easily Batiste dry shampoos work.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other dry shampoo Ive tried!</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this product, having never used dry shampoo before, but I have to say, the products are amazing.</li>
            <li>It was not a fun mess to clean up-especially since I only had the product for around an hour.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really too bad because I love Batiste.  </li>

            <li> can usually find Batiste brand at TJ Maxx or Marshalls and is much cheaper than anything I have found on Amazon.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a lazy girl.</li>
            <li> Very heavy musky smelling.</li>
            <li> I like putting off washing my hair for a week, but I hate feeling like I put off washing my hair for a week.</li>
            <li> These smell really horrible.  </li>

            <li> Great way to sample some of Batiste&#x27;s dry shampoo scents! Loved the product!</li>
            <li> The size is so cute and I like how it smells....</li>
            <li> These smell really horrible.  I think my grandma wore these scents when she was in her 90&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s really too bad because I love Batiste.  They have the best dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveliing</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product, having never used dry shampoo before, but I have to say, the products are amazing. they hold all day and make my hair feel like the second day after washing it. It lets me have my curls a little longer and I don&#x27;t have to ruin my hair by washing it as often.</li>
            <li> The scents are a bit much, but I like how easily Batiste dry shampoos work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a no &#x27;poo kick. These guys smell great and they add a little &#x27;umph to my hair between treatments to get the extra oily out. I spray a little on and blowdry it in- my hair smells and looks fresh again.</li>
            <li> Purchased for stocking stuffer. Great for gift giving.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more a fun and girly scents for the dry shampoo.  But they ended up smelling more &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; parfume(s) instead.  Very heavy musky smelling. Not for me personally.</li>
            <li> Small and perfect for travel, great scents and cute case. Very happy with this purchase!!! Would buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo out there. Does the job without leaving too much powder after restyling. So good You want a travel size to carry along with you!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best brand of dry shampoo out there. Nothing works like this stuff. After I spray it my hair is full of volume and last for at last two more days before needing to wash it. Other brands don&#x27;t even come close! It also smells great, my husband loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with this set is that the bottles were really small - each can was good for 3, maybe 4 uses at most!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can usually find Batiste brand at TJ Maxx or Marshalls and is much cheaper than anything I have found on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lazy girl. I love sleeping in and crashing before I have the chance to get a shower. I like putting off washing my hair for a week, but I hate feeling like I put off washing my hair for a week. That&#x27;s where this glorious stuff comes in. You put one in your book bag or your purse or whatever, and whenever you feel gross you go to the bathroom and spray this on your roots and shake your head around. Then you&#x27;re good. You feel clean and you look clean. This stuff restores the volume to your hair and takes the grease away. It also happens to smell amazing, all of it. Just be aware that you can&#x27;t use this all the time, like try not to use it twice in a row. It stops working so well after you use it twice with no shower/water in between.</li>
            <li> Smells great, zaps oil and refreshes hair better then anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Not a lot of product in each can, but still a good value for the price.  I have one for travel, one in my purse, and one at work.  Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The products are good but I only got 3-4 uses out of these cans. I thought they would last a little longer than that maybe that was my own fault. The value is pretty crappy compared to a regular full size can.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend really likes these, uses them at work even!</li>
            <li> Overall the product is great! Fun scents, cute design, and it absorbs all of that pesky unneeded oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with the product is the way it was shipped. I put it in my bathroom cabinet only to find one of the containers leaking all over. It was not a fun mess to clean up-especially since I only had the product for around an hour.</li>
            <li> The best Dry Shampoo ever! It doesn&#x27;t clump and really saved me when i put too much straightening oil in my hair after washing it. It gives my hair a nice lift if it&#x27;s been under a hat or in the rain as well.</li>
