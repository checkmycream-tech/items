            <li>Love this mirror.  </li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>34;8-inch 7x Magnification&amp;#34; is better than &amp;#34;6-inch 10x Magnification&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This one sure fits the bill.</li>
            <li>My eyes are not what they use to be, so I really LOVE the 7x magnification on the tabletop 8&amp;#34; mirror.</li>
            <li>perfect size to see my entire face.</li>
            <li>Its big and sturdy and perfect.</li>
            <li>Nice sized mirror, I use it to tweeze my eyebrows and to help me be more precise while plucking.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li>Great mirror, good quality and big.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>product shipped and was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to have both the regular and the magnification sides.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>This mirror is nice and heavy and a good height for my vanity table.</li>
            <li>Am using the magnify side to apply my make-up and it working out great the only thing you have to focus because it can appear blurry at first.</li>
            <li>It is really nice and the quality has surprised me.</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied and highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>Normal side is great for seeing back of hair when styling.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I can actually SEE what I&#x27;m doing without glasses and both hands free.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I think a 10x would be too big/too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really difficult anymore to find makeup mirrors that are magnified enough to be able to easily apply makeup, are distortion free, and are large enough to be able to see enough of your face at one time to make foundation application easier.</li>
            <li>Very well made, stable, and it is very clear when using either magnification.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mirror for its quality and price.  </li>
            <li>I was so very pleasantly surprised when it arrived.  </li>
            <li>I am not a fan of the 10 because it simply seems a bit much.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is heavy and sturdy and large enough to really see what you need to see.  </li>
            <li>only possible improvement could be a little more weight in the base, but otherwise great.</li>
            <li>This one was so reasonable, half the price of the one I was replacing.  </li>

            <li> Love this mirror.  Magnification side is perfect for putting on my make up.  Normal side is great for seeing back of hair when styling.  I have problems lifting with my left arm and this mirror is lightweight enough for me to hold it in one hand and the hairbrush in the other.  Would buy it again. (In fact I did just buy it again ha)</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars but mine came cracked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and functional. Great buy!</li>
            <li> This mirror is nice and heavy and a good height for my vanity table. So far so good!</li>
            <li> I am satisfy with my purchase.  Am using the magnify side to apply my make-up and it working out great the only thing you have to focus because it can appear blurry at first.</li>
            <li> I just received this mirror; it is great!  Very well made, stable, and it is very clear when using either magnification.  I am going to order another one for a gift.  Shirl from FL.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I bought three months before the &amp;#34;DecoBros 6-Inch Tabletop Two-Sided Swivel Vanity Mirror with 10x Magnification&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I was satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;So, I was repurchase to give a gift to my mother.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;6-inch, 10x Magnification&amp;#34; is sold out. so, i bought this size.&lt;br /&gt;I think that &amp;#34;8-inch 7x Magnification&amp;#34; is better than &amp;#34;6-inch 10x Magnification&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, bought it for my 8 years old to put her contacts in it is great.</li>

            <li> I love this mirror! It is really nice and the quality has surprised me. For the price, I would say this mirror has surpassed my expectations. It is the perfect size and the mirror part of it flips, so you can access the magnnified side. The only reason I have given it a 4-star rating is becaue the magnified side is slightly distorted. But I use this mirror every day for makeup. I definitely reccommend it if you won&#x27;t mind not having a quality magnified side.</li>

            <li> Nice sized mirror, I use it to tweeze my eyebrows and to help me be more precise while plucking. The side that&#x27;s 7x you have to get close to focus it, but it&#x27;s perfect once you&#x27;re in focus. The &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; side is great for doing makeup, hair, and etc.</li>

            <li> This mirror is AMAZING. Packaged very nicely. It&#x27;s smooth to the touch. Very pretty. The 7x magnification is enough to do makeup. I think a 10x would be too big/too much. It even comes with a lifetime warranty. LOVE LOVE LOVE. The price is awesome for what you get. Very happy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful! Great mirror. I love it!</li>
