            <li>So, it isn&#x27;t the best in regards to blackhead removal, but it isn&#x27;t without benefit.</li>

            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>works ok and as good as I hoped with a blackheads on my nose</li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>I like it a lot, but I kind of had to figure out the instructions by trial and error because it&#x27;s written in some oriental language.</li>
            <li>Love this peel mask, great for blackheads and really satisfying to see all the gunk you can get out of your face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome you can see a huge difference right when you peel it off.</li>
            <li>but this works so much better</li>
            <li>When you see what comes out of your face you will be grossed out yet pleased.</li>
            <li>You are better off putting glue on your face</li>
            <li>The product probably works differently on different people, so use your best judgement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Seems to top remove moisture layer from the skin</li>
            <li>I think those are better</li>
            <li>Interesting product, but doesn&#x27;t work well at all...</li>
            <li>i say order this and try it out :)</li>
            <li>so make sure you add more product in those areas to be sure all holes are filled.</li>
            <li>Will have to try again to make a more accurate review.</li>
            <li>I use this once a week to keep my face nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>Plus, lets me real, it&#x27;s fun to peel off.</li>

            <li>Peeled easily.</li>
            <li>Pretty effective blackhead removal peel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to apply huge globs at once</li>
            <li>my face feels so smooth after I use this</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this because I have been wanting it for a while.</li>
            <li>It is SUPER IMPORTANT to moisturizer after you use this.</li>
            <li>It is SUPER IMPORTANT to moisturizer after you use this.</li>
            <li>Face felt clean afterward</li>
            <li>i was quite impressed with it at first but after the 8th time of using it, it started burning my face a little</li>
            <li>Good product overall.</li>
            <li>face with warm and pat dry, make sure there are no traces makeup or oils on the skin.</li>
            <li>The tip of the tool is really sharp and great for piercing acne to make them easier to extract.</li>
            <li>Plus the mask makes my face nice &amp; smooth, &amp; totally freaks out my kids when I wear it!!</li>
            <li>Really super for exfoliating</li>
            <li>but overall did clean my pores and plus is nice</li>
            <li>So it is a great exfoliator in a way, but it doesn&#x27;t remove all the black heads.</li>
            <li>The mask was easy to apply, however I was unsure how much to apply.</li>
            <li>Works great apply a somewhat thick layer to get it to remove easily.</li>
            <li>My skin is super soft after I use it, and allows my foundation to lay better on the skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is super soft after I use it, and allows my foundation to lay better on the skin.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just not applying it right, but it&#x27;s super sticky and gets EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying</li>
            <li>Even though it doesn&#x27;t pull out all the blackheads, I can just pop them not with this handy tool &amp; not have red splotches all over my face!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fun to use but doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>Gave it to my daughter and son to have fun peeling this product off their faces.</li>
            <li>Works great but be VERY careful when you use this on sensitive parts of your skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely going to order more of this when it&#x27;s over .</li>
            <li>It was actually really nice but did pull hairs out so be careful</li>
            <li>Ripped that off first.</li>
            <li>but I think it worked very well!</li>
            <li>Product doesn&#x27;t remove blackheads and is very damaging to your skin!</li>
            <li>better than whatever this is supposed to do the only plus is the tool that comes with it</li>
            <li>Works great its not as harsh on my sensitive skin as what a biore pore strip is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product once so far, but I really liked it.</li>
            <li>skin feels super soft</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good and goes on nice but is a pain to take off like it hurts so bad</li>
            <li>but it really hurt to take off alot of burning</li>
            <li>It stuck to the skin so much that it had to be washed off, it did nothing for the blackheads</li>
            <li>Makeup application was much smoother after using Pilaten.  </li>
            <li>The tool works really well too.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.a Biore strip for your whole face; however, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d like it to.</li>
            <li>The tool works really well too.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Warning : shave or wax your face before hand if you&#x27;re doing the whole thing.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel very soft; however, it didn&#x27;t do much in the way of blackhead removal.</li>
            <li>Have to lather on a lot had a hard time peeling, really liked the tool that came with.</li>
            <li>another thin on top but wasn&#x27;t thick enough but still did an amazing job I will definitely be buying more and for some friends as well!</li>
            <li>Rinse off your face with cool water, pat dry, and apply moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apply a thin layer of the mask over your entire face with fingers avoiding eye brows and any hair on your face, layer more over it until it is completely opaque (this may take more than one additional layer.)</li>
            <li>I will continue using it to see how well it will help clear out my face!</li>
            <li>I usually use pore strips for my blackheads, and this helped slightly more.</li>
            <li>It does a good job removing blackheads, but make sure to let it dry on your face completely as it is difficult to clean up, its like tar and difficult to clean it off anything, especially face towels....</li>
            <li>It hurts a little more than the traditional clear peel mask</li>
            <li>i ordered this about a month or so ago, i just finished the bottle last night and to be honest, i was expecting a little bigger bottle</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a big blackhead problem</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>my complexion is brighter and my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li>not irritate sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only did the nose and the forehead, separately, not the whole face.</li>
            <li>I left it on for 15 minutes and peeled the whole thing out of my face.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to put a thick layer.</li>
            <li>Allow to dry completely, this may take up to 45 minutes depending on how much product you applied.</li>
            <li>Saw the same results would get with a normal pore strip.</li>
            <li>Great for ripping hairs out of your face, other than that it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li>Have only used once so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try it again, but as of right now I&#x27;m not very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I like it, the tool was hard to see as it was taped to the packaging, but I have found it extremely useful!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I was using it right</li>
            <li>It is not the same as a $100+ facial treatment, but my skin is not bad and it certainly made it smoother.&lt;br /&gt;Following suggestions in the reviews, I applied a thin layer, let it dry for about 5 minutes, then applied another one.</li>
            <li>Take a makeup remover to remove any left over product (usually around the edges of the face.. it&#x27;ll come right off).</li>

            <li> Soak a washcloth in hot water and ring out excess water, lay over your face for a few minutes and pat dry again to open pores.</li>
            <li> It will sink into large pores leaving a small hole in the mask over the pore..</li>
            <li> Not sure it really did anything.  </li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> This was definitely a strange experience</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> It just makes my face extremely dry</li>
            <li> It does remove SOME black heads, but I wouldn&#x27;t consider this to be on the same level as a Biore strip.</li>

            <li> As others have said, the amount of product you get isn&#x27;t very much and the mask bottle is quite small, but I think since you only need to apply a thin layer, this should last you quite a few uses.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Takes out all your blackheads! Definitely going to order more of this when it&#x27;s over . I recommend!</li>
            <li> It was actually really nice but did pull hairs out so be careful and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but it really hurt to take off alot of burning but otherwise it was very good</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a big blackhead problem but sometimes my cheeks break out. This mask takes everything out!! WOW my face feels so smooth after I use this and I could not be happier. I use this once a week to keep my face nice and fresh. my complexion is brighter and my skin feels so soft. It hurts a little more than the traditional clear peel mask but this works so much better you will be shocked!! When you see what comes out of your face you will be grossed out yet pleased.</li>
            <li> It stuck to the skin so much that it had to be washed off, it did nothing for the blackheads</li>
            <li> Rips out hairs including peach fuz. Definitely not something you want to put on your entire face... Or accidentally drip on your arm and not notice. Ripped that off first. Then realized it rips out hair. Then had to slowly rip out all of my peach fuz around my face. But works really nice.</li>
            <li> This worked amazingly well on my 43 year-old skin.  It removed what I didn&#x27;t even know was there.  Makeup application was much smoother after using Pilaten.  Has become part of my beauty regimen!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Such a wares of money. You are better off putting glue on your face</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works. Definitely worth buying</li>
            <li> Works well, as expected. Takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just not applying it right, but it&#x27;s super sticky and gets EVERYWHERE. Not only is it messy and sticky, IT HURTS WHEN YOU PEEL IT OFF. I&#x27;ll try it again, but as of right now I&#x27;m not very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Horrible. it Doesn&#x27;t do anything it says it does. Does not work. Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks. All it did was pull all the little hairs out of my face(which hurt like crazy!) and cause severe dryness to my skin. DO NOT BUY. And what the heck are you supposed to do with that little tool? I repeat DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I was using it right but it only got out a little bit.</li>
            <li> Works great apply a somewhat thick layer to get it to remove easily. Feels like rubber ehen dried and peels off and clears your pores.</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel very soft; however, it didn&#x27;t do much in the way of blackhead removal. It helps to shave off any peach fuzz off the face before using the product, because it&#x27;s quite painful if not. The product probably works differently on different people, so use your best judgement. Good product overall.</li>
            <li> Hurts like waking when you pull it off but it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Pretty effective blackhead removal peel. I haven&#x27;t used other kinds of blackhead peel masks before, but I like the black color because it helps me to see what has been removed. It also doesn&#x27;t damage the skin as others have said. I always would get ripped skin when I used pore strips, so I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this, but it wasn&#x27;t painful at all. Also, it does indeed come with a blackhead removing tool. It was taped to the side and is quite small, so if you aren&#x27;t paying attention when opening the package, you might end up throwing away the tool by accident. The tip of the tool is really sharp and great for piercing acne to make them easier to extract. As others have said, the amount of product you get isn&#x27;t very much and the mask bottle is quite small, but I think since you only need to apply a thin layer, this should last you quite a few uses.</li>
            <li> This was definitely a strange experience but I think it worked very well!</li>
            <li> Work good on me but I don&#x27;t know about it working on you</li>
            <li> OVERVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;This is a black charcoal peel-off mask that is meant to remove black heads. It does come with the tool you see in the image. It is a thick formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW TO USE:&lt;br /&gt;Wash face with warm and pat dry, make sure there are no traces makeup or oils on the skin. Soak a washcloth in hot water and ring out excess water, lay over your face for a few minutes and pat dry again to open pores. Apply a thin layer of the mask over your entire face with fingers avoiding eye brows and any hair on your face, layer more over it until it is completely opaque (this may take more than one additional layer.) It will sink into large pores leaving a small hole in the mask over the pore.. so make sure you add more product in those areas to be sure all holes are filled. Allow to dry completely, this may take up to 45 minutes depending on how much product you applied. Gently, carefully peel off in an upward motion. The mask should come off in one piece. Take a makeup remover to remove any left over product (usually around the edges of the face.. it&#x27;ll come right off). Rinse off your face with cool water, pat dry, and apply moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOES IT WORK?: Meh, kinda. It does remove SOME black heads, but I wouldn&#x27;t consider this to be on the same level as a Biore strip. It DOES, however, remove ALL of the peach fuzz from your face as well as the dead/dry skin. So it is a great exfoliator in a way, but it doesn&#x27;t remove all the black heads. The tool provided does work, though. So you can always go back and remove the remaining blackheads with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Removes peach fuzz&lt;br /&gt;Removes dead skin&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin feels super soft&lt;br /&gt;Makeup applies well after use&lt;br /&gt;Does not cause break outs&lt;br /&gt;Does not irritate sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Seems to top remove moisture layer from the skin&lt;br /&gt;May cause drying&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t remove all black heads&lt;br /&gt;Painful to remove&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINAL THOUGHTS:&lt;br /&gt;The idea of this product is awesome, a Biore strip for your whole face; however, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d like it to. I like that it removes the dry patches, peach fuzz, and dead skin.. but I don&#x27;t like that it dries out my face. My skin is super soft after I use it, and allows my foundation to lay better on the skin. It is SUPER IMPORTANT to moisturizer after you use this. The tool works really well too. So, it isn&#x27;t the best in regards to blackhead removal, but it isn&#x27;t without benefit. Plus, lets me real, it&#x27;s fun to peel off. Although, it does hurt to peel off, I won&#x27;t lie. It makes your eyes water.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product with my own money and of my own volition. My review is honest and unbiased.

            <li> Apply generously for it to work best.  Arrived on time and as described.</li>
            <li> Did not remove anything</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t remove blackheads and is very damaging to your skin!</li>
            <li> i gave this mask a try and didnt do anything for me at all!!! dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work, however i like the tool it came with</li>
            <li> Gooddd product thankss</li>
            <li> The needle is missing</li>
            <li> works ok and as good as I hoped with a blackheads on my nose</li>
            <li> I like it, the tool was hard to see as it was taped to the packaging, but I have found it extremely useful! I do like the mask too! Even though it doesn&#x27;t pull out all the blackheads, I can just pop them not with this handy tool &amp; not have red splotches all over my face! SO AWESOME! Plus the mask makes my face nice &amp; smooth, &amp; totally freaks out my kids when I wear it!! haha.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good and goes on nice but is a pain to take off like it hurts so bad but overall did clean my pores and plus is nice</li>
            <li> Works great its not as harsh on my sensitive skin as what a biore pore strip is. I was amazed at the amount of ick that came off my face!</li>
            <li> this is not like the ponds strip I think those are better I can get a facial peel package at Walmart that does better than whatever this is supposed to do the only plus is the tool that comes with it</li>
            <li> You have to apply a layer and let it dry then apply another layer let that dry ect in order to get a thick enough coating for any blackheads to pull out. It has charcoal which does help pull up the dirt in pores. I&#x27;ve tried to apply huge globs at once but it drips and dries flat and thin. Saw the same results would get with a normal pore strip. Nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, but I kind of had to figure out the instructions by trial and error because it&#x27;s written in some oriental language.</li>
            <li> I did some research and finally  decided to buy this. It did came with the blackhead remover, which is a big plus for the combo.&lt;br /&gt;The mask worked - I only did the nose and the forehead, separately, not the whole face. It is not the same as a $100+ facial treatment, but my skin is not bad and it certainly made it smoother.&lt;br /&gt;Following suggestions in the reviews, I applied a thin layer, let it dry for about 5 minutes, then applied another one. I left it on for 15 minutes and peeled the whole thing out of my face.</li>
            <li> Loooove this product! I saw a video in Chinese of a girl using this so it sparked my curiosity. My husband and I both used it and it worked amazing! Warning : shave or wax your face before hand if you&#x27;re doing the whole thing. It will rip out the hair making it hurt.</li>
            <li> Horrible product! This mask is BLACK and it gets everywhere and stains when you peel it off. Though I did notice a minor decrease in blackheads, it was not worth the hassle and mess.</li>
            <li> I will return this item as its very harsh on your skin and drys it</li>
            <li> Works great but be VERY careful when you use this on sensitive parts of your skin. It hurts when you peel it off. Pain scale is equivalent to the sensation of waxing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once so far, but I really liked it. I usually use pore strips for my blackheads, and this helped slightly more. I will continue using it to see how well it will help clear out my face!</li>
            <li> Love this peel mask, great for blackheads and really satisfying to see all the gunk you can get out of your face.</li>
            <li> Really super for exfoliating</li>
            <li> Not great it&#x27;s fun to use but doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this because I have been wanting it for a while. The mask was easy to apply, however I was unsure how much to apply. Also, it was difficult to get off of my life. i had to scrub and use my finger nails in order for it to come off.</li>
            <li> I placed the mask on hoping for a Bjore type result and it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. Gave it to my daughter and son to have fun peeling this product off their faces. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Interesting product, but doesn&#x27;t work well at all... Disappointed</li>
            <li> THIS DID NOT COME WITH THE TOOL... SMH NOT HAPPY</li>
            <li> Dont see anything pulled out with the mask like the pictures. It just makes my face extremely dry</li>
            <li> The amount received is small when you need to apply to layers to work efficaciously it ends up going awful quickly</li>
            <li> Have only used once so far. Peeled easily. Could see dirt on mask after peeling. Did not burn my face as other products did. Face felt clean afterward</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let them fool you! It did not come with the extras. Only the mask.</li>
            <li> Works like it says and helps a lot</li>
            <li> It does a good job removing blackheads, but make sure to let it dry on your face completely as it is difficult to clean up, its like tar and difficult to clean it off anything, especially face towels....</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s awesome you can see a huge difference right when you peel it off. Just make sure to put a thick layer. I put on a thin layer then another thin on top but wasn&#x27;t thick enough but still did an amazing job I will definitely be buying more and for some friends as well!</li>
            <li> Great for ripping hairs out of your face, other than that it&#x27;s useless. DO NOT BUY! It&#x27;s messy, it gets everywhere and takes forever to get off your hands. Plus it never came with tool!</li>
            <li> Mask did not work for me.  It was fairly painful to peel off and I didn&#x27;t see any results.  Also, like other people have claimed, it came without the tool. Save your money.</li>
            <li> We used it once on my son.  Not sure it really did anything.  Will have to try again to make a more accurate review.</li>
            <li> i ordered this about a month or so ago, i just finished the bottle last night and to be honest, i was expecting a little bigger bottle but i wasnt too dissapointed. i was quite impressed with it at first but after the 8th time of using it, it started burning my face a little BUT it did remove some of the acne i had on my face which i was quite impressed with :) however, it did not remove much black heads:( i had to order something else for that. then again, that was just how it was for my skin! i say order this and try it out :)</li>
            <li> Have to lather on a lot had a hard time peeling, really liked the tool that came with. Need it in a bigger size</li>
