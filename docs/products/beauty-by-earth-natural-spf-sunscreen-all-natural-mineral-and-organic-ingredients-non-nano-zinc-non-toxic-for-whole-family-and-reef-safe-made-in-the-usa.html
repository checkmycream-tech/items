            <li>EXCELLENT NATURAL SUNSCREEN</li>
            <li>Suitable for anyone, all ages.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the natural ingredients, too.  </li>
            <li>It feels like I just put on some body lotion, honestly nothing more than that feeling.</li>
            <li>And this has been the best one I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>I have tried some natural sunscreens, but have not had the best luck.</li>
            <li>Oh and the bonus all natural and still smells delicious.</li>
            <li>It also smells devine, a nice bonus :)</li>
            <li>It does not have that greasy feel or toxic smell that so many drugstore brands or popular unscented brands have.  </li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>I love that it smells good and feels great on my skin and doesn&#x27;t have the greasy residue that sunblock normally has.</li>
            <li>It smells great and for what it&#x27;s worth, I like the packaging and design too. :)</li>
            <li>This is a nice organic sunscreen to use when you are out and about - nice and light, too.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Natural Sunscreen from Beauty by Earth and we are all very happy and satisfied after using this product.</li>
            <li>In general though it&#x27;s best to apply it every 60-90 mins if you are in and out of water along with drying yourself</li>
            <li>Very light and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li>So, I was very pleased to find this product by Beauty by Earth, which is a great (and natural) alternative.</li>
            <li>The product has a nice smell and it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It has a nice tropical scent, not too strong.  </li>
            <li>The smell is also nice, not too strong.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, organic and safe ingredients!</li>
            <li>Love the product- super fast shipping, qualitative packaged-smells wonderful and leaves the skin protected, hydrated and glowing.</li>
            <li>I have very fair sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of this sunblock!</li>
            <li>Better than all of the zinc sunscreens I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love these products.</li>
            <li>I put it mostly all over my son as well</li>
            <li>There is also the dangers in being in the sun without it though, so it solved that problem for me! :)</li>
            <li>so we used that one more.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a chemical smell like most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, love the ingredients.</li>
            <li>and I love how it looks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally safe and organic</li>
            <li>If you have a beard, it will not absorb as well and stand out more.</li>
            <li>But Definitely Love ThisSunscreen, I Use</li>
            <li>Badger brand is much better in comparison</li>
            <li>Even better, my daughter-in-law rubbed her brand on my granddaughter who started complaining almost immediately that her face was burning.</li>
            <li>I am going to try more products by them.</li>
            <li>LOVE this sun screen.</li>
            <li>Not too greasy and love that it&#x27;s safe to use without toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I would give it more stars, but just started using it.</li>
            <li>Sunscreen doesn&#x27;t get much better than this.</li>
            <li>You do have to reapply many times through the day if you get in and out of water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>.. love the smell..</li>
            <li>and I am allergic to most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen keeps me from burning without the rash no matter how many days I apply it in a row.</li>
            <li>Do you all really love it?  </li>
            <li>I also love the smell......</li>
            <li>better than most sunscreens out there   </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how much I love it.</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li>My kids and I love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I wish it rubbed in better.  </li>
            <li>and he is able to use this when he goes out fishing.  </li>
            <li>I had been researching sunscreen and and found that more than 75% of the sunscreens contained toxic chemicals that can increase your risk of cancer.</li>
            <li>And I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I have allergies to many sunscreen lotions.  </li>
            <li>and therefor I am more inclined to use it as I should.  </li>
            <li>Apply pea size amounts at a time and rub in desired area to avoid looking like a ghost. :)</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients and the non-toxic nature of this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>and I know the ingredients are healthy and non toxic.</li>
            <li>My skin feels healthy, smooth and loves this product!</li>
            <li>so you  can feel confident about putting it on your skin.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad  </li>
            <li>and I did not get burned nor did this product give me a rash as many sunscreens tend to do to me.  </li>
            <li>I got this product for my daughter because many sunscreens irritate her skin and we needed to try something else.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love that this is safe for the kiddos.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light tropical scent!  </li>
            <li>And it works. :)</li>
            <li>I love being able to go to the pool and not wonder about the chemicals that I am putting in my children and myself.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>, I think they just needed to rub it in better.</li>
            <li>I am tan, so I think it would be better for lighter skin, or use in the winter.  </li>
            <li>and my face burns when I use most sunscreen</li>
            <li>It seems that it is best to work in sections on your limbs, (e.g. upper arm, lower arm, etc.).  </li>
            <li>Now I am sure this probably needs to be re-applied.  </li>
            <li>but you just need to rub it in more</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t able to keep the sunscreen in a temperature controlled environment.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s refreshing.</li>
            <li>Keeping my skin healthy now and be a suave-looking gentleman</li>
            <li>I enjoyed that the oily feeling dissipates after an hour or so.</li>
            <li>Is good.iew and my skin feels nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>I love to play with my kids in the pool</li>
            <li>I am excited to use this more during the summer months!</li>
            <li>I think I have found my perfect daily wear combination for body.</li>
            <li>organic safe ingredients&lt;br /&gt;-Used</li>
            <li>That way, I know it would be absolutely safe for my children.</li>
            <li>So safe, I love that it can be used on Children!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>still looking for a safe sunscreen...</li>
            <li>Now she cannot do without it, hence my need for buying 3 more tubes.</li>
            <li>I used it for a week in Hawaii in and out of the water and got a nice light tan with no burn at all.  </li>
            <li>Most of all.....</li>
            <li>One of my favorite things about this sunscreen was its lack of &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>I really like this product in terms of the protection it provides, its great smell and price and its consistency when applying it on my face.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t have the chemical smell like most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>that is gender neutral and seems fitting for a sunscreen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Im in love with this product</li>
            <li>and I mostly use it on my face.</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves my skin prepped and ready for the application of my make up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll post more as I use it more.</li>
            <li>but I was thinking it would blend into the skin more.</li>
            <li>And the best part is that you don&#x27;t have to reapply until 4-5 hours later.  </li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>the seal on the box was intact, it is completely safe to use.</li>
            <li>Most sunscreen manufacturers do not put a seal on for this reason and we will not be going ahead, but it is still completely safe to use.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Nice light smell and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I really LOVE that I know it is safe to put on</li>
            <li>I love this one.</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are too many chemicals in the environment as it</li>
            <li>Totally safe for babies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product.  </li>
            <li>I actually knew what all the ingredients in this sunscreen were and it feels great!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>no sunburn and better yet.....</li>
            <li>the ingredients on others that claim to be Organic or Toxic Free!  </li>
            <li>LOVE that its all organic.</li>
            <li>I wanted to purchase something better for my skin.  </li>
            <li>okay, okay...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>but I still did not burn without applying more.</li>
            <li>Overall, we were very happy with this product - my husband did not have to worry about it hurting his skin</li>
            <li>It worked actually better than I thought;</li>
            <li>Love that it doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased to report that this did.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just used this product and love it.  </li>
            <li>Safe to put on&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this is all natural and the smell is very pleasant and not too strong.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant enough and it is effective, but I fell like I needed a putty knife to sparkle this on!</li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant, light, non-chemically scent and with all the natural ingredients it has, I don&#x27;t feel like I am putting something toxic on my skin as I do with most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>This is a very good sunscreen its thick and creamy goes on nice, smells good and blocks out the UV rays.</li>
            <li>That said, when I&#x27;m out in the bright California sun all day long I still need a protective layer that I can apply and I love that this is Organic!!</li>
            <li>It shows me exactly where I missed applying the sunscreen which is a plus for fair skinned people.</li>
            <li>I would definitely be interested in anything that is good for my skin and body.</li>
            <li>Super easy to apply, no mess, smells delicious and my kids love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried this product on myself and my 5 yr old daughter for our beach trip Friday and was very impressed with how lightweight yet powerful it was.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I easily burn and I also get itchy rashes from many products, but not from this.</li>
            <li>Excellent protect from sun light such as UV.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>The product did a very nice job, wasn&#x27;t white like most others I&#x27;ve tried, and smelled nice without being overly strong.  </li>
            <li>It is all natural and has a very light pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>natural with great ingredients</li>
            <li>In fact, not only is successfully protected from the sun, but her skin feels AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are fantastic, and won&#x27;t cause any allergic reactions like most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>But more importantly to that was finding a sunscreen that did not burn the kids eyes.</li>
            <li>This product is great if you are looking for a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear and has great ingredients.</li>
            <li>I was ready to give up on finding one that was good for us.  </li>
            <li>The problem is that I have very fair skin and even though I&#x27;ve seemed to build up this tolerance to burning easily unlike my younger self who could look redder than a stop sign within 10 minutes of being out in the Texas summer sun-</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, love the product, not greasy,Thank you! :)</li>
            <li>It has a mild pleasant scent to it which is much nicer than smelling like banana candy!</li>
            <li>Plus, this isn&#x27;t a huge con to me as I find it&#x27;s way more important to me to avoid skin cancer than it is to avoid pasty skin.</li>
            <li>Plus, this isn&#x27;t a huge con to me as I find it&#x27;s way more important to me to avoid skin cancer than it is to avoid pasty skin.</li>

            <li>I returned it because it was described as rubbing in easily, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>experience  with the sunscreen  was that it aplied easily.  </li>
            <li>Even with 50 SPF, I still tend to burn easily.</li>

            <li>I love the smell of the sunscreen, slightly sweet, but not overly scented.</li>
            <li>Finally a TOTALLY natural product that is effective!</li>
            <li>I live in Los Angeles, am fair skinned, and burn easily.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant odor that my 5-year old was fine with.</li>
            <li>Works fine</li>
            <li>And I was actually fine with the texture too, was worried about it after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>Absorbed really well and has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>and I felt confident when they didn&#x27;t have their own sunscreen I had something  that was safe and effective in general as well as  for kids and more sensitive types.</li>
            <li>I love that it is not only safe for you, but it is also safe for the environment!</li>

            <li>Rubs in smoothly and leaves no white residue and smells great.</li>
            <li>With all the horror stories I hear about mineral sunscreens leaving a white face, I think this one did a great job.</li>
            <li>Great if you are only going to the beach, or to a Halloween party.</li>
            <li>I do enjoy this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Light and non greasy... I recommend</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and quality ingredients.</li>

            <li>I especially appreciated the scent.  </li>

            <li>Does not go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>This product is thicker when compared to the chemical filled sunscreens I used to buy at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Wearing sunscreen is so important.</li>
            <li>it goes on smoothly.  </li>

            <li>and it was great, as he&#x27;s outside a lot.</li>

            <li>So far it has been good, but it hasn&#x27;t been summer yet.</li>
            <li>The good news is that my face and arms where I DID put on sunblock where totally unburned even after being out for many hours.</li>
            <li>so far so good</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a safe and natural sunscreen, that works and is cost effective.  </li>

            <li>natural is always good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>It just seems like you are doing more harm than help right?</li>
            <li>This is a high quality sunscreen that will keep your skin healthy!</li>
            <li>We all went out to the beach over the weekend and used it for the first time!!</li>
            <li>It is really important to me to not put any chemicals into my body, so that is why I originally bought this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>do not be dissuaded with SPF 25 listing as I found this sunscreen to work better than most SPF 50 that are high in chemicals.</li>
            <li>Decent price for a 4 oz. tube compared to other naturals and with the good performance we experienced.</li>
            <li>My new favorite sunscreen!</li>
            <li>My new favorite sunscreen!</li>
            <li>My new favorite sunscreen!  </li>
            <li>First it went on so nice, soaked right in and was not greasy at all and did not make me feel sticky like some sunscreen does.</li>
            <li>(I should totally know better, I am pretty fair and burn really easily.)</li>
            <li>friendly customer service.</li>
            <li>so I think it is worth it!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this sunscreen</li>
            <li>It seems the packaging and the original container has changed design/appearance.</li>
            <li>I used this yesterday for the first time and I love it.</li>
            <li>Nice smell -- not strong, but pleasant.</li>
            <li>and I received with the free shipping offer quickly.</li>
            <li>We have been very impressed with everything from the delicate &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; scent to the smooth application.  </li>
            <li>Goes on clean.</li>
            <li>I mix it with a different sunscreen that&#x27;s also good for daytime that blocks UVB and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It rubs in nicely too and is all natural!</li>
            <li>My 3 young daughters love how this smells!</li>
            <li>This natural, water resistant, biodegradable, and reef safe sunscreen is just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use sunscreen too often because my skin tone is a bit on the dark side which is great because I don&#x27;t burn easily because of it.</li>
            <li>special occasions</li>
            <li>This sunscreen had a very &#x27;dry&#x27; feeling after application which I am so happy with.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my 21 old daughter who has very light skin and burns easily; she has to wear sunscreen if she&#x27;s out in the sun at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels fresh and light in my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the store shelves are full of sun-screen products that work well, I would never buy them.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really sure how much to put</li>
            <li>Most sunscreens have a very distinctive sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m loving this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-Don&#x27;t need a lot to get full coverage</li>
            <li>However, I have found that this product, rubbed in well, makes my skin only the slightest degree paler and, surprisingly</li>
            <li>I did get this at a reduced price for a review but would buy at full price as well.</li>
            <li>After a full day in sun...</li>
            <li>I love that this product is really Organic.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s true).  </li>
            <li>and I loved that I could just rub it on my sons face with no concerns of what potential chemicals are entering his body.</li>
            <li>I recommend Chanel liquid (UV Essential), Shiesdo liquid, the more affordable Japanese Biore liquid Aqua rich (for a shimmery glow) and Japanese Biore Perfect face (for a more matte powdery finish).</li>
            <li>It has a pretty thick consistency but it absorbs quickly and leaves the skin feeling smooth and smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li>And seriously, it smells incredible!</li>
            <li>lovely for a sunscreen, especially if you plan on wearing it as an every day item (its not over-powering like most sunscreens)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only use physical (vs chemical sunscreen), and this one is great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good product for everyday use :)</li>
            <li>I have super senstive skin</li>
            <li>I will keep using it and love that it is all natural!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also super important that I see exactly where the sunscreen is being applied.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from cheap to high end, but this was fine for my face</li>
            <li>First , I get burned like no body&#x27;s beezwax if I don&#x27;t have fantastic sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I was alarmed when I first applied this lotion to my face, as it did not go on smoothly (it was lumpy).  </li>
            <li>but once you start applying it onto your skin it goes on pretty smooth.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, at the end of the weekend I was both breakout and sunburn free, so it actually worked!</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t have the other stuff most sunscreens have in it (another way of saying I am so happy I found it as it&#x27;s natural!)</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get good organic and natural sunscreen at most local stores.  </li>
            <li>My favorite benefit which I love about a physical sunscreen, is that once you put it on, you can go right out the door and not wait 20 - 30 minutes like chemical</li>
            <li>but I am happy to deal with that to avoid the harmful chemicals in previous products I have used.</li>
            <li>and my skin is dry, fair, and always irritated.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t sweat much, so I&#x27;m not sure how it holds up under that stress, but it was perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face which I have NEVER been able to do as I have very sensitive skin on my face or</li>
            <li>Love having a natural sunscreen I can use for my baby!</li>
            <li>I wore it and did not get sunburned in the hot Florida sun, so I recommend it to everyone!  </li>
            <li>This is the first sunscreen that I can identify everything on the label!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE that it has an all natural coconut smell!</li>
            <li>This is ORGANIC and is the FIRST sunscreen I can put on my Face (I have always had oily skin) and it DIDN&#x27;T break out!</li>
            <li>I love this all natural sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Sunscreen is extremely important to me as I have sensitive skin that burns easily.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at the light fresh smell and it rubs on easily.</li>
            <li>We had a great little kayak trip without any sunburn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but we all stayed sunburn free thanks to this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It smells and feels nice, goes on a bit white but with some rubbing becomes more clear.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it for the way it feels,  </li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using this, and it has a really nice smell to it too.</li>
            <li>The only thing I liked about it was that it stated it was &amp;</li>
            <li>1) Love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>Love it so far.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen is different from many currently available.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is natural, non-toxic and safe for the environment, should you be swimming in the ocean or a lake.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen was not only more affordable, it smelled better (really nice actually) and definitely spread better.</li>
            <li>received this for a reduced amount for giving a honest and personal review</li>
            <li>I love the all natural part of the product .  </li>
            <li>The smell is so nice that I actually look forward to using it!</li>
            <li>I am encouraged to find it available through Amazon Prime and will order more in the future.</li>
            <li>If you want a quality product with quality ingredients, this is worth every penny and some.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely love and recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for an all natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>fair skinned, spent a week in Florida and didn&#x27;t burn at all.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>I started looking for a more natural alternative.</li>
            <li>I love that this product is all natural.</li>
            <li>This one is the only one that doesn&#x27;t cause redness or any kind of irritation.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get burned,  Worth the $$.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>Love that it has natural, soothing ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I like that the sunscreen is all natural, with many beneficial oils.  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s worth it for me to have chemical-free sunscreen.</li>
            <li>We hope it was worth it to save the fish.</li>
            <li>This one has a nice scent, and although it DOES come out white, with some smoothing it does blend in.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was very pleased with Beauty by Earth&#x27;s Mineral Sunscreen; although I did not get to use it on the hottest day with the most direct sunlight, I could still generally assess most of its features.</li>
            <li>This product smells nice, and does not have chemicals, however it does leave a white residue.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely and makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>My kids have fun putting it on.  </li>
            <li>Glad to have found a natural sunscreen that works</li>
            <li>This has no harsh ingredients (so nice compared so many other junk sunscreens on the market), smells wonderful and it goes on nicely (not oily).</li>
            <li>This is true of all natural physical sunscreens and this one is more cosmetically elegant than anyone that I have tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is quite thick at first like a nice lotion but rubs in nicely.</li>
            <li>Noticed right away</li>
            <li>The manufacturers of this product got it right.</li>
            <li>It is just the right amount of protection.  </li>
            <li>When I apply it, it appears white at first, but when you rub it in, it blends in nicely.  </li>
            <li>It is thicker and a bit more opaque than a natural brand I&#x27;ve been using because of the higher spf content for people who don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li>I tried to sunscreen for the first time this past week while out on an all day bike tour on a beautiful sunny day.</li>
            <li>No burn, no bad reaction just pure reliable protection.</li>
            <li>It is very very effective and safe for my very sensitive facial skin, as I could never use any sunscreen earlier on until I stumbled on this on Amazon site.</li>
            <li>Really nothing special.</li>
            <li>I have lived in the sun for the past 12 years and this sunscreen works great.</li>
            <li>I used it on my face which is my true test as I really don&#x27;t like sunscreens that leave my face feeling oily or greasy.</li>
            <li>As far as appearance, it actually had more of a matte finish than most.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through so many different natural and organic sunscreens in hopes if finding something that rubs in a bit better</li>
            <li>Although I wish this didn&#x27;t go on so thick, I feel good about putting it on my skin because I know it is much safer than most products out there.</li>
            <li>Smells great, has a less glaring white glow than other natural blocks, &amp; works great!</li>
            <li>This product came at the exact right time.</li>
            <li>Upon first opening the bottle I knew I had ordered the right sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I use it on the top of my hands to protect from sun also and it feels very protective and soft.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to find a natural sunblock that the whole family can use.  </li>
            <li>I also break out easily from many products and at the same time I am very conscious about what I put on and in my body.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and would buy it again when I need a new batch :-)</li>
            <li>This sunscreen has a very natural and light scent, almost like something tropical.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic natural sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Makes me feel good knowing it is not full of carcinogens.</li>
            <li>I am really delighted to have found an organic, natural, mineral sunscreen I am willing to use daily.</li>
            <li>We are very fair-skinned, and I used to get sunburned a lot as a child, so I&#x27;m glad I found something safe that works for my children.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly, which makes applying it on kids a lot easier because they don&#x27;t have to wait while you rub a thick lotion in.  </li>
            <li>Third and lastly, the consistency is very nice and creamy and blends in very well!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not easy to find all natural, organic and cruelty free sunscreens and this one is by sure a fantastic choice!</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li>My friends tease because I look like a ghost :) another friend of mine uses Blue Lizard with similar results but it rubs in quickly and easily</li>
            <li>I am huge on organic and natural products.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Used this sunscreen for the first time this weekend on a family trip to Legoland.</li>
            <li>so you will see it first</li>
            <li>First of all, I trust this brand and the ingredients they use in their products.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>this is a great organic sun screen that I use for myself and my daughter when we are outside for a long time.</li>
            <li>You only need to rub a litte more.</li>
            <li>Only reason I&#x27;m not in love with this product, its not creamy and doesn&#x27;t apply or spread well.</li>
            <li>Wore it for the first time in LA out in the sun.</li>
            <li>I also love how it smells, I will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li>That was AFTER rubbing it in until I couldnt see the more obvious &amp;#34;just put sunscreen on&amp;#34; layer, and applied makeup.</li>
            <li>We saw many others with white layers of sunscreen</li>
            <li>When I went in the pool, the white became more noticeable.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really only 3 more seconds of your time to get it on</li>
            <li>The first  time I used it</li>
            <li>Will use it up, but most likely not buy again.</li>
            <li>I really like the fresh, tropical scent of this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>and I really feel like this sunscreen stayed on and in place while I play and have fun.</li>
            <li>sure whether it&#x27;s actually water-resistant?  </li>
            <li>Had to do 3 hours of work in 95 degree LA sun and put this sunscreen on first.</li>
            <li>I have even advertised it to many friends, just that they do not appreciate the way it makes the face looking white after application.</li>
            <li>If there are more than 5 stars I would give double.</li>
            <li>It works really well too!</li>
            <li>Worked perfectly in hot Caribbean,</li>
            <li>I love it because it protects her well, and doesn&#x27;t make her look &#x27;white&#x27;.</li>
            <li>If your skin is very white, you should be okay with it.</li>
            <li>It did look whitish at first</li>
            <li>my skin can still breath and i am still no burn after the hot sunshine . .</li>
            <li>Looks like white paint on my skin :)</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done my research and anything higher</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>They seem to really care about their products and their customers!</li>
            <li>so I am pretty picky about my sunscreens...</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have bought this product.  </li>
            <li>i will definitely be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li>must at home from now on!!&lt;br /&gt;Really really recommend it!</li>
            <li>My wife disliked the viscosity property, as she is use to putting a good dollop on one spot and spreading it.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and treat your body to some GOOD all-natural reef-safe sunscreen this summer (and all-year &#x27;round, because you know...</li>
            <li>Very natural and clean smell</li>
            <li>found my new favorite natural day to day 15 sunscreen (every morning at sea) at trader joes, forget the name.</li>
            <li>I felt like it really covered every area of my skin accurately, and it did NOT irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>We were fine without reapplication, but I still reapplied after a few hours in the water just to be safe.</li>
            <li>According to the label, the fragrance is natural, which is rare!  </li>
            <li>It is full of natural oils and extracts!</li>
            <li>It smells good and initially when you put it on it feels like your face gets a bit white</li>
            <li>Thanks Beauty Earth for creating something healthy enough to use!</li>
            <li>Now that I know how much to use it&#x27;s not like it was the first time</li>
            <li>Second I got such a nice golden tan.</li>
            <li>too small but product is good.</li>
            <li>I also love that it is SPF 25, not too high (50) and not too low (10).</li>
            <li>and she didn&#x27;t even get a slight burn or color which means it did an AMAZING job blocking the sun.</li>
            <li>It is very white and does not spread easily.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and oily skin.</li>
            <li>Also my skin is super sensitive and I have not had an increase in breakouts because of it.</li>
            <li>Not so easy to apply, need to rub the white paste intensively.</li>
            <li>While he too did not receive even a hint of sunburn, it definitely did not soak up into his skin as easily as it went into mine.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too strong, just enough to feel like it is time for a vacation.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice clean subtle scent, not perfumy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a very smooth texture and not real greasy like</li>
            <li>Based on reviews from other buyers, I purchased it and so far am very pleased with the texture and scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s very important to use a topical, not chemical, sunscreen, especially since I&#x27;m a nursing mom and very conscious about what gets absorbed (or doesn&#x27;t!)</li>
            <li>I used it skiing at a very high altitude and it worked for me the whole time out, without having to reapply.  </li>
            <li>It seriously is great and it is all-natural and great for those that have an allergy to all the nasty chemical-laden sunscreens on the market.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>One bottle of this stuff lasted me for a whole week of a cruise and a whole week in Florida.</li>
            <li>cheap and affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to your product, I&#x27;ll have white face.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>Both worked very well.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some stuff has so much alcohol that it evaporates</li>
            <li>Works really well to prevent a sun burn.</li>
            <li>And you need to dab it all over your face and gently rub in otherwise</li>
            <li>Thanks~</li>
            <li>VERY.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need nearly as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li>This suncreen really works.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I learned just not to use too much</li>
            <li>I was able to work in the sun in my garden without getting even pink for a change.  </li>
            <li>Very creamy.</li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>Very responsive.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t describe it, but it&#x27;s absolutely divine and very understated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>sunscreen products but my daughter burned as much with them on as she did with no sunscreen at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>id much rather pay for this, than pay for junk that leads to cancer or to pay an oncologist to treat cancer....</li>
            <li>and I used to much</li>
            <li>and it absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;re going to have very splotchy skin afterwards all the spots you messed.</li>
            <li>I put a lot of time into trying to find a sunscreen that was chemical free and would not leave me with a white overcast.</li>
            <li>It protects our skin very well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I am light completed and and have not burned one time since wearing it for the last week.</li>
            <li>le&#x27;ts be real.</li>
            <li>The Sunscreen worked very well for me and helped me to really mitigate the effect of the Kuwait sun rays on my face.</li>
            <li>My skin felt much softer after using it.</li>
            <li>I would really like to see a &amp;#34;tinted&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>And I could also stem from the fact I probably used too much.</li>
            <li>And the best part is you don&#x27;t have to worry about having dangerous chemicals on</li>
            <li>It has protected my skin very well from the sun</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>and I love that I am using a product that is free of dangerous chemicals and safe for the whole family to use.</li>
            <li>As a cancer survivor, I&#x27;m very concerned about what goes on my skin.  </li>
            <li>and it works for the whole family.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>this sunscreen is very moisture</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for you and your kids!</li>
            <li>I really like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I never end up using a whole bottle of sunscreen each summer</li>
            <li>It was shipped fast.</li>
            <li>and after I put it on, I felt like I really had a &#x27;layer&#x27; of protection on my face.    </li>
            <li>and I really noticed a difference as well in how my face felt after using it.</li>
            <li>The addition of zinc and titanium oxide really make a difference.</li>
            <li>We were outside from 10am until 4pm in the direct sun for most of the day.</li>
            <li>Plus, I love the natural smells from the essential oil!</li>
            <li>After that, her mom made sure to only use the BbyE Natural Sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I am not a big sunscreen person myself, but my daughter is 1 yrs old and has red hair and fair skin.</li>
            <li>I love having a natural sunscreen that will actually work.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients, especially with the kids in mind.</li>
            <li>Love the natural and simple ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have tried SO MANY different sunscreens with my kids (they are 4 and 2 years old).  </li>
            <li>It lasted a long time and was fairly easy to apply.</li>
            <li>They are full of chemicals that have been directly linked to cancer.&lt;br /&gt;Seems illogical to apply sunscreen to prevent skin cancer when the chemicals in the sunscreen have been directly linked to cancer!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me a long time to find a product that is natural, free of harsh chemicals and most importantly -</li>
            <li>Beware that it is very chalky and due to zinc oxide does leave whit residue on top of skin but will eventually absorb into skin.</li>
            <li>I found that I really don&#x27;t even have to reapply often.smells great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and the smell is very subtle and nice.</li>
            <li>I have a red-headed toddler who requires sunscreen any time we are spending a significant amount of time outdoors (which is often living in Southern California!).</li>
            <li>It has a rich texture; therefore, making it a product that doesn&#x27;t need to be constantly reapplied.</li>
            <li>This is better than some other zinc creams which makes everyone look like a ghost.  </li>
            <li>I love their other products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots, and I means lots of different sunscreens, and I love that this one is not only is chemical free but that it has a smooth creamy texture that blends into my face with just a little rubbing.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the new permanent sunscreen for my family!</li>
            <li>In general trust physical sunscreens much more than chemical.</li>
            <li>I have small grandchildren and can feel good about using this on them also because it is all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>One of my daughter has a problematic skin (very dry) but the sunscreen is gentle and easy on her skin.</li>
            <li>After reading the other reviews, I thought I&#x27;d found my favorite new sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Seems pretty natural to me.</li>
            <li>I am pretty fair-skinned, and even being in and out of direct sun all day, I didn&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
            <li>So I had to pay the full price for this last purchase.  </li>
            <li>One thing true about this product is that it is definitely water resistant.</li>
            <li>Firstly, I bought it because i wanted an all natural sunscreen for myself and my son.</li>
            <li>The 100 ml bottle lasted the two of us a full week of daily repeated use though.</li>
            <li>One tiny problem is that it takes hours to fade the white color after applying them on your face, but it&#x27;s good overall.</li>
            <li>Maybe this wouldnt matter if you are only using it outside/for sport, but I had planned on using it as a very light protective layer (it is only 25 SPF, after all)&lt;br /&gt;-Greasy</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a decent chemical free sunscreen for a long time.</li>
            <li>I live in a California city that often gets to 115 fahrenheit!</li>
            <li>Well, it spreads easier than other physical sunscreens; the smell is nice, although a bit intense</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really not good at all for the face, but it is a great general sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The less chemical exposure the better.</li>
            <li>Less is more, just have patience and apply it in advance.</li>
            <li>I really like that it really is made of natural products-</li>
            <li>Good product, especially for heavily exposed areas - ears, nose, neck.  </li>
            <li>At last a natural- chemical free sunscreen without all that toxic nastiness.</li>
            <li>It does most definitely start out white</li>
            <li>Really liked this sunscreen,especially because I am rest assured that it comes from natural ingredients with no harmful and harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>The only time that I found it left residue was in places I wasn&#x27;t fully able to reach and just sort of slapped it on.</li>
            <li>I am very happy to have found this brand as I have been diligently working on getting chemicals out of my house and this is finally a product I do not have to feel guilty about putting on my children.</li>
            <li>Nice, light scent -- not at all a stereotypical &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>I only needed to use 1x in morning and would last most of day in Puerto Rico.</li>
            <li>It was such a mild day</li>
            <li>I got the product pretty fast and have been using it, I have sensitive skin and this cream does not give me irritation like other products I used before, my skin feels clean and moisturized, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlikely most other suncreams it offers full protection to all uses instantly without you having to wait the 30-45mins &#x27;Protection activation time&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on  GOOEY WHITE with only an SPF 25 rating it is not worthwhile for anyone with a very fair skin</li>
            <li>I may have put a little bit too much sunscreen on, as I looked a little ghost-like for the first part of the day until it seemed to fully &amp;#34;absorb&amp;#34; and spread more smoothly across my skin.</li>
            <li>A lot of sunblocks are very oily, and if you apply it when you&#x27;re at the park or the pool, your hands feel so gross, but with this one, I don&#x27;t have to wash my hands right after</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a white layer as so many other all natural sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>This is non-chemically, high % minerals, not oily sunscreen that does what I need it to.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchasing this product and keeping it in your home.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is a little pasty as most zinc based sunscreens are.  </li>
            <li>I tried a little more-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s active ingredients are titanium dioxide and zinc oxide which are safe natural sunscreens, not</li>
            <li>Also, it has a very light, almost mousse like consistency, which is a nice change from many natural sunscreens that can be thick and difficult to get out of the container and to apply.  </li>
            <li>I need natural for how much I put sunblock on my tattoos</li>
            <li>I really like this sunscreen because it has all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Really appreciate the natural feel of it.</li>
            <li>I really like how this sunscreen is comprised of all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick and greasy like a lot of sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>I do not think the effort is too much, considering that this is a natural product that is using non-nano zinc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that all the ingredients are natural and it still gives SPF 25</li>
            <li>I work out in the sun 10 hours a day and since I am a frequent user of sunscreen I was really looking for something that would make a difference.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally review.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t have the harsh chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>Now, instead of buying several different kinds, for myself and my children, I feel safe to put this product on my young ones.  </li>
            <li>Normally I will go home and wash my face after wearing sunscreens as they tend to feel greasy and also cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>This is actually a good thing because it means it isn&#x27;t small enough particles to absorb all the way into your skin.</li>
            <li>and I wish you big success in the business.</li>
            <li>I normally break out after using any sunscreen on my face.</li>
            <li>It will be nice for days I have to spend a lot of time in the sun and don&#x27;t want to reapply thick lotion all day.</li>
            <li>Nice consistency, not too liquid, but not too thick to it applies easily&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>I love that has organic ingredients and the tube last long imd too!</li>
            <li>It works fine under or over the other moisturizers I used it with as well.  </li>
            <li>says even thought it&#x27;s a solid sunscreen that it isn&#x27;t visible on the skin, but it is slightly visible, kind of an opalescent look to your skin where it is applied, but I didn&#x27;t find that objectionable.  </li>
            <li>The way they are blended with the other natural ingredients shows that Beauty by Earth is really concerned about making a chemical free sunscreen for its customers.</li>
            <li>It is easy to rub in, has a very slight, pleasant smell and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>This is my very first purchase by this company and I will definitely continue buying their natural products that contain no harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>I just use it on my face mostly, but trying to cover your whole self for the beach would be pretty tough and take a lot of blending, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It felt kind of thick, and it shows up white on my skin at first.</li>
            <li>New to this produce.</li>
            <li>We live in Florida so are outdoors all the time.</li>
            <li>We live at the beach and go through a ton of sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and subtle.</li>
            <li>As far as price is concerned, this is the classic case of you pay for what you get.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it as much as I&#x27;ve planned to because I have not been outside much.</li>
            <li>has a smooth feel and sinks in to skin leaving it soft but without any oily or sticky residue.</li>
            <li>Really nice subtle smell.  </li>
            <li>You are left with a light sheen (i.e., it&#x27;s not totally matte).</li>
            <li>This is the first natural sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried and I was leery because I do tend to burn when I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li>I used to get an uncomfortable burning, prickly sensation on top of hands when they were exposed to the rays of the sun -- especially in intense heat.  </li>
            <li>Wow Wow Wow!!!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Bought this product for two weeks of snorkeling in Fiji and found that not only did it do well protecting the reef, but it very much protected my skin.</li>
            <li>Used this on my very sensitive skinned child and it worked well.</li>
            <li>I am highly allergic to every sunblock I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>also used it on my face, which is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way and it keeps my kiddos skin safe from the sun!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m hoping that they come out with one that has a higher SPF, but can maintain the same quality.</li>
            <li>and it was the first time I was outside like that this year.</li>
            <li>: Aside from the color issue on my face, it felt greasy no matter where I put it, and continued to make my skin more greasy than usual as I wore it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had purchased this, as I mentioned, to wear as an &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; basic level, and stick with my higher SPF during activities, but I wont be using this again.</li>
            <li>It looks white when you first rub it in</li>
            <li>and I think I have tried every sensitive skin sunblock that ever existed!  </li>
            <li>: This is a lot thicker or more viscous than ordinary sun screen.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li>at first looks white but then absorbs</li>
            <li>ENTER Natural Sunscreen by Earth!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a physical sunscreen and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.  </li>
            <li>This afternoon I applied Beauty by Earth Natural Sunscreen and walked out in a Los Angeles heat wave (102 degrees!)</li>
            <li>After using this sunscreen for several days, I noticed my skin did not feel as hot to the touch nor did it seem to feel as if it was burning.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easy and a little gets a lot of coverage.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, but does leave a slight whitish tint as any natural sunscreen will.</li>
            <li>The only drawback that I found was that it was extremely hard for me to rub it in enough so that I didn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;ghostlike.&amp;#34;  Very nice scent, and I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in a well labeled, eco friendly, thin cardboard box and inside contains an attractive black and white 118ml /</li>
            <li>It requires some additional rubbing to get rid of the white residue, but this is because it is more natural than other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>I live by this for myself and my children because it&#x27;s totally natural.</li>
            <li>I found it; this will be our only sunscreen for as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>I love that this is a small family company that is dedicated to making a high-quality natural product.</li>
            <li>I have major major issues with your typical suncreens found in most grocery stores...</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT, DOES NOT LEAVE OUR FACE AS WHITE AS OTHER PRODUCTS!</li>
            <li>but this is one I would definitely recommend to people who do have skin problems and are allergic to certain products.</li>
            <li>It spreads easily and does not leave me all pasty white like some other zinc based sunscreens.</li>
            <li>It does not rub in completely clear (but almost).</li>
            <li>and it then becomes clear.</li>
            <li>I could clearly see where I had the cream on and where I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The only thing I can complain about so far is, yes it absorbs fast</li>
            <li>All natural.</li>
            <li>I used this today with my 4.5 month old baby</li>
            <li>All the natural ingredients, protect my skin from sunburn.</li>
            <li>I LIke Natural Products</li>
            <li>yes this is natural, yes it does not rub in that well,</li>
            <li>I bought this because it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li>I like that this is a natural sunscreen</li>
            <li>We washed it off and applied the BbyE Natural Sunscreen on and it soothed the burning situation.</li>
            <li>so I am always looking for a natural Sunscreen to prevent sunburns.  </li>
            <li>you for introducing me to a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I use this on myself and my 10 month old son.</li>
            <li>No skin reactions on myself nor my 10 month old, and my skin is quite sensitive.</li>
            <li>So it is gentle enough to use on children.  </li>
            <li>I really like this sunscreen, initially it takes some rubbing in but it lasts all day, even in the pool.</li>
            <li>UPDATE :   used this natural sunscreen on my face in Aruba.   </li>
            <li>I ordered this sunscreen because it is organic and natural</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend to everyone but especially mothers and fathers.</li>
            <li>He has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>We had 4 people use this natural sunscreen and none of us had any burns whatsoever after the week was over.</li>
            <li>It can leave you looking white if you put on too much.</li>
            <li>It does go on white, but it is very soothing to my skin.</li>
            <li>It is natural and it works well.  </li>
            <li>I like this sunscreen because it is all natural without harmful chemicals and nano</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying one for sensitive skin now.</li>
            <li>I got this product for a vacation because my husband has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far, it seems to protect my skin well.  </li>
            <li>I am still on the search for a natural sunscreen that spreads like California Baby without the nano particles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I bought it to try out on my 4 year old son.</li>
            <li>This one is much easier to put on and has similar ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for an all natural sunscreen that didn&#x27;t contain any nano particles or have any synthetic chemical fragrances in it, and I found it with this one.</li>
            <li>I smell like a classy man who knows what&#x27;s up.</li>
            <li>I have relatively sensitive skin, and have applied this product to my face without any breakouts.</li>
            <li>It is all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain nano particles like the rest.</li>
            <li>It is a challenge to find a sunscreen that has natural organic ingredients and is fragrance-free.</li>
            <li>works well and does rub in completely, I run in it and have not had eye problems even though it goes on my forehead</li>
            <li>Leaves skin white no matter how much rubbing is done.</li>
            <li>I was in search  of an all natural sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It offered protection using  natural and organic ingredients and did not contain any nano-particles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used once, don&#x27;t go out that much.  </li>
            <li>You can keep it as light or heavy as you like.  </li>
            <li>so I got worried and contacted the company directly.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this product and feel protected in the sun.</li>
            <li>I like that it is a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It is all natural and water resistant.</li>
            <li>i save it for the longer days in direct sun, nose and lips.&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li>The ingredients are natural and I appreciate that.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased a couple all natural sunscreens including burt&#x27;s bees that didn&#x27;t rub in AT ALL.  </li>
            <li>I had almost given up trying to find an all natural sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>, I like that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and so far no issues.</li>
            <li>Scent is natural and pleasing to the senses.</li>
            <li>try to use natural things whenever I can</li>
            <li>and I were in the water and direct sun all day at the beach for hours.</li>
            <li>I took this on a recent trip to Hawaii and thought it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>My husband often ended up with white on his face or neck when he started to sweat, but I think he was using too much.  </li>
            <li>No allergic reaction for me - happened to me once with a natural sunscreen..</li>
            <li>I used it while on vacation near Cancun since it is reef-safe and</li>
            <li>and I also feel at peace knowing it is a safe product to apply everyday for me and my entire family.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen is my &#x27;go to&#x27; from here on out...not greasy and just thick enough to rub in and create a nice barrier.  </li>
            <li>Also, for others be aware that&lt;br /&gt;the product is very thick and NOT so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thick and doesn&#x27;t spread easily, so I recommend spreading on your hands first and then applying it to your body.</li>
            <li>It filled the 100 ml bottle and there was hardly anything left in the original bottle (no way there was 1/3 of the contents left).</li>
            <li>(titanium/zinc sunscreens are always a little think and need a little rubbing to get on, but this one is pretty good - I have tried &amp;#62;10 other kinds).  </li>
            <li>Love this product, especially for my little ones!  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way so that is a huge plus!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the seal was slightly offset when I opened the top, so they may want to consider a different type of seal.</li>
            <li>Really nice sunscreen, but not good for a daily face lotion under makeup.</li>
            <li>I only wish the bottle (4 oz.) would be a bit bigger! ;-)</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the product, and a little but goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels heavy on the face as it lasts long all day for me.</li>
            <li>it felt different than others in that it wasn&#x27;t watered down and went on smooth.</li>
            <li>This is very sticky and super hard to apply evenly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure many of you know what I mean when I say that most typical grocery store brands have a very distinct and slightly irritating smell which is not pleasant.</li>
            <li>This has high levels of the minerals that physically block the UVA rays...</li>
            <li>second, I love it enough to use it on my little organic-only-eating-babies.  </li>
            <li>It took quite a bit of rubbing to dissolve the texture into a smooth consistency and work in the stark white cream, so that my natural skin tone appeared.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s normal to have to reapply, especially when swimming.  </li>
            <li>Does have to be rubbed in more so than a typical chemical sunscreen due to the zinc</li>
            <li>and this is now my new go to sunscreen which I apply 4-6 times daily.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier especially because I live in Hawaii</li>
            <li>It does apply with a white tint, but the key is to not use too much and spread it around.</li>
            <li>Very white at first, but fades (although not completely) with time.</li>
            <li>On light colored skins (Caucasian) it does not turn your skin white unless applied too heavy.</li>
            <li>I was worried about this bottle lasting me the whole vacation, but I still have plenty left over.</li>
            <li>It is very water resistant several hours later</li>
            <li>I loved the idea of using a product with natural SPF, however this was a disappointment.  </li>
            <li>I got a bottle of this sunscreen because I&#x27;m pregnant and don&#x27;t want harsh chemicals and toxins being transferred to me or my baby.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen works better than any commercial chemical cocktail and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I ended up mixing it with some other oils and a little foundation to be able to use it.  </li>
            <li>but this is a major shortcoming in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new sunscreen because the other organic one I was using was super expensive and a real pain to spread, particularly on my three-year-old who doesn&#x27;t really have patience for sunscreen.</li>
            <li>but it absorbed after a little while of being in the sun.</li>
            <li>I waited to write this review until I could test this sunscreen in a tropical climate, and it worked for me as well as others in my family with different skin types, although, as other reviewers have noted,  white residue remains after the sunscreen dries, especially when more is used, but that is a minor matter, because it is not drying or sticky.</li>
            <li>I got this sunscreen because I do not like to put chemicals on my face and on my skin in general.</li>
            <li>I have had skin cancer three times, but have generally resisted wearing sunscreen daily because I either didn&#x27;t want to use the chemical kinds or because the ones natural ones containing zinc made me look like a walking ghost.  </li>
            <li>After a couple weeks of daily use (and a lot of hiking), I developed some pimples on my neck and chest area (and I&#x27;ve never been prone to acne in these places), so I figured the sunscreen was the cause.</li>
            <li>I only use natural sunscreens</li>
            <li>I will only use natural sunscreen and I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li>The only one so far that I can use is chalky and costly.  </li>
            <li>My children and I have sensitive skin ,especially around the face and neck area</li>
            <li>I was only out in the direct sun for a couple of hours and needed a break from the sun</li>
            <li>I have been looking for an all natural sunscreen and finally found it!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural sunscreen that wasn&#x27;t chalky &amp; that I would actually want to use.</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>I only apply all natural creams on my face and body so thats why I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li>Will never go back to the old stuff.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for an organic - natural sunscreen and finally found it.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it once so far, but wanted to give a review on it.</li>
            <li>(I have sensitive skin), especially if you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin with that white look that natural sunscreen has, just FYI.</li>
            <li>If anyone is looking for a true sun block, then look no more.</li>
            <li>Is a bit thick and goes on white, but with a bit of rubbing, the white mostly goes away.  </li>
            <li>leaves a slight blue white residue on wheat colored skin (so take a pass on special occasions or when you will be photographed)&lt;br /&gt;expensive</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a natural sunblock that isn&#x27;t super gunky/sticky after it&#x27;s been applied.</li>
            <li>While it isn&#x27;t oily it is thick and rubs in dry creating more of a creamy complexion on skin.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, there are other natural easier-to-apply sunscreens in this price range (recently tried and really like the Beyond Coastal products).</li>
            <li>We have been trying several different natural sunscreens this summer to avoid all the harmful chemicals, while still protecting our skin from harmful rays!  </li>
            <li>It takes a little more time to apply to the skin (I&#x27;m assuming because of the all natural ingredients rather than the usual greasy sunscreens that just glide on)</li>
            <li>I bought it to wear on my face since I am really, really, really allergic to chemical sunscreens and certain common ingredients.</li>
            <li>As a naturally sweaty person, this was even more difficult for me as the day wore on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t break out a single time, and I have very sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I felt I had to use more of it than other mineral sunscreens because it was hard to spread.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is that it is not very easy to rub in and it will leave a white residue on your skin at first, but eventually will soak in.</li>
            <li>I already look like a ghost as I&#x27;m pretty pale.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really white &amp; thick, as much or more than other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to waste any more money on other brands, this one works, and it&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s fine for me.</li>
            <li>My suggestion is to apply less so that your skin will fully absorb the sunscreen -- this way you won&#x27;t look much whiter and chalkier after you put it on.</li>
            <li>and I swear my fine lines/ few wrinkles are looking less noticible.</li>
            <li>While on vacation in Florida this past week, we used Beauty Natural Sunscreen and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>And my son who got a full slathering was totally unburned, not even a little pink.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product because it is safe and will last a long time due to the fact that you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li>So much in fact that I was a little self-conscious about it.</li>
            <li>It can be hard to spread when your skin is a little wet, but it was extremely effective.</li>
            <li>I really like this sunscreen, it does leave a little white cast however.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a handful of different methods of application over the past couple of months, thinking I just needed to figure out the &amp;#34;trick&amp;#34; to this natural sunscreen in particular, but I&#x27;m done trying.</li>
            <li>it is not as bad as most, isn&#x27;t too oily, hasn&#x27;t caused breakouts and feels very moisturizing on skin.</li>

            <li> It feels like I just put on some body lotion, honestly nothing more than that feeling.</li>
            <li> And this has been the best one I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> I have tried some natural sunscreens, but have not had the best luck.</li>
            <li> Oh and the bonus all natural and still smells delicious.</li>
            <li> It also smells devine, a nice bonus :)</li>
            <li> It does not have that greasy feel or toxic smell that so many drugstore brands or popular unscented brands have.  </li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I love that it smells good and feels great on my skin and doesn&#x27;t have the greasy residue that sunblock normally has.</li>
            <li> It smells great and for what it&#x27;s worth, I like the packaging and design too. :)</li>
            <li> This is a nice organic sunscreen to use when you are out and about - nice and light, too.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Natural Sunscreen from Beauty by Earth and we are all very happy and satisfied after using this product.</li>
            <li> In general though it&#x27;s best to apply it every 60-90 mins if you are in and out of water along with drying yourself</li>
            <li> Very light and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li> So, I was very pleased to find this product by Beauty by Earth, which is a great (and natural) alternative.</li>
            <li> The product has a nice smell and it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It has a nice tropical scent, not too strong.  </li>
            <li> The smell is also nice, not too strong.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, organic and safe ingredients!</li>
            <li> Love the product- super fast shipping, qualitative packaged-smells wonderful and leaves the skin protected, hydrated and glowing.</li>
            <li> I have very fair sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of this sunblock!</li>
            <li> Better than all of the zinc sunscreens I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love these products.</li>
            <li> I put it mostly all over my son as well</li>
            <li> There is also the dangers in being in the sun without it though, so it solved that problem for me! :)</li>
            <li> so we used that one more.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a chemical smell like most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love the ingredients.</li>
            <li> and I love how it looks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally safe and organic</li>
            <li> If you have a beard, it will not absorb as well and stand out more.</li>
            <li> But Definitely Love ThisSunscreen, I Use</li>
            <li> Badger brand is much better in comparison</li>
            <li> Even better, my daughter-in-law rubbed her brand on my granddaughter who started complaining almost immediately that her face was burning.</li>
            <li> I am going to try more products by them.</li>
            <li> LOVE this sun screen.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy and love that it&#x27;s safe to use without toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I would give it more stars, but just started using it.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen doesn&#x27;t get much better than this.</li>
            <li> You do have to reapply many times through the day if you get in and out of water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> .. love the smell..</li>
            <li> and I am allergic to most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen keeps me from burning without the rash no matter how many days I apply it in a row.</li>
            <li> Do you all really love it?  </li>
            <li> I also love the smell......</li>
            <li> better than most sunscreens out there   </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how much I love it.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My kids and I love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I wish it rubbed in better.  </li>
            <li> and he is able to use this when he goes out fishing.  </li>
            <li> I had been researching sunscreen and and found that more than 75% of the sunscreens contained toxic chemicals that can increase your risk of cancer.</li>
            <li> And I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I have allergies to many sunscreen lotions.  </li>
            <li> and therefor I am more inclined to use it as I should.  </li>
            <li> Apply pea size amounts at a time and rub in desired area to avoid looking like a ghost. :)</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients and the non-toxic nature of this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> and I know the ingredients are healthy and non toxic.</li>
            <li> My skin feels healthy, smooth and loves this product!</li>
            <li> so you  can feel confident about putting it on your skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad  </li>
            <li> and I did not get burned nor did this product give me a rash as many sunscreens tend to do to me.  </li>
            <li> I got this product for my daughter because many sunscreens irritate her skin and we needed to try something else.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love that this is safe for the kiddos.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light tropical scent!  </li>
            <li> And it works. :)</li>
            <li> I love being able to go to the pool and not wonder about the chemicals that I am putting in my children and myself.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> , I think they just needed to rub it in better.</li>
            <li> I am tan, so I think it would be better for lighter skin, or use in the winter.  </li>
            <li> and my face burns when I use most sunscreen</li>
            <li> It seems that it is best to work in sections on your limbs, (e.g. upper arm, lower arm, etc.).  </li>
            <li> Now I am sure this probably needs to be re-applied.  </li>
            <li> but you just need to rub it in more</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t able to keep the sunscreen in a temperature controlled environment.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s refreshing.</li>
            <li> Keeping my skin healthy now and be a suave-looking gentleman</li>
            <li> I enjoyed that the oily feeling dissipates after an hour or so.</li>
            <li> Is good.iew and my skin feels nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> I love to play with my kids in the pool</li>
            <li> I am excited to use this more during the summer months!</li>
            <li> I think I have found my perfect daily wear combination for body.</li>
            <li> organic safe ingredients&lt;br /&gt;-Used</li>
            <li> That way, I know it would be absolutely safe for my children.</li>
            <li> So safe, I love that it can be used on Children!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> still looking for a safe sunscreen...</li>
            <li> Now she cannot do without it, hence my need for buying 3 more tubes.</li>
            <li> I used it for a week in Hawaii in and out of the water and got a nice light tan with no burn at all.  </li>
            <li> Most of all.....</li>
            <li> One of my favorite things about this sunscreen was its lack of &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> I really like this product in terms of the protection it provides, its great smell and price and its consistency when applying it on my face.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t have the chemical smell like most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> that is gender neutral and seems fitting for a sunscreen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im in love with this product</li>
            <li> and I mostly use it on my face.</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves my skin prepped and ready for the application of my make up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll post more as I use it more.</li>
            <li> but I was thinking it would blend into the skin more.</li>
            <li> And the best part is that you don&#x27;t have to reapply until 4-5 hours later.  </li>
            <li> and I love</li>
            <li> the seal on the box was intact, it is completely safe to use.</li>
            <li> Most sunscreen manufacturers do not put a seal on for this reason and we will not be going ahead, but it is still completely safe to use.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Nice light smell and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I really LOVE that I know it is safe to put on</li>
            <li> I love this one.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are too many chemicals in the environment as it</li>
            <li> Totally safe for babies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product.  </li>
            <li> I actually knew what all the ingredients in this sunscreen were and it feels great!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> no sunburn and better yet.....</li>
            <li> the ingredients on others that claim to be Organic or Toxic Free!  </li>
            <li> LOVE that its all organic.</li>
            <li> I wanted to purchase something better for my skin.  </li>
            <li> okay, okay...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> but I still did not burn without applying more.</li>
            <li> Overall, we were very happy with this product - my husband did not have to worry about it hurting his skin</li>
            <li> It worked actually better than I thought;</li>
            <li> Love that it doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased to report that this did.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just used this product and love it.  </li>
            <li> Safe to put on&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is all natural and the smell is very pleasant and not too strong.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant enough and it is effective, but I fell like I needed a putty knife to sparkle this on!</li>
            <li> It has a very pleasant, light, non-chemically scent and with all the natural ingredients it has, I don&#x27;t feel like I am putting something toxic on my skin as I do with most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> This is a very good sunscreen its thick and creamy goes on nice, smells good and blocks out the UV rays.</li>
            <li> That said, when I&#x27;m out in the bright California sun all day long I still need a protective layer that I can apply and I love that this is Organic!!</li>
            <li> It shows me exactly where I missed applying the sunscreen which is a plus for fair skinned people.</li>
            <li> I would definitely be interested in anything that is good for my skin and body.</li>
            <li> Super easy to apply, no mess, smells delicious and my kids love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried this product on myself and my 5 yr old daughter for our beach trip Friday and was very impressed with how lightweight yet powerful it was.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I easily burn and I also get itchy rashes from many products, but not from this.</li>
            <li> Excellent protect from sun light such as UV.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> The product did a very nice job, wasn&#x27;t white like most others I&#x27;ve tried, and smelled nice without being overly strong.  </li>
            <li> It is all natural and has a very light pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> natural with great ingredients</li>
            <li> In fact, not only is successfully protected from the sun, but her skin feels AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are fantastic, and won&#x27;t cause any allergic reactions like most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> But more importantly to that was finding a sunscreen that did not burn the kids eyes.</li>
            <li> This product is great if you are looking for a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It goes on clear and has great ingredients.</li>
            <li> I was ready to give up on finding one that was good for us.  </li>
            <li> The problem is that I have very fair skin and even though I&#x27;ve seemed to build up this tolerance to burning easily unlike my younger self who could look redder than a stop sign within 10 minutes of being out in the Texas summer sun-</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, love the product, not greasy,Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> It has a mild pleasant scent to it which is much nicer than smelling like banana candy!</li>
            <li> Plus, this isn&#x27;t a huge con to me as I find it&#x27;s way more important to me to avoid skin cancer than it is to avoid pasty skin.</li>

            <li> This sunscreen goes on easily and does not have a greasy feel on the skin.</li>
            <li> I returned it because it was described as rubbing in easily, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> experience  with the sunscreen  was that it aplied easily.  </li>
            <li> Even with 50 SPF, I still tend to burn easily.</li>
            <li> I really love that this has such great ingredients.</li>
            <li> It rubs in easy.</li>
            <li> But overall love the ingredients and is great for problem</li>

            <li> As far as healthy sunscreen goes this is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far-</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the sunscreen, slightly sweet, but not overly scented.</li>
            <li> Finally a TOTALLY natural product that is effective!</li>
            <li> I live in Los Angeles, am fair skinned, and burn easily.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant odor that my 5-year old was fine with.</li>
            <li> Works fine</li>
            <li> And I was actually fine with the texture too, was worried about it after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> Absorbed really well and has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> and I felt confident when they didn&#x27;t have their own sunscreen I had something  that was safe and effective in general as well as  for kids and more sensitive types.</li>
            <li> I love that it is not only safe for you, but it is also safe for the environment!</li>
            <li> Not only does it have a very pleasant neutral scent, but it is the first product that doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin.  </li>
            <li> this was a huge problem.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent, affordable, natural product if you&#x27;re considering going with natural.  </li>
            <li> Picture is accurate.</li>
            <li> Picture is accurate.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, THE BEST all natural mineral sunscreen I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Rubs in smoothly and leaves no white residue and smells great.</li>
            <li> With all the horror stories I hear about mineral sunscreens leaving a white face, I think this one did a great job.</li>
            <li> Great if you are only going to the beach, or to a Halloween party.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Light and non greasy... I recommend</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> So happy to have finally found this!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Feels light on skin&lt;br /&gt;Rubs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy on my face feels light...</li>
            <li> Great price as a facial sunscreen (cheaper than Neutrogena face sunscreen per ounce)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly light.</li>
            <li> I especially appreciated the scent.  </li>
            <li> The SPF 25 is a great middle ground for me.  </li>
            <li> We bought this for two ecological park excursions in Mexico.</li>
            <li> They offered customers a free lip balm for our sunscreen purchase, which I accepted.  </li>
            <li> Texture is silky and smooth, not chalky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also its not oily or sticky at all, goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> Once it is distributed on my skin, it is light and not sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> Does not go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This product is thicker when compared to the chemical filled sunscreens I used to buy at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Wearing sunscreen is so important.</li>
            <li> it goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> It covers very well and looks like you have a nice liquid foundation on.  </li>
            <li> They replied to me in a very timely and courteous manner and explained that \\&quot;If</li>
            <li> and it was great, as he&#x27;s outside a lot.</li>
            <li> him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 110% satisfied and I&#x27;d love to see more of the population use this product because 1) its natural</li>
            <li> Finally an all natural sunscreen that works great, smells good and rubs in easily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fabulous sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Finally one with a great smell</li>
            <li> product feels natural and smells good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I feel good about using this product on my fair skin, knowing I will be protected without exposing myself to harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> So far it has been good, but it hasn&#x27;t been summer yet.</li>
            <li> The good news is that my face and arms where I DID put on sunblock where totally unburned even after being out for many hours.</li>
            <li> so far so good</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a safe and natural sunscreen, that works and is cost effective.  </li>
            <li> Loved this reef-safe, natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> All natural and smells good.  </li>
            <li> My youngest has really really sensitive skin, so this surprised me - and made me one happy mommy!</li>
            <li> natural is always good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good...</li>
            <li> It just seems like you are doing more harm than help right?</li>
            <li> This is a high quality sunscreen that will keep your skin healthy!</li>
            <li> We all went out to the beach over the weekend and used it for the first time!!</li>
            <li> It is really important to me to not put any chemicals into my body, so that is why I originally bought this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> do not be dissuaded with SPF 25 listing as I found this sunscreen to work better than most SPF 50 that are high in chemicals.</li>
            <li> Decent price for a 4 oz. tube compared to other naturals and with the good performance we experienced.</li>
            <li> My new favorite sunscreen!</li>
            <li> My new favorite sunscreen!</li>
            <li> My new favorite sunscreen!  </li>
            <li> First it went on so nice, soaked right in and was not greasy at all and did not make me feel sticky like some sunscreen does.</li>
            <li> (I should totally know better, I am pretty fair and burn really easily.)</li>
            <li> friendly customer service.</li>
            <li> so I think it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this sunscreen</li>
            <li> It seems the packaging and the original container has changed design/appearance.</li>
            <li> I used this yesterday for the first time and I love it.</li>
            <li> Nice smell -- not strong, but pleasant.</li>
            <li> and I received with the free shipping offer quickly.</li>
            <li> We have been very impressed with everything from the delicate &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; scent to the smooth application.  </li>
            <li> Goes on clean.</li>
            <li> I mix it with a different sunscreen that&#x27;s also good for daytime that blocks UVB and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> It rubs in nicely too and is all natural!</li>
            <li> My 3 young daughters love how this smells!</li>
            <li> This natural, water resistant, biodegradable, and reef safe sunscreen is just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use sunscreen too often because my skin tone is a bit on the dark side which is great because I don&#x27;t burn easily because of it.</li>
            <li> special occasions</li>
            <li> This sunscreen had a very &#x27;dry&#x27; feeling after application which I am so happy with.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my 21 old daughter who has very light skin and burns easily; she has to wear sunscreen if she&#x27;s out in the sun at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels fresh and light in my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the store shelves are full of sun-screen products that work well, I would never buy them.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure how much to put</li>
            <li> Most sunscreens have a very distinctive sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m loving this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-Don&#x27;t need a lot to get full coverage</li>
            <li> However, I have found that this product, rubbed in well, makes my skin only the slightest degree paler and, surprisingly</li>
            <li> I did get this at a reduced price for a review but would buy at full price as well.</li>
            <li> After a full day in sun...</li>
            <li> I love that this product is really Organic.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s true).  </li>
            <li> and I loved that I could just rub it on my sons face with no concerns of what potential chemicals are entering his body.</li>
            <li> I recommend Chanel liquid (UV Essential), Shiesdo liquid, the more affordable Japanese Biore liquid Aqua rich (for a shimmery glow) and Japanese Biore Perfect face (for a more matte powdery finish).</li>
            <li> It has a pretty thick consistency but it absorbs quickly and leaves the skin feeling smooth and smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li> And seriously, it smells incredible!</li>
            <li> lovely for a sunscreen, especially if you plan on wearing it as an every day item (its not over-powering like most sunscreens)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only use physical (vs chemical sunscreen), and this one is great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good product for everyday use :)</li>
            <li> I have super senstive skin</li>
            <li> I will keep using it and love that it is all natural!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also super important that I see exactly where the sunscreen is being applied.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from cheap to high end, but this was fine for my face</li>
            <li> First , I get burned like no body&#x27;s beezwax if I don&#x27;t have fantastic sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I was alarmed when I first applied this lotion to my face, as it did not go on smoothly (it was lumpy).  </li>
            <li> but once you start applying it onto your skin it goes on pretty smooth.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, at the end of the weekend I was both breakout and sunburn free, so it actually worked!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have the other stuff most sunscreens have in it (another way of saying I am so happy I found it as it&#x27;s natural!)</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get good organic and natural sunscreen at most local stores.  </li>
            <li> My favorite benefit which I love about a physical sunscreen, is that once you put it on, you can go right out the door and not wait 20 - 30 minutes like chemical</li>
            <li> but I am happy to deal with that to avoid the harmful chemicals in previous products I have used.</li>
            <li> and my skin is dry, fair, and always irritated.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t sweat much, so I&#x27;m not sure how it holds up under that stress, but it was perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face which I have NEVER been able to do as I have very sensitive skin on my face or</li>
            <li> Love having a natural sunscreen I can use for my baby!</li>
            <li> I wore it and did not get sunburned in the hot Florida sun, so I recommend it to everyone!  </li>
            <li> This is the first sunscreen that I can identify everything on the label!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE that it has an all natural coconut smell!</li>
            <li> This is ORGANIC and is the FIRST sunscreen I can put on my Face (I have always had oily skin) and it DIDN&#x27;T break out!</li>
            <li> I love this all natural sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Sunscreen is extremely important to me as I have sensitive skin that burns easily.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at the light fresh smell and it rubs on easily.</li>
            <li> We had a great little kayak trip without any sunburn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but we all stayed sunburn free thanks to this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It smells and feels nice, goes on a bit white but with some rubbing becomes more clear.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it for the way it feels,  </li>
            <li> and I love that it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using this, and it has a really nice smell to it too.</li>
            <li> The only thing I liked about it was that it stated it was &amp;</li>
            <li> 1) Love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> Love it so far.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen is different from many currently available.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is natural, non-toxic and safe for the environment, should you be swimming in the ocean or a lake.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen was not only more affordable, it smelled better (really nice actually) and definitely spread better.</li>
            <li> received this for a reduced amount for giving a honest and personal review</li>
            <li> I love the all natural part of the product .  </li>
            <li> The smell is so nice that I actually look forward to using it!</li>
            <li> I am encouraged to find it available through Amazon Prime and will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> If you want a quality product with quality ingredients, this is worth every penny and some.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely love and recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for an all natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> fair skinned, spent a week in Florida and didn&#x27;t burn at all.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I started looking for a more natural alternative.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is all natural.</li>
            <li> This one is the only one that doesn&#x27;t cause redness or any kind of irritation.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get burned,  Worth the $$.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> Love that it has natural, soothing ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I like that the sunscreen is all natural, with many beneficial oils.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s worth it for me to have chemical-free sunscreen.</li>
            <li> We hope it was worth it to save the fish.</li>
            <li> This one has a nice scent, and although it DOES come out white, with some smoothing it does blend in.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was very pleased with Beauty by Earth&#x27;s Mineral Sunscreen; although I did not get to use it on the hottest day with the most direct sunlight, I could still generally assess most of its features.</li>
            <li> This product smells nice, and does not have chemicals, however it does leave a white residue.</li>
            <li> It smells lovely and makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> My kids have fun putting it on.  </li>
            <li> Glad to have found a natural sunscreen that works</li>
            <li> This has no harsh ingredients (so nice compared so many other junk sunscreens on the market), smells wonderful and it goes on nicely (not oily).</li>
            <li> This is true of all natural physical sunscreens and this one is more cosmetically elegant than anyone that I have tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is quite thick at first like a nice lotion but rubs in nicely.</li>
            <li> Noticed right away</li>
            <li> The manufacturers of this product got it right.</li>
            <li> It is just the right amount of protection.  </li>
            <li> When I apply it, it appears white at first, but when you rub it in, it blends in nicely.  </li>
            <li> It is thicker and a bit more opaque than a natural brand I&#x27;ve been using because of the higher spf content for people who don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li> I tried to sunscreen for the first time this past week while out on an all day bike tour on a beautiful sunny day.</li>
            <li> No burn, no bad reaction just pure reliable protection.</li>
            <li> It is very very effective and safe for my very sensitive facial skin, as I could never use any sunscreen earlier on until I stumbled on this on Amazon site.</li>
            <li> Really nothing special.</li>
            <li> I have lived in the sun for the past 12 years and this sunscreen works great.</li>
            <li> I used it on my face which is my true test as I really don&#x27;t like sunscreens that leave my face feeling oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> As far as appearance, it actually had more of a matte finish than most.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through so many different natural and organic sunscreens in hopes if finding something that rubs in a bit better</li>
            <li> Although I wish this didn&#x27;t go on so thick, I feel good about putting it on my skin because I know it is much safer than most products out there.</li>
            <li> Smells great, has a less glaring white glow than other natural blocks, &amp; works great!</li>
            <li> This product came at the exact right time.</li>
            <li> Upon first opening the bottle I knew I had ordered the right sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I use it on the top of my hands to protect from sun also and it feels very protective and soft.  </li>
            <li> I was glad to find a natural sunblock that the whole family can use.  </li>
            <li> I also break out easily from many products and at the same time I am very conscious about what I put on and in my body.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product and would buy it again when I need a new batch :-)</li>
            <li> This sunscreen has a very natural and light scent, almost like something tropical.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic natural sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Makes me feel good knowing it is not full of carcinogens.</li>
            <li> I am really delighted to have found an organic, natural, mineral sunscreen I am willing to use daily.</li>
            <li> We are very fair-skinned, and I used to get sunburned a lot as a child, so I&#x27;m glad I found something safe that works for my children.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly, which makes applying it on kids a lot easier because they don&#x27;t have to wait while you rub a thick lotion in.  </li>
            <li> Third and lastly, the consistency is very nice and creamy and blends in very well!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not easy to find all natural, organic and cruelty free sunscreens and this one is by sure a fantastic choice!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> My friends tease because I look like a ghost :) another friend of mine uses Blue Lizard with similar results but it rubs in quickly and easily</li>
            <li> I am huge on organic and natural products.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Used this sunscreen for the first time this weekend on a family trip to Legoland.</li>
            <li> so you will see it first</li>
            <li> First of all, I trust this brand and the ingredients they use in their products.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> this is a great organic sun screen that I use for myself and my daughter when we are outside for a long time.</li>
            <li> You only need to rub a litte more.</li>
            <li> Only reason I&#x27;m not in love with this product, its not creamy and doesn&#x27;t apply or spread well.</li>
            <li> Wore it for the first time in LA out in the sun.</li>
            <li> I also love how it smells, I will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> That was AFTER rubbing it in until I couldnt see the more obvious &amp;#34;just put sunscreen on&amp;#34; layer, and applied makeup.</li>
            <li> We saw many others with white layers of sunscreen</li>
            <li> When I went in the pool, the white became more noticeable.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really only 3 more seconds of your time to get it on</li>
            <li> The first  time I used it</li>
            <li> Will use it up, but most likely not buy again.</li>
            <li> I really like the fresh, tropical scent of this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> and I really feel like this sunscreen stayed on and in place while I play and have fun.</li>
            <li> sure whether it&#x27;s actually water-resistant?  </li>
            <li> Had to do 3 hours of work in 95 degree LA sun and put this sunscreen on first.</li>
            <li> I have even advertised it to many friends, just that they do not appreciate the way it makes the face looking white after application.</li>
            <li> If there are more than 5 stars I would give double.</li>
            <li> It works really well too!</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly in hot Caribbean,</li>
            <li> I love it because it protects her well, and doesn&#x27;t make her look &#x27;white&#x27;.</li>
            <li> If your skin is very white, you should be okay with it.</li>
            <li> It did look whitish at first</li>
            <li> my skin can still breath and i am still no burn after the hot sunshine . .</li>
            <li> Looks like white paint on my skin :)</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done my research and anything higher</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> They seem to really care about their products and their customers!</li>
            <li> so I am pretty picky about my sunscreens...</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have bought this product.  </li>
            <li> i will definitely be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> must at home from now on!!&lt;br /&gt;Really really recommend it!</li>
            <li> My wife disliked the viscosity property, as she is use to putting a good dollop on one spot and spreading it.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and treat your body to some GOOD all-natural reef-safe sunscreen this summer (and all-year &#x27;round, because you know...</li>
            <li> Very natural and clean smell</li>
            <li> found my new favorite natural day to day 15 sunscreen (every morning at sea) at trader joes, forget the name.</li>
            <li> I felt like it really covered every area of my skin accurately, and it did NOT irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> We were fine without reapplication, but I still reapplied after a few hours in the water just to be safe.</li>
            <li> According to the label, the fragrance is natural, which is rare!  </li>
            <li> It is full of natural oils and extracts!</li>
            <li> It smells good and initially when you put it on it feels like your face gets a bit white</li>
            <li> Thanks Beauty Earth for creating something healthy enough to use!</li>
            <li> Now that I know how much to use it&#x27;s not like it was the first time</li>
            <li> Second I got such a nice golden tan.</li>
            <li> too small but product is good.</li>
            <li> I also love that it is SPF 25, not too high (50) and not too low (10).</li>
            <li> and she didn&#x27;t even get a slight burn or color which means it did an AMAZING job blocking the sun.</li>
            <li> It is very white and does not spread easily.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and oily skin.</li>
            <li> Also my skin is super sensitive and I have not had an increase in breakouts because of it.</li>
            <li> Not so easy to apply, need to rub the white paste intensively.</li>
            <li> While he too did not receive even a hint of sunburn, it definitely did not soak up into his skin as easily as it went into mine.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too strong, just enough to feel like it is time for a vacation.  </li>
            <li> Has a nice clean subtle scent, not perfumy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a very smooth texture and not real greasy like</li>
            <li> Based on reviews from other buyers, I purchased it and so far am very pleased with the texture and scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s very important to use a topical, not chemical, sunscreen, especially since I&#x27;m a nursing mom and very conscious about what gets absorbed (or doesn&#x27;t!)</li>
            <li> I used it skiing at a very high altitude and it worked for me the whole time out, without having to reapply.  </li>
            <li> It seriously is great and it is all-natural and great for those that have an allergy to all the nasty chemical-laden sunscreens on the market.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> One bottle of this stuff lasted me for a whole week of a cruise and a whole week in Florida.</li>
            <li> cheap and affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to your product, I&#x27;ll have white face.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> Both worked very well.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some stuff has so much alcohol that it evaporates</li>
            <li> Works really well to prevent a sun burn.</li>
            <li> And you need to dab it all over your face and gently rub in otherwise</li>
            <li> Thanks~</li>
            <li> VERY.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need nearly as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li> This suncreen really works.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I learned just not to use too much</li>
            <li> I was able to work in the sun in my garden without getting even pink for a change.  </li>
            <li> Very creamy.</li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> Very responsive.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t describe it, but it&#x27;s absolutely divine and very understated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> sunscreen products but my daughter burned as much with them on as she did with no sunscreen at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> id much rather pay for this, than pay for junk that leads to cancer or to pay an oncologist to treat cancer....</li>
            <li> and I used to much</li>
            <li> and it absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;re going to have very splotchy skin afterwards all the spots you messed.</li>
            <li> I put a lot of time into trying to find a sunscreen that was chemical free and would not leave me with a white overcast.</li>
            <li> It protects our skin very well.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am light completed and and have not burned one time since wearing it for the last week.</li>
            <li> le&#x27;ts be real.</li>
            <li> The Sunscreen worked very well for me and helped me to really mitigate the effect of the Kuwait sun rays on my face.</li>
            <li> My skin felt much softer after using it.</li>
            <li> I would really like to see a &amp;#34;tinted&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> And I could also stem from the fact I probably used too much.</li>
            <li> And the best part is you don&#x27;t have to worry about having dangerous chemicals on</li>
            <li> It has protected my skin very well from the sun</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> and I love that I am using a product that is free of dangerous chemicals and safe for the whole family to use.</li>
            <li> As a cancer survivor, I&#x27;m very concerned about what goes on my skin.  </li>
            <li> and it works for the whole family.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> this sunscreen is very moisture</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend for you and your kids!</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I never end up using a whole bottle of sunscreen each summer</li>
            <li> It was shipped fast.</li>
            <li> and after I put it on, I felt like I really had a &#x27;layer&#x27; of protection on my face.    </li>
            <li> and I really noticed a difference as well in how my face felt after using it.</li>
            <li> The addition of zinc and titanium oxide really make a difference.</li>
            <li> We were outside from 10am until 4pm in the direct sun for most of the day.</li>
            <li> Plus, I love the natural smells from the essential oil!</li>
            <li> After that, her mom made sure to only use the BbyE Natural Sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I am not a big sunscreen person myself, but my daughter is 1 yrs old and has red hair and fair skin.</li>
            <li> I love having a natural sunscreen that will actually work.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients, especially with the kids in mind.</li>
            <li> Love the natural and simple ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have tried SO MANY different sunscreens with my kids (they are 4 and 2 years old).  </li>
            <li> It lasted a long time and was fairly easy to apply.</li>
            <li> They are full of chemicals that have been directly linked to cancer.&lt;br /&gt;Seems illogical to apply sunscreen to prevent skin cancer when the chemicals in the sunscreen have been directly linked to cancer!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me a long time to find a product that is natural, free of harsh chemicals and most importantly -</li>
            <li> Beware that it is very chalky and due to zinc oxide does leave whit residue on top of skin but will eventually absorb into skin.</li>
            <li> I found that I really don&#x27;t even have to reapply often.smells great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and the smell is very subtle and nice.</li>
            <li> I have a red-headed toddler who requires sunscreen any time we are spending a significant amount of time outdoors (which is often living in Southern California!).</li>
            <li> It has a rich texture; therefore, making it a product that doesn&#x27;t need to be constantly reapplied.</li>
            <li> This is better than some other zinc creams which makes everyone look like a ghost.  </li>
            <li> I love their other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots, and I means lots of different sunscreens, and I love that this one is not only is chemical free but that it has a smooth creamy texture that blends into my face with just a little rubbing.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the new permanent sunscreen for my family!</li>
            <li> In general trust physical sunscreens much more than chemical.</li>
            <li> I have small grandchildren and can feel good about using this on them also because it is all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> One of my daughter has a problematic skin (very dry) but the sunscreen is gentle and easy on her skin.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews, I thought I&#x27;d found my favorite new sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Seems pretty natural to me.</li>
            <li> I am pretty fair-skinned, and even being in and out of direct sun all day, I didn&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
            <li> So I had to pay the full price for this last purchase.  </li>
            <li> One thing true about this product is that it is definitely water resistant.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I bought it because i wanted an all natural sunscreen for myself and my son.</li>
            <li> The 100 ml bottle lasted the two of us a full week of daily repeated use though.</li>
            <li> One tiny problem is that it takes hours to fade the white color after applying them on your face, but it&#x27;s good overall.</li>
            <li> Maybe this wouldnt matter if you are only using it outside/for sport, but I had planned on using it as a very light protective layer (it is only 25 SPF, after all)&lt;br /&gt;-Greasy</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a decent chemical free sunscreen for a long time.</li>
            <li> I live in a California city that often gets to 115 fahrenheit!</li>
            <li> Well, it spreads easier than other physical sunscreens; the smell is nice, although a bit intense</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not good at all for the face, but it is a great general sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The less chemical exposure the better.</li>
            <li> Less is more, just have patience and apply it in advance.</li>
            <li> I really like that it really is made of natural products-</li>
            <li> Good product, especially for heavily exposed areas - ears, nose, neck.  </li>
            <li> At last a natural- chemical free sunscreen without all that toxic nastiness.</li>
            <li> It does most definitely start out white</li>
            <li> Really liked this sunscreen,especially because I am rest assured that it comes from natural ingredients with no harmful and harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> The only time that I found it left residue was in places I wasn&#x27;t fully able to reach and just sort of slapped it on.</li>
            <li> I am very happy to have found this brand as I have been diligently working on getting chemicals out of my house and this is finally a product I do not have to feel guilty about putting on my children.</li>
            <li> Nice, light scent -- not at all a stereotypical &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> I only needed to use 1x in morning and would last most of day in Puerto Rico.</li>
            <li> It was such a mild day</li>
            <li> I got the product pretty fast and have been using it, I have sensitive skin and this cream does not give me irritation like other products I used before, my skin feels clean and moisturized, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlikely most other suncreams it offers full protection to all uses instantly without you having to wait the 30-45mins &#x27;Protection activation time&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Goes on  GOOEY WHITE with only an SPF 25 rating it is not worthwhile for anyone with a very fair skin</li>
            <li> I may have put a little bit too much sunscreen on, as I looked a little ghost-like for the first part of the day until it seemed to fully &amp;#34;absorb&amp;#34; and spread more smoothly across my skin.</li>
            <li> A lot of sunblocks are very oily, and if you apply it when you&#x27;re at the park or the pool, your hands feel so gross, but with this one, I don&#x27;t have to wash my hands right after</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a white layer as so many other all natural sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is non-chemically, high % minerals, not oily sunscreen that does what I need it to.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend purchasing this product and keeping it in your home.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is a little pasty as most zinc based sunscreens are.  </li>
            <li> I tried a little more-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s active ingredients are titanium dioxide and zinc oxide which are safe natural sunscreens, not</li>
            <li> Also, it has a very light, almost mousse like consistency, which is a nice change from many natural sunscreens that can be thick and difficult to get out of the container and to apply.  </li>
            <li> I need natural for how much I put sunblock on my tattoos</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen because it has all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Really appreciate the natural feel of it.</li>
            <li> I really like how this sunscreen is comprised of all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick and greasy like a lot of sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> I do not think the effort is too much, considering that this is a natural product that is using non-nano zinc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that all the ingredients are natural and it still gives SPF 25</li>
            <li> I work out in the sun 10 hours a day and since I am a frequent user of sunscreen I was really looking for something that would make a difference.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally review.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t have the harsh chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> Now, instead of buying several different kinds, for myself and my children, I feel safe to put this product on my young ones.  </li>
            <li> Normally I will go home and wash my face after wearing sunscreens as they tend to feel greasy and also cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> This is actually a good thing because it means it isn&#x27;t small enough particles to absorb all the way into your skin.</li>
            <li> and I wish you big success in the business.</li>
            <li> I normally break out after using any sunscreen on my face.</li>
            <li> It will be nice for days I have to spend a lot of time in the sun and don&#x27;t want to reapply thick lotion all day.</li>
            <li> Nice consistency, not too liquid, but not too thick to it applies easily&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> I love that has organic ingredients and the tube last long imd too!</li>
            <li> It works fine under or over the other moisturizers I used it with as well.  </li>
            <li> says even thought it&#x27;s a solid sunscreen that it isn&#x27;t visible on the skin, but it is slightly visible, kind of an opalescent look to your skin where it is applied, but I didn&#x27;t find that objectionable.  </li>
            <li> The way they are blended with the other natural ingredients shows that Beauty by Earth is really concerned about making a chemical free sunscreen for its customers.</li>
            <li> It is easy to rub in, has a very slight, pleasant smell and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This is my very first purchase by this company and I will definitely continue buying their natural products that contain no harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I just use it on my face mostly, but trying to cover your whole self for the beach would be pretty tough and take a lot of blending, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It felt kind of thick, and it shows up white on my skin at first.</li>
            <li> New to this produce.</li>
            <li> We live in Florida so are outdoors all the time.</li>
            <li> We live at the beach and go through a ton of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and subtle.</li>
            <li> As far as price is concerned, this is the classic case of you pay for what you get.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it as much as I&#x27;ve planned to because I have not been outside much.</li>
            <li> has a smooth feel and sinks in to skin leaving it soft but without any oily or sticky residue.</li>
            <li> Really nice subtle smell.  </li>
            <li> You are left with a light sheen (i.e., it&#x27;s not totally matte).</li>
            <li> This is the first natural sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried and I was leery because I do tend to burn when I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li> I used to get an uncomfortable burning, prickly sensation on top of hands when they were exposed to the rays of the sun -- especially in intense heat.  </li>
            <li> Wow Wow Wow!!!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Bought this product for two weeks of snorkeling in Fiji and found that not only did it do well protecting the reef, but it very much protected my skin.</li>
            <li> Used this on my very sensitive skinned child and it worked well.</li>
            <li> I am highly allergic to every sunblock I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> also used it on my face, which is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way and it keeps my kiddos skin safe from the sun!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping that they come out with one that has a higher SPF, but can maintain the same quality.</li>
            <li> and it was the first time I was outside like that this year.</li>
            <li> : Aside from the color issue on my face, it felt greasy no matter where I put it, and continued to make my skin more greasy than usual as I wore it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had purchased this, as I mentioned, to wear as an &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; basic level, and stick with my higher SPF during activities, but I wont be using this again.</li>
            <li> It looks white when you first rub it in</li>
            <li> and I think I have tried every sensitive skin sunblock that ever existed!  </li>
            <li> : This is a lot thicker or more viscous than ordinary sun screen.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li> at first looks white but then absorbs</li>
            <li> ENTER Natural Sunscreen by Earth!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a physical sunscreen and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.  </li>
            <li> This afternoon I applied Beauty by Earth Natural Sunscreen and walked out in a Los Angeles heat wave (102 degrees!)</li>
            <li> After using this sunscreen for several days, I noticed my skin did not feel as hot to the touch nor did it seem to feel as if it was burning.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easy and a little gets a lot of coverage.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, but does leave a slight whitish tint as any natural sunscreen will.</li>
            <li> The only drawback that I found was that it was extremely hard for me to rub it in enough so that I didn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;ghostlike.&amp;#34;  Very nice scent, and I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in a well labeled, eco friendly, thin cardboard box and inside contains an attractive black and white 118ml /</li>
            <li> It requires some additional rubbing to get rid of the white residue, but this is because it is more natural than other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> I live by this for myself and my children because it&#x27;s totally natural.</li>
            <li> I found it; this will be our only sunscreen for as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> I love that this is a small family company that is dedicated to making a high-quality natural product.</li>
            <li> I have major major issues with your typical suncreens found in most grocery stores...</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT, DOES NOT LEAVE OUR FACE AS WHITE AS OTHER PRODUCTS!</li>
            <li> but this is one I would definitely recommend to people who do have skin problems and are allergic to certain products.</li>
            <li> It spreads easily and does not leave me all pasty white like some other zinc based sunscreens.</li>
            <li> It does not rub in completely clear (but almost).</li>
            <li> and it then becomes clear.</li>
            <li> I could clearly see where I had the cream on and where I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can complain about so far is, yes it absorbs fast</li>
            <li> All natural.</li>
            <li> I used this today with my 4.5 month old baby</li>
            <li> All the natural ingredients, protect my skin from sunburn.</li>
            <li> I LIke Natural Products</li>
            <li> yes this is natural, yes it does not rub in that well,</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li> I like that this is a natural sunscreen</li>
            <li> We washed it off and applied the BbyE Natural Sunscreen on and it soothed the burning situation.</li>
            <li> so I am always looking for a natural Sunscreen to prevent sunburns.  </li>
            <li> you for introducing me to a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I use this on myself and my 10 month old son.</li>
            <li> No skin reactions on myself nor my 10 month old, and my skin is quite sensitive.</li>
            <li> So it is gentle enough to use on children.  </li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen, initially it takes some rubbing in but it lasts all day, even in the pool.</li>
            <li> UPDATE :   used this natural sunscreen on my face in Aruba.   </li>
            <li> I ordered this sunscreen because it is organic and natural</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend to everyone but especially mothers and fathers.</li>
            <li> He has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> We had 4 people use this natural sunscreen and none of us had any burns whatsoever after the week was over.</li>
            <li> It can leave you looking white if you put on too much.</li>
            <li> It does go on white, but it is very soothing to my skin.</li>
            <li> It is natural and it works well.  </li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen because it is all natural without harmful chemicals and nano</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying one for sensitive skin now.</li>
            <li> I got this product for a vacation because my husband has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far, it seems to protect my skin well.  </li>
            <li> I am still on the search for a natural sunscreen that spreads like California Baby without the nano particles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I bought it to try out on my 4 year old son.</li>
            <li> This one is much easier to put on and has similar ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for an all natural sunscreen that didn&#x27;t contain any nano particles or have any synthetic chemical fragrances in it, and I found it with this one.</li>
            <li> I smell like a classy man who knows what&#x27;s up.</li>
            <li> I have relatively sensitive skin, and have applied this product to my face without any breakouts.</li>
            <li> It is all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain nano particles like the rest.</li>
            <li> It is a challenge to find a sunscreen that has natural organic ingredients and is fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> works well and does rub in completely, I run in it and have not had eye problems even though it goes on my forehead</li>
            <li> Leaves skin white no matter how much rubbing is done.</li>
            <li> I was in search  of an all natural sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It offered protection using  natural and organic ingredients and did not contain any nano-particles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used once, don&#x27;t go out that much.  </li>
            <li> You can keep it as light or heavy as you like.  </li>
            <li> so I got worried and contacted the company directly.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this product and feel protected in the sun.</li>
            <li> I like that it is a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It is all natural and water resistant.</li>
            <li> i save it for the longer days in direct sun, nose and lips.&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li> The ingredients are natural and I appreciate that.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased a couple all natural sunscreens including burt&#x27;s bees that didn&#x27;t rub in AT ALL.  </li>
            <li> I had almost given up trying to find an all natural sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> , I like that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and so far no issues.</li>
            <li> Scent is natural and pleasing to the senses.</li>
            <li> try to use natural things whenever I can</li>
            <li> and I were in the water and direct sun all day at the beach for hours.</li>
            <li> I took this on a recent trip to Hawaii and thought it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> My husband often ended up with white on his face or neck when he started to sweat, but I think he was using too much.  </li>
            <li> No allergic reaction for me - happened to me once with a natural sunscreen..</li>
            <li> I used it while on vacation near Cancun since it is reef-safe and</li>
            <li> and I also feel at peace knowing it is a safe product to apply everyday for me and my entire family.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen is my &#x27;go to&#x27; from here on out...not greasy and just thick enough to rub in and create a nice barrier.  </li>
            <li> Also, for others be aware that&lt;br /&gt;the product is very thick and NOT so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and doesn&#x27;t spread easily, so I recommend spreading on your hands first and then applying it to your body.</li>
            <li> It filled the 100 ml bottle and there was hardly anything left in the original bottle (no way there was 1/3 of the contents left).</li>
            <li> (titanium/zinc sunscreens are always a little think and need a little rubbing to get on, but this one is pretty good - I have tried &amp;#62;10 other kinds).  </li>
            <li> Love this product, especially for my little ones!  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so that is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the seal was slightly offset when I opened the top, so they may want to consider a different type of seal.</li>
            <li> Really nice sunscreen, but not good for a daily face lotion under makeup.</li>
            <li> I only wish the bottle (4 oz.) would be a bit bigger! ;-)</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the product, and a little but goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels heavy on the face as it lasts long all day for me.</li>
            <li> it felt different than others in that it wasn&#x27;t watered down and went on smooth.</li>
            <li> This is very sticky and super hard to apply evenly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure many of you know what I mean when I say that most typical grocery store brands have a very distinct and slightly irritating smell which is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> This has high levels of the minerals that physically block the UVA rays...</li>
            <li> second, I love it enough to use it on my little organic-only-eating-babies.  </li>
            <li> It took quite a bit of rubbing to dissolve the texture into a smooth consistency and work in the stark white cream, so that my natural skin tone appeared.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s normal to have to reapply, especially when swimming.  </li>
            <li> Does have to be rubbed in more so than a typical chemical sunscreen due to the zinc</li>
            <li> and this is now my new go to sunscreen which I apply 4-6 times daily.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier especially because I live in Hawaii</li>
            <li> It does apply with a white tint, but the key is to not use too much and spread it around.</li>
            <li> Very white at first, but fades (although not completely) with time.</li>
            <li> On light colored skins (Caucasian) it does not turn your skin white unless applied too heavy.</li>
            <li> I was worried about this bottle lasting me the whole vacation, but I still have plenty left over.</li>
            <li> It is very water resistant several hours later</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of using a product with natural SPF, however this was a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I got a bottle of this sunscreen because I&#x27;m pregnant and don&#x27;t want harsh chemicals and toxins being transferred to me or my baby.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works better than any commercial chemical cocktail and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I ended up mixing it with some other oils and a little foundation to be able to use it.  </li>
            <li> but this is a major shortcoming in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new sunscreen because the other organic one I was using was super expensive and a real pain to spread, particularly on my three-year-old who doesn&#x27;t really have patience for sunscreen.</li>
            <li> but it absorbed after a little while of being in the sun.</li>
            <li> I waited to write this review until I could test this sunscreen in a tropical climate, and it worked for me as well as others in my family with different skin types, although, as other reviewers have noted,  white residue remains after the sunscreen dries, especially when more is used, but that is a minor matter, because it is not drying or sticky.</li>
            <li> I got this sunscreen because I do not like to put chemicals on my face and on my skin in general.</li>
            <li> I have had skin cancer three times, but have generally resisted wearing sunscreen daily because I either didn&#x27;t want to use the chemical kinds or because the ones natural ones containing zinc made me look like a walking ghost.  </li>
            <li> After a couple weeks of daily use (and a lot of hiking), I developed some pimples on my neck and chest area (and I&#x27;ve never been prone to acne in these places), so I figured the sunscreen was the cause.</li>
            <li> I only use natural sunscreens</li>
            <li> I will only use natural sunscreen and I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> The only one so far that I can use is chalky and costly.  </li>
            <li> My children and I have sensitive skin ,especially around the face and neck area</li>
            <li> I was only out in the direct sun for a couple of hours and needed a break from the sun</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an all natural sunscreen and finally found it!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural sunscreen that wasn&#x27;t chalky &amp; that I would actually want to use.</li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> I only apply all natural creams on my face and body so thats why I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li> Will never go back to the old stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for an organic - natural sunscreen and finally found it.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it once so far, but wanted to give a review on it.</li>
            <li> (I have sensitive skin), especially if you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin with that white look that natural sunscreen has, just FYI.</li>
            <li> If anyone is looking for a true sun block, then look no more.</li>
            <li> Is a bit thick and goes on white, but with a bit of rubbing, the white mostly goes away.  </li>
            <li> leaves a slight blue white residue on wheat colored skin (so take a pass on special occasions or when you will be photographed)&lt;br /&gt;expensive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a natural sunblock that isn&#x27;t super gunky/sticky after it&#x27;s been applied.</li>
            <li> While it isn&#x27;t oily it is thick and rubs in dry creating more of a creamy complexion on skin.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, there are other natural easier-to-apply sunscreens in this price range (recently tried and really like the Beyond Coastal products).</li>
            <li> We have been trying several different natural sunscreens this summer to avoid all the harmful chemicals, while still protecting our skin from harmful rays!  </li>
            <li> It takes a little more time to apply to the skin (I&#x27;m assuming because of the all natural ingredients rather than the usual greasy sunscreens that just glide on)</li>
            <li> I bought it to wear on my face since I am really, really, really allergic to chemical sunscreens and certain common ingredients.</li>
            <li> As a naturally sweaty person, this was even more difficult for me as the day wore on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t break out a single time, and I have very sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I felt I had to use more of it than other mineral sunscreens because it was hard to spread.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that it is not very easy to rub in and it will leave a white residue on your skin at first, but eventually will soak in.</li>
            <li> I already look like a ghost as I&#x27;m pretty pale.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really white &amp; thick, as much or more than other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to waste any more money on other brands, this one works, and it&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s fine for me.</li>
            <li> My suggestion is to apply less so that your skin will fully absorb the sunscreen -- this way you won&#x27;t look much whiter and chalkier after you put it on.</li>
            <li> and I swear my fine lines/ few wrinkles are looking less noticible.</li>
            <li> While on vacation in Florida this past week, we used Beauty Natural Sunscreen and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> And my son who got a full slathering was totally unburned, not even a little pink.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product because it is safe and will last a long time due to the fact that you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> So much in fact that I was a little self-conscious about it.</li>
            <li> It can be hard to spread when your skin is a little wet, but it was extremely effective.</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen, it does leave a little white cast however.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a handful of different methods of application over the past couple of months, thinking I just needed to figure out the &amp;#34;trick&amp;#34; to this natural sunscreen in particular, but I&#x27;m done trying.</li>
            <li> it is not as bad as most, isn&#x27;t too oily, hasn&#x27;t caused breakouts and feels very moisturizing on skin.</li>
            <li> It is a little thicker than I expected, but all right after it soaks in.  </li>
            <li> To add, it wasn&#x27;t really greasy as some natural sunscreens we have tried in the past!</li>
            <li> partickles.&lt;br /&gt;It is thick and there was a white residue right after I applied it.</li>
            <li> I was advised to put on lotion before applying any sunscreen because it will apply much easier, with less &amp;#34;white-ness&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t turn dry.</li>
            <li> This is due to the natural sunscreen properties.</li>
            <li> After a considerable amount of work, you&#x27;ll eventually get it spread evenly, but I&#x27;m not sure how anyone gets rid of the very white color or the considerable greasiness.</li>
            <li> I ordered this due to my son (who has eczema) recently developed an allergic reaction to Banana Boat and Water Babies sunscreens.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and I got rash from using other products.</li>
            <li> I need to say I also do not to slather on as much because a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy and oily like other all natural brands, it lastes all day and doesn&#x27;t get on my clothes.</li>
            <li> It leaves your face a bit white, definitely less than other similar products, but I would really expect this from a physical sunscreen.</li>
            <li> only cons are that this stuff is pretty thick and it will make you look like a ghost.</li>
            <li> Not too pretty, but at least I know it was staying on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super pale and do workouts in the park a few days a week</li>
            <li> It hard to fine a sunscreen with zine oxide like this and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I prayed I wouldn&#x27;t end up in the ER after trying out a small patch of the stuff when it quickly arrived in the mail a few days later.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a LONG way!</li>
            <li> We live in California, so we use sunscreen  everyday.</li>
            <li> so know they take a little more work to apply than regular sunscreens, but this one in particular is very difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the natural sunscreen instead of chemical, but I couldn&#x27;t rub it in enough to not look so pale.</li>
            <li> Also, it would be hard to spread this over a large area, I think.</li>
            <li> Even for my little guy&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is a little greasy, but from what I&#x27;ve seen all the sensitive skin sunblocks are greasy.  </li>
            <li> Sent to me for review this sunscreen is made from a number of natural products with less harmful ingredients and has a SPF value of 25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be used by both adults and children with all skin types and can be used in both dry and aqueous environments (waterproof).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A bit hard to run in, but once the time is taken to do so, it works very well.</li>
            <li> My severe sunscreen allergy causes not only an itchy, god-awful rash all over my entire body, but can also cause me to go into Anaphylactic shock if I just happen to inhale some of those nasty sunscreen particles from those fun little spray sunscreens they&#x27;ve been selling (are you catching on to the sarcasm here?</li>
            <li> Same &amp;#34;issue&amp;#34; with the other physical sunscreen brands, bit too dry to put on by itself</li>
            <li> I still plan on using this product for runs, and daily use, but I do feel that it needs to be reapplied for longer excursions (which is expected since it&#x27;s SPF 25).</li>
            <li> Used it all summer long.</li>
            <li> Some of it did not completely wash off when I washed my face, but it was so soothing</li>
            <li> Stays for long.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old puts it on everyday before school as part of her morning routine.</li>
            <li> The bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The fragrance lingers too long.</li>
            <li> I spent the weekend at the beach and used only this product and it worked like a charm!</li>
            <li> I hope this company will be around for a long time and that they add a makeup line.</li>
            <li> and I almost give myself heatstroke going out in long sleeves and long pants and a sun hat...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for so long.</li>
            <li> The slightly white film is barely there after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> The slight white tint does fade away, and I have asian skin.</li>
            <li> My darker complected husband tried it and left him looking an odd grayish blue color.</li>
            <li> I mean really guys...</li>
            <li> I mean really guys...</li>
            <li> My one big complaint is that I really looked white and sickly pale with it on.</li>
            <li> It is totally moisturized and also seems to have handled some other pre-existing skin irritations.  </li>
            <li> However, it does leave skin white color just like other suncreens do.</li>
            <li> A lot of the sunscreens have this minor problem, so I still give it 4 stars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 5 other mineral sunscreens, they all had different consistencies, smells, and some of the non-essential ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Review: Like all natural physical sunscreens this is hard to rub in, and leaves a whitish, metallic ghostly cast to skin.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t make me feel dry  .</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel sticky or dry -</li>
            <li> It rubs in dry, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> my skin would become dry</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I will not be ordering this again because I wanted a sunscree I could use everyday that is not heavy, absorbs quickly, and does not leave a residue.</li>
            <li> The only downside is it would be a difficult application for a whole body sunscreen, as it is pretty thick and viscous</li>
            <li> But if you are like me, you get iffy about putting chemicals like that on your body every single day.</li>
            <li> But unlike the other reviewers I found it super white and difficult to rub in and spread over my skin.</li>
            <li> starters, when it goes on the hand it has the same pasty texture as other natural sunblocks made with zinc, but once it goes on the skin it applies extremely well with hardly any white residue.</li>
            <li> So I was anxious to try this Beauty by Earth Natural Sunscreen.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not sure why all sunscreens aren&#x27;t natural if it can be done and still provide protection from the sun).</li>
            <li> Goes on white, yes, but it faded into my skin (and I have a dark complexion).</li>
            <li> If you are olive to dark skninned you will see a white residue.</li>
            <li> I also put it on my arms (driving arm) so that I don&#x27;t cook while I am driving, and end up with one dark and one white arm.</li>
            <li> The product is very thick, but as long as you don&#x27;t use too much</li>
            <li> this is one of the many I&#x27;ve tried; unfortunately this one is very thick and hard to spread evenly; it also leaves a very noticeable white film on the skin;</li>
            <li> Not only it is safe from dangerous chemicals, it is a pleasure to use!</li>
            <li> Third usually want I put a product like this on my face the next day</li>
            <li> With two small children I&#x27;m worried about the different chemicals in different sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Seems to work well - my child&#x27;s skin not reddened like it typically is when playing outside without sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I always had a problem using sunscreen, commercial brands made me break out</li>
            <li> Spent 10 days at the beach and didn&#x27;t burn a single time.</li>
            <li> I hate the chemicals in most sunscreens and this takes all the worry out of what you&#x27;re putting on your skin!</li>
            <li> and it kept my skin soft and hydrated the whole day in the dry and cold climate.  </li>
            <li> If I miss even a tiny little spot</li>
            <li> yes, it does leave a little bit of a white film on your skin.</li>
            <li> Decided to even it out, ordered this, and went to the pool for a little bit having this only on my hands and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Secondly, I did feel a little itchy around my neck when I applied it, but it went away, and I saw no evidence of a rash or allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is all natural, which is very hard to find, including not using any palm oil (which may be natural but is destroying orantugtan habitat).  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that with the zinc oxide it leaves my already white skin even whiter.</li>
            <li> Yes you have to rub it in, totally expected for mineral sunscreens, and I don&#x27;t consider this to be any problem when the alternative is covering my kids in chemicals.</li>
            <li> When you go to apply the handful of mess to your skin, the watery part spreads evenly, and the white part ends up in uneven, flat patches.</li>
            <li> I expected excellance.</li>
            <li> but perhaps that&#x27;s to be expected with sun screen.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I stopped buying regular sunscreen a few years ago.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really soak in, you can detect a thin film on your skin where you have applied it, which wears off as it wears off, so you know when to reapply it.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like how my face is white for a few minutes</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times but am already a fan.</li>
            <li> That apart, it keeps them away from the harsh sun burns which they use to be subjected to earlier.</li>
            <li> I have looked and looked and never really find anything workable without the onslaught of chemicals on their skin.</li>
            <li> I hate the traditional sunscreen stench, so I am SOOOO pleased that this isn&#x27;t that scent.</li>
            <li> It is thick and natural.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using the Badger products because of the simple &amp; non toxic ingredients but have been open to try something that isn&#x27;t as thick.</li>
            <li> but it is so WHITE on your face and takes a while to absorb and even after rubbing it in for a while your skin still looks pale.  </li>
            <li> This left a chalky residue on my already pale skin.</li>
            <li> However, I had bought the Blue Lizard sunscreen at the same time to try it and it is a little less thick and is white as well but rubs in quicker</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit too thick and hard to rub in and it leaves my skin very pasty white.</li>
            <li> It is pretty thick, so you have to work it in a bit, but it&#x27;s not so thick that it didn&#x27;t blend in.</li>
            <li> A little went a long ways.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I did find that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and</li>
            <li> A couple of other companies were reviewed because of them.</li>
            <li> I do have rosacea, which makes me break out easily, so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m going to keep up daily use, but I&#x27;m going to give it a try for awhile.</li>
            <li> Does not absorb thoroughly like other people are reporting.</li>
            <li> I bought it also due to it being &amp;</li>
            <li> Thank you I have passed this product onto other friends of mine</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t find it offensive or to an extreme degree.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but I think I&#x27;ve had that with other sunscreens to</li>
            <li> but by the time I had finished my other arm the overcast was gone.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for an organic based sunscreen since i&#x27;ve been breaking out in acne with the regular sunscreen i used to use in the past.</li>
            <li> Pretty sad it was ruined and had to chuck it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not sting the face like other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> Within minutes I forgot I had it on (unlike other sunscreens that leave you feeling oily and pasty) and was sweating non-stop.</li>
            <li> I shared one of the tubes with my daughter who is extremely grateful I did.</li>
            <li> But no more so than any other sunscreen I currently use.</li>
            <li> I usually buy my sun products at the local drug store.  </li>
            <li> But with all other sunscreens, and believe me after decades of trying them I have tried them all, I would still get a burn even when re-applying every 1.5 hours.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I am thankful for a company that cares about other&#x27; wellbeing.</li>
            <li> We went to Hawaii for a week and it worked extremely well.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily face</li>
            <li> It is a little on the heavy side, but I don&#x27;t find that it leaves my face white or greasy at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After moisturizing, let your skin dry down by waiting a few minutes before applying sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> knowing I&#x27;m using a product that is free of all the &#x27;bad stuff&#x27; other brands use.  </li>
            <li> So many other sunscreens have so much crap in them.  </li>
            <li> Most sunscreens are full of chemicals that I hate putting on my skin, but everything in this sunscreen is natural and there is nothing bad in it!</li>
            <li> It was slightly greasier to the touch than I had hoped, based on some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> however it turns your skin white no matter how hard you rub it in.</li>
            <li> The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because it is a little, (very little) thick for the face and leaves the white residue slightly.  </li>
            <li> If you are olive or dark skinned you will not like this product.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to spread...as I expect all zinc oxide based sunscreens to be, so that wasn&#x27;t really a surprise.</li>
            <li> I read that some people complained about it being white on their face</li>
            <li> Thick, greasy and leaves your face metallic white.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thick and leaves white residue on your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> and I love that I am not putting a bunch of crap (chemicals) on my skin and into my system.  </li>
            <li> It goes on quite thick and white, but with some effort you can work into the skin</li>
            <li> cream is white with a fairly thick consistency.</li>
            <li> It does go on thick and white.</li>
            <li> The consistency is too thick, and you actually get sunburn using it, almost like you are not using any sunscreen at all.</li>
            <li> only need a dime size since it has a thick consistency.</li>
            <li> do you want wrinkly leathery skin down the road or do you want semi-white skin that is protected from UVB and UVA rays?</li>
            <li> do you want wrinkly leathery skin down the road or do you want semi-white skin that is protected from UVB and UVA rays?</li>
            <li> It is not as heavy as other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> It is thick and white but disappears in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> make you look ridiculous like you painted yourself with white paint.</li>
            <li> Spreading this on your skin in dabs will make it less opaque.</li>
            <li> But unfortunately, I had to send this back, because it was so yucky and pasty and white, and could not rub this in at all!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what half the ingredients were.</li>
            <li> Not immediately, with my skin tone, there seemed to be a slight overcast</li>
            <li> I wish something could be done to help make it become less visible on the face.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I threw away the  card which  had the code for the 20% discount offered me for a next purchase after the one I purchased last year.</li>
            <li> Anything less is not enough.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li> I hate thick, greasy sunscreen and this felt nice and lightweight on my face.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the quality and purity of this product and recommend it highly to those who are skeptical on what they apply to their skin.</li>
            <li> The only reason that I am giving it four stars is because it is a little difficult for me to spread, especially for my children&#x27;s face, when I am in a hurry to get them to school in the morning.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not chemically so it is thick and you have to take your time to work it in a bit, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Its thick and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult to rub in, and it leaves your skin looking a little whiter than normal.</li>
            <li> In my experience all physical sunscreens are thick but that is a small price to pay for not having the junk in it.</li>
            <li> I wish it weren&#x27;t as thick and a little easier to rub in, but I&#x27;m not sure that is possible with this type of sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift I might buy some later...was a little pricey</li>
            <li> Could be a little smoother to apply.</li>
            <li> I ordered it because I was looking and looking for a sunscreen I could use on my little one</li>
            <li> In My Little Daughter</li>
            <li> Because there is a lot of Zinc, that&#x27;s a little bit of time to rub it in.  </li>
            <li> had to rub in a little bit</li>
            <li> I noticed that the scent changed after a while a little bit though.</li>
            <li> With a little work it rubbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> I found myself dabbing little spots over my skin and then spreading it.</li>
            <li> The consistency could be a little thinner to help spreading.</li>
            <li> I do look a little shiny, but I&#x27;m not burning</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally buy sunscreen because of all the terrible ingredients that can be worse on my body more than the sun would do to me without sunscreen....</li>
            <li> Chalky white and very hard to rub in.  </li>
            <li> I do wish it was a little easier.however without the harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> A little on the heavy side</li>
            <li> Just a warning - this sunscreen goes on VERY thick and VERY white!</li>
            <li> It is very thick, almost like the zinc oxide we put on our noses when skiing, but instead of staying white on my face</li>
            <li> It does have a very thick consistency which some people may not prefer, but I actually do --</li>
            <li> Yeah, not smart, yet this thing works, I leant it the hard way.</li>
            <li> Not happy with that purchase overall.</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday.  </li>
            <li> protects and isn&#x27;t filled with crap.</li>
            <li> But for everyday where it is a winner.</li>
            <li> When it comes to picking sunscreen, I try to avoid the heavy chemicals.</li>
            <li> or it feels heavy.  </li>
            <li> We were out in the sun for a few hours on a humid day and no redness.</li>
            <li> It also has organic green tea extract in it, which is an anti-inflammatory.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m out in the sun everyday</li>
            <li> Once it dried, I didn&#x27;t even noticed it was on me</li>
            <li> Once I blend it in, and after a few moments, the whiteness goes away.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste a dime on it.</li>
            <li> There were a few  that met this requirement on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> When I opened the bottle, I noticed that the inner seal was broken</li>
            <li> my face would still feel as if it were burning after a few hours in the sun, but I just assumed that was the norm.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only thick, but even after trying to shake it thoroughly it&#x27;s still separated into thick sticky sunscreen surrounded by water when you squeeze it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> so I could not care less about that!</li>
            <li> sunscreen didn&#x27;t even let me get a slight burn!  </li>
            <li> no hidden weird stuff.</li>
            <li> It can make darker skin look pale.</li>
            <li> It made me look really pale when I spread a lot in one area.</li>
            <li> I WILL be purchasing again for our cruise in the Fall!retty pale.</li>
            <li> For me, it was like applying any other sunscreen, if a bit thick.  </li>
            <li> It does go on thick because one of the active ingredients is zinc oxide</li>
            <li> A sunscreen that is not full of ingredients or chemicals!  </li>
            <li> , pretty bad burn....</li>
            <li> I have been using this sunscreen for the past few days</li>
            <li> After a full day on the beach with the outdoor temp being 95 and the sun index factor a 10 (on a scale of 0-10), including trips in and out of the salty ocean, my daughter had NO sunburn (except the base of her neck where she missed a spot and didn&#x27;t apply it.......</li>
            <li> just gives a false sense of security for staying out in the sun too long because, while you may not burn your skin, the UVA rays are still damaging your deeper layers of skin.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> A little thick</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is a little thick, maybe that&#x27;s why it works so well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really too bad, because I like everything else about this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well it would hold up at the beach...</li>
            <li> My only issue is that it is difficult to spread.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the small size of the bottle fool you.</li>
            <li> She said she would use it for her face or small areas, but not arms and legs.</li>
            <li> Ordinary sunblock makes me feel like I&#x27;m going to break out in pimples hours afterwards.</li>
            <li> I just dislike that oily residue that smears on everything after putting on ordinary sunblock.</li>
            <li> Just yesterday I went walking around beaches and small coastal towns.</li>
            <li> and it;s not cheap!</li>
            <li> I believe it is a small price to pay.  </li>
            <li> And for the aforementioned reason, reapplying is difficult.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that just a small bit does the trick.</li>
            <li> And because it&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t have chemicals or artificial fragrances</li>
            <li> But unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me, it is thick and leaves the skin covered with a white layer.</li>
            <li> Some other natural/organic sun screens are very thick and hard to apply, leaving you looking like Casper the ghost.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s impossible to completely rub in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I will order it again, at least to use on my face, because it makes me look a little unhealthy.</li>
            <li> However, it was hard to spread on his body.</li>
            <li> Hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I did find it to be a bit hard to rub in.  </li>
            <li> My daughter told me stop mom, you&#x27;re hurting me, you&#x27;re rubbing too hard.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so hard to rub in.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s hard to rub in.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen leaves a very thick sticky white film and is difficult rub it.  </li>
            <li> I decided to take a risk with Natural Sunscreen and hope that I would not have a bad reaction.  </li>
            <li> The rest of my family was using spray on sunscreen and each of them got burnt at least a time or two.</li>
            <li> have nothing negative to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> Got home late and went to bed.</li>
            <li> I still wanted to protect myself from the dangerous UVB and UVA rays so that I could hopefully lesson the risk of getting skin cancer in the future.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it as I want to support organic products, however, I will also shop around for a lotion that isn&#x27;t quite as thick.</li>
            <li> Goes on thick.</li>
            <li> As a result it is THICK.  </li>
            <li> and it goes on thickly.</li>
            <li> I would take a thick consistency over greasy any day.</li>
            <li> It is a thick paste, so you don&#x27;t have to shake it before applying it,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Extremely thick and pasty, does not spread out, very difficult to rub in, it&#x27;s hard enough for kids to stay still for sunscreen application</li>
            <li> Rather difficult to apply, but does the job extremely well.</li>
            <li> but Im a few days outside of the 30 day return policy :-(</li>
            <li> I feel this is a very small thing to have to deal with.</li>
            <li> so I always need sunscreen and hate all the chemicals that are normally included.</li>
            <li> I was the person who didn&#x27;t use sunscreen prior because I couldn&#x27;t put myself to using the awful ingredients in regular store bought suntan lotion.</li>
            <li> Trying to rub it into my arms and legs is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to apply, very thick and makes you look like a ghost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy and thick and hasn&#x27;t washed off of either of us!</li>
            <li> Too thick!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t spread this THICK cream!</li>
            <li> It dispensed well, but it was very hard to rub into the skin.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is tough to beat.  </li>
            <li> but it is very thick.</li>
            <li> and so are the people that stand behind it.</li>
            <li> Just put on a thin layer</li>
            <li> After reading several articles about the crap in a lot of sunscreens, I was looking for something I could use that I could also use for my baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I would have know that I would have found something to thin it with before going on vacation.</li>
            <li> I looked ridiculous wearing it!  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something natural, as I am just sick and tired of all the crap in sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> like the very subtle smell of the ingredients and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t smell like fake coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The sunscreen works but it goes on thick and is very difficult to spread evenly.</li>
            <li> I hate how chemically the typical sunscreen is...</li>
            <li> very* pale skin, and have been known to get a bad sunburn even during a rainstorm</li>
            <li> (I usually prefer fragrance-free on my face, but it&#x27;s just me!!!).</li>
            <li> If it fails to protect me I will let you know.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is anything</li>
            <li> This Sunscreen doesn&#x27;t have weird smell.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so difficult to rub in, but all eco sunscreen is.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m not used to using sunscreen, it felt weird to put it on.</li>
            <li> For him, it was difficult to spread it around and had to rub a lot to get it to soak in.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any sunscreen in years, but in anticipation of an event where I knew I&#x27;d be exposed for a long period of time, I searched Amazon for something that is all-natural and doesn&#x27;t have all that nasty, chemically stuff in it.</li>
            <li> Worst money spent.</li>
            <li> its just real thick!</li>
            <li> It absorbs well into the skin and thankfully it did not have an unpleasant scent or stickiness like a lot of others do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very expensive</li>
            <li> was very difficult.  </li>
            <li> I like the idea and packaging of Beauty by Earth, but unless I got a bad tube, this is a crazy bad product.</li>
            <li> No nothing bad for your kids.</li>
            <li> , it rubbed in without causing any bad skin reactions.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.</li>
            <li> My kids are also picky about what goes on their face, if it smells bad it is all over.</li>
            <li> I ordered it after going through the ingredients and reviews but I am highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Because I hate the person who created those...).</li>
            <li> I have not used sunscreen for years because of the toxic smell and chemical base.</li>
            <li> The worst part is that you have to reapply every 45-60 minutes and when you are out and have makeup on that is just impossible...  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, though!</li>
            <li> reason I give 4 stars instead of 3 is my husband hated it.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this sunscreen based on the reviews I read, but I was very disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the product</li>
            <li> but I hate it!  </li>
            <li> I probably bought every sunscreen on the market and it would sting their eyes horribly.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this product a lot! I used it in Maui while hiking and hanging out by the beach for 3-4 hours at a time. It does apply with a white tint, but the key is to not use too much and spread it around. So I dabbed a pea-size here and there and then rubbed it in and spread it. The slight white tint does fade away, and I have asian skin. It does not feel greasy. Like everyone said, it smells wonderful. I still plan on using this product for runs, and daily use, but I do feel that it needs to be reapplied for longer excursions (which is expected since it&#x27;s SPF 25). After about 2 hours I could feel my skin tingle, but I did not burn.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping that they come out with one that has a higher SPF, but can maintain the same quality. I would buy this product again, and I did suggest it to my sister as well. With all the horror stories I hear about mineral sunscreens leaving a white face, I think this one did a great job.</li>
            <li> Thick, greasy and leaves your face metallic white. Great if you are only going to the beach, or to a Halloween party. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying to wear this product under make-up.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, however it made my face breakout so I only use it on my body now.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and subtle. I&#x27;m using it every day!</li>
            <li> This was a gift I might buy some later...was a little pricey</li>
            <li> Needed biodegradable sunscreen for underground rivers in Mexico. I didn&#x27;t burn, and I&#x27;m Irish, so I guess it works, Cheers</li>
            <li> friendly customer service. product feels natural and smells good. But unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me, it is thick and leaves the skin covered with a white layer. I ended up mixing it with some other oils and a little foundation to be able to use it.  Not happy with that purchase overall.</li>
            <li> Better than all of the zinc sunscreens I&#x27;ve used. It smells so nice and leaves the lightest zinc-white hue to your skin. I use this for my face. It hasn&#x27;t made my skin breakout. Love it</li>
            <li> I need natural for how much I put sunblock on my tattoos</li>
            <li> The product did a very nice job, wasn&#x27;t white like most others I&#x27;ve tried, and smelled nice without being overly strong.  Amazon shipped it and I received with the free shipping offer quickly.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy this sunscreen.  I wear it everyday.  It wears well under my make up and does not make me break out.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! A bit hard to run in, but once the time is taken to do so, it works very well. I am very fair skinned and I got a nice tan being in the Caribbean sun for 3 hours at a time. Highly recommended! One bottle of this stuff lasted me for a whole week of a cruise and a whole week in Florida.</li>
            <li> Light and non greasy... I recommend</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!! Works great on my babies!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent protect from sun light such as UV.&lt;br /&gt;Very cheap and affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to your product, I&#x27;ll have white face.</li>
            <li> Love these products. I don&#x27;t normally review. but they inspired me today. A couple of other companies were reviewed because of them. Great business. thanks.</li>
            <li> Awesome. All natural. No nothing bad for your kids. Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of using a product with natural SPF, however this was a disappointment.  It is very white and does not spread easily.  The smell is pleasant enough and it is effective, but I fell like I needed a putty knife to sparkle this on!</li>
            <li> No complaints. Worked well.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  It is a little on the heavy side, but I don&#x27;t find that it leaves my face white or greasy at all. I do have rosacea, which makes me break out easily, so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m going to keep up daily use, but I&#x27;m going to give it a try for awhile. I really like that it really is made of natural products- no hidden weird stuff. The smell is quite pleasant as well- not &amp;#34;sunscreen-y&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Nice scent and texture. Goes on smooth and quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> Used this sunscreen for the first time this weekend on a family trip to Legoland. We were outside from 10am until 4pm in the direct sun for most of the day. I didn&#x27;t get a chance to apply it on myself except my shoulders (which I&#x27;m happy to say did NOT get burnt) but mostly put it on my kids. I covered my daughter in it from head to toe and she didn&#x27;t even get a slight burn or color which means it did an AMAZING job blocking the sun. I put it mostly all over my son as well and he didn&#x27;t get burnt at all either. I am happy that I got this product 100%. I was the person who didn&#x27;t use sunscreen prior because I couldn&#x27;t put myself to using the awful ingredients in regular store bought suntan lotion. There is also the dangers in being in the sun without it though, so it solved that problem for me! :)</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen because it has all natural ingredients.  Works well under my make-up and on my cheekbones where I have sun spots. I use it on the top of my hands to protect from sun also and it feels very protective and soft.  It rubs in well and disappears.  I have small grandchildren and can feel good about using this on them also because it is all natural ingredients. Has a nice clean subtle scent, not perfumy.</li>
            <li> Does its job. Very expensive but it does what it needs to. Very light and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients and I love the smell too! Very happy that I got it.</li>
            <li> Good product, especially for heavily exposed areas - ears, nose, neck.  I like the formula for those areas.  The only downside is it would be a difficult application for a whole body sunscreen, as it is pretty thick and viscous</li>
            <li> It is thick and white but disappears in a few minutes. My daughter has been allergic to all the sunscreens we have every tried but we were going to Hawaii and I wanted to try something. This was great! No reaction. However, I had bought the Blue Lizard sunscreen at the same time to try it and it is a little less thick and is white as well but rubs in quicker so we used that one more. Both worked very well.</li>
            <li> We all went out to the beach over the weekend and used it for the first time!! Worked GREAT! Doesn&#x27;t have a chemical smell like most sunscreens. It has a pleasant odor that my 5-year old was fine with. I lathered us all up and NO sunburn! We were on the beach for a couple hours in 80 degree weather! To add, it wasn&#x27;t really greasy as some natural sunscreens we have tried in the past! Great product!! :)</li>
            <li> Really nice sunscreen, but not good for a daily face lotion under makeup. It&#x27;s really thick and leaves white residue on your eyebrows. Does not absorb thoroughly like other people are reporting. But great for taking to the pool/lake/river. I&#x27;m not sure how well it would hold up at the beach...</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love the ingredients. Could be a little smoother to apply.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, non-greasy.</li>
            <li> Thank you for this great product! Not only it is safe from dangerous chemicals, it is a pleasure to use! Nice smell, great texture, goes on nicely, doesn&#x27;t leave skin oily. A little thick so you will see it first but then it blends in. In my experience all physical sunscreens are thick but that is a small price to pay for not having the junk in it. So happy to have finally found this!</li>
            <li> This Beauty by Earth Sunscreen is fine.&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Feels light on skin&lt;br /&gt;Rubs in well (for a zinc oxide sunscreen)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;The smell.  (I just don&#x27;t care for it, and since I bought to use on my face I really don&#x27;t like it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll stick with my Badger from now on.</li>
            <li> Really appreciate the natural feel of it. Its Not sticky. Love the smooth texture and great smell too:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product!!! We just had my daughter baby shower outside form 1pm to 6pm and it was the first time I was outside like that this year. First it went on so nice, soaked right in and was not greasy at all and did not make me feel sticky like some sunscreen does. Second I got such a nice golden tan. Did not burn at all!!! Third usually want I put a product like this on my face the next day I have a break out. Not this time!!! Highly recommend awesome product and one I will be getting more of!!!!</li>
            <li> love this stuff!!!  First , I get burned like no body&#x27;s beezwax if I don&#x27;t have fantastic sunscreen.  It&#x27;s also super important that I see exactly where the sunscreen is being applied.  If I miss even a tiny little spot It&#x27;ll burn; So I like that I can see this sunscreen while applying.  Some stuff has so much alcohol that it evaporates and then I&#x27;m left patchy.  Not this stuff at all. great barrier protection.  second, I love it enough to use it on my little organic-only-eating-babies.  I&#x27;m a label reader and this passed the mom-check.</li>
            <li> We have been trying several different natural sunscreens this summer to avoid all the harmful chemicals, while still protecting our skin from harmful rays!  I&#x27;m confident this is among the top quality for the price!  We have been very impressed with everything from the delicate &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; scent to the smooth application.  I feel good about using this product on my fair skin, knowing I will be protected without exposing myself to harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Smells great, has a thinner consistency making it easy to rub in nicely. Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy on my face feels light... Only use on my face I have a spray use on my body...</li>
            <li> Nice smell -- not strong, but pleasant. Works really well to prevent a sun burn. yes, it does leave a little bit of a white film on your skin. It does not rub in completely clear (but almost). Yet I have yet to burn in the strongest of sun so I think it is worth it!</li>
            <li> Feels fresh and light in my skin. It does take a while to not look white on my skin but it&#x27;s worth it for the way it feels,  protects and isn&#x27;t filled with crap.</li>
            <li> Very white at first, but fades (although not completely) with time. Nice earthy scent.</li>
            <li> Pros: Great price as a facial sunscreen (cheaper than Neutrogena face sunscreen per ounce)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t make me breakout ***&lt;br /&gt;smells great&lt;br /&gt;feels moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;very natural with great ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Eventually rubs in well&lt;br /&gt;Gentle enough to use under eyes with no burning or issues!&lt;br /&gt;Cons: leaves a slight blue white residue on wheat colored skin (so take a pass on special occasions or when you will be photographed)&lt;br /&gt;expensive for a body sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review: Like all natural physical sunscreens this is hard to rub in, and leaves a whitish, metallic ghostly cast to skin. it is not as bad as most, isn&#x27;t too oily, hasn&#x27;t caused breakouts and feels very moisturizing on skin. After using it my skin feels great. It does eventually rub (i dab all over my face). I wear this under Tarte makeup and a facial powder that I made myself and I love how it looks. It can make darker skin look pale. And you need to dab it all over your face and gently rub in otherwise it doesn&#x27;t spread well. This is true of all natural physical sunscreens and this one is more cosmetically elegant than anyone that I have tried. Not the greatest for special occasions. But for everyday where it is a winner. I live in a California city that often gets to 115 fahrenheit! I needed great protection and so I bought this. So far it has been good, but it hasn&#x27;t been summer yet. If it fails to protect me I will let you know. In general trust physical sunscreens much more than chemical. Will keep you posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For special occasions I recommend Chanel liquid (UV Essential), Shiesdo liquid, the more affordable Japanese Biore liquid Aqua rich (for a shimmery glow) and Japanese Biore Perfect face (for a more matte powdery finish).</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! The only sunblock I will ever use!</li>
            <li> My new favorite sunscreen! First of all, I trust this brand and the ingredients they use in their products. When it comes to picking sunscreen, I try to avoid the heavy chemicals. So, I was very pleased to find this product by Beauty by Earth, which is a great (and natural) alternative. Second, this sunscreen smells heavenly!  I hate the traditional sunscreen stench, so I am SOOOO pleased that this isn&#x27;t that scent. Third and lastly, the consistency is very nice and creamy and blends in very well! I use it on my daughters as well as myself.</li>
            <li> I used this today with my 4.5 month old baby and it worked great! It&#x27;s totally safe and organic and I&#x27;m really happy I ordered it because I was looking and looking for a sunscreen I could use on my little one and now I found it!</li>
            <li> I loved it! With two small children I&#x27;m worried about the different chemicals in different sunscreens.  I tried it and was really happy with it.  It worked great and I love that it&#x27;s all natural.  Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Creamy yet not greasy!  Plus it has all the good stuff in and not no poisons!  Thanks~</li>
            <li> Excellent Sunscreen. Very effective for me. I easily burn and I also get itchy rashes from many products, but not from this. I waited to write this review until I could test this sunscreen in a tropical climate, and it worked for me as well as others in my family with different skin types, although, as other reviewers have noted,  white residue remains after the sunscreen dries, especially when more is used, but that is a minor matter, because it is not drying or sticky. My family looks to me to make recommendations to them and I felt confident when they didn&#x27;t have their own sunscreen I had something  that was safe and effective in general as well as  for kids and more sensitive types. Will continue to recommend.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is incredible!  I have a red-headed toddler who requires sunscreen any time we are spending a significant amount of time outdoors (which is often living in Southern California!). This has been a God-send.  Not only does it have a very pleasant neutral scent, but it is the first product that doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin.  In fact, not only is successfully protected from the sun, but her skin feels AMAZING.  It is totally moisturized and also seems to have handled some other pre-existing skin irritations.  I LOVE THIS SUNSCREEN!!!</li>
            <li> This product is great and so are the people that stand behind it. The ingredients are fantastic, and won&#x27;t cause any allergic reactions like most sunscreens. On light colored skins (Caucasian) it does not turn your skin white unless applied too heavy. Unfortunately, if this is not your skin type, it will leave your skin looking like a Geisha (for the lack of a better comparison). This is due to the natural sunscreen properties. If you have a beard, it will not absorb as well and stand out more. I contacted their customer service, and was offered a refund.</li>
            <li> Extremely thick and pasty, does not spread out, very difficult to rub in, it&#x27;s hard enough for kids to stay still for sunscreen application this one prolongs the process, great that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; but needs to be reformulated</li>
            <li> I love this product! All the natural ingredients, protect my skin from sunburn. Plus, I love the natural smells from the essential oil!</li>
            <li> I really like how this sunscreen is comprised of all natural ingredients. I don&#x27;t mind the smell, which is a bit citrus-y and resinous. However, I could not get used to its greasiness. After a couple weeks of daily use (and a lot of hiking), I developed some pimples on my neck and chest area (and I&#x27;ve never been prone to acne in these places), so I figured the sunscreen was the cause. After not using it for a couple weeks, the pimples went away. Overall, I would recommend this sunscreen if you are not at all prone to acne or do not mind the greasy white sheen it leaves.</li>
            <li> I live by this for myself and my children because it&#x27;s totally natural. It&#x27;s not greasy and smells really nice. Yes you have to rub it in, totally expected for mineral sunscreens, and I don&#x27;t consider this to be any problem when the alternative is covering my kids in chemicals.</li>
            <li> I LIke Natural Products But Definitely Love ThisSunscreen, I Use In My Little Daughter Every DayWhen She&#x27;s Outside And Her Skin Looks great, I Feel Happy They Give Me Promotion For This Product. :)</li>
            <li> yes this is natural, yes it does not rub in that well, yes you will look like an extra in a twilight movie but you also won&#x27;t be smearing your body with harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works better than any commercial chemical cocktail and a little goes a long way. Light, pleasant scent, non-greasy, and waterproof. My new favorite sunscreen!</li>
            <li> It smells nice but my eyes sting when applying to cheeks and forehead. We haven&#x27;t burned, but it is letting a lot of sun through judging by the tan lines after 90 minutes of sun.</li>
            <li> If you are olive or dark skinned you will not like this product. It will NOT blend into your skin and It&lt;br /&gt;will make you look ridiculous like you painted yourself with white paint. Also, for others be aware that&lt;br /&gt;the product is very thick and NOT so easy to apply. I had to return product.</li>
            <li> Love having a natural sunscreen I can use for my baby! I&#x27;ve always been concerned about putting anything on his skin but this is a perfect non-toxic sunscreen that does the job well! Thanks!</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews, I thought I&#x27;d found my favorite new sunscreen! Unfortunately, this is anything but. I only use natural sunscreens so know they take a little more work to apply than regular sunscreens, but this one in particular is very difficult to apply. VERY. It&#x27;s not only thick, but even after trying to shake it thoroughly it&#x27;s still separated into thick sticky sunscreen surrounded by water when you squeeze it out of the bottle. When you go to apply the handful of mess to your skin, the watery part spreads evenly, and the white part ends up in uneven, flat patches. After a considerable amount of work, you&#x27;ll eventually get it spread evenly, but I&#x27;m not sure how anyone gets rid of the very white color or the considerable greasiness. I&#x27;ve tried a handful of different methods of application over the past couple of months, thinking I just needed to figure out the &amp;#34;trick&amp;#34; to this natural sunscreen in particular, but I&#x27;m done trying. I can&#x27;t even make this work well enough to use up the rest of the bottle! Thankfully, there are other natural easier-to-apply sunscreens in this price range (recently tried and really like the Beyond Coastal products).</li>
            <li> Works fine but it&#x27;s hard to apply, very thick and makes you look like a ghost. Badger brand is much better in comparison</li>
            <li> this is a great organic sun screen that I use for myself and my daughter when we are outside for a long time. It smells great and goes on our skin real nice.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to spread...as I expect all zinc oxide based sunscreens to be, so that wasn&#x27;t really a surprise. But I&#x27;ll tell you what, this stuff definitely works! Spent 10 days at the beach and didn&#x27;t burn a single time. The rest of my family was using spray on sunscreen and each of them got burnt at least a time or two. I was worried about this bottle lasting me the whole vacation, but I still have plenty left over. I didn&#x27;t need nearly as much as I thought I would. A little went a long ways. The biggest downside was just the time it took to actually put it on because it takes time to rub it in. It was also perfect for my face. I didn&#x27;t break out a single time, and I have very sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Great product! Absorbed really well and has a pleasant smell.  Can&#x27;t wait to use it on our trip to Cozumel.</li>
            <li> Really nice sunscreen!  Not greasy and I love that I am not putting a bunch of crap (chemicals) on my skin and into my system.  I&#x27;m very pleased and will be using this for my family again and again.</li>
            <li> This Sunscreen doesn&#x27;t have weird smell. However, it does leave skin white color just like other suncreens do. You only need to rub a litte more. I have super sensitive skin and oily skin. This suncreen really works. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this is nontoxic.  It goes on quite thick and white, but with some effort you can work into the skin and it then becomes clear.</li>
            <li> So I went to a birthday party at the park this weekend. I remembered to bring sunscreen but not a hat.... Ugh. No worries. I put this sunscreen on myself and my toddler- it&#x27;s not chemically so it is thick and you have to take your time to work it in a bit, and a little goes a long way. At the end of the day when I get home I notice that my face looks great, but my neck and shoulders are stinging.... Ugh ugh ugh yeah, pretty bad burn.... (I should totally know better, I am pretty fair and burn really easily.) The good news is that my face and arms where I DID put on sunblock where totally unburned even after being out for many hours. And my son who got a full slathering was totally unburned, not even a little pink.  So I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using this, and it has a really nice smell to it too. Great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s natural.  When I apply it, it appears white at first, but when you rub it in, it blends in nicely.  I learned just not to use too much or it feels heavy.  I will only use natural sunscreen and I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen every....leaves your skin feeling so soft...</li>
            <li> Just a warning - this sunscreen goes on VERY thick and VERY white!</li>
            <li> Only reason I&#x27;m not in love with this product, its not creamy and doesn&#x27;t apply or spread well. I probably wouldn&#x27;t order again at this price for sunscreen. I expected excellance. ;+(</li>
            <li> I like that this is a natural sunscreen but it does take effort to rub it in so the white residue disappears. A lot of the sunscreens have this minor problem, so I still give it 4 stars!</li>
            <li> I ordered this sunscreen based on the reviews I read, but I was very disappointed in the product. I ordered this due to my son (who has eczema) recently developed an allergic reaction to Banana Boat and Water Babies sunscreens. I bought it also due to it being &amp;#34;Natural and Reef Safe.&amp;#34; I was hoping to use it in Hawaii because of that. However, it was hard to spread on his body. It dispensed well, but it was very hard to rub into the skin. It left white streaks everywhere the product was applied. This caused him to not be protected in those areas as his body was tanned in the areas adjacent to the white streaks. I was very disappointed in the product so I returned it. The only thing I liked about it was that it stated it was &amp;#34;reef safe.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Spent day at outdoor concert using this all natural sunscreen.  Worked wonderfully and smells incredible!</li>
            <li> I got a set burn/tan. Decided to even it out, ordered this, and went to the pool for a little bit having this only on my hands and shoulders. Yeah, not smart, yet this thing works, I leant it the hard way. I could clearly see where I had the cream on and where I didn&#x27;t. And I was actually fine with the texture too, was worried about it after reading the reviews. Seems pretty natural to me. So thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I bought a face creme once that had sunscreen in it and it set my face on fire. That&#x27;s how I found out I was allergic to something....probably the PABA in it. So I was anxious to try this Beauty by Earth Natural Sunscreen. I put it on and it worked great. Even better, my daughter-in-law rubbed her brand on my granddaughter who started complaining almost immediately that her face was burning. We washed it off and applied the BbyE Natural Sunscreen on and it soothed the burning situation. After that, her mom made sure to only use the BbyE Natural Sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and I got rash from using other products. No problem with this product. Easy to apply. I use it on my daughter who has eczema. Working well.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that it is difficult to spread.</li>
            <li> Great product. It goes on white, like a zinc cream so you need to rub it in well, but even then it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy and oily. It&#x27;s surprisingly light. I am going to try more products by them.</li>
            <li> I just want to point out ALL organic sunscreens are &amp;#34;harder&amp;#34; to spread on compared to the ones fulled with all kinds of chemicals.  I personally loved it!  I especially appreciated the scent.  Most are floral (which I cannot have) and this isn&#x27;t but still smells so good!  Fast shipping, love the product, not greasy,Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin so I am always looking for a natural Sunscreen to prevent sunburns.  I have used this Sunscreen and it&#x27;s great. It feels good putting it on your skin. It smells great and for what it&#x27;s worth, I like the packaging and design too. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing negative to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for introducing me to a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> If anyone is looking for a true sun block, then look no more. This sun block creates a barrier between you and the suns power rays.  Being a boater I know; from every activity of being in and out of the water this is the only block you&#x27;ll ever need. It has a rich texture; therefore, making it a product that doesn&#x27;t need to be constantly reapplied.</li>
            <li> LOVE this sun screen. I use this on myself and my 10 month old son. Don&#x27;t let the small size of the bottle fool you. A tiny bit goes a LONG way! It&#x27;s creamy and thick and hasn&#x27;t washed off of either of us!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT NATURAL SUNSCREEN</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen, it works and it is safer than what i have been using.</li>
            <li> 1) Love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural&lt;br /&gt;2) Goes on easily - I had no issues with &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; of my skin&lt;br /&gt;3) Protects from sunburn&lt;br /&gt;4) Has a very pleasant scent&lt;br /&gt;5) Washes off easily&lt;br /&gt;6) Would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> This is some nice stuff. Wore it for the first time in LA out in the sun. Worked well. Not too greasy and love that it&#x27;s safe to use without toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> New to this produce. Love it so far.  It&#x27;s not thick and greasy like a lot of sunscreens.  I would give it more stars, but just started using it.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen is extremely important to me as I have sensitive skin that burns easily.  My younger daughter has inherited this skin from me.  When I was growing up in the 70s, sun tan lotions and oils were the thing and finding something to prevent burning was very difficult.  This sunscreen is different from many currently available.  It is very thick, almost like the zinc oxide we put on our noses when skiing, but instead of staying white on my face, it rubbed in without causing any bad skin reactions.  I was able to work in the sun in my garden without getting even pink for a change.  It is also different because of the ingredients.  I like that it is natural, non-toxic and safe for the environment, should you be swimming in the ocean or a lake.  It has a light pleasant smell and a cooling feel.  And it works.  Sunscreen doesn&#x27;t get much better than this.</li>
            <li> Love it! The only one sunscreen I use on my kids. No chemicals needed! Smells great, very easy to apply, non oily. One of my daughter has a problematic skin (very dry) but the sunscreen is gentle and easy on her skin. I love that has organic ingredients and the tube last long imd too!</li>
            <li> I was alarmed when I first applied this lotion to my face, as it did not go on smoothly (it was lumpy).  It took quite a bit of rubbing to dissolve the texture into a smooth consistency and work in the stark white cream, so that my natural skin tone appeared.  Hands still feel greasy....but perhaps that&#x27;s to be expected with sun screen. It smells pleasant which is a welcomed change.  I will continue to use it as I want to support organic products, however, I will also shop around for a lotion that isn&#x27;t quite as thick.</li>
            <li> Wonderful natural sunscreen for adults and children!!! No skin reactions on myself nor my 10 month old, and my skin is quite sensitive. We were out in the sun for a few hours on a humid day and no redness. While it isn&#x27;t oily it is thick and rubs in dry creating more of a creamy complexion on skin. I would suggest placing tiny dollops in an area and then rubbing, rather than placing on hands and then rubbing on skin. Absolutely the new permanent sunscreen for my family!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new sunscreen because the other organic one I was using was super expensive and a real pain to spread, particularly on my three-year-old who doesn&#x27;t really have patience for sunscreen. This sunscreen was not only more affordable, it smelled better (really nice actually) and definitely spread better. I use it on myself, my three-year-old and my 11-month-old and it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is great!  There are so many great ingredients in it.  It has aloe vera, castor oil and coconut oil in it, which all heal your skin. It also has organic green tea extract in it, which is an anti-inflammatory.  There are no parabens, no phalates, no paba, no toxic chemicals and no chemical fragrance.  So it is gentle enough to use on children.  It is also water resistant, so if you are using it for outdoor sports or water sports, it works!</li>
            <li> This product works great. Goes on thick. Like that it&#x27;s all nature and organic. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I&#x27;m very fair skinned and burn easy and this works. You do have to reapply many times through the day if you get in and out of water.&lt;br /&gt;I received this for a reduced amount for giving a honest and personal review</li>
            <li> so far so good.. love the smell..its just real thick!</li>
            <li> Works great! Even for my little guy&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Very creamy.</li>
            <li> This is a nice organic sunscreen to use when you are out and about - nice and light, too.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen I have ever tried. I have very fair sensitive skin so I burn easily and I am allergic to most sunscreens. This sunscreen keeps me from burning without the rash no matter how many days I apply it in a row. It spreads easily and does not leave me all pasty white like some other zinc based sunscreens. I also love how it smells, I will definitely be buying again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this sunscreen and I keep trying it, but I hate it!  Some of it comes out of the container watery, but the rest comes out like a white blob.  Trying to rub it into my arms and legs is ridiculous.  I can&#x27;t imagine kids staying still for it.  Yes, it&#x27;s mineral-based, but so is Babyganics, Blue Lizard, and Badger.  I just don&#x27;t get why anyone would buy this a second time.  Do you all really love it?  Really?  Babyganics has become my go to sunscreen for arms and legs, although I have some Blue Llizard to try too.  Just bought Cotz face spf 40 and I love it!  I like the idea and packaging of Beauty by Earth, but unless I got a bad tube, this is a crazy bad product.</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen, initially it takes some rubbing in but it lasts all day, even in the pool. I recommend for fair skinned individuals for great protection.</li>
            <li> I had to wait until we had actually sun to rate this product....I love the all natural part of the product .  Because there is a lot of Zinc, that&#x27;s a little bit of time to rub it in.  The SPF was perfect.  My next time to test it well, will be in Aruba in September.......I also love the smell......better than most sunscreens out there   UPDATE :   used this natural sunscreen on my face in Aruba.   I LOVE IT !!!   my face did not break out...had to rub in a little bit but it worked and I was very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> I love this sunblock! I use it on myself and my toddler. It smells good and works well. Makes me feel good knowing it is not full of carcinogens.</li>
            <li> I am not a big sunscreen person myself, but my daughter is 1 yrs old and has red hair and fair skin. I ordered this sunscreen because it is organic and natural so is safe to use on my daughter, but it also smells wonderful and the consistency is not oily and rubs into skin really well. I also love that it is SPF 25, not too high (50) and not too low (10). Also, the packaging is really cute too and the bottle is the perfect size.</li>
            <li> I like the scent.  I like that it&#x27;s natural.  But unlike the other reviewers I found it super white and difficult to rub in and spread over my skin.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product! It&#x27;s one of the best sunscreens on the market. I have lived in the sun for the past 12 years and this sunscreen works great. I am now using it daily on my chest and arms and of course when I am at the beach or pool (almost daily with Summer and kids). This has no harsh ingredients (so nice compared so many other junk sunscreens on the market), smells wonderful and it goes on nicely (not oily). Thank you I have passed this product onto other friends of mine that&#x27;s how much I love it.</li>
            <li> Sent to me for review this sunscreen is made from a number of natural products with less harmful ingredients and has a SPF value of 25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be used by both adults and children with all skin types and can be used in both dry and aqueous environments (waterproof).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlikely most other suncreams it offers full protection to all uses instantly without you having to wait the 30-45mins &#x27;Protection activation time&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a well labeled, eco friendly, thin cardboard box and inside contains an attractive black and white 118ml / 4 fl.oz tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is white with a fairly thick consistency. It absorbs well into the skin and thankfully it did not have an unpleasant scent or stickiness like a lot of others do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer recommends applying the product immediately prior to exposing yourself to the sun and reapply as needed. In general though it&#x27;s best to apply it every 60-90 mins if you are in and out of water along with drying yourself regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this to meet the required standard during use as it protected me well from sunburn and I was happy to have it on my body.</li>
            <li> Have used a couple of times for swimming and for cycling as well as for my preschooler while playing outside (just got the product last week).  Is a bit thick and goes on white, but with a bit of rubbing, the white mostly goes away.  I do not think the effort is too much, considering that this is a natural product that is using non-nano zinc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to work well - my child&#x27;s skin not reddened like it typically is when playing outside without sunscreen.  Did not run into my eyes while cycling in humid temps.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite sunscreen. I use it for my baby and toddler and myself. The smell is so nice that I actually look forward to using it! It rubs in nicely too and is all natural! Yay!</li>
            <li> My kids and I love this sunscreen.  It has a great smell and does not burn skin or eyes.  Additionally we were out at the pool for 2 hours playing in the water, no burns at all.  I have been looking for a safe and natural sunscreen, that works and is cost effective.  No need to look any further.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I don&#x27;t use sunscreen too often because my skin tone is a bit on the dark side which is great because I don&#x27;t burn easily because of it. That said, when I&#x27;m out in the bright California sun all day long I still need a protective layer that I can apply and I love that this is Organic!! Great product, great company! I hope there are more products to come!</li>
            <li> This sunblock smells wonderful.  According to the label, the fragrance is natural, which is rare!  I wish it rubbed in better.  I&#x27;m not sure I will order it again, at least to use on my face, because it makes me look a little unhealthy.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen goes on easily and works well for my kids and me. Great product!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Used it all summer long. We live in Florida so are outdoors all the time. I used this throughout the entire summer and the kids never came home burnt. But more importantly to that was finding a sunscreen that did not burn the kids eyes. this was a huge problem. I probably bought every sunscreen on the market and it would sting their eyes horribly. My 4-year-old asks me now if I have beauty sunscreen cause that is the one that doesn&#x27;t hurt his eyes. Absolutely recommend to everyone but especially mothers and fathers.</li>
            <li> The product has a nice smell and it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Suitable for anyone, all ages. Invisible on the skin, it&#x27;s a mineral barrier, not chemical, smells nice too. Reapply it after swimming or sweating. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> This product works great!  My two kids and I use it and no sun burns.  It is easy to rub in, has a very slight, pleasant smell and a little goes a long way.  Some other natural/organic sun screens are very thick and hard to apply, leaving you looking like Casper the ghost.  This doesn&#x27;t!  My husband likes it too.  He has sensitive skin and he is able to use this when he goes out fishing.  It protects from the sun reflecting off of the water.  The bottle size &amp; design makes it easy to put in your purse or backpack.</li>
            <li> Too thick! Hard to apply. After I finally put it on my face looked like covered by white paint. I guess I have to throw it away. A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Loved this reef-safe, natural sunscreen. We went to St. John, USVI, which is known for tropical sun and severe sunburns. There are people that stated they still had sunburn after wearing sunscreen. We had 4 people use this natural sunscreen and none of us had any burns whatsoever after the week was over. It can leave you looking white if you put on too much. Just put on a thin layer and it is enough. It also seemed to last all day! We were fine without reapplication, but I still reapplied after a few hours in the water just to be safe.</li>
            <li> Product def blocks the sun however it turns your skin white no matter how hard you rub it in. Apply and towel off to remove some ghosting</li>
            <li> PRO:&lt;br /&gt;-SMELL: lovely for a sunscreen, especially if you plan on wearing it as an every day item (its not over-powering like most sunscreens)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-White Sheen that&#x27;s impossible to completely rub in. I even had several people ASK me about it throughout several different days trying this. That was AFTER rubbing it in until I couldnt see the more obvious &amp;#34;just put sunscreen on&amp;#34; layer, and applied makeup. Maybe this wouldnt matter if you are only using it outside/for sport, but I had planned on using it as a very light protective layer (it is only 25 SPF, after all)&lt;br /&gt;-Greasy: Aside from the color issue on my face, it felt greasy no matter where I put it, and continued to make my skin more greasy than usual as I wore it.&lt;br /&gt;-SPF: very low if you are outside a lot. I had purchased this, as I mentioned, to wear as an &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; basic level, and stick with my higher SPF during activities, but I wont be using this again.</li>
            <li> Good quality sunscreen.  You can&#x27;t get good organic and natural sunscreen at most local stores.  This is a high quality sunscreen that will keep your skin healthy!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice sunscreen.  It is thick and natural.  It smells DELICIOUS.  It requires some additional rubbing to get rid of the white residue, but this is because it is more natural than other sunscreens.  It also works well.  The SPF 25 is a great middle ground for me.  I like 15 and 30, so 25 is perfect for me!  I wore it and did not get sunburned in the hot Florida sun, so I recommend it to everyone!  And seriously, it smells incredible!</li>
            <li> I stopped buying regular sunscreen a few years ago. I had been researching sunscreen and and found that more than 75% of the sunscreens contained toxic chemicals that can increase your risk of cancer. GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;Well this amazing cream is the answer. It&#x27;s very effective. Organic! And I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> We bought this for two ecological park excursions in Mexico. It worked well for protection - none of us got burned. It does go on thick because one of the active ingredients is zinc oxide but we rubbed it in well so it wasn&#x27;t too obvious. We saw many others with white layers of sunscreen so we didn&#x27;t feel out of place. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad either. Decent price for a 4 oz. tube compared to other naturals and with the good performance we experienced.</li>
            <li> I have allergies to many sunscreen lotions.  The only one so far that I can use is chalky and costly.  I decided to take a risk with Natural Sunscreen and hope that I would not have a bad reaction.  Not only did I not react but I also found the lotion to be easier to tolerate and therefor I am more inclined to use it as I should.  I am encouraged to find it available through Amazon Prime and will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> At last a natural- chemical free sunscreen without all that toxic nastiness. This cream does need a good rub in as good sunscreen should. The herbal scent will take you to the beach when applying almost instantly. Apply pea size amounts at a time and rub in desired area to avoid looking like a ghost. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m out in the sun everyday and this is now my new go to sunscreen which I apply 4-6 times daily. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the quality and purity of this product and recommend it highly to those who are skeptical on what they apply to their skin. As far as price is concerned, this is the classic case of you pay for what you get. If you want a quality product with quality ingredients, this is worth every penny and some.</li>
            <li> My children and I have sensitive skin ,especially around the face and neck area and so when we use regular sunscreen it tends to burn and sting. I purchased the Natural Sunscreen from Beauty by Earth and we are all very happy and satisfied after using this product. It has a awesome fragrance that just is wonderful and reminds me of the Tropics. We will continue to use this product from now on</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients and the non-toxic nature of this sunscreen.  I did find it to be a bit hard to rub in.  I felt I had to use more of it than other mineral sunscreens because it was hard to spread.  It did leave a white film on my skin that I couldn&#x27;t blend in with any amount of rubbing.  When I went in the pool, the white became more noticeable.  Not too pretty, but at least I know it was staying on.  So for ease of use and appearance - 2 stars.  For skin cancer screening - 6 stars!    Update.  I got an email about my review from the company.  Very responsive.  They offered customers a free lip balm for our sunscreen purchase, which I accepted.  Today I have an envelope from the mailman requesting I put a check for $1.12 in an envelope before they can deliver the lip balm!</li>
            <li> I got the product pretty fast and have been using it, I have sensitive skin and this cream does not give me irritation like other products I used before, my skin feels clean and moisturized, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I do love this product!  This is my 1st purchase of this product.  It is thicker and a bit more opaque than a natural brand I&#x27;ve been using because of the higher spf content for people who don&#x27;t know.  This is an excellent, affordable, natural product if you&#x27;re considering going with natural.  My favorite benefit which I love about a physical sunscreen, is that once you put it on, you can go right out the door and not wait 20 - 30 minutes like chemical sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After moisturizing, let your skin dry down by waiting a few minutes before applying sunscreen.  If using an oil for moisturizing, you don&#x27;t need to wait.  The sunscreen will immediately, and easily blend in.  Spreading this on your skin in dabs will make it less opaque.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I know I&#x27;m not putting harmful nonsense on my kids or my skin! It does leave a visible residue but I didn&#x27;t find it offensive or to an extreme degree. I can use the visibility to gauge the necessity of reapplication.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely THRILLED with this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;For starters, when it goes on the hand it has the same pasty texture as other natural sunblocks made with zinc, but once it goes on the skin it applies extremely well with hardly any white residue. Texture is silky and smooth, not chalky.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly,  the scent is amazing! I can&#x27;t describe it, but it&#x27;s absolutely divine and very understated.&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan</li>
            <li> Excellent product! It smells great too! I love that it doesn&#x27;t have the harsh chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> I got a bottle of this sunscreen because I&#x27;m pregnant and don&#x27;t want harsh chemicals and toxins being transferred to me or my baby. I really like the fact that all the ingredients are natural and it still gives SPF 25 (I&#x27;m not sure why all sunscreens aren&#x27;t natural if it can be done and still provide protection from the sun). It takes a little more time to apply to the skin (I&#x27;m assuming because of the all natural ingredients rather than the usual greasy sunscreens that just glide on) but it&#x27;s really only 3 more seconds of your time to get it on and it&#x27;s completely worth it. Once it dried, I didn&#x27;t even noticed it was on me and it wasn&#x27;t greasy or anything. One thing that was a pleasant surprise is that it has a super yummy smell! I wasn&#x27;t expecting that. Definitely love and recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for an all natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I used this sunscreen this weekend. It does go on white, but it is very soothing to my skin. I also did NOT get a sunburn while out at the lake. I did get a nice tan, which is what I wanted. Some of it did not completely wash off when I washed my face, but it was so soothing and I know the ingredients are healthy and non toxic. My skin feels healthy, smooth and loves this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my 21 old daughter who has very light skin and burns easily; she has to wear sunscreen if she&#x27;s out in the sun at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the store shelves are full of sun-screen products that work well, I would never buy them.  They are full of chemicals that have been directly linked to cancer.&lt;br /&gt;Seems illogical to apply sunscreen to prevent skin cancer when the chemicals in the sunscreen have been directly linked to cancer!  No thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me a long time to find a product that is natural, free of harsh chemicals and most importantly - that works.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sunscreen products but my daughter burned as much with them on as she did with no sunscreen at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one made by Beauty by Earth is the best I&#x27;ve found.  It is natural and it works well.  After a full day on the beach with the outdoor temp being 95 and the sun index factor a 10 (on a scale of 0-10), including trips in and out of the salty ocean, my daughter had NO sunburn (except the base of her neck where she missed a spot and didn&#x27;t apply it.......)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit pricy, but id much rather pay for this, than pay for junk that leads to cancer or to pay an oncologist to treat cancer....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I found it; this will be our only sunscreen for as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> Perfect sunscreen for my sensitive skin!  Highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> So happy with this product. So many other sunscreens have so much crap in them.  So glad they make this with good stuff so you  can feel confident about putting it on your skin.</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen because it is all natural without harmful chemicals and nano partickles.&lt;br /&gt;It is thick and there was a white residue right after I applied it. The residue disappeared several minutes after. I think SPF 25 is enough for me. The less chemical exposure the better. I am still in a process of trying it. So far so good.</li>
            <li> The Beauty by Earth sunscreen smells very nice and pleasant. I am happy to see that the Beauty by Earth sunscreen does not contain chemicals or junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen comes out a pit patchy- a mix between cream and lotion- but once you start applying it onto your skin it goes on pretty smooth. You will get a tiny white cast of it (this is always the case with physical sunscreens) but this diminishes after a while. So we went out for about 2 hours on a nearby lake kayaking- the sun was burning- but we all stayed sunburn free thanks to this sunscreen. This worked perfect! I noticed that the scent changed after a while a little bit though. We had a great little kayak trip without any sunburn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not easy to find all natural, organic and cruelty free sunscreens and this one is by sure a fantastic choice! I only wish the bottle (4 oz.) would be a bit bigger! ;-)</li>
            <li> AWESOME PRODUCT!  I&#x27;am fair skinned, spent a week in Florida and didn&#x27;t burn at all. Its not grease! Goes on smooth! Smells good! Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling all slimmy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used this type of sunscreen before.  It doesn&#x27;t really soak in, you can detect a thin film on your skin where you have applied it, which wears off as it wears off, so you know when to reapply it.&lt;br /&gt;It says even thought it&#x27;s a solid sunscreen that it isn&#x27;t visible on the skin, but it is slightly visible, kind of an opalescent look to your skin where it is applied, but I didn&#x27;t find that objectionable.  Again, the fact that you can see where you have applied it, allows you to see when it needs reapplying, as it fades.&lt;br /&gt;I like the very subtle smell of the ingredients and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t smell like fake coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have soybean oil in it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it as much as I&#x27;ve planned to because I have not been outside much. I&#x27;m using this because the skin care system I use requires a sunscreen and I wanted something with out all the extra chemicals to add to that. The first  time I used it I wasn&#x27;t really sure how much to put and I used to much and my face was really really  white but it absorbed after a little while of being in the sun. Now that I know how much to use it&#x27;s not like it was the first time and it absorbs fast. I&#x27;m really glad  it hasn&#x27;t broke me out but I&#x27;ve only used it maybe 3 or 4 times. It deffinetly smells good. It&#x27;s also good my face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like I was thinking it might. The only thing I can complain about so far is, yes it absorbs fast but it&#x27;s not instantly like I&#x27;m used to with products I put on my face. I just don&#x27;t like how my face is white for a few minutes but I think I&#x27;ve had that with other sunscreens to but I do plan on purchasing another once I run out of this one. I would recommend this</li>
            <li> I just came back from Jamaica and I did not get burned nor did this product give me a rash as many sunscreens tend to do to me.  I am a fan</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is all natural and the smell is very pleasant and not too strong. Makes my skin feel soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and feels good. But since I&#x27;m a darker complexion, it did come off as white on my face. I decided to just not use sunscreen but this is a great sunscreen for anyone of a lighter complexion.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the natural sunscreen instead of chemical, but I couldn&#x27;t rub it in enough to not look so pale. Wish it had worked for me. I&#x27;m trying one for sensitive skin now.</li>
            <li> This product is great if you are looking for a natural sunscreen. Good for sensitive skin. Goes on easy and has a non greasy feel. Removal is also easy as well. Definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li> Rather difficult to apply, but does the job extremely well.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my daughter because many sunscreens irritate her skin and we needed to try something else. It was perfect for her. She did not have any irritation and liked the texture. I love having a natural sunscreen that will actually work.</li>
            <li> Love it. Stays for long. Absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something natural, as I am just sick and tired of all the crap in sunscreen.  But unfortunately, I had to send this back, because it was so yucky and pasty and white, and could not rub this in at all!  I looked ridiculous wearing it!  Laura  [...]</li>
            <li> We live in California, so we use sunscreen  everyday. I started reading the labels  on the sunscreen we were using on a daily basis. I didn&#x27;t know what half the ingredients were. I started looking for a more natural alternative. Came across this sunblock on Amazon and the reviews looked good. We love it! it smells great without being too strong. My 9 year old puts it on everyday before school as part of her morning routine.</li>
            <li> Every year at the beach I develop what I thought was sun poisoning. Turns out it was a reaction to some suntan lotions. This one is amazing. No burn, no bad reaction just pure reliable protection. I found that I really don&#x27;t even have to reapply often.smells great and a little goes a long way. Very Happy and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great protection. Although I wish this didn&#x27;t go on so thick, I feel good about putting it on my skin because I know it is much safer than most products out there. A little goes a long way. You just have to rub it in well to avoid looking pasty.  I would definitely recommend this product because it is safe and will last a long time due to the fact that you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen. Used it on my son and me and it protected us great! Also its not oily or sticky at all, goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is all natural. With a little work it rubbed into the skin.  I do wish it was a little easier.however without the harsh chemicals I feel this is a very small thing to have to deal with.</li>
            <li> I got this product for a vacation because my husband has sensitive skin. I was surprised at the light fresh smell and it rubs on easily. I will recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> So far, it seems to protect my skin well.  It has a pleasant scent and isn&#x27;t greasy.  Most importantly, organic and safe ingredients!</li>
            <li> I was searching for an oxybenzone-free sunscreen and found this product on Amazon. Based on reviews from other buyers, I purchased it and so far am very pleased with the texture and scent. It takes a bit longer to work into my skin because of the nature of the ingredients but I am happy to deal with that to avoid the harmful chemicals in previous products I have used. Once it is distributed on my skin, it is light and not sticky or greasy. I have only used it a few times but am already a fan. The seller delivered as promised. I would recommend this product and this seller</li>
            <li> Great product. I will definitely be buying this again soon. We live at the beach and go through a ton of sunscreen. Love that this is safe for the kiddos.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT, DOES NOT LEAVE OUR FACE AS WHITE AS OTHER PRODUCTS! YOU NEED TO RUB IT ON THOUGH! GOOD FOR NATURE AND US!</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen! has a smooth feel and sinks in to skin leaving it soft but without any oily or sticky residue. It looks white when you first rub it in but it will sink in and disappear! It has a mild pleasant scent to it which is much nicer than smelling like banana candy!</li>
            <li> Way thicker than I had hoped. I am still on the search for a natural sunscreen that spreads like California Baby without the nano particles.</li>
            <li> Does not go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this sunscreen. It is all natural and has a very light pleasant scent. Most sunscreens have a very distinctive sunscreen smell. This is something I can use every day without smelling like I&#x27;m going to the beach. And it feels very nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> This product smells so good!&lt;br /&gt;I bought it to try out on my 4 year old son. We&#x27;ve been using the Badger products because of the simple &amp; non toxic ingredients but have been open to try something that isn&#x27;t as thick. This one is much easier to put on and has similar ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;My son (who is fair skinned) was in the pool for hours in 90 degree weather yesterday and didn&#x27;t get any pinkness at all. I&#x27;m really pleased with it! If you&#x27;re looking for a sunscreen without toxic ingredients, that isn&#x27;t a paste and makes you look like a painted ghost, this is a must have!</li>
            <li> My new favorite sunscreen!  I love the scent!  It&#x27;s a light tropical scent!  It&#x27;s not too oily, blends in well, and it works!  I am very happy with the natural ingredients, too.  I hate how chemically the typical sunscreen is...</li>
            <li> Goes on clean. I love that it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients, especially with the kids in mind. And it works. :)</li>
            <li> I think that this is a great product. I love being able to go to the pool and not wonder about the chemicals that I am putting in my children and myself. Why not get the protection that I need without that? I recommend for everyone.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen.  I used it skiing at a very high altitude and it worked for me the whole time out, without having to reapply.  I didn&#x27;t get burned at all and it kept my skin soft and hydrated the whole day in the dry and cold climate.  It has a mild but very nice pleasant smell that I liked.</li>
            <li> I am very happy I bought this sunscreen. It is really important to me to not put any chemicals into my body, so that is why I originally bought this sunscreen. I read that some people complained about it being white on their face but I don&#x27;t have that problem, I think they just needed to rub it in better. I&#x27;m also proud to own reef safe sunscreen now!</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen, it does leave a little white cast however.  I am tan, so I think it would be better for lighter skin, or use in the winter.  I will wear it when at home and not in public (don&#x27;t want the white cast!).  I have very sensitive skin and my face burns when I use most sunscreen, this does not cause the burning feeling.  I only use this for my face.  I recommend this to anyone that has sensitivity like that to sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is the first sunscreen that I can identify everything on the label!  I am trying to minimize the chemicals I am exposed to on a routine basis, and this sunscreen fits the bill.  It rubs in to the skin nicely (titanium/zinc sunscreens are always a little think and need a little rubbing to get on, but this one is pretty good - I have tried &amp;#62;10 other kinds).  I will be using this on my baby too.</li>
            <li> This is very sticky and super hard to apply evenly. It works well but you&#x27;re going to have very splotchy skin afterwards all the spots you messed. I recommend not using it.</li>
            <li> I put a lot of time into trying to find a sunscreen that was chemical free and would not leave me with a white overcast. I read a lot of reviews and this one seemed to be what I wanted.  I have very fair skin with a reddish undertone so I am white enough to begin with!!  This product is thicker when compared to the chemical filled sunscreens I used to buy at the drugstore.  It does most definitely start out white but as I rub it in it disappears.  Not immediately, with my skin tone, there seemed to be a slight overcast but by the time I had finished my other arm the overcast was gone.  I need to say I also do not to slather on as much because a little goes a long way.  It seems that it is best to work in sections on your limbs, (e.g. upper arm, lower arm, etc.).  It does have a scent that is like a baby powder scent but that smell does not linger for hours.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest question is does it work?  With my lily white skin I put this on to be out in the Arizona sun.  It worked.  There was no burn.  Now I am sure this probably needs to be re-applied.  I was only out in the direct sun for a couple of hours and needed a break from the sun so I never re-applied.  That evening when I checked my skin before my shower there was no burn.  So yes, it works.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen makes my eyes sting for a moment when I put it on, but I will give it 5 stars anyway.  I have very sensitive skin and I think I have tried every sensitive skin sunblock that ever existed!  This one is the only one that doesn&#x27;t cause redness or any kind of irritation.  It is a little greasy, but from what I&#x27;ve seen all the sensitive skin sunblocks are greasy.  I&#x27;m not going to waste any more money on other brands, this one works, and it&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s fine for me.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m loving this sunscreen.  I&#x27;ve tried lots, and I means lots of different sunscreens, and I love that this one is not only is chemical free but that it has a smooth creamy texture that blends into my face with just a little rubbing.</li>
            <li> I love that this is a small family company that is dedicated to making a high-quality natural product. I liked the sun protection it provided, the feel of the sunscreen on my skin (not sticky), and it even smelled good! I was looking for an all natural sunscreen that didn&#x27;t contain any nano particles or have any synthetic chemical fragrances in it, and I found it with this one. My one big complaint is that I really looked white and sickly pale with it on. So much in fact that I was a little self-conscious about it. It&#x27;s really too bad, because I like everything else about this product.</li>
            <li> Smells great and does rub on well.  I burn easily on a good beach day.  I didn&#x27;t get burned,  Worth the $$.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an organic based sunscreen since i&#x27;ve been breaking out in acne with the regular sunscreen i used to use in the past. I have been using this sunscreen for the past few days and I already see a difference. I haven&#x27;t had any breaking out of skin or acne because of it. Acne scars also get fainter with sunscreen use. It smells good and initially when you put it on it feels like your face gets a bit white but you just need to rub it in more and it&#x27;s great. When I put it on initially I feel like my face is a bit greasy but as it settles in I don&#x27;t feel it anymore at all. I would recommend this product and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I only use physical (vs chemical sunscreen), and this one is great! Goes on easily. Does have to be rubbed in more so than a typical chemical sunscreen due to the zinc but it&#x27;s worth it. I never burn wearing this stuff!</li>
            <li> Update: 2/12/2016 - Around summer 2015 had several heatwaves of 90-100 degrees over the summer. Wasn&#x27;t able to keep the sunscreen in a temperature controlled environment. As a result the oils separated from the titanium oxide. The sunscreen had a clumpy fraction and a watery/oily fraction. Pretty sad it was ruined and had to chuck it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this sunscreen to replace the generic stuff I have. I feel like I&#x27;m reviewing a beer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: Great. Very natural and clean smell that&#x27;s refreshing. It is low key. I didn&#x27;t want something that screams &amp;#34;I GOT SUNBLOCK ON!!&amp;#34; I got what I wanted, a sunblock that smells nice. Honestly, my masculinity goes through the roof with this smell. I smell like a classy man who knows what&#x27;s up. Keeping my skin healthy now and be a suave-looking gentleman later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture: This is a lot thicker or more viscous than ordinary sun screen. I found myself dabbing little spots over my skin and then spreading it. My wife disliked the viscosity property, as she is use to putting a good dollop on one spot and spreading it. She said she would use it for her face or small areas, but not arms and legs. It made me look really pale when I spread a lot in one area. I got mixed feelings here. The consistency could be a little thinner to help spreading. I also feel it is great the way it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feeling: This feels a lot smoother on the skin. It did not leave my skin tacky or too oily. It feels like I just put on some body lotion, honestly nothing more than that feeling. I enjoyed that the oily feeling dissipates after an hour or so. Ordinary sunblock makes me feel like I&#x27;m going to break out in pimples hours afterwards. I just dislike that oily residue that smears on everything after putting on ordinary sunblock. This product I don&#x27;t notice after an hour. Just yesterday I went walking around beaches and small coastal towns. Got home late and went to bed. There is no oily residue that I&#x27;d be worried about getting onto my sheets. Woke up to write this review and my skin feels nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appearance: White lotion in a brown bottle. Picture is accurate. Heck I don&#x27;t know why I have this section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy again: Yup. Good stuff. Anything to prevent the associated costs of getting skin cancer. Worth it. Feels good. Smells good. Is good.iew and my skin feels nice and smooth.  Appearance: White lotion in a brown bottle. Picture is accurate. Heck I don&#x27;t know why I have this section.  Would I buy again: Yup.

            <li> Goes on white, yes, but it faded into my skin (and I have a dark complexion). It is pretty thick, so you have to work it in a bit, but it&#x27;s not so thick that it didn&#x27;t blend in. And, like I said, it seemed to fade, so I didn&#x27;t feel like a clown. Really nice subtle smell.  Two reasons why I gave it four stars instead of five: one, I have only been out in the sun twice since I purchased this, so I can&#x27;t say that I have a lot of experience with it. Secondly, I did feel a little itchy around my neck when I applied it, but it went away, and I saw no evidence of a rash or allergic reaction. I am looking forward to using it again, as I found the scent and the texture quite pleasant, and it seems as if the ingredients in this sunscreen are safer than most. I will post again if I discover anything else.</li>
            <li> Seems to help protect from the sun, but goes on heavy and does not sink in real well. Will use it up, but most likely not buy again. Sorry.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find a natural sunblock that the whole family can use.  Now, instead of buying several different kinds, for myself and my children, I feel safe to put this product on my young ones.  It protects our skin very well.  We are very fair-skinned, and I used to get sunburned a lot as a child, so I&#x27;m glad I found something safe that works for my children.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly, which makes applying it on kids a lot easier because they don&#x27;t have to wait while you rub a thick lotion in.  I love that it&#x27;s non-greasy.  A lot of sunblocks are very oily, and if you apply it when you&#x27;re at the park or the pool, your hands feel so gross, but with this one, I don&#x27;t have to wash my hands right after applying.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good, too.</li>
            <li> Love the natural and simple ingredients. Can&#x27;t wait to try it in Hawaii!</li>
            <li> Love this product, especially for my little ones!  A little bit goes a long way and it keeps my kiddos skin safe from the sun!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like the fresh, tropical scent of this sunscreen.  It isn&#x27;t too strong, just enough to feel like it is time for a vacation.  Also, it has a very light, almost mousse like consistency, which is a nice change from many natural sunscreens that can be thick and difficult to get out of the container and to apply.  This sunscreen goes on easily and does not have a greasy feel on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a decent chemical free sunscreen for a long time. I used this in Mexico and it worked great. The bottle goes a long way. I am now using the rest for the summer. It goes on well and it protects my skin.</li>
            <li> My 3 young daughters love how this smells! They will find it in my pool bag and bring it to me to put on them when it is pool time! It is easy to apply, but does leave a slight whitish tint as any natural sunscreen will. I will continue to purchase this for myself and daughters!</li>
            <li> Love that it has natural, soothing ingredients.  The only drawback that I found was that it was extremely hard for me to rub it in enough so that I didn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;ghostlike.&amp;#34;  Very nice scent, and I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is tough to beat.  The zinc/titanium formula doesn&#x27;t make you look too white.  This is better than some other zinc creams which makes everyone look like a ghost.  All natural and smells good.  Does not sting the face like other sunscreens.  If you&#x27;re into organic, non chemical mineral based sunscreen, this is it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an all natural sunscreen and finally found it! This sunscreen is great! I love to play with my kids in the pool and I really feel like this sunscreen stayed on and in place while I play and have fun. I love the smell of the product, and a little but goes a long way! I have relatively sensitive skin, and have applied this product to my face without any breakouts. Great news! My only complaint is that with the zinc oxide it leaves my already white skin even whiter. This isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, though! It shows me exactly where I missed applying the sunscreen which is a plus for fair skinned people. Great product! Will surely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I like that the sunscreen is all natural, with many beneficial oils.  It feels nice.  It smells nice.  It is a little thicker than I expected, but all right after it soaks in.  The reason it is not a 4-star rating is that it must be re-applied every 45 to 60 minutes.  I bought this to use as an under-makeup sunscreen expecting full-day protection.  Obviously I am not goint to reapply over my makeup.  In fact, I probably won&#x27;t remember to reapply every 45 minutes on my body when I am working in the yard.  Good product, but this is a major shortcoming in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Really nothing special. I returned it because it was described as rubbing in easily, but it doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s really white &amp; thick, as much or more than other sunscreens. Have to rub for a while if I don&#x27;t wanna look like a clown.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural sunscreen that wasn&#x27;t chalky &amp; that I would actually want to use. So glad I tried this one! Smells great, has a less glaring white glow than other natural blocks, &amp; works great! I still got tan, and only burned in one spot I missed on my back. Adios chemicals!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product. It definitely protects you from the sun -- I haven&#x27;t burned yet. It&#x27;s a little difficult to rub in, and it leaves your skin looking a little whiter than normal. However, it&#x27;s worth it for me to have chemical-free sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and the smell is very subtle and nice. It isn&#x27;t greasy and oily like other all natural brands, it lastes all day and doesn&#x27;t get on my clothes.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I am light completed and and have not burned one time since wearing it for the last week. I work outside 10hrs/day. My skin feels moisturized and I swear my fine lines/ few wrinkles are looking less noticible. It does go on thick and white. I just rub it in really good and problem solved! I do look a little shiny, but I&#x27;m not burning so I could not care less about that! It is all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain nano particles like the rest. Also my skin is super sensitive and I have not had an increase in breakouts because of it. My skin seems to like this sunscreen!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t spread this THICK cream! OMG did I try. My daughter told me stop mom, you&#x27;re hurting me, you&#x27;re rubbing too hard. and still her arm was so white and nothing could make this cream penetrate her skin. Worst money spent. I guess this one is going to the trash! and it;s not cheap!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is great! I used it on my face which is my true test as I really don&#x27;t like sunscreens that leave my face feeling oily or greasy. This sunscreen had a very &#x27;dry&#x27; feeling after application which I am so happy with. Normally I will go home and wash my face after wearing sunscreens as they tend to feel greasy and also cause breakouts. I didn&#x27;t even think about washing my face when I got home! And no breakout occurred, woohoo! A little goes a long way so that is a huge plus! It has a very pleasant, light, non-chemically scent and with all the natural ingredients it has, I don&#x27;t feel like I am putting something toxic on my skin as I do with most sunscreens. I am excited to use this more during the summer months!</li>
            <li> Love, love  this sunscreen! Very happy I found it!</li>
            <li> Bought this product for two weeks of snorkeling in Fiji and found that not only did it do well protecting the reef, but it very much protected my skin. It can be hard to spread when your skin is a little wet, but it was extremely effective. I would definitely recommend for anyone heading to a place concerned with the marine life around them.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so difficult to rub in, but all eco sunscreen is. It did work, we didn&#x27;t get burned. We hope it was worth it to save the fish.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen does not contain potentially harmful nano particles.  As a result it is THICK.  I believe it is a small price to pay.  It spreads heavily and leaves a haze on the skin unless you are very persistent.  All and all I like it... it just requires a bit of work.</li>
            <li> A generous amount of quality sunscreen for the price. I am picky about this kind of product, being a fair child and also prone to oily skin. This doesn&#x27;t feel tacky or greasy - I don&#x27;t get that eww ugh feeling when I put on my clothes after applying. This has high levels of the minerals that physically block the UVA rays...le&#x27;ts be real. I&#x27;m vain and I don&#x27;t want wrinkles. This is non-chemically, high % minerals, not oily sunscreen that does what I need it to. I mix it with a different sunscreen that&#x27;s also good for daytime that blocks UVB and goes on smoothly. I think I have found my perfect daily wear combination for body.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Smells amazing&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t need a lot to get full coverage&lt;br /&gt;-Definitely works - don&#x27;t let the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; SPF 25 fool you&lt;br /&gt;-Great organic safe ingredients&lt;br /&gt;-Used this for my face throughout my weeklong vacation in Mexico, and didn&#x27;t break out at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Takes some time to rub in, especially if your skin is already sweaty/wet.  As a naturally sweaty person, this was even more difficult for me as the day wore on.&lt;br /&gt;-Not sure whether it&#x27;s actually water-resistant?  I&#x27;d come out of the water and the sunscreen would turn into visible-white and slide off my arm in droplets.  And for the aforementioned reason, reapplying is difficult.</li>
            <li> Really liked this sunscreen,especially because I am rest assured that it comes from natural ingredients with no harmful and harsh chemicals. That way, I know it would be absolutely safe for my children. The only reason that I am giving it four stars is because it is a little difficult for me to spread, especially for my children&#x27;s face, when I am in a hurry to get them to school in the morning. That apart, it keeps them away from the harsh sun burns which they use to be subjected to earlier. Would definitely recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is truly an all Mineral Sunscreen with no added chemicals.  So safe, I love that it can be used on Children!!!&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves using it on his hight altitude hikes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a daily sunscreen that isn&#x27;t toxic for quite some time. I know I need to wear it bit I&#x27;ve always been worried about the toxic chemicals in the generic stuff. I was really happy to see Beauty by Earth had made a sun screen. I love their other products. A little goes a long way and it goes on thickly. This is actually a good thing because it means it isn&#x27;t small enough particles to absorb all the way into your skin. You just want it to create a barrier. I skipped my daily moisturizer and just applied this under my make up. It isn&#x27;t watery so you have to rub it all the way in. I love that it doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen. No one needs to walk around smelling like you just went to the pool. I love it and I&#x27;ll be using it daily.</li>
            <li> still looking for a safe sunscreen...this is one of the many I&#x27;ve tried; unfortunately this one is very thick and hard to spread evenly; it also leaves a very noticeable white film on the skin;</li>
            <li> The consistency is too thick, and you actually get sunburn using it, almost like you are not using any sunscreen at all.</li>
            <li> Had to do 3 hours of work in 95 degree LA sun and put this sunscreen on first. Noticed right away it felt different than others in that it wasn&#x27;t watered down and went on smooth. Within minutes I forgot I had it on (unlike other sunscreens that leave you feeling oily and pasty) and was sweating non-stop. End of the day, skin feels great. No sign of sun exposure. The manufacturers of this product got it right. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> too small but product is good. only need a dime size since it has a thick consistency.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any sunscreen in years, but in anticipation of an event where I knew I&#x27;d be exposed for a long period of time, I searched Amazon for something that is all-natural and doesn&#x27;t have all that nasty, chemically stuff in it. I have used this three times now. Since I&#x27;m not used to using sunscreen, it felt weird to put it on. It felt kind of thick, and it shows up white on my skin at first. Once I blend it in, and after a few moments, the whiteness goes away. As for sun protection, I would say this works great. I am pretty fair-skinned, and even being in and out of direct sun all day, I didn&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
            <li> I like the sunscreen but I wish it was fragrance-free. The fragrance lingers too long. It is a challenge to find a sunscreen that has natural organic ingredients and is fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> Wow Wow Wow!!! I have never provided a review on products but I will be doing the sellers of this product a great disservice if I do not express my satisfaction with the product. The Sunscreen worked very well for me and helped me to really mitigate the effect of the Kuwait sun rays on my face. I love the way it feels heavy on the face as it lasts long all day for me. I will buy it again and again. I have even advertised it to many friends, just that they do not appreciate the way it makes the face looking white after application. I wish something could be done to help make it become less visible on the face. It also forms a whitish looking liquid on the face and neck when one sweats; however, these will not make me condemn the product. It is very very effective and safe for my very sensitive facial skin, as I could never use any sunscreen earlier on until I stumbled on this on Amazon site. No regrets. It seems the packaging and the original container has changed design/appearance. I shared one of the tubes with my daughter who is extremely grateful I did. Initially, I had to persuade her to accept my generous offer . Now she cannot do without it, hence my need for buying 3 more tubes. The product is excellent and I will always stick to it. The packaging is very good and delivery was quite fast. Unfortunately, I threw away the  card which  had the code for the 20% discount offered me for a next purchase after the one I purchased last year. So I had to pay the full price for this last purchase.  You guys are doing q good job and I wish you big success in the business. If there are more than 5 stars I would give double.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is all natural, which is very hard to find, including not using any palm oil (which may be natural but is destroying orantugtan habitat).  It smells and feels nice, goes on a bit white but with some rubbing becomes more clear. I used it for a week in Hawaii in and out of the water and got a nice light tan with no burn at all.  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Great product, works great, absorbs nicely and not greasy and amazing customer service!! :)</li>
            <li> I like the way it applies and the fragrance too.  Most of all.....it&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a natural sunblock that isn&#x27;t super gunky/sticky after it&#x27;s been applied. This one has a nice scent, and although it DOES come out white, with some smoothing it does blend in. You are left with a light sheen (i.e., it&#x27;s not totally matte). I&#x27;ve found that just a small bit does the trick. I would recommend putting it on and letting it settle on your skin before applying makeup/powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the seal was slightly offset when I opened the top, so they may want to consider a different type of seal. Also, it would be hard to spread this over a large area, I think. I just use it on my face mostly, but trying to cover your whole self for the beach would be pretty tough and take a lot of blending, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s very important to use a topical, not chemical, sunscreen, especially since I&#x27;m a nursing mom and very conscious about what gets absorbed (or doesn&#x27;t!) into my skin. And this has been the best one I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> Used this on my very sensitive skinned child and it worked well. Smells good and  I would purchase again if i&#x27;d thought about it .</li>
            <li> Wearing sunscreen is so important. Not just in the summer when you are out on the beach, always! But if you are like me, you get iffy about putting chemicals like that on your body every single day. It just seems like you are doing more harm than help right? Well, that is where Beauty By Earth comes in! This natural, water resistant, biodegradable, and reef safe sunscreen is just what I was looking for! It is full of natural oils and extracts! And you know what, it smells AMAZING! It works really well too! I have been using it on my daughters and we have had no burns and no reactions. My youngest has really really sensitive skin, so this surprised me - and made me one happy mommy! I love this stuff, and I bet you will too!</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly in hot Caribbean,</li>
            <li> Overall, I was very pleased with Beauty by Earth&#x27;s Mineral Sunscreen; although I did not get to use it on the hottest day with the most direct sunlight, I could still generally assess most of its features. One of my favorite things about this sunscreen was its lack of &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; smell. I&#x27;m sure many of you know what I mean when I say that most typical grocery store brands have a very distinct and slightly irritating smell which is not pleasant. This sunscreen has a very natural and light scent, almost like something tropical. It does have a very thick consistency which some people may not prefer, but I actually do -- I prefer to know that it is actually blocking the sun. I would take a thick consistency over greasy any day. My suggestion is to apply less so that your skin will fully absorb the sunscreen -- this way you won&#x27;t look much whiter and chalkier after you put it on. The only time that I found it left residue was in places I wasn&#x27;t fully able to reach and just sort of slapped it on. I felt like it really covered every area of my skin accurately, and it did NOT irritate my very sensitive skin. Instead of feeling like the sunscreen was blocking all of my pores and creating an oily and acne-prone appearance, I actually felt like it was moisturizing my skin and improving the texture. My skin felt much softer after using it. Of course, my favorite feature was the lack of unnatural additives! I feel like I am helping both my skin and the environment by making the switch to this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I am using this product on my 2yo daughter. I love it because it protects her well, and doesn&#x27;t make her look &#x27;white&#x27;. This sunscreen is easy to apply, smells good and most importantly made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This product smells nice, and does not have chemicals, however it does leave a white residue. If you are olive to dark skninned you will see a white residue. It is not as heavy as other sunscreens. Unfortunately, I will not be ordering this again because I wanted a sunscree I could use everyday that is not heavy, absorbs quickly, and does not leave a residue. If I was going to the beach I might use this one.</li>
            <li> I really like this product in terms of the protection it provides, its great smell and price and its consistency when applying it on my face. The only downside to it I would say is that it makes you look like you&#x27;re wearing a white mask. I would really like to see a &amp;#34;tinted&amp;#34; version of this product for darker tones. If your skin is very white, you should be okay with it.</li>
            <li> works well and does rub in completely, I run in it and have not had eye problems even though it goes on my forehead and I don&#x27;t wear a hat. will purchase again. do recommend</li>
            <li> Leaves skin white no matter how much rubbing is done.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen has a very pleasant scent, texture and does a good job protecting my skin.</li>
            <li> Horrible! Don&#x27;t waste a dime on it. I ordered it after going through the ingredients and reviews but I am highly disappointed. When I applied it; it felt as of someone has painted my face white. It has gritty texture and doesn&#x27;t apply well. One thing true about this product is that it is definitely water resistant. When I try to wash my face with water it didn&#x27;t come off. I had to use a face wash.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, THE BEST all natural mineral sunscreen I have ever used.  I have had skin cancer three times, but have generally resisted wearing sunscreen daily because I either didn&#x27;t want to use the chemical kinds or because the ones natural ones containing zinc made me look like a walking ghost.  However, I have found that this product, rubbed in well, makes my skin only the slightest degree paler and, surprisingly, also seems have improved my skin.  It works fine under or over the other moisturizers I used it with as well.  I am really delighted to have found an organic, natural, mineral sunscreen I am willing to use daily.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic natural sunscreen! This is the first natural sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried and I was leery because I do tend to burn when I&#x27;m not careful. I spent the weekend at the beach and used only this product and it worked like a charm! It lasted a long time and was fairly easy to apply. Having zinc in it, it took a minute to get used to rubbing it in well but I found that once you rubbed it in you didn&#x27;t appear white like you had zinc on topically. I don&#x27;t have plans to ever go back to store bought sunscreen packed with chemicals.</li>
            <li> As far as healthy sunscreen goes this is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far- at first looks white but then absorbs</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen. It goes on like a cream. And it doesn&#x27;t have the chemical smell like most sunscreens. This will definitely be in my purse for my cruise next month!!</li>
            <li> I was in search  of an all natural sunscreen.  There were a few  that met this requirement on Amazon.  Looking at the reviews this product stood out.  It offered protection using  natural and organic ingredients and did not contain any nano-particles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience  with the sunscreen  was that it aplied easily.  It did look whitish at first but after you rub it for a while the color disappears.  There  is a fragrance  that is gender neutral and seems fitting for a sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall  I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it without  hesitation.</li>
            <li> I live in Los Angeles, am fair skinned, and burn easily. I also break out easily from many products and at the same time I am very conscious about what I put on and in my body. I have tried some natural sunscreens, but have not had the best luck. Even with 50 SPF, I still tend to burn easily. I tried to sunscreen for the first time this past week while out on an all day bike tour on a beautiful sunny day. I only applied it once in the morning and did not burn. I love the smell of the sunscreen, slightly sweet, but not overly scented. I may have put a little bit too much sunscreen on, as I looked a little ghost-like for the first part of the day until it seemed to fully &amp;#34;absorb&amp;#34; and spread more smoothly across my skin. Less is more, just have patience and apply it in advance. It was slightly greasier to the touch than I had hoped, based on some of the other reviews. But no more so than any other sunscreen I currently use. And I could also stem from the fact I probably used too much. As far as appearance, it actually had more of a matte finish than most. Most importantly, at the end of the weekend I was both breakout and sunburn free, so it actually worked!</li>
            <li> This product is great.  It is a thick paste, so you don&#x27;t have to shake it before applying it,&lt;br /&gt;and it goes on smoothly.  Its white color soon disappears so you can&#x27;t tell that you have it&lt;br /&gt;on.  And the best part is you don&#x27;t have to worry about having dangerous chemicals on&lt;br /&gt;your skin.</li>
            <li> Im in love with this product and I mostly use it on my face.It smells great and leaves my skin prepped and ready for the application of my make up. I only apply all natural creams on my face and body so thats why I decided to try this product. It absorbs quickly into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a white layer as so many other all natural sunscreens. I am very happy with it, as well with the costumer service and fast shipment. It has protected my skin very well from the sun and I even use it on my daughter when she plays outside in the sun and we have never been sunburned using this product. I would highly recommend this product and would buy it again when I need a new batch :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used once, don&#x27;t go out that much.  My bottle also was unsealed, but the box was sealed.  So I know this happened during shipment.  Worked the lotion it, the white gradually went away for me.  I limit my time in the sun, so can&#x27;t state on that item.  Smells nice, not sticky or gummy feeling.  I&#x27;ll post more as I use it more.</li>
            <li> I know this has zinc but I was thinking it would blend into the skin more. It really doesn&#x27;t. Unless you are Caucasian, be prorated to look like a pastey white person. I wool now try a product with micronized zinc.</li>
            <li> I used this yesterday for the first time and I love it. I did find that a little goes a long way. It melts into your skin and I love that I am using a product that is free of dangerous chemicals and safe for the whole family to use. I hope this company will be around for a long time and that they add a makeup line. I would definitely be interested in anything that is good for my skin and body.</li>
            <li> Smells good and feels good on my skin</li>
            <li> This sunscreen leaves a very thick sticky white film and is difficult rub it.  I had to throw the bottle away.</li>
            <li> I hate this sunscreen.  I ordered it because it didn&#x27;t have any chemicals but it is so WHITE on your face and takes a while to absorb and even after rubbing it in for a while your skin still looks pale.  The worst part is that you have to reapply every 45-60 minutes and when you are out and have makeup on that is just impossible...  I have since ordered the Self Defense Minerals SPF 30...  It&#x27;s a brush where the liquid comes out into the brush and used as a foundation.  You can keep it as light or heavy as you like.  It covers very well and looks like you have a nice liquid foundation on.  And the best part is that you don&#x27;t have to reapply until 4-5 hours later.  Perfect, I love it!!</li>
            <li> Love the product- super fast shipping, qualitative packaged-smells wonderful and leaves the skin protected, hydrated and glowing. Highly recommend it and will be ordering more!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally buy sunscreen because of all the terrible ingredients that can be worse on my body more than the sun would do to me without sunscreen....but since I came across this sunscreen, I decided to order it based off the ingredients.  When it arrived, I smelled it and I love it&#x27;s scent!  I even love the texture and don&#x27;t mind putting it on me!  I am 100% glad I bought it!  Thanks Beauty Earth for creating something healthy enough to use!</li>
            <li> I got this sunscreen because I do not like to put chemicals on my face and on my skin in general. It arrived on time and well packaged. When I opened the bottle, I noticed that the inner seal was broken so I got worried and contacted the company directly. They replied to me in a very timely and courteous manner and explained that \\&quot;If the seal on the box was intact, it is completely safe to use. The recent heat caused the seal to implode. Most sunscreen manufacturers do not put a seal on for this reason and we will not be going ahead, but it is still completely safe to use. I can assure you that it was not tampered with by a human\\&quot;, so I started using it. Well, it spreads easier than other physical sunscreens; the smell is nice, although a bit intense (I usually prefer fragrance-free on my face, but it&#x27;s just me!!!). It leaves your face a bit white, definitely less than other similar products, but I would really expect this from a physical sunscreen. Overall, I really like this product and feel protected in the sun.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I feel good wearing it knowing that it does not have any harmful chemicals.  It smells lovely and makes my skin feel so soft.  As a cancer survivor, I&#x27;m very concerned about what goes on my skin.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> While on vacation in Florida this past week, we used Beauty Natural Sunscreen and it worked very well. I like that it is a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Not so easy to apply, need to rub the white paste intensively.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen smells so good! I love that it is not only safe for you, but it is also safe for the environment! It rubs in great and I do not look like Casper the Friendly Ghost!</li>
            <li> Nice light smell and works like a charm. I do have skin problems and this did not bother me at all. Some others I can&#x27;t wear but this is one I would definitely recommend to people who do have skin problems and are allergic to certain products. It is all natural and water resistant. Makes for one great product. I did get this at a reduced price for a review but would buy at full price as well.</li>
            <li> Living in Florida I am always looking for the perfect sun screen for my family! My kids are outside almost all day and I need sun protection without the chemicals. I have looked and looked and never really find anything workable without the onslaught of chemicals on their skin. So I have been using this and it works for the whole family. My kids are also picky about what goes on their face, if it smells bad it is all over. This product is delightful and my children have been using it every day.  I am very happy to have found this brand as I have been diligently working on getting chemicals out of my house and this is finally a product I do not have to feel guilty about putting on my children.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this sunscreen. Most sunscreens are full of chemicals that I hate putting on my skin, but everything in this sunscreen is natural and there is nothing bad in it! I couldn&#x27;t be happier especially because I live in Hawaii and we are outside ALL the time!</li>
            <li> I used this product on my vacation to Florida and the Dominican Republic and it works great!  It helped me to not burn at all during these trips. The only thing is that it is not very easy to rub in and it will leave a white residue on your skin at first, but eventually will soak in.</li>
            <li> Effective. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> natural is always good.  this stuff is a little pasty as most zinc based sunscreens are.  i save it for the longer days in direct sun, nose and lips.&lt;br /&gt;i found my new favorite natural day to day 15 sunscreen (every morning at sea) at trader joes, forget the name.</li>
            <li> Not moisturising enough for me. But I got a refund without any problems. Thanks</li>
            <li> This product came at the exact right time. After reading several articles about the crap in a lot of sunscreens, I was looking for something I could use that I could also use for my baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quite thick at first like a nice lotion but rubs in nicely. I put it on my baby one of the days he&#x27;s in daycare and it was great, as he&#x27;s outside a lot. I really LOVE that I know it is safe to put on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 110% satisfied and I&#x27;d love to see more of the population use this product because 1) its natural and you don&#x27;t have to worry 2) IT WORKS 3) smells great 4) it doesn&#x27;t have the other stuff most sunscreens have in it (another way of saying I am so happy I found it as it&#x27;s natural!)</li>
            <li> This stuff 1) smells amazing, and 2) feels good on my skin. Never found a sunscreen that I loved before, and I gotta say, I love this one.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen - it goes on and absorbs and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy but still gives great coverage. Oh and the bonus all natural and still smells delicious.</li>
            <li> this sunscreen is very moisture not  like others product i used before. It won&#x27;t make me feel dry  . I can feel after applying this product my skin can still breath and i am still no burn after the hot sunshine . . It&#x27;s good product for everyday use :)</li>
            <li> Nice, light scent -- not at all a stereotypical &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; smell. I hate thick, greasy sunscreen and this felt nice and lightweight on my face. It will be nice for days I have to spend a lot of time in the sun and don&#x27;t want to reapply thick lotion all day.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It feels good on my skin.  It didn&#x27;t feel sticky or dry - just right.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It is just the right amount of protection.  Anything less is not enough.&lt;br /&gt;3.  It smells really great.  It is not perfumy or stinky.  Very, very pleasant smelling.&lt;br /&gt;4.  The ingredients are natural and I appreciate that.  I don&#x27;t feel as though I&#x27;m rubbing chemicals all over my body.  There are too many chemicals in the environment as it is!&lt;br /&gt;5.  Because of all of the above I feel that I can use this on my kids.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. My dermatologist recommended that I use it .</li>
            <li> Looks like white paint on my skin :)</li>
            <li> I really love that this has such great ingredients. I am huge on organic and natural products. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit too thick and hard to rub in and it leaves my skin very pasty white. For that reason I don&#x27;t see myself using this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Was playing with my son all day out in the Texas sun and neither of us got even a dot of red. I love that it smells good and feels great on my skin and doesn&#x27;t have the greasy residue that sunblock normally has. I would highly recommend for you and your kids!</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen. I have a baby and I like that I don&#x27;t have to worry about this at all with him.  Totally safe for babies. Will never go back to the old stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! It&#x27;s got a very smooth texture and not real greasy like some of them are. I LOVE that it has an all natural coconut smell! And because it&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t have chemicals or artificial fragrances I can just share this with my son and bring 1 lotion for us both! Love it!</li>
            <li> Finally an all natural sunscreen that works great, smells good and rubs in easily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased a couple all natural sunscreens including burt&#x27;s bees that didn&#x27;t rub in AT ALL.  My husband looked like a ghost after having applied it and was horrified I made him my guinea pig on our honeymoon! I had almost given up trying to find an all natural sunscreen.  I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product.  I highly recommend purchasing this product and keeping it in your home.  I hate the chemicals in most sunscreens and this takes all the worry out of what you&#x27;re putting on your skin!</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s the perfect amount of SPF. I&#x27;ve done my research and anything higher just gives a false sense of security for staying out in the sun too long because, while you may not burn your skin, the UVA rays are still damaging your deeper layers of skin.&lt;br /&gt;2) It&#x27;s active ingredients are titanium dioxide and zinc oxide which are safe natural sunscreens, not chemical.&lt;br /&gt;3) It rubs in dry, not greasy at all. And it doesn&#x27;t stay white on your skin - it rubs in clear.&lt;br /&gt;4) The 4 oz bottle is the perfect size. I never end up using a whole bottle of sunscreen each summer and I think after a year it&#x27;s not as effective so I just end up throwing it away.&lt;br /&gt;5) It has a pleasant smell, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing! I&#x27;m super pale and do workouts in the park a few days a week so I always need sunscreen and hate all the chemicals that are normally included. I actually knew what all the ingredients in this sunscreen were and it feels great! Love it.</li>
            <li> I am highly allergic to every sunblock I have tried so far. I need sunblock so I bought this sunblock. It was shipped fast. I put some on the inside of my arm as a test area and after 3 hrs no reaction. I was still nervous when I applied it to my arms face, arms and legs the next day. It smells AMAZING! It rubs in easy. After a full day in sun...no sunburn and better yet.....NO RASH!!! I am a huge fan of this sunblock!</li>
            <li> I love that this product is really Organic.  Just read the ingredients and then read (if you can) the ingredients on others that claim to be Organic or Toxic Free!  This is exactly what I needed.  The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because it is a little, (very little) thick for the face and leaves the white residue slightly.  But that is what you get for not putting toxins on yourself!  Great Customer Service.  They seem to really care about their products and their customers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician so I am pretty picky about my sunscreens...and I love this one! It goes on clear and has great ingredients.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is a little thick, maybe that&#x27;s why it works so well.  It has a nice tropical scent, not too strong.  I like it, I like that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> Previously, I always had a problem using sunscreen, commercial brands made me break out and I stopped using any all together. ENTER Natural Sunscreen by Earth! This is ORGANIC and is the FIRST sunscreen I can put on my Face (I have always had oily skin) and it DIDN&#x27;T break out! Hallelujah! I also put it on my arms (driving arm) so that I don&#x27;t cook while I am driving, and end up with one dark and one white arm. This is wonderful sunscreen, and I am grateful for it! And IT&#x27;S ORGANIC!!</li>
            <li> light weight, non greasy great smelling lotion</li>
            <li> I have been searching for an organic - natural sunscreen and finally found it.  It goes on smooth and smells great too (pleasant but not too strong).  Excellent protection from both UVA and UVB rays. I have sensitive skin and so far no issues. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Five stars for sunscreen. I bought it to wear on my face since I am really, really, really allergic to chemical sunscreens and certain common ingredients. It&#x27;s really not good at all for the face, but it is a great general sunscreen.</li>
            <li> fabulous sunscreen. LOVE that its all organic.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! Not too smelly, not too greasy!  Seems to stay on.  It feels good on your skin, doesn&#x27;t feel like it is clogging it up!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a physical sunscreen and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.  I finally feel at ease knowing I&#x27;m using a product that is free of all the &#x27;bad stuff&#x27; other brands use.  This sunscreen is my &#x27;go to&#x27; from here on out...not greasy and just thick enough to rub in and create a nice barrier.  The slightly white film is barely there after a few minutes.  Scent is natural and pleasing to the senses.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have bought this product.  I usually buy my sun products at the local drug store.  Now that I am over 50 I wanted to purchase something better for my skin.  This sunscreen was a great purchase.  Its thick and a little bit goes a long way.  My husband used it for his scalp and he was happy his head didn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> Finally!!!  A sunscreen that is not full of ingredients or chemicals!  I have tried SO MANY different sunscreens with my kids (they are 4 and 2 years old).  None of them worked for myself or my kids.  I was ready to give up on finding one that was good for us.  This sunscreen did the trick!!  My kids did not have ANY reaction to the sunscreen.  There was no &amp;#34;odd&amp;#34; smell or the &amp;#34;usual&amp;#34; sunscreen smell.  My kids have fun putting it on.  I use it on my face which I have NEVER been able to do as I have very sensitive skin on my face or my eyes will burn.  I didn&#x27;t have any reaction to this product.  I recommend this product to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> wonderful product, smells rubs on smooth and is not tacky or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Really love it!</li>
            <li> Finally, a sin screen that didn&#x27;t give my daughter an allergic reaction.  We have tried numerous types.  This one rocks !</li>
            <li> I have major major issues with your typical suncreens found in most grocery stores...you know, those ones you find with chemicals you can&#x27;t pronounce all over the bottles claiming to offer 70 SPF? My severe sunscreen allergy causes not only an itchy, god-awful rash all over my entire body, but can also cause me to go into Anaphylactic shock if I just happen to inhale some of those nasty sunscreen particles from those fun little spray sunscreens they&#x27;ve been selling (are you catching on to the sarcasm here? Because I hate the person who created those...). The problem is that I have very fair skin and even though I&#x27;ve seemed to build up this tolerance to burning easily unlike my younger self who could look redder than a stop sign within 10 minutes of being out in the Texas summer sun- I still wanted to protect myself from the dangerous UVB and UVA rays so that I could hopefully lesson the risk of getting skin cancer in the future. I didn&#x27;t know what to do...I almost died every time I tried to protect myself with sunscreen and I almost give myself heatstroke going out in long sleeves and long pants and a sun hat...I just had to find another way. That&#x27;s when I came across Beauty by Earth All-Natural Sunscreen. I prayed I wouldn&#x27;t end up in the ER after trying out a small patch of the stuff when it quickly arrived in the mail a few days later. So far so good...I tried a little more- okay, okay...no rash, no itchy throat, no swelling. Hooray! I had finally found my miracle sun protection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works, guys! It seriously is great and it is all-natural and great for those that have an allergy to all the nasty chemical-laden sunscreens on the market. Do yourself a favor and treat your body to some GOOD all-natural reef-safe sunscreen this summer (and all-year &#x27;round, because you know...the sun only sleeps at night, &#x27;yall!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons are that this stuff is pretty thick and it will make you look like a ghost. I already look like a ghost as I&#x27;m pretty pale. Plus, this isn&#x27;t a huge con to me as I find it&#x27;s way more important to me to avoid skin cancer than it is to avoid pasty skin. Think about it- do you want wrinkly leathery skin down the road or do you want semi-white skin that is protected from UVB and UVA rays? I mean really guys... (;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5+ stars from me! I WILL be purchasing again for our cruise in the Fall!retty pale.

            <li> Chalky white and very hard to rub in.  Wanted to return it but Im a few days outside of the 30 day return policy :-(</li>
            <li> Went on a cruise with my infant and used this  for her and myself. I love that it&#x27;s natural and still smells really good. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> This left a chalky residue on my already pale skin. My darker complected husband tried it and left him looking an odd grayish blue color. Purchase with caution if your skin is very fair. (Unless you like looking like a zombie...)</li>
            <li> A little on the heavy side but if u mix this with ur moisturizer it blends well. And it makes my skin look great and my skin is dry, fair, and always irritated. It is the winter so i cant give 5 stars until i know what its actually like in the sun. But overall love the ingredients and is great for problem skin</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it smells wonderful and the natural ingredients does not bother my skin or burn my eyes when i sweat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this sunscreen. I&#x27;ve been through so many different natural and organic sunscreens in hopes if finding something that rubs in a bit better and this one does! I don&#x27;t look like a ghost! It also smells devine, a nice bonus :) Great product!!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen does a very good job but it is very thick. If I would have know that I would have found something to thin it with before going on vacation. But no harm to the fish and coral and no sun burn in Aruba so it is a good product in my book.</li>
            <li> do not be dissuaded with SPF 25 listing as I found this sunscreen to work better than most SPF 50 that are high in chemicals. Beware that it is very chalky and due to zinc oxide does leave whit residue on top of skin but will eventually absorb into skin. I only needed to use 1x in morning and would last most of day in Puerto Rico. Only downside is I noticed after 4 hours my skin would become dry but I still did not burn without applying more.</li>
            <li> Glad to have found a natural sunscreen that works but it&#x27;s so hard to rub in. When I wear this, I can go all day without getting any color or a burn. But it&#x27;s hard to rub in.  My friends tease because I look like a ghost :) another friend of mine uses Blue Lizard with similar results but it rubs in quickly and easily so I will likely try that next time.</li>
            <li> Great product that worked well in Jamaica, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Goes on  GOOEY WHITE with only an SPF 25 rating it is not worthwhile for anyone with a very fair skin</li>
            <li> The sunscreen works but it goes on thick and is very difficult to spread evenly. It is very water resistant several hours later I could still see white residue on my skin even after being in the salt water.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this sunscreen.  I have *very* pale skin, and have been known to get a bad sunburn even during a rainstorm (it&#x27;s true).  This stuff lasted me an entire 6-hour pool party in the middle of July in Texas with only 3 applications (every 2 hours folks!).  That&#x27;s normal to have to reapply, especially when swimming.  But with all other sunscreens, and believe me after decades of trying them I have tried them all, I would still get a burn even when re-applying every 1.5 hours.&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen didn&#x27;t even let me get a slight burn!  I was so happy I literally had tears in my eyes at the end of the day.  Yes, literally, not figuratively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I give 4 stars instead of 3 is my husband hated it.  While he too did not receive even a hint of sunburn, it definitely did not soak up into his skin as easily as it went into mine.  For me, it was like applying any other sunscreen, if a bit thick.  For him, it was difficult to spread it around and had to rub a lot to get it to soak in.  It also left his beard looking snowy white where it had gotten into his hair.</li>
            <li> I just got my sunscreen in the mail. I have only used it once so far, but wanted to give a review on it. Firstly, I bought it because i wanted an all natural sunscreen for myself and my son. This stuff is great because it has no chemicals. It smells really good and I loved that I could just rub it on my sons face with no concerns of what potential chemicals are entering his body. It worked great and my son had no sunburns.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen for my husband who has had allergic reactions to chemical sunscreens.  He used this product for a week in Florida and didn&#x27;t get a sunburn and he had no skin reactions!  The product is very thick, but as long as you don&#x27;t use too much and you rub it in, it will become invisible on your skin.  I wish it weren&#x27;t as thick and a little easier to rub in, but I&#x27;m not sure that is possible with this type of sunscreen.  The smell is also nice, not too strong.  Overall, we were very happy with this product - my husband did not have to worry about it hurting his skin and it worked!</li>
            <li> This is a very good sunscreen its thick and creamy goes on nice, smells good and blocks out the UV rays. It hard to fine a sunscreen with zine oxide like this and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this all natural sunscreen! It has a pretty thick consistency but it absorbs quickly and leaves the skin feeling smooth and smelling wonderful. This is my very first purchase by this company and I will definitely continue buying their natural products that contain no harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the quality of this sunscreen and I also feel at peace knowing it is a safe product to apply everyday for me and my entire family.  It is incredibly water-proof, pleasant smelling, and all natural!  I am thankful for a company that cares about other&#x27; wellbeing.</li>
            <li> I have not used sunscreen for years because of the toxic smell and chemical base. I ordered this for an all-day kayak trip last week. It worked actually better than I thought; maybe even too good LOL There was NO sign of sun on my skin at all!  And it didn&#x27;t leave white smear all over, either. It rubbed in nicely. It was such a mild day I didn&#x27;t sweat much, so I&#x27;m not sure how it holds up under that stress, but it was perfect for me. i will definitely be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Rubs in smoothly and leaves no white residue and smells great. I have super senstive skin but this works great for me.</li>
            <li> Love that it doesn&#x27;t stink. Goes on easy and a little gets a lot of coverage. Protected me all day without burning my face and arms. Will definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on myself and my 5 yr old daughter for our beach trip Friday and was very impressed with how lightweight yet powerful it was.&lt;br /&gt;I try to use natural things whenever I can but sometimes they just don&#x27;t work as well as some of the heavier stuff with chemicals. I&#x27;m pleased to report that this did.&lt;br /&gt;I also used it on my face, which is very sensitive. I normally break out after using any sunscreen on my face. I&#x27;ve tried everything from cheap to high end, but this was fine for my face so far.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I did reapply this every hour as my daughter and I were in the water and direct sun all day at the beach for hours.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is great!....I got a nice even tan color and no burns.</li>
            <li> We went to Hawaii for a week and it worked extremely well. Even after swimming, it protected my fair skin. It&#x27;s very thick and doesn&#x27;t spread easily, so I recommend spreading on your hands first and then applying it to your body. My only concern is that I don&#x27;t think this bottle is actually 150 ml. I only had carry-on luggage so had to transfer this into a 100 ml travel size bottle. It filled the 100 ml bottle and there was hardly anything left in the original bottle (no way there was 1/3 of the contents left). The 100 ml bottle lasted the two of us a full week of daily repeated use though.</li>
            <li> I took this on a recent trip to Hawaii and thought it worked very well.  It smells good, goes and easily and works!  My husband often ended up with white on his face or neck when he started to sweat, but I think he was using too much.  I will keep using it and love that it is all natural!!</li>
            <li> Just used this product and love it.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier. It applies well, stays on well and does the job of sun protection equally as well. Finally a TOTALLY natural product that is effective! I used to get an uncomfortable burning, prickly sensation on top of hands when they were exposed to the rays of the sun -- especially in intense heat.  This afternoon I applied Beauty by Earth Natural Sunscreen and walked out in a Los Angeles heat wave (102 degrees!) and there was no burning sensation on my hands! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Perfect protection very nice and mild product it smells great, thank you seller</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 5 other mineral sunscreens, they all had different consistencies, smells, and some of the non-essential ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Smells awesome&lt;br /&gt;2) Nice consistency, not too liquid, but not too thick to it applies easily&lt;br /&gt;3) Good SPF&lt;br /&gt;4) Water proof. No white lines..&lt;br /&gt;5) Safe to put on&lt;br /&gt;6) No allergic reaction for me - happened to me once with a natural sunscreen..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Same &amp;#34;issue&amp;#34; with the other physical sunscreen brands, bit too dry to put on by itself (I have sensitive skin), especially if you&#x27;re in a hurry. I was advised to put on lotion before applying any sunscreen because it will apply much easier, with less &amp;#34;white-ness&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t turn dry.</li>
            <li> Awesome all-natural/organic sunscreen! I used it while on vacation near Cancun since it is reef-safe and it worked great. Did not state it was waterproof on the packaging but I was really impressed with how well it stayed on in the water. Leaves skin with that white look that natural sunscreen has, just FYI. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> Too pasty! Returned immediately.</li>
            <li> I work out in the sun 10 hours a day and since I am a frequent user of sunscreen I was really looking for something that would make a difference.  Upon first opening the bottle I knew I had ordered the right sunscreen.  Finally one with a great smell and once I tested it, the consistency is excellent.  It does not have that greasy feel or toxic smell that so many drugstore brands or popular unscented brands have.  It does not run at all and after I put it on, I felt like I really had a &#x27;layer&#x27; of protection on my face.    A little goes a long way and and I really noticed a difference as well in how my face felt after using it. With my former drugstore brand of 50 SPF my face would still feel as if it were burning after a few hours in the sun, but I just assumed that was the norm.  After using this sunscreen for several days, I noticed my skin did not feel as hot to the touch nor did it seem to feel as if it was burning.  The addition of zinc and titanium oxide really make a difference. The way they are blended with the other natural ingredients shows that Beauty by Earth is really concerned about making a chemical free sunscreen for its customers. Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen seems work on my face. I have extremely oily face so this product is perfect. I don&#x27;t feel any sunburn at all. I wish it was fragrance-free. One tiny problem is that it takes hours to fade the white color after applying them on your face, but it&#x27;s good overall.</li>
            <li> Such a relief to find a sunscreen that is Not Toxic, with Organic Ingredients AND Works!!!  I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for so long. Super easy to apply, no mess, smells delicious and my kids love it!&lt;br /&gt;A must at home from now on!!&lt;br /&gt;Really really recommend it!</li>
            <li> Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Product looks good.</li>
