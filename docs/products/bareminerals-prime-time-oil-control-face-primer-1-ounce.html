    <ol>
            <li>Best product I&#x27;ve ever used for oil control!</li>
            <li>But the primer is great!</li>
            <li>this product is great!!</li>
            <li>my foundation application is flawless.</li>
            <li>OMG, this is the best primer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>My makeup stays flawless all day</li>
            <li>I have incredibly oily skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really happy with this product.</li>
            <li>It works great to control oil.</li>
            <li>Great product and keeps the acne at bay when I use it under my foundation.</li>
            <li>She says it does a great job of controlling oil.</li>
            <li>; works great and will stick with it.</li>
            <li>This is really great if you have oily areas on your face or you can put all over your face.</li>
            <li>This primer works great.</li>
            <li>this is a great option.</li>
            <li>Still a good product.</li>
            <li>Good purchase.  </li>
            <li>so I thought i&#x27;d try the oil controling thinking it would be just as good</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m truly loving this primer, not one of my employees stop me and ask why are you sweating, since I started using this primer.</li>
            <li>Smoothes into your skin perfectly, and feels SO soft.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure it&#x27;s fulfilled by amazon.</li>
            <li>Even when I don&#x27;t touch it (to prevent it from peeling--this means not being able to apply makeup after the primer)</li>
            <li>I love using this in the summer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in serum form which I love because creams are too greasy for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>I will try a couple more times to see if there is any changes</li>
            <li>I love this product, it always arrives on time, and I never have any issues with damage or leakage....</li>
            <li>I have super oily skin and too many layers of product do not do any favors to my skin (acne)!</li>
            <li>I love the original prime time primer</li>
            <li>I would recommend the original but for sure not the oil controling.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love the original formula, but the oil control does not spread as easily and does not give you the smooth feeling of the original.</li>
            <li>up goes on smooth and keeps my shine prone forehead matte all day.</li>
            <li>Great product and about the same price as walking into a store to buy...</li>
            <li>Very photoshop perfection all day!!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel it works a well as the original primer.</li>
            <li>This primer keeps my face from looking oily for a full 8 hours.</li>
            <li>My skin is fairly oily and using PrimeTime makes it so my makeup doesn&#x27;t totally melt off my face.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell much of a difference between the oil control and the regular primer, but both are a great product.</li>
            <li>The seller was fine, no problems there, but the product leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li>Worth the money and this jewel is now part of my 90 day Amazon auto-ship.</li>
            <li>Always love Bare Minerals!</li>
            <li>I guess it works best with the bare minerals foundation and veil as that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve ever worn, but I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li>It needs a few minutes to dry (set) before applying foundation, but does a very good job in terms of providing a smooth surface for makeup application and the desired adhesion for all-day staying power.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no fragrance at all, and you won&#x27;t need to use very much at all.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a huge value versus buying it directly from BM.  </li>
            <li>and this was the first product I tried to help the problem.</li>
            <li>I didnt need to blot it handled hot newyork train humidity</li>
            <li>I followed directions exactly.  </li>
            <li>A pea sized amount is more than enough to cover your whole face.  </li>
            <li>This goes on light, and helps hold the Bare Minerals foundation and mineral veil well.  </li>
            <li>She says that it goes on easily and last all day.</li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals usually has great products, but this is the exception to the rule.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have really really oily skin</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel much difference.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>It also ran out really fast.</li>
            <li>The instructions say one pump covers the whole face, but it took about 3-4 pumps to really get my face evenly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;n now using a MAC primer which is really silky and moisturising but seems to help reduce oil in the day better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other primers and didn&#x27;t love this one.</li>
            <li>I see a big difference in my face after a nights work when I use this Oil control compared to the original.</li>
            <li>Definitely has good oil control property, but doesn&#x27;t seem to help makeup last as long as the original primer from Bare Escentuals that I tried did.</li>
            <li>I had to order a new one straight from Sephora.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for oily skin</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Yes, keep the skin dry and the makeup in the right place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it about five or six times so far, but I can&#x27;t tell that it is adding anything to my routine.</li>
            <li>Helps my makeup last for the whole day.</li>
            <li>This product is an absolute life-saver when it comes to keeping makeup on and combatting shine - especially in photos.</li>
            <li>For those clients who are sensitive and oily</li>
            <li>The foundation blends as the day goes on, leaving my face looking natural.</li>
            <li>The only thing that has worked for me is the oil absorbing sheets by Proactiv.</li>
            <li>I live bare minerals.</li>
            <li>It seemed to not make much of a difference in how long the color lasted and can get clumpy.</li>
            <li>I notice a marked difference if I don&#x27;t use this under my Bare Minerals makeup as it just doesn&#x27;t cover as well.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a a long way; one pump was more than enough.  </li>
            <li>This was my go to primer for a couple months until I noticed it was drying out my face a little too much and wasnt really doing anything to help oil on my face during a work day where I am constantly moving.</li>
            <li>Ran out of my primer when I was in Nashville, so I decided to stop in bare minerals to get me some lip gloss and decided to grab the prime time oil control primer.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a must-pair if you&#x27;re using Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>I usually wear this over sunscreen/moisturizer and under BB cream and powder foundation and it works really well, giving my face an even tone and texture and reducing the shine of the sunscreen and any oils on a normal day.</li>
            <li>Directions on box clearly say apply a thin layer and less is more.</li>

            <li> If you have a big problem with oil, such as myself, you&#x27;re still probably going to use oil blotting sheets occasionally throughout the day; but if you use this, you&#x27;ll have to do it less often</li>

            <li> My skin use to be oily by the middle of the day, now I have absolutely no oil all day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and I came back to this</li>
            <li> Very strange.</li>
            <li> keeps me dry</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin</li>
            <li> She applies it every day before putting on her other make up.</li>
            <li> This was a pretty useless product for me.</li>
            <li> Unless you have extremely oily skin, I would not buy the oil control it dries out your skin and leaves patches of residue from time to time.</li>
            <li> Having oily skin can be a blessing because you&#x27;re less susceptible to wrinkles</li>
            <li> It is orderless and slightly tinted.  </li>
            <li> Feels wasteful and a little like I got cheated money-wise.</li>
            <li> I had breakouts after using it for a few days, but I am not sure whether it was this primer or if, due to my oily skin, the result of a combination of this primer with my foundation.</li>
            <li> I bought this just because I couldn&#x27;t find the non oil control on here, while it doesn&#x27;t feel as heavy</li>
            <li> It is a bit heavy in consistency</li>
            <li> I wish the bottle wasn&#x27;t so small.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday!  </li>
            <li> It tends to be hard to get out of the bottle toward the end of use.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I have super oily skin and although I still find that I have that sheen (especially if it&#x27;s muggy</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!  </li>
            <li> If you have crazy oil skin like me or lives in places like Miami</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated the oily look</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My skin use to be oily by the middle of the day, now I have absolutely no oil all day!</li>
            <li> I tend to have the T-zone oily areas and this seems to help. I wish the bottle wasn&#x27;t so small. It tends to be hard to get out of the bottle toward the end of use. All of the pump products do. Feels wasteful and a little like I got cheated money-wise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about five or six times so far, but I can&#x27;t tell that it is adding anything to my routine.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and I&#x27;m prone to acne. I&#x27;ve always hated the oily look my make up gets after just an hour of wear. This primer keeps my face from looking oily for a full 8 hours. Best product I&#x27;ve ever used for oil control!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really happy with this product. My skin is fairly oily and using PrimeTime makes it so my makeup doesn&#x27;t totally melt off my face. Helps my makeup last for the whole day.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday!  It works great to control oil. I use it alone or over pore minimizer.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work for me. I don&#x27;t have really really oily skin but it still it oily. And I thought this would help but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Great product and keeps the acne at bay when I use it under my foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other primers and didn&#x27;t love this one. It seemed to not make much of a difference in how long the color lasted and can get clumpy.</li>
            <li> I bought this just because I couldn&#x27;t find the non oil control on here, while it doesn&#x27;t feel as heavy I don&#x27;t feel it works a well as the original primer.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product. She says that it goes on easily and last all day. She applies it every day before putting on her other make up. She says it does a great job of controlling oil.</li>
            <li> Having oily skin can be a blessing because you&#x27;re less susceptible to wrinkles but it&#x27;s also a pain. This product is an absolute life-saver when it comes to keeping makeup on and combatting shine - especially in photos. I&#x27;ve struggled for years to absorb the oiliness that my face produces especially by the end of the day. I can put on this product, with or without makeup, and my face stays matte for hours. I&#x27;ve never had that! My makeup actually stays on instead of sloughing off after about four hours. I guess it works best with the bare minerals foundation and veil as that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve ever worn, but I&#x27;m not sure. Worth the money and this jewel is now part of my 90 day Amazon auto-ship. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Definitely has good oil control property, but doesn&#x27;t seem to help makeup last as long as the original primer from Bare Escentuals that I tried did. Still a good product. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel much difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and I came back to this; works great and will stick with it. Highly recommended for oily skin</li>
            <li> For some reason this order was not the regular prime time face primer that I get from Sephora.  It was the same brand, same look but was does not cover my face the way the one from my sephora account does.  Very strange. I had to order a new one straight from Sephora.</li>
            <li> There is a cheaper (smaller) size of this primer out there.  I think it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; item, so take advantage of that if you&#x27;re not ready to splurge on this bigger size.  But the primer is great! Smoothes into your skin perfectly, and feels SO soft.  There&#x27;s no fragrance at all, and you won&#x27;t need to use very much at all.  A pea sized amount is more than enough to cover your whole face.  They have several different kinds, but I like the oil-control one because it keeps my t-zone from getting too shiny underneath my make-up.  And this bottle will last for MONTHS on end, so it&#x27;s a huge value versus buying it directly from BM.  Just make sure it&#x27;s fulfilled by amazon.</li>
            <li> Good purchase.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I see a big difference in my face after a nights work when I use this Oil control compared to the original. I have very oily skin. I won&#x27;t ever change this brand.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!  I love the original prime time primer so I thought i&#x27;d try the oil controling thinking it would be just as good but it turned my makeup flaky as I was putting it on then I had to use a towel to wipe it all off.  It looked so gross, not wearable.  I would recommend the original but for sure not the oil controling.</li>
            <li> This was a pretty useless product for me. I felt like there was no difference on the days I wore it versus the days I did not wear it.</li>
            <li> Works well for mineral and powder foundations. Combining it with liquid or cream foundations seemed to produce extra oil. It is orderless and slightly tinted.  A little goes a a long way; one pump was more than enough.  It is a bit heavy in consistency so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for us oily girls (even for those of us who use minerals or powders).  It needs a few minutes to dry (set) before applying foundation, but does a very good job in terms of providing a smooth surface for makeup application and the desired adhesion for all-day staying power.  I had breakouts after using it for a few days, but I am not sure whether it was this primer or if, due to my oily skin, the result of a combination of this primer with my foundation.</li>
            <li> I have super oily skin and too many layers of product do not do any favors to my skin (acne)! Helps if using this and one cover!</li>
            <li> I have incredibly oily skin and this was the first product I tried to help the problem. Bare Escentuals usually has great products, but this is the exception to the rule. It literally peels off as if you&#x27;ve put school glue on your face. Even when I don&#x27;t touch it (to prevent it from peeling--this means not being able to apply makeup after the primer) it didn&#x27;t control any oil. Terrible product.</li>
            <li> Always love Bare Minerals! This goes on light, and helps hold the Bare Minerals foundation and mineral veil well.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> For those clients who are sensitive and oily this product is great!! I love using this in the summer keeps me dry n my foundation application is flawless. Very photoshop perfection all day!!! I didnt need to blot it handled hot newyork train humidity well</li>
            <li> Directions on box clearly say apply a thin layer and less is more. You will only need one pump. It&#x27;s in serum form which I love because creams are too greasy for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make up goes on smooth and keeps my shine prone forehead matte all day. Seriously. This works for me....</li>
            <li> My skin gets so oily...especially in the summer time! Been using this for about a week now and I love it! Great product and about the same price as walking into a store to buy...but I ordered it from my home! Would do business with this seller again!</li>
            <li> This is really great if you have oily areas on your face or you can put all over your face. Then apply your foundation and you will not see any shine all day long. It keeps your skin tone looking even looking all day LNG.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t control the oil like I thought it would. Maybe my skin is just too oily. I will try a couple more times to see if there is any changes</li>
            <li> The seller was fine, no problems there, but the product leaves much to be desired. I love the original formula, but the oil control does not spread as easily and does not give you the smooth feeling of the original. Unless you have extremely oily skin, I would not buy the oil control it dries out your skin and leaves patches of residue from time to time.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it always arrives on time, and I never have any issues with damage or leakage....one thing I wish is that they had a larger size to choose from.</li>
            <li> I live bare minerals. This primer works great. The foundation blends as the day goes on, leaving my face looking natural. I can&#x27;t tell much of a difference between the oil control and the regular primer, but both are a great product.</li>
            <li> I usually wear this over sunscreen/moisturizer and under BB cream and powder foundation and it works really well, giving my face an even tone and texture and reducing the shine of the sunscreen and any oils on a normal day. This was my go to primer for a couple months until I noticed it was drying out my face a little too much and wasnt really doing anything to help oil on my face during a work day where I am constantly moving. It also ran out really fast. The instructions say one pump covers the whole face, but it took about 3-4 pumps to really get my face evenly. I&#x27;n now using a MAC primer which is really silky and moisturising but seems to help reduce oil in the day better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would still recommend to anyone looking for oil control in a primer!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and this primer did nothing for that.  I followed directions exactly.  About 2 hours after I applied the primer and my foundation, my skin was oily and shiny again.  The only thing that has worked for me is the oil absorbing sheets by Proactiv.</li>
            <li> Yes, keep the skin dry and the makeup in the right place. I like bareminerals products. If you have crazy oil skin like me or lives in places like Miami this is a great option.</li>
            <li> OMG, this is the best primer I have ever used. Ran out of my primer when I was in Nashville, so I decided to stop in bare minerals to get me some lip gloss and decided to grab the prime time oil control primer. The next day I applied the primer, did my makeup and I would have to say I went almost 8 hours without the shiny nose, shiny forehead or the shiny chin. This is day six and I&#x27;m truly loving this primer, not one of my employees stop me and ask why are you sweating, since I started using this primer. My makeup stays flawless all day and I do not have to touch-up every hour.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything for me. It didn&#x27;t help with oil control, priming, or keeping my make up last for long periods of time. I would not recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I have super oily skin and although I still find that I have that sheen (especially if it&#x27;s muggy or I&#x27;ve been sweating), I would recommend this product as a great base.  I notice a marked difference if I don&#x27;t use this under my Bare Minerals makeup as it just doesn&#x27;t cover as well.  If you have a big problem with oil, such as myself, you&#x27;re still probably going to use oil blotting sheets occasionally throughout the day; but if you use this, you&#x27;ll have to do it less often and it&#x27;s a must-pair if you&#x27;re using Bare Minerals.</li>
