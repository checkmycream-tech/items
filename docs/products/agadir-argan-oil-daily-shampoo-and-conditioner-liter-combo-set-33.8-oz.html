            <li>one is much better.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I will gladly purchase this product again.</li>
            <li>My hair is in recovery after many bleachings, dyings, etc.</li>
            <li>What more can I say.</li>
            <li>While I still absolutely love the shampoo and the smell, I have noticed that it has started to make my hair oily.</li>
            <li>It felt like hay, and had many splint ends.  </li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>The oil on your hair is like a cherry on top of the ice cream as the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This duo arrived safely with everything in tact.  </li>
            <li>Keeps your hair healthy</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I was an Ojon client for many years but since they have change their line so that the new shampoo does not have the pleasant smell I liked, so I did not want to use that any more as I am used to lots of complements because of the smell...</li>
            <li>The smell is very clean and refreshing and it doesn&#x27;t over power you with a &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this shampoo and conditioner, after hearing about all the benefits of argan oil.</li>
            <li>Great full curly hair has just the right amount of oil does not leave hair greasy just shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li>So between the wonderful scent and the fact that it has lasted SO long, It&#x27;s my favorite.  </li>
            <li>The lather of the shampoo is so rich it engulfs every strand with gentleness!</li>
            <li>If you have dry or treated hair, this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for my dry hair.</li>
            <li>This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used for dry hair.</li>
            <li>Many shampoos and conditioners have strong smells to them.</li>
            <li>And  love love the free gift .</li>
            <li>I ordered Agadir Argan Oil Daily Shampoo + Conditioner \\&quot;Liter Combo Set\\&quot; 33.8 oz w/5 free oil tubes and want to let you know that I am very happy!</li>
            <li>My hair also seems softer and shinier which is a huge plus of course :)</li>
            <li>My hair is softer to the touch, and my roots feel conditioned and easier to comb thru to end, great detangling action.</li>
            <li>I love this product and everyone says my hair feels so smooth.</li>
            <li>for those who have natural curls great for curls , leaves curls with bounce</li>
            <li>I love that it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li>My hair is easy to comb out when I get out of the shower, you can comb through it during the day tangle free, plus it looks and feels healthy.  </li>
            <li>I love the shampoo, it is so rich and creamy.</li>
            <li>Easy to sit in the shower and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair clean and looking healthy.</li>
            <li>It is NOT drying at all - as is often the case with many shampoos I&#x27;ve used - and leaves my hair feeling both clean and supple even immediately after rinsing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of sulfate free shampoos/conditioners and this one is now at the top of my list.</li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t make your hair stronger and as it does not have strong chemicals</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product, based upon the good reviews.  </li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, soft, manageable and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>However, I think it still does a pretty nice job conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li>Most are fruity or floral or sweet.</li>
            <li>Makes my crappy, naturally curly and frizzy hair more soft and manageable and smells freakin&#x27; awesome.</li>
            <li>The fact that it comes with 5 oil packs is also super!</li>
            <li>Arrived quick!</li>
            <li>Lovely scent, quick shipping, well packaged.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very interested in repurchasing!</li>
            <li>I always use the Agadir hair oil afterwards which makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is a huge help for my hair.</li>
            <li>It make my hair feel smooth, silky, and virtually frizz free.</li>
            <li>Uglynbeauty packed it so well that there was no spilling and everything was secure.</li>
            <li>The conditioner worked fabulously when used with a plastic cap and under the dryer for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>and it looks fabulous.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth, silky and no frizz.</li>
            <li>My hair is silky smooth</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shampoo:  works into a truly luxurious lather, which I definitely enjoy.</li>
            <li>But I did not get the free oil like it said I would.</li>
            <li>, if you are in a hurry you can forget the conditioner a couple times a week, and still be tangle free with shiny hair.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner did nothing to smooth my hair.  </li>
            <li>the shampoo and conditioner leave my hair smooth and silky</li>
            <li>leaves your hair smooth and non frizzy.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Your hair will be smooth.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it thoroughly.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth.</li>
            <li>So I am kinda using them for free</li>
            <li>And this is a fantastic price.  </li>
            <li>Great product and will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li>It will take a good clarifying shampoo to get this stuff completely out of my hair.</li>
            <li>Smells so good, and leaves your hair amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>I love this product, my hair feels so silky after I use it and it has been great when I&#x27;ve wanted to grow my hair out for prolonging rough feeling ends, which stretches the time between trims.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is just as good, but not as thick; which is great.  </li>
            <li>It has done my hair a world of good as far as texture, manageability, and color maintenance.</li>
            <li>After one use of it, my hair felt so soft, and I love playing with my own hair now.  </li>
            <li>So i was excited to try the conditioner and expected more great product.  </li>
            <li>It gives you very fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>They come in HUGE bottles, so it&#x27;s really worth the money!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel so clean and light.</li>
            <li>I love it very much.</li>
            <li>First time using the shampoo &amp; love it.</li>
            <li>So yes, some of the contents had leaked out inside the plastic the product was originally sent in.</li>
            <li>I seriously can&#x27;t get over how much i love this shampoo and conditioner...or the amazing smell!!</li>
            <li>It not only conditions but also leaves a nice shine on my hair and makes them more manageable.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling (or smelling) clean.  </li>
            <li>and it feels really clean after I use this product but hydrated.</li>
            <li>Great for dry hair.</li>
            <li>I am not saying that this is related, but as a 59 year old man, who still has a lot of his hair, I am happy!  </li>
            <li>Use their entire product line with great success.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many shampoos and conditioners over the years but this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>so I need to use special shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo suds nicely and Makes my hair feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li>But what I love about this particular shampoo is the scent!  </li>
            <li>Not only can this product be used daily, but the smell is amazing (great for both men and women).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it daily and there is no build up, drying out of my hair and it smells sooooo good.</li>
            <li>It has really helped moisturize my hair and scalp, and I LOVE the smell.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s  very resistant to most products.</li>
            <li>The item smells good and works with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping too!</li>
            <li>I feel like it&#x27;s more gentle on my hair.  </li>
            <li>she says, hair is more brilliant and  the hairstylist asked what did she  did because her hair was completly different  than last time</li>
            <li>The spray says speeds drying time by 50% and that is really true.</li>
            <li>You literally see results immediately after a good wash and 30 minute deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sulfate free, makes the hair feel soft, smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>It is very manageable and healthy,  </li>
            <li>WE HAVE ALL SEEN TRUE CHANGES IN OUR HAIR TEXTURE.</li>
            <li>It leaves you hair nice and soft BEFORE conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair is usually dry and this seems the best shampoo for it so far.</li>
            <li>it smells amazing, and for the most part doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin</li>
            <li>Hair feels clean, product has a fresh clean scent.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair super hydrated and beautifully conditioned, but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>Using very small amounts and it works great!!</li>
            <li>Other than that, this was a great buy for the cost and</li>
            <li>I think this shampoo is great for dry brittle hair, but after awhile it starts to make it greasy, so I wanted to recommend that after you&#x27;ve used this shampoo for awhile you  may want to alternate between this shampoo and another kind.</li>
            <li>my favorite shampoo just got better with the larger size and pump.</li>
            <li>However, I received my order ( really quickly thank God) and decided against the chemicals.</li>
            <li>It arrived at my door so quickly, I was shocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product and what it did for my healthy hair and also later on for my bleached ravaged hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a high quality product and my stylist commented about how healthy my hair was after I started using it.</li>
            <li>We live in a dry climate &amp; this shampoo is very good.</li>
            <li>If someone has extremely dry brittle hair this may be a good product to keep it from breaking</li>
            <li>To be able to maintain long hair that looks healthy, I need products that are nourishing and can help prevent breakage.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s good for dry hair .</li>
            <li>Most def recommend to anyone with wild unruly hair like mine!</li>
            <li>Exactly the products I needed!</li>
            <li>I definitely see now why people love this product set!</li>
            <li>I sent it back and sure if I order anything from your company I will have to do a lot of research since you didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner, and not to mention the bonus oil packets (which don&#x27;t make your hair greasy, but instead, soft and silky!)</li>
            <li>and my hair just keeps getting better, super shiny and soft and no</li>
            <li>The little hair treatments that are included in the package smell very good, which I use more than the actual shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>And the sulfate free shampoo gelp keep hair color vibrant!</li>
            <li>Love how it leaves my hair, best I&#x27;ve found, and these prices are half what I paid at other stores.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair smooth, shiny and moisturizes very well</li>
            <li>Its very runny and light weight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but otherwise it is really good and would recommend it to anyone who wants some moisture or deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Love how soft my hair is after using and went three days</li>
            <li>This shampoo  and conditioner is worth</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>When I came across this set, I was extremely happy since it&#x27;s DOUBLE the size of my old one, but also affordable.  </li>
            <li>But the morning after just leaves you with a lovely, soft scent on close contact.</li>
            <li>and this is the sulfate free set my stylist most recommends to help the treatment last.  </li>
            <li>i highly reccommend this - even my hairdresser had a positive comment on how healthy my hair is looking.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews, which we very positive and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased other Argan Oil shampoos but none smell as good as this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The non-sulfate formula does not mean no suds, the shampoo lathes fine.</li>
            <li>Awesome smell, leaves my hair very supple, soft, shiny, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>The Argan oil adds just the right amount of shine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s meant to wash right out.</li>
            <li>:) I think I am good for 1 year as 2 bottles of shampoo would last very long for my hair length.</li>
            <li>The shampoo really makes my hair feel really clean</li>
            <li>It was a little bit pricey at the salon, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>At the same time, however, I noticed that my scalp was getting oily much more quickly than usual.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Shampoo and Conditioner have such strong fragrance, a cheap smelling kind, which I have not encountered for a long time.</li>
            <li>I generally use a top line Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, which is what I set out to do when I ran across Agadir products.  </li>
            <li>The bottle was still full and the loss was very minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But when rinsed and dried, there is no extra bulk, and my hair is soft, silky, and have great movement, bounce and exceptional shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, even though I have a bunch of product left (the bottles are pretty large), I&#x27;m going to stop using them and start showering at Equinox more often!</li>
            <li>My hair is low porosity and very fine</li>
            <li>this particular shampoo and conditioner combo did anything special for my curly hair nor did it keep color any longer.</li>
            <li>It has worked wonders on my dry hair and makes it feel so soft and smell AMAZING!</li>
            <li>The price of this product in the liter combo is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>This product has a spicy, herbal scent very much like something I would expect from a product like this.</li>
            <li>It is very much like Moroccanoil but</li>
            <li>great shampoo for my hard to manage hair.</li>
            <li>I had to double check to make sure I didn&#x27;t accidentally grab the cond.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE the big size and nozzle to dispense the shampoo or conditioner.</li>
            <li>When all three are used in combination it turns my unmanageable tresses  into silky, pretty waves.</li>
            <li>Love this product, but packaging left a lot to be desired.  </li>
            <li>Made it soft and shiney and smells fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Been using these daily for over a month and really love the products.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling soft and oiled (lightly).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t say anything the first time thinking</li>
            <li>but it really does smell like the Jean Desprez perfume!  </li>
            <li>I initially purchased the oil at a salon for $35, when that was out I ordered more from Amazon and thought I would try the shampoo and conditioner as well.  </li>
            <li>The scent is lovely but not overpowering and lasts for several days between washings.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Compared to what I would pay buying this at the local drugstore, I save more than 50%!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the fast shipping was a bonus!</li>
            <li>I got it yesterday and used it for the first time this morning.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product and have been using it exclusively for the last year.  </li>
            <li>I have super fine hair and this is the only product that works for that!  </li>
            <li>It leave your hair very silky and shiny!</li>
            <li>I love the argan-oil smell of both (they&#x27;re different, but similar), and I love the feel of the lather.  </li>
            <li>The scent, the lather, how clean and lightweight it makes my long fine hair feel.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best natural shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve used that actually keeps your hair in good shape while still being affordable to someone who doesn&#x27;t believe in spending ridiculous amounts on personal products.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is light but packed with so much goodness for your hair, it completely gets the job done!</li>
            <li>will purchase again, love the extra large size and gerat pricing..</li>
            <li>It smells absolutely AMAZING and makes my hair softer than any other shampoo i&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>I previously wrote about the other products in this line and shampoo/conditioner is awesome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a male, who doesn&#x27;t know much about these products, but I did love the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Now about the product, I wish I could be as positive about it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>Was tired of paying a fortune for this set in the salon&#x27;s, found it here and have been very pleased, quick delivery!</li>
            <li>It dry my scalp even more.</li>
            <li>My Mom is very particular on hair products.</li>
            <li>My&lt;br /&gt;Hair is dry and damaged and after washing and conditioning with these products my hair feels healthy and moisturized.</li>
            <li>My hair is more than 50% gray and was always dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>which I&#x27;m certain you are), you may want to skip out on this.</li>
            <li>and I also bought the Agadir Argan Oil Volumizing Styling and Sculpting Gel Xtreme Hold and a bottle of the pure Argan oil for my skin.  </li>
            <li>And, indeed, my hair does not feel anymore manageable or tangle-free after using a large dollop of this conditioner on it.  </li>
            <li>It made my frizzy, dry hair feel very sumptuous and healthy again.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t like this shampoo or conditioner</li>
            <li>but I would have appreciated receiving what I ordered.</li>
            <li>I think this works really well for me, and I will order it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the product.  </li>
            <li>it is just exceptional....not much else can be said........</li>
            <li>This really helps my hair after highlights.</li>
            <li>And, this item if you consider the quality, is really affordable.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner makes my hair so shiny, although it doesn&#x27;t seem to thicken as much as I would like.</li>
            <li>The argan oil treats the dryness very well.</li>
            <li>I have really, really curly hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>the price.my hair is so soft, shiny, manageable and brings out the color of my hair beautifully.its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair really shiny</li>
            <li>but this brand is very drying</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Agadir product line!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit strong while I&#x27;m using it, then it becomes more subtle when it dries, but it smells really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The packaging is always secure enough that I never have to worry about the product leaking out or getting damaged in shipping.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner really works.</li>
            <li>Give it a week of use to really see the difference.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li>and it still was too much for me.</li>
            <li>My hair is much softer and shinier after using this.</li>
            <li>My hair shines &amp; is much easier to manage after using this product.</li>
            <li>I no longer have to run a straight iron through it every day.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is so creamy and cleans my hair gently.  </li>
            <li>Really oily</li>
            <li>REAL argan oil.</li>
            <li>I have very think,</li>
            <li>Also I have been using agadir for over a year and the conditioner really has no scent like it&#x27;s suppose to...</li>
            <li>Highly!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even have to use much, I&#x27;ve had it for a month</li>
            <li>They did refund me for the whole package though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pricey at the salon.  </li>
            <li>We really like this set.  </li>
            <li>Due to the large size and the fact that I co-wash more</li>
            <li>I was concerned sulfate free shampoo would not clean, my hair as well, but my hair is clean and shines when using the shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>feeling good after first usage, i just hope it is natural and does not dry my hair like some of the other products ive used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair was very frizzy and dry, but after using this its silky, soft, and I LOVE the smell..</li>
            <li>I am completely platinum (or grey to most)</li>
            <li>when I say that although my hair is healthy, if I let it dry naturally, it doesn&#x27;t look shiny or touchable.</li>
            <li>I have very long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>This is huge, especially when you are talking about a 17 year old girl!  </li>
            <li>problem i had is that the top was loose when it arrived along with the other free shipping items..</li>
            <li>Love that it makes my hair silky without feeling weighed down.</li>
            <li>you have a new fan!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair much more manageable and less flyaway.</li>
            <li>I finally got this package after checking every possible way to get the most for my money.</li>
            <li>I was so worried that the product would smell that strong in my hair too, but once the wet cardboard packaging was removed, the scent disappated.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried about finding the right fit for them but</li>
            <li>This line made my hair very soft, very manageable and it minimized the frizz.</li>
            <li>I generally use the very expensive Morrocan Oil, and this is certainly just as good, or better.  </li>
            <li>This is a high quality product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend for all types of hair......</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I researched a lot before buying this and can&#x27;t understand the reviews being high for this.....</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND these products.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>(over the years I have tried all the so called high end products).  </li>
            <li>But you should be warned this product is highly scented.</li>
            <li>I highly rcommend this shampoo and condition.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I will give it a little more time</li>
            <li>This makes my hair so amazingly soft!!</li>
            <li>My last treatment was four months ago and other than the new growth, the keratin treatment is still effective.</li>
            <li>I went to a new stylist who uses Agadir &amp; my hair has steadily improved.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt more moisturized after I washed it until it dried.</li>
            <li>camping and hair wasn&#x27;t greasy like it normally would after two days.</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like my late mother&#x27;s favorite perfume, Bal A Versailles.  </li>
            <li>They rejuvenate curly locks and allow the true springy, long curls to evolve from frizz.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews on things I purchase, but I felt the need to do so with this.</li>
            <li>I use this product and purchase if from Walgreens normally so some of the reviews concerned me</li>
            <li>Get beyond your normal concept of how shampoo and conditioner normally is and expand your horizons to a new idea on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product left my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>The scent from the leak was strong enough to fill the entire bathroom and hall.</li>
            <li>Couple of months ago I went to a new salon and got my hair done.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new Shampoo and Conditioner permanently.</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t feel exceptionally soft afterward, just soft, but after two days the real benefit if the shampoo became apparant.</li>
            <li>I love the smell but this is on the heavy side as far as moisture goes.  </li>
            <li>When I received my order from this particular seller I was pleasantly surprised that the bottles already had pumps on them.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and so soft that I seriously cannot stop touching it!</li>
            <li>then you know this scent, very old fashioned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brand in the past and love it.  </li>
            <li>Conditioner was not the same quality first order received.</li>
            <li>wow, what a difference!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used hair products that actually make a difference.  </li>
            <li>is the first time I upgraded to the big bottles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although not unpleasant at first after you&#x27;ve been subjected to it for a few hours</li>
            <li>Your hair smells fresh all day long!  </li>
            <li>I was hooked, my barbed wire hair was suddenly silky smooth (all day long).</li>
            <li>My true test is when my daughter, who has a disease called RSD/CRPS started losing her hair due to her disease and steroid medication.  </li>
            <li>and it was packaged securely and the  tops were on tight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a long time and the shampoo is not the original: thinner, whiter and smells completely different.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair short and natural without chemical straighteners and find this product both gentle and healing for my hair which can be dry/ brittle in the winter.</li>
            <li>It comes as a set, wrapped in plastic, with a label that clearly states &amp;#34;This is a set.</li>
            <li>hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy and my hair feels really soft since using this product.</li>
            <li>- Works as promised for shiny, soft hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Local Kroger has them for way too much price.</li>
            <li>my hair and my hair is soft looking and manageable and the color lasts longer than ever.  </li>
            <li>Hair feels soft after washing.  </li>
            <li>I have natural, virgin hair</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair soft and sleek.</li>
            <li>This keeps my hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>leaves hair soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>so I am not crying over losing them.  </li>
            <li>coarse hair and this product just strips the moisture from my strands and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t moisturize much.</li>
            <li>I got this product on the strength of the reviews, and so far it has not lived up to the hype.</li>
            <li>recently joined Equinox and started using the Kiehl&#x27;s shampoo/conditioner products, and that&#x27;s when I really sensed the difference.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried the Argan Oil products until now, pleasantly surprised with how well these work.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft, silky, and shiny.  </li>
            <li>This combo leaves even my completely natural African American clients&#x27; hair super soft, silky and shiny when flat ironed!</li>
            <li>Even the container is flimsly plastic, where bottles in the past were more solid arrived with sealed caps.</li>
            <li>this makes me wonder if the company cares less for the item if it is done through super shipping...</li>
            <li>I have very curly dry hair and this product along with the oil make my hair soft and shiny and keeps the frizz away.  </li>
            <li>Will for sure continue to buy especially if it means using the flat iron a lot less.</li>
            <li>I purchased the large bottles so will use until gone but will not repurchase this brand and will opt for the more expensive Morrocan Oil.</li>
            <li>and I have very silky hair that doesn&#x27;t usually dry out.</li>
            <li>I actually find the shampoo and conditioner to be very drying (the opposite of what you would assume with the Argan Oil)&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>I want to address many of the negative comments I read for anyone who might be out there who might do the same thing</li>
            <li>I stopped at the local drugstore and noticed they did carry the product but much smaller bottles at a much higher cost (individually).</li>
            <li>My first purchase left my hair dry after washing.</li>
            <li>One of the combos arrived in good condition, but the other had been dropped or crushed in shipping, the bottom of the conditioner bottle had split and leaked all over, creating quite a mess and wasting about a third of the product.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey but well worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could barely run a brush through my hair and it looked frizzy and</li>
            <li>It dried relatively scent free, which was a big plus.</li>
            <li>When I received  the shipment, one of the individual tubes of oil had leaked completely out.</li>
            <li>hair is left soft and shiny</li>
            <li>I do know that nothing makes my hair feel like Agadir Argan oil and my hair feels soft and luxurious with the bigger bottles as well.</li>
            <li>Before I purchase something I tend to read the negative reviews first, especially when there a quite a few, then work my way up to the top reviews.</li>
            <li>only minor critique I have is that the shampoo spilled slightly due to the top coming loose, and there no being a hygienic seal to prevent leaking.</li>
            <li>The reason why I order was because of one of the reviews, it said that I really helps with dry scalp, when it did the opposite.</li>
            <li>I think that if you have straight hair, it will really weigh it down but for my dry curly hair &#x3D; perfection.</li>
            <li>So, after years of torturing my hair with other products, I finally found that Argan oil really makes my hair so shiny and touchably soft.</li>
            <li>I also have an itchy scalp when I use normal shampoo and conditioners or my hair gets dry and frizzy to the point of insanity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do wish it was packaged a little better as each time a little has came out of the cap into the bag they place them in, but no biggie.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping with the shampoo, it will stay very soft for a long time to come.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fourth complaint and the one that held me back most: &amp;#34;This is not the real thing&amp;#34; - I don&#x27;t know where these people purchased their product previously, but this is the very same one I get and have been using for quite some</li>
            <li>The confitioner is light and subtly fragrant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Afterwards, my hair has never felt so soft in my entire life (I use a lot of different product; my brother is a hair stylist)!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older and my hair was starting to get very dry (like horse hair).  </li>
            <li>think for the majority of people who are looking for a great conditioning product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li>; The shampoo is thick but the conditioner is watery&amp;#34; - this is true.</li>
            <li>Yes, Kiehl&#x27;s is more expensive, but my hair feels nice and fluffy for at least 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner is so rich you will use less than any other!  </li>
            <li>my hair was frizzy and dry, and using this for a week made my hair soft and managable</li>
            <li>I may use other shampoos, as my stylist says a little variety is healthiest for hair, and I wash my hair every other day, but this raglan shampoo is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I put a bit of the oil in while it was still wet, blow dried my hair&amp; then straightened my hair, using a little more of the oil</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Let me start by saying I love Agadir Argan shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am not quite sure.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> This could probably be a better product for people with thinner hair.</li>
            <li> I love agadir shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner combination.  </li>
            <li> It is also a wonderful daily shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> one is much better.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I will gladly purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> My hair is in recovery after many bleachings, dyings, etc.</li>
            <li> What more can I say.</li>
            <li> While I still absolutely love the shampoo and the smell, I have noticed that it has started to make my hair oily.</li>
            <li> It felt like hay, and had many splint ends.  </li>
            <li> and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> The oil on your hair is like a cherry on top of the ice cream as the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This duo arrived safely with everything in tact.  </li>
            <li> Keeps your hair healthy</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I was an Ojon client for many years but since they have change their line so that the new shampoo does not have the pleasant smell I liked, so I did not want to use that any more as I am used to lots of complements because of the smell...</li>
            <li> The smell is very clean and refreshing and it doesn&#x27;t over power you with a &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this shampoo and conditioner, after hearing about all the benefits of argan oil.</li>
            <li> Great full curly hair has just the right amount of oil does not leave hair greasy just shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li> So between the wonderful scent and the fact that it has lasted SO long, It&#x27;s my favorite.  </li>
            <li> The lather of the shampoo is so rich it engulfs every strand with gentleness!</li>
            <li> If you have dry or treated hair, this is perfect.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used for dry hair.</li>
            <li> Many shampoos and conditioners have strong smells to them.</li>
            <li> And  love love the free gift .</li>
            <li> I ordered Agadir Argan Oil Daily Shampoo + Conditioner \\&quot;Liter Combo Set\\&quot; 33.8 oz w/5 free oil tubes and want to let you know that I am very happy!</li>
            <li> My hair also seems softer and shinier which is a huge plus of course :)</li>
            <li> My hair is softer to the touch, and my roots feel conditioned and easier to comb thru to end, great detangling action.</li>
            <li> I love this product and everyone says my hair feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> for those who have natural curls great for curls , leaves curls with bounce</li>
            <li> I love that it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li> My hair is easy to comb out when I get out of the shower, you can comb through it during the day tangle free, plus it looks and feels healthy.  </li>
            <li> I love the shampoo, it is so rich and creamy.</li>
            <li> Easy to sit in the shower and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair clean and looking healthy.</li>
            <li> It is NOT drying at all - as is often the case with many shampoos I&#x27;ve used - and leaves my hair feeling both clean and supple even immediately after rinsing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of sulfate free shampoos/conditioners and this one is now at the top of my list.</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t make your hair stronger and as it does not have strong chemicals</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, based upon the good reviews.  </li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, soft, manageable and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> However, I think it still does a pretty nice job conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li> Most are fruity or floral or sweet.</li>
            <li> Makes my crappy, naturally curly and frizzy hair more soft and manageable and smells freakin&#x27; awesome.</li>
            <li> The fact that it comes with 5 oil packs is also super!</li>
            <li> Arrived quick!</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, quick shipping, well packaged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very interested in repurchasing!</li>
            <li> I always use the Agadir hair oil afterwards which makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a huge help for my hair.</li>
            <li> It make my hair feel smooth, silky, and virtually frizz free.</li>
            <li> Uglynbeauty packed it so well that there was no spilling and everything was secure.</li>
            <li> The conditioner worked fabulously when used with a plastic cap and under the dryer for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> and it looks fabulous.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth, silky and no frizz.</li>
            <li> My hair is silky smooth</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shampoo:  works into a truly luxurious lather, which I definitely enjoy.</li>
            <li> But I did not get the free oil like it said I would.</li>
            <li> , if you are in a hurry you can forget the conditioner a couple times a week, and still be tangle free with shiny hair.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner did nothing to smooth my hair.  </li>
            <li> the shampoo and conditioner leave my hair smooth and silky</li>
            <li> leaves your hair smooth and non frizzy.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Your hair will be smooth.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it thoroughly.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth.</li>
            <li> So I am kinda using them for free</li>
            <li> And this is a fantastic price.  </li>
            <li> Great product and will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> It will take a good clarifying shampoo to get this stuff completely out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Smells so good, and leaves your hair amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> I love this product, my hair feels so silky after I use it and it has been great when I&#x27;ve wanted to grow my hair out for prolonging rough feeling ends, which stretches the time between trims.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is just as good, but not as thick; which is great.  </li>
            <li> It has done my hair a world of good as far as texture, manageability, and color maintenance.</li>
            <li> After one use of it, my hair felt so soft, and I love playing with my own hair now.  </li>
            <li> So i was excited to try the conditioner and expected more great product.  </li>
            <li> It gives you very fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> They come in HUGE bottles, so it&#x27;s really worth the money!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so clean and light.</li>
            <li> I love it very much.</li>
            <li> First time using the shampoo &amp; love it.</li>
            <li> So yes, some of the contents had leaked out inside the plastic the product was originally sent in.</li>
            <li> I seriously can&#x27;t get over how much i love this shampoo and conditioner...or the amazing smell!!</li>
            <li> It not only conditions but also leaves a nice shine on my hair and makes them more manageable.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling (or smelling) clean.  </li>
            <li> and it feels really clean after I use this product but hydrated.</li>
            <li> Great for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I am not saying that this is related, but as a 59 year old man, who still has a lot of his hair, I am happy!  </li>
            <li> Use their entire product line with great success.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many shampoos and conditioners over the years but this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> so I need to use special shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo suds nicely and Makes my hair feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li> But what I love about this particular shampoo is the scent!  </li>
            <li> Not only can this product be used daily, but the smell is amazing (great for both men and women).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it daily and there is no build up, drying out of my hair and it smells sooooo good.</li>
            <li> It has really helped moisturize my hair and scalp, and I LOVE the smell.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s  very resistant to most products.</li>
            <li> The item smells good and works with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping too!</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s more gentle on my hair.  </li>
            <li> she says, hair is more brilliant and  the hairstylist asked what did she  did because her hair was completly different  than last time</li>
            <li> The spray says speeds drying time by 50% and that is really true.</li>
            <li> You literally see results immediately after a good wash and 30 minute deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sulfate free, makes the hair feel soft, smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> It is very manageable and healthy,  </li>
            <li> WE HAVE ALL SEEN TRUE CHANGES IN OUR HAIR TEXTURE.</li>
            <li> It leaves you hair nice and soft BEFORE conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is usually dry and this seems the best shampoo for it so far.</li>
            <li> it smells amazing, and for the most part doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin</li>
            <li> Hair feels clean, product has a fresh clean scent.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair super hydrated and beautifully conditioned, but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> Using very small amounts and it works great!!</li>
            <li> Other than that, this was a great buy for the cost and</li>
            <li> I think this shampoo is great for dry brittle hair, but after awhile it starts to make it greasy, so I wanted to recommend that after you&#x27;ve used this shampoo for awhile you  may want to alternate between this shampoo and another kind.</li>
            <li> my favorite shampoo just got better with the larger size and pump.</li>
            <li> However, I received my order ( really quickly thank God) and decided against the chemicals.</li>
            <li> It arrived at my door so quickly, I was shocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product and what it did for my healthy hair and also later on for my bleached ravaged hair.  </li>
            <li> This is a high quality product and my stylist commented about how healthy my hair was after I started using it.</li>
            <li> We live in a dry climate &amp; this shampoo is very good.</li>
            <li> If someone has extremely dry brittle hair this may be a good product to keep it from breaking</li>
            <li> To be able to maintain long hair that looks healthy, I need products that are nourishing and can help prevent breakage.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s good for dry hair .</li>
            <li> Most def recommend to anyone with wild unruly hair like mine!</li>
            <li> Exactly the products I needed!</li>
            <li> I definitely see now why people love this product set!</li>
            <li> I sent it back and sure if I order anything from your company I will have to do a lot of research since you didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner, and not to mention the bonus oil packets (which don&#x27;t make your hair greasy, but instead, soft and silky!)</li>
            <li> and my hair just keeps getting better, super shiny and soft and no</li>
            <li> The little hair treatments that are included in the package smell very good, which I use more than the actual shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> And the sulfate free shampoo gelp keep hair color vibrant!</li>
            <li> Love how it leaves my hair, best I&#x27;ve found, and these prices are half what I paid at other stores.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair smooth, shiny and moisturizes very well</li>
            <li> Its very runny and light weight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but otherwise it is really good and would recommend it to anyone who wants some moisture or deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Love how soft my hair is after using and went three days</li>
            <li> This shampoo  and conditioner is worth</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> When I came across this set, I was extremely happy since it&#x27;s DOUBLE the size of my old one, but also affordable.  </li>
            <li> But the morning after just leaves you with a lovely, soft scent on close contact.</li>
            <li> and this is the sulfate free set my stylist most recommends to help the treatment last.  </li>
            <li> i highly reccommend this - even my hairdresser had a positive comment on how healthy my hair is looking.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, which we very positive and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other Argan Oil shampoos but none smell as good as this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The non-sulfate formula does not mean no suds, the shampoo lathes fine.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell, leaves my hair very supple, soft, shiny, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> The Argan oil adds just the right amount of shine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s meant to wash right out.</li>
            <li> :) I think I am good for 1 year as 2 bottles of shampoo would last very long for my hair length.</li>
            <li> The shampoo really makes my hair feel really clean</li>
            <li> It was a little bit pricey at the salon, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> At the same time, however, I noticed that my scalp was getting oily much more quickly than usual.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Shampoo and Conditioner have such strong fragrance, a cheap smelling kind, which I have not encountered for a long time.</li>
            <li> I generally use a top line Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, which is what I set out to do when I ran across Agadir products.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was still full and the loss was very minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But when rinsed and dried, there is no extra bulk, and my hair is soft, silky, and have great movement, bounce and exceptional shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, even though I have a bunch of product left (the bottles are pretty large), I&#x27;m going to stop using them and start showering at Equinox more often!</li>
            <li> My hair is low porosity and very fine</li>
            <li> this particular shampoo and conditioner combo did anything special for my curly hair nor did it keep color any longer.</li>
            <li> It has worked wonders on my dry hair and makes it feel so soft and smell AMAZING!</li>
            <li> The price of this product in the liter combo is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> This product has a spicy, herbal scent very much like something I would expect from a product like this.</li>
            <li> It is very much like Moroccanoil but</li>
            <li> great shampoo for my hard to manage hair.</li>
            <li> I had to double check to make sure I didn&#x27;t accidentally grab the cond.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE the big size and nozzle to dispense the shampoo or conditioner.</li>
            <li> When all three are used in combination it turns my unmanageable tresses  into silky, pretty waves.</li>
            <li> Love this product, but packaging left a lot to be desired.  </li>
            <li> Made it soft and shiney and smells fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Been using these daily for over a month and really love the products.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling soft and oiled (lightly).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t say anything the first time thinking</li>
            <li> but it really does smell like the Jean Desprez perfume!  </li>
            <li> I initially purchased the oil at a salon for $35, when that was out I ordered more from Amazon and thought I would try the shampoo and conditioner as well.  </li>
            <li> The scent is lovely but not overpowering and lasts for several days between washings.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to what I would pay buying this at the local drugstore, I save more than 50%!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the fast shipping was a bonus!</li>
            <li> I got it yesterday and used it for the first time this morning.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product and have been using it exclusively for the last year.  </li>
            <li> I have super fine hair and this is the only product that works for that!  </li>
            <li> It leave your hair very silky and shiny!</li>
            <li> I love the argan-oil smell of both (they&#x27;re different, but similar), and I love the feel of the lather.  </li>
            <li> The scent, the lather, how clean and lightweight it makes my long fine hair feel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best natural shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve used that actually keeps your hair in good shape while still being affordable to someone who doesn&#x27;t believe in spending ridiculous amounts on personal products.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is light but packed with so much goodness for your hair, it completely gets the job done!</li>
            <li> will purchase again, love the extra large size and gerat pricing..</li>
            <li> It smells absolutely AMAZING and makes my hair softer than any other shampoo i&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I previously wrote about the other products in this line and shampoo/conditioner is awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male, who doesn&#x27;t know much about these products, but I did love the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now about the product, I wish I could be as positive about it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Was tired of paying a fortune for this set in the salon&#x27;s, found it here and have been very pleased, quick delivery!</li>
            <li> It dry my scalp even more.</li>
            <li> My Mom is very particular on hair products.</li>
            <li> My&lt;br /&gt;Hair is dry and damaged and after washing and conditioning with these products my hair feels healthy and moisturized.</li>
            <li> My hair is more than 50% gray and was always dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> which I&#x27;m certain you are), you may want to skip out on this.</li>
            <li> and I also bought the Agadir Argan Oil Volumizing Styling and Sculpting Gel Xtreme Hold and a bottle of the pure Argan oil for my skin.  </li>
            <li> And, indeed, my hair does not feel anymore manageable or tangle-free after using a large dollop of this conditioner on it.  </li>
            <li> It made my frizzy, dry hair feel very sumptuous and healthy again.</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t like this shampoo or conditioner</li>
            <li> but I would have appreciated receiving what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I think this works really well for me, and I will order it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the product.  </li>
            <li> it is just exceptional....not much else can be said........</li>
            <li> This really helps my hair after highlights.</li>
            <li> And, this item if you consider the quality, is really affordable.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner makes my hair so shiny, although it doesn&#x27;t seem to thicken as much as I would like.</li>
            <li> The argan oil treats the dryness very well.</li>
            <li> I have really, really curly hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> the price.my hair is so soft, shiny, manageable and brings out the color of my hair beautifully.its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair really shiny</li>
            <li> but this brand is very drying</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Agadir product line!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit strong while I&#x27;m using it, then it becomes more subtle when it dries, but it smells really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The packaging is always secure enough that I never have to worry about the product leaking out or getting damaged in shipping.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner really works.</li>
            <li> Give it a week of use to really see the difference.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li> and it still was too much for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is much softer and shinier after using this.</li>
            <li> My hair shines &amp; is much easier to manage after using this product.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to run a straight iron through it every day.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is so creamy and cleans my hair gently.  </li>
            <li> Really oily</li>
            <li> REAL argan oil.</li>
            <li> I have very think,</li>
            <li> Also I have been using agadir for over a year and the conditioner really has no scent like it&#x27;s suppose to...</li>
            <li> Highly!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even have to use much, I&#x27;ve had it for a month</li>
            <li> They did refund me for the whole package though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pricey at the salon.  </li>
            <li> We really like this set.  </li>
            <li> Due to the large size and the fact that I co-wash more</li>
            <li> I was concerned sulfate free shampoo would not clean, my hair as well, but my hair is clean and shines when using the shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> feeling good after first usage, i just hope it is natural and does not dry my hair like some of the other products ive used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was very frizzy and dry, but after using this its silky, soft, and I LOVE the smell..</li>
            <li> I am completely platinum (or grey to most)</li>
            <li> when I say that although my hair is healthy, if I let it dry naturally, it doesn&#x27;t look shiny or touchable.</li>
            <li> I have very long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is huge, especially when you are talking about a 17 year old girl!  </li>
            <li> problem i had is that the top was loose when it arrived along with the other free shipping items..</li>
            <li> Love that it makes my hair silky without feeling weighed down.</li>
            <li> you have a new fan!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair much more manageable and less flyaway.</li>
            <li> I finally got this package after checking every possible way to get the most for my money.</li>
            <li> I was so worried that the product would smell that strong in my hair too, but once the wet cardboard packaging was removed, the scent disappated.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about finding the right fit for them but</li>
            <li> This line made my hair very soft, very manageable and it minimized the frizz.</li>
            <li> I generally use the very expensive Morrocan Oil, and this is certainly just as good, or better.  </li>
            <li> This is a high quality product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend for all types of hair......</li>
            <li> I Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I researched a lot before buying this and can&#x27;t understand the reviews being high for this.....</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND these products.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> (over the years I have tried all the so called high end products).  </li>
            <li> But you should be warned this product is highly scented.</li>
            <li> I highly rcommend this shampoo and condition.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I will give it a little more time</li>
            <li> This makes my hair so amazingly soft!!</li>
            <li> My last treatment was four months ago and other than the new growth, the keratin treatment is still effective.</li>
            <li> I went to a new stylist who uses Agadir &amp; my hair has steadily improved.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt more moisturized after I washed it until it dried.</li>
            <li> camping and hair wasn&#x27;t greasy like it normally would after two days.</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like my late mother&#x27;s favorite perfume, Bal A Versailles.  </li>
            <li> They rejuvenate curly locks and allow the true springy, long curls to evolve from frizz.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews on things I purchase, but I felt the need to do so with this.</li>
            <li> I use this product and purchase if from Walgreens normally so some of the reviews concerned me</li>
            <li> Get beyond your normal concept of how shampoo and conditioner normally is and expand your horizons to a new idea on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product left my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> The scent from the leak was strong enough to fill the entire bathroom and hall.</li>
            <li> Couple of months ago I went to a new salon and got my hair done.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new Shampoo and Conditioner permanently.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t feel exceptionally soft afterward, just soft, but after two days the real benefit if the shampoo became apparant.</li>
            <li> I love the smell but this is on the heavy side as far as moisture goes.  </li>
            <li> When I received my order from this particular seller I was pleasantly surprised that the bottles already had pumps on them.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and so soft that I seriously cannot stop touching it!</li>
            <li> then you know this scent, very old fashioned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand in the past and love it.  </li>
            <li> Conditioner was not the same quality first order received.</li>
            <li> wow, what a difference!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used hair products that actually make a difference.  </li>
            <li> is the first time I upgraded to the big bottles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although not unpleasant at first after you&#x27;ve been subjected to it for a few hours</li>
            <li> Your hair smells fresh all day long!  </li>
            <li> I was hooked, my barbed wire hair was suddenly silky smooth (all day long).</li>
            <li> My true test is when my daughter, who has a disease called RSD/CRPS started losing her hair due to her disease and steroid medication.  </li>
            <li> and it was packaged securely and the  tops were on tight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a long time and the shampoo is not the original: thinner, whiter and smells completely different.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair short and natural without chemical straighteners and find this product both gentle and healing for my hair which can be dry/ brittle in the winter.</li>
            <li> It comes as a set, wrapped in plastic, with a label that clearly states &amp;#34;This is a set.</li>
            <li> hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy and my hair feels really soft since using this product.</li>
            <li> - Works as promised for shiny, soft hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Local Kroger has them for way too much price.</li>
            <li> my hair and my hair is soft looking and manageable and the color lasts longer than ever.  </li>
            <li> Hair feels soft after washing.  </li>
            <li> I have natural, virgin hair</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft and sleek.</li>
            <li> This keeps my hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> leaves hair soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> so I am not crying over losing them.  </li>
            <li> coarse hair and this product just strips the moisture from my strands and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t moisturize much.</li>
            <li> I got this product on the strength of the reviews, and so far it has not lived up to the hype.</li>
            <li> recently joined Equinox and started using the Kiehl&#x27;s shampoo/conditioner products, and that&#x27;s when I really sensed the difference.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried the Argan Oil products until now, pleasantly surprised with how well these work.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft, silky, and shiny.  </li>
            <li> This combo leaves even my completely natural African American clients&#x27; hair super soft, silky and shiny when flat ironed!</li>
            <li> Even the container is flimsly plastic, where bottles in the past were more solid arrived with sealed caps.</li>
            <li> this makes me wonder if the company cares less for the item if it is done through super shipping...</li>
            <li> I have very curly dry hair and this product along with the oil make my hair soft and shiny and keeps the frizz away.  </li>
            <li> Will for sure continue to buy especially if it means using the flat iron a lot less.</li>
            <li> I purchased the large bottles so will use until gone but will not repurchase this brand and will opt for the more expensive Morrocan Oil.</li>
            <li> and I have very silky hair that doesn&#x27;t usually dry out.</li>
            <li> I actually find the shampoo and conditioner to be very drying (the opposite of what you would assume with the Argan Oil)&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I want to address many of the negative comments I read for anyone who might be out there who might do the same thing</li>
            <li> I stopped at the local drugstore and noticed they did carry the product but much smaller bottles at a much higher cost (individually).</li>
            <li> My first purchase left my hair dry after washing.</li>
            <li> One of the combos arrived in good condition, but the other had been dropped or crushed in shipping, the bottom of the conditioner bottle had split and leaked all over, creating quite a mess and wasting about a third of the product.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey but well worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could barely run a brush through my hair and it looked frizzy and</li>
            <li> It dried relatively scent free, which was a big plus.</li>
            <li> When I received  the shipment, one of the individual tubes of oil had leaked completely out.</li>
            <li> hair is left soft and shiny</li>
            <li> I do know that nothing makes my hair feel like Agadir Argan oil and my hair feels soft and luxurious with the bigger bottles as well.</li>
            <li> Before I purchase something I tend to read the negative reviews first, especially when there a quite a few, then work my way up to the top reviews.</li>
            <li> only minor critique I have is that the shampoo spilled slightly due to the top coming loose, and there no being a hygienic seal to prevent leaking.</li>
            <li> The reason why I order was because of one of the reviews, it said that I really helps with dry scalp, when it did the opposite.</li>
            <li> I think that if you have straight hair, it will really weigh it down but for my dry curly hair &#x3D; perfection.</li>
            <li> So, after years of torturing my hair with other products, I finally found that Argan oil really makes my hair so shiny and touchably soft.</li>
            <li> I also have an itchy scalp when I use normal shampoo and conditioners or my hair gets dry and frizzy to the point of insanity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do wish it was packaged a little better as each time a little has came out of the cap into the bag they place them in, but no biggie.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping with the shampoo, it will stay very soft for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fourth complaint and the one that held me back most: &amp;#34;This is not the real thing&amp;#34; - I don&#x27;t know where these people purchased their product previously, but this is the very same one I get and have been using for quite some</li>
            <li> The confitioner is light and subtly fragrant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Afterwards, my hair has never felt so soft in my entire life (I use a lot of different product; my brother is a hair stylist)!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older and my hair was starting to get very dry (like horse hair).  </li>
            <li> think for the majority of people who are looking for a great conditioning product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> ; The shampoo is thick but the conditioner is watery&amp;#34; - this is true.</li>
            <li> Yes, Kiehl&#x27;s is more expensive, but my hair feels nice and fluffy for at least 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is so rich you will use less than any other!  </li>
            <li> my hair was frizzy and dry, and using this for a week made my hair soft and managable</li>
            <li> I may use other shampoos, as my stylist says a little variety is healthiest for hair, and I wash my hair every other day, but this raglan shampoo is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I put a bit of the oil in while it was still wet, blow dried my hair&amp; then straightened my hair, using a little more of the oil</li>
            <li> I live in CO which is very dry, and I have naturally dry, wavy, unruly hair.</li>
            <li> really helps tame the hair.</li>
            <li> Keeping my hair from getting dried out and controlling frizzies is a constant battle, especially as I get older.</li>
            <li> and I have only used about half of the shampoo, and a little more than half of the conditioner, so it lasts a long time for the price.</li>
            <li> The conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair and these big bottles last a while.</li>
            <li> MADE it coarse and very dry textured; had to go back to a more expensive shampoo for my color treated hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much softer, it&#x27;s unbelievable.</li>
            <li> and flat iron it, and swim and stay out in the sun riding my horse, and forget my hat.</li>
            <li> I also use the bottled oil while styling with the dryer, flat iron, etc.</li>
            <li> When I use the oil to flat my hair, the products works.</li>
            <li> I have long blonde hair &amp; it was getting brittle from coloring.</li>
            <li> why: it&#x27;s too heavy for my fairly normal but color processed hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried mixing it with other brands and it just weighs my hair down too much.  </li>
            <li> It weighs hair down and looks like a Greasy Hot Mess....</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that has also turned a little grey lately.  </li>
            <li> Not a major concern in my opinion.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed because this got very good reviews.</li>
            <li> I was having dry scalp problems with my last set of shampoo and conditioner so after reading the reviews of the Agadir Argan, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I am a white girl with dry course hair.</li>
            <li> Agadir products have brought life back into my dry unruly hair.</li>
            <li> I swim daily and this product keeps my hair from being dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> The box which was left outside my door got wet.</li>
            <li> Super shiny, healthier looking and the frizziness is noticeably tamed down without having the heavy oily residue of some other frizz taming products</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner were a complete mess in the plastic packaging it was sent in...</li>
            <li> it was getting very dry and fragile, and started to resemble the straw that i use for bedding the horse stalls!</li>
            <li> Both products are hard to rinse out (using way too much water)</li>
            <li> I find this product very help full for me hair, but was a bit disappointed that the pump is not screwed properly.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s is not sulfate free and it&#x27;s way to expensive.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was when I received the product the shampoo wasn&#x27;t closed all the way</li>
            <li> I have long salt and pepper hair and struggled to find a product that can take care of my gray hair issues.  </li>
            <li> The set arrived well packaged, which aided in containing a minor leak from one of the bottles.</li>
            <li> Gives shiny, soft, manageable hair without being heavy or oily feeling, extends my color longer and no frizzies.</li>
            <li> Having searched long and thoroughly I heartily recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Totally not what I expected after using of shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Will always order this used it for years now on my hair and it took me this long to find what works for my texture and this is it</li>
            <li> smaller bottle shampoo has a pink opalescent sheen to it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It is similar to shrink wrap so not much room for moving things around.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I would much rather have a small amount of product spill out in transitthan have them open my package, ensure the lid is on tight, then send it to me open and loose.</li>
            <li> I also use a little on my dry hair to moisturize and it feels so silky soft.</li>
            <li> I am a black female with mixed, long, curly hair that can get a bit frizzy sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dry hair, curly hair, long hair will benefit from using these products.  </li>
            <li> I only use the conditioner about every other washing</li>
            <li> I was purchasing it from another site that was more expensive!</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing it from here as long as I can!</li>
            <li> I chose this product due to the lower pricing as compared with the Morrocan Oil (blue bottles) brand.</li>
            <li> and I was having a moment of weakness due to the stress of trying to manage coarse, dry hair.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel dry</li>
            <li> My hair feels dry and like straw when I used this product.  </li>
            <li> I colored my hair and using this shampoo/conditioner and moisturing mask keeps my hair abd scalp from feeling dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> It was really dry.</li>
            <li> , I just let it dry out after I shower</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like frizzy, dry looking hair.....</li>
            <li> Well I have wavy hair that is heathy but dry.</li>
            <li> If you have severly dry hair then this might work for you.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair</li>
            <li> Both me &amp; my wife use this, and it leaves our hair feeling dry and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> But it did nothing to nourish my dry ends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have short course thick naturally curly/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Going from black to purple then to removing the purple, my hair was pretty fried and dull.  </li>
            <li> I am in my mid 20&#x27;s  and highlight my hair, which is very long (almost down to the bottom of my rib cage).</li>
            <li> The product was wrapped in a plastic bag-like material and was loose in the box.  </li>
            <li> BECAUSE ONE OF THE CAPS CAME LOOSE</li>
            <li> I like the product but each time they were delivered the tops were loose and the product has leaked.</li>
            <li> With this Agadir Argan Oil product, my hair felt like it was beginning to get weighted down 12 hours later.  </li>
            <li> the dry itchy scalp- GONE!</li>
            <li> I am a user of the Marrakesh Shampoo and Conditioner, and this product works as similar for less money.  </li>
            <li> The pricing on Amazon is about half what you&#x27;ll pay in the salon, so I regularly reorder online.</li>
            <li> yet I only need two sqirts of the shampoo and three of the conditioner, so I save money over my previous choice of products.  </li>
            <li> the same!&lt;br /&gt;So, maybe the differences noted are because it is from a different &amp;#34;batch&amp;#34;, or maybe the bigger stuff is diluted by small percent.</li>
            <li> Works.&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry hair and that lead to frizz</li>
            <li> The shampoo came open, waisting 10% of product and the packaging was a mess, i wish i can show the pics of it</li>
            <li> I wa using other shAmpoos before that were super expensive and after awhile.those stopped working for me.</li>
            <li> looks like I&#x27;ll be running out sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Only thing, if used everyday, made my head itch.</li>
            <li> It can be expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Agadir Argan Oil Hair products was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> She started cleaning out the brush once a day, then every few days, and now she only has to do it once a week!  </li>
            <li> If not removed properly your hair will be heavy.</li>
            <li> Again, it&#x27;s possible that I got a knockoff of the Agadir, but in any case, what a waste of money and they don&#x27;t allow returns.</li>
            <li> Made my hair easier to comb through when wet.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and thick after using it.</li>
            <li> The shampoo on the other hand has a loose cap so the contents of both shampoo and conditioner spilled inside the plastic packaging.</li>
            <li> I have long black hair, and I often change the color of my hair (highlighting).</li>
            <li> I have dry hair using this product has calmed my hair down</li>
            <li> I only shampoo my very dry hair every other day, and it usually gets static-y on day two, but using this shampoo</li>
            <li> My hair, which I foil, became so less frizzy and dry.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have coarse dry hair and thick too.</li>
            <li> I am in agreement with other raters.</li>
            <li> So not a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> The shampoo gets sudsy but not as much as other shampoos that have sulfates.  </li>
            <li> You only use a small amount</li>
            <li> , I thought I could just use it once or twice a week, like every other conditioner/shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I just wasn&#x27;t seeing what all the other reviews were ranting and raving about.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a dope for my other favor argan oil set since that one is always out of stock on costco.com.  </li>
            <li> But conditioner on the other hand, it&#x27;s so watery that the shampoo is thicker than the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I had some leftover from other bottle, I poured both in my hand to compare the color, consistency and scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazon appears to have the cheapest price although I was surprised at how expensive this product line is but a little bit goes a long way so it will last me quite awhile.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned that being oil based that it would be heavy and weigh my hair down, but after a solid week of daily use my hair is not in the least greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo that I could use everyday and wouldn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> My thick hair is usually drier than a popcorn fart after years of dying it blonde and daily straightening.</li>
            <li> This product does not have to have a thick conditioner because it gives your hair so much moisture in both steps that a thick conditioner would cause it to be weighed down - in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The odor is unpleasant and the products left my fine thin hair heavy and flat.</li>
            <li> and it was a tad difficult working it through my hair (straight, blond, medium length, with highlights.)</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, thick curly hair and this stuff</li>
            <li> Her hair is unprocessed, long and thick.  </li>
            <li> L;IKE WAS THEY SHOULD TAPE DOWN THE CAPS</li>
            <li> It moisterizes without weighing your hair down.</li>
            <li> manageable.does not weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> It lathers slightly when washing, which I thought didn&#x27;t happen with sulfate-free shampoo?</li>
            <li> My items arrived damaged and half of both bottles emptied out.  </li>
            <li> This works as well, in my estimation as the Paul Mitchell Moisturizing shampoo I was using, and at half the price.</li>
            <li> The oil treatment (In the little packets) makes my hair dry in half the usual time and it makes it shine with no greasy feeling -</li>
            <li> you have very dry hair, this product is for you!!!</li>
            <li> AND THERE WAS A MESS.</li>
            <li> And I have long thick colored hair.</li>
            <li> But, I found that this method would leave my hair dry, brittle, hard, and tangled.</li>
            <li> but this Shampoo can keep my hair away from looking dry and dull.</li>
            <li> Some product was wasted and was a mess onced removed from the box.</li>
            <li> is a little background on my hair type, since these products are probably not suited for everyone.</li>
            <li> A little goes along way.</li>
            <li> I stopped using the little packets of oil</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get all those little flyaways</li>
            <li> So there is little waste.</li>
            <li> Havent really noticed anything too crazy for the amount.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package, one of the bottle which is the conditioner is missing the cap.</li>
            <li> I always had trouble finding something that works for me</li>
            <li> I was also tired of dandruff and using a second shampoo for that problem.</li>
            <li> no matter how you do it your hair will be so heavy and and unclean feeling</li>
            <li> This has transformed my hair in just a few days.</li>
            <li> Disliked what it did to my hair though.</li>
            <li> I wasted My money</li>
            <li> Because I dye my hair every few months, my ends suffer.</li>
            <li> I bought this after using Moraccanoil for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair everyday.  </li>
            <li> smells like tropical heaven but not cheap tropical, also not overpowering.</li>
            <li> My hair looks moisturized and shine since I used it few months ago.  </li>
            <li> but it just made it look oily and limp.</li>
            <li> After my hair dresser used this shampoo and conditioner on me after a cut a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> My hair is heavily processed and thinner.  </li>
            <li> This product is too heavy for both of us.  </li>
            <li> It has dried my hair and my neighbor&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I used it for a few weeks before getting a haircut.  </li>
            <li> it was messy.</li>
            <li> Too Heavy .</li>
            <li> Agadir wasn&#x27;t as expensive, two 33 oz bottles cost about the same as the two 8 oz of the other brand.</li>
            <li> What a mess not to mention the wasted shampoo!</li>
            <li> shiny is not easy.  </li>
            <li> I had bought the Conditioner first from Amazon, because I needed a conditioner for my hair badly.  </li>
            <li> I have used other shampoos that, I have been told by the woman who cuts my hair, are not good for the hair and could accelerate hair loss.  </li>
            <li> The frizz is a hard thing to get rid of so like all shampoos when this one builds up a little (like after 3-4 weeks)</li>
            <li> then I usually do a stripper like Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I bought 2 giant bottles....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a million different products over the years, including ultra expensive stuff from my salon.</li>
            <li> It also made my thick hair feel heavy and greasy.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about that for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have never been a fan of leave in treatments because they usually make my hair oily of sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li> The sample oils, which I add a pea sized amount to washed and conditioned towel dried hair, is just the icing on the cake!</li>
            <li> I have used it in the past and it smoothes my hair</li>
            <li> shampoo is o.k, but conditioner too heavy, even for my thick, curly, frizzy hair</li>
            <li> No more frizz</li>
            <li> The shampoo is very heavy.  </li>
            <li> When you sit it makes your hair hard.</li>
            <li> i am very disappointed and think that it might not even be the real conditioner inside!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First complaint I read: &amp;#34</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second complaint I read: &amp;#34;when</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third complaint</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thick&amp; creamy</li>
            <li> If there was one complaint I would say that the conditioner is not as thick as I would like.</li>
            <li> (and I use a thick serum to control it).</li>
            <li> I thought to myself \\&quot;I don&#x27;t give a crap how much this costs, I&#x27;m buying it!\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> conditioner is not as thick and creamy as i like.</li>
            <li> then you know what I mean</li>
            <li> And its absolutely ridiculous to manage.</li>
            <li> it is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that the conditioner had leaked a bit during shipping.</li>
            <li> This was my secon time that I ordered Agadir Argan Shampoo and Conditioner, but this time I received on of the bottles brokend and Iose part of the product, that is not good.</li>
            <li> Not good as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Not good for hair.</li>
            <li> I think that we have become so accustomed to the shampoo being thin and the conditioner being thick.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist was shocked by the condition of my hair--it was so dry.  </li>
            <li> However, this time the packaging was so poor that my conditioner had leaked out.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely thin and I don&#x27;t think any product will work miracles.</li>
            <li> It made my hair so limp and my scalp felt so dirty</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Amazon says it&#x27;s no longer available..at least for now.  </li>
            <li> The pump was broken on my shampoo bottle as well.</li>
            <li> I have thin and color-treated hair; so it is on the dryer side.</li>
            <li> the shampoo exploded inside the bag and i was not happy</li>
            <li> It gives you a lot of lether which I never experienced from well know brands like bed head or redkin.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a bad imitation I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I  don&#x27;t usually leave reviews, but this stuff was so bad that I feel like I have to....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy the Moroccan oil products, because it&#x27;s too expensive.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I had highlighted brittle very thin hair.</li>
            <li> Now I am afraid to buy it again...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately when shipped, the bottles cap had come lose and the shampoo had spilled all over the inside packaging!</li>
            <li> I bought Agadir as substitute of Moroccan shampoo since its very expensive.</li>
            <li> They leave your hair smelling bad &amp; hair</li>
            <li> dries my hair so bad.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> but sadly I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate to say it</li>
            <li> I hated this shampoo.</li>
            <li> but I hated it.</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like the way it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I purchased this product because I tried a sample size of it and loves how it made my hair feel. It make my hair feel smooth, silky, and virtually frizz free. They come in HUGE bottles, so it&#x27;s really worth the money! I&#x27;m very interested in repurchasing! The only problem I had was when I received the product the shampoo wasn&#x27;t closed all the way so there was quite a bit of leakage in the bag it came in. Not a major concern in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I am in agreement with other raters. This is not the same product I purchased before. It does not smell the same, nor does it work as well....something is amiss. Now I am afraid to buy it again...what&#x27;s up with that?</li>
            <li> This shampoo is awesome. My hair is usually dry and this seems the best shampoo for it so far. It not only conditions but also leaves a nice shine on my hair and makes them more manageable.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this line of products.  I have very coarse, thick curly hair and this stuff really helps tame the hair. I also use the nexus split end mender products as well and between the two they have helped my hair tremendously !!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner smells great and it lasts all day. It made my frizzy, dry hair feel very sumptuous and healthy again. The frizz is a hard thing to get rid of so like all shampoos when this one builds up a little (like after 3-4 weeks) then I usually do a stripper like Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo but otherwise it is really good and would recommend it to anyone who wants some moisture or deep conditioning. The fact that it comes with 5 oil packs is also super!</li>
            <li> The reason why I order was because of one of the reviews, it said that I really helps with dry scalp, when it did the opposite. It dry my scalp even more. Love the smells but that about it</li>
            <li> my hair gets a lot of abuse - i color it (okay, the secret is out!) and flat iron it, and swim and stay out in the sun riding my horse, and forget my hat. it was getting very dry and fragile, and started to resemble the straw that i use for bedding the horse stalls! after one or two shampoos with the argan oil shampoo and a just a dab of conditioner, the luster was restored as well as strength. i highly reccommend this - even my hairdresser had a positive comment on how healthy my hair is looking. i can&#x27;t praise this product enough!</li>
            <li> i loved the way this product smelled, but the SLS in the product made me itch. i think im allergic</li>
            <li> These products have a VERY strong scent that lingers for days even after you stop using them.  Although not unpleasant at first after you&#x27;ve been subjected to it for a few hours it becomes nauseating.  The shampoo is very heavy.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling (or smelling) clean.  The conditioner did nothing to delta glue my hair or make it feel smoother.  I&#x27;m still in search of a good shampoo and conditioner - this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> My Mom loves this stuff.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars bc I have never used it.  I have Keratin in my hair so I need to use special shampoo.  But she continues to make me order it for her so it must be a great product.  My Mom is very particular on hair products.</li>
            <li> My hair felt more moisturized after I washed it until it dried. I felt like my hair was drier.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner!! It makes my hair feel silky and gives it a beautiful shine. Some of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used. My&lt;br /&gt;Hair is dry and damaged and after washing and conditioning with these products my hair feels healthy and moisturized. Will purchase it again😄</li>
            <li> I hate to say it but I really don&#x27;t like this shampoo or conditioner and I&#x27;ll tell you why: it&#x27;s too heavy for my fairly normal but color processed hair. Both products are hard to rinse out (using way too much water) so I dread even washing my hair because it seems to take forever. To top it off, my hair feels oily/dirty the next day. Unfortunately I bought 2 giant bottles.... If someone has extremely dry brittle hair this may be a good product to keep it from breaking but otherwise I don&#x27;t like it, won&#x27;t finish it and don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I previously wrote about the other products in this line and shampoo/conditioner is awesome. I use it daily and there is no build up, drying out of my hair and it smells sooooo good. I am going to continue to use these products because I have oily scalp and it feels really clean after I use this product but hydrated. My hair tends to frizz in the summer, but no frizzing or tangles. I love it!</li>
            <li> The product itself is great!  I&#x27;ve used this brand in the past and love it.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this purchase 5 stars was because of the packaging the product was delivered in.  The product was wrapped in a plastic bag-like material and was loose in the box.  This unsecurity caused the product to spill outside the plastic wrapping and the box.  Some product was wasted and was a mess onced removed from the box.</li>
            <li> Great product and great service, thank you!</li>
            <li> I been using this shampoo for 1 year and it&#x27;s AMAZING!!!  It smells great and and my hair is a lot healthier and it has grown so much!!! I will be ordering more. Thank you :)</li>
            <li> i used either my hair is treated or not .smells great and smooths the hair perfectly, a must for every woman whatever her hair type is .</li>
            <li> I was having dry scalp problems with my last set of shampoo and conditioner so after reading the reviews of the Agadir Argan, I decided to give it a try. It has really helped moisturize my hair and scalp, and I LOVE the smell. My hair also seems softer and shinier which is a huge plus of course :)</li>
            <li> Havent really noticed anything too crazy for the amount. I would recommend taking Cod Liver Oil. Why use a topical product when you can fix the root cause, you&#x27;re body!</li>
            <li> I finally got this package after checking every possible way to get the most for my money. I didn&#x27;t want to buy the Moroccan oil products, because it&#x27;s too expensive. This is great though. The shampoo is amazing. Best I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s so thick&amp; creamy I had to double check to make sure I didn&#x27;t accidentally grab the cond. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair a wreck after shampooing like some do. The conditioner is great also, my hair stays so soft!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally curly&amp; I always use some sort of product when straightening it so it doesn&#x27;t get damaged. Well. I put a bit of the oil in while it was still wet, blow dried my hair&amp; then straightened my hair, using a little more of the oil so it didn&#x27;t frizz.&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, my hair has never felt so soft in my entire life (I use a lot of different product; my brother is a hair stylist)!&lt;br /&gt;I will Definitely be buying this set again. Love it!</li>
            <li> I received the items on time but was very disappointed. The box which was left outside my door got wet. When I opened the package, one of the bottle which is the conditioner is missing the cap. I checked all the contents of the box and it wasn&#x27;t there. The shampoo on the other hand has a loose cap so the contents of both shampoo and conditioner spilled inside the plastic packaging.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!</li>
            <li> Received in time for Christmas and I LOVE the big size and nozzle to dispense the shampoo or conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shampoo and conditioner. I love how my hair looks like now after I started using it along with Agadir oil. Great products.</li>
            <li> LOVE this shampoo and conditioner. Great for dry hair.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  My hairdresser recommended it to me and I use it daily.</li>
            <li> my favorite shampoo just got better with the larger size and pump.</li>
            <li> Smells Amazing and Works.&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry hair and that lead to frizz but this product had helped me keep that in control and achieve great smooth hair. My husband now reaches for my shampoo and loves it.....looks like I&#x27;ll be running out sooner than expected.I wa using other shAmpoos before that were super expensive and after awhile.those stopped working for me. But these have exceeded mt expectations.I get compliments all the time and it feels amazing</li>
            <li> love love love this stuff. I am a white girl with dry course hair. works great on all hair types.</li>
            <li> I am n love with this shampoo and conditioner. Smells so nice everyone n my family now uses it. Smells great, lathers awesome, keeps hair soft. And I have long thick colored hair.</li>
            <li> The product itself is excellent, that&#x27;s why I purchased it again.  However, this time the packaging was so poor that my conditioner had leaked out.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner works great and smells so good I get compliments. Uglynbeauty packed it so well that there was no spilling and everything was secure.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair using this product has calmed my hair down</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have found this product and have already purchased it for my daughter as well.  It leaves hair smooth, shiny and moisturizes very well</li>
            <li> I love this product, the smell is to die for, your hair smells good for days</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this shampoo and conditioner. My hair is low porosity and very fine 3c/4a curls so it&#x27;s  very resistant to most products. This line made my hair very soft, very manageable and it minimized the frizz. The conditioner worked fabulously when used with a plastic cap and under the dryer for 20 minutes. I will be using this from this point on and I will be buying it from Amazon. I stopped at the local drugstore and noticed they did carry the product but much smaller bottles at a much higher cost (individually).</li>
            <li> I ordered shampoo and conditioner and all I got was the shampoo</li>
            <li> I was supposed to receive one bottle of Shampoo and one bottle of Conditioner. I was sent 2 bottles of Conditioner. Good product but I would have appreciated receiving what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I am a user of the Marrakesh Shampoo and Conditioner, and this product works as similar for less money.  The item smells good and works with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping too!</li>
            <li> Ótimo produto e ótimo vendedor.  Recomendo ambos a todos.  Produto chegou no prazo e bem embalado.  Não tive qualquer dificuldade.  Produto excelente para qualquer tipo de cabelo.</li>
            <li> My hair is more than 50% gray and was always dry and frizzy.  My hairstylist recommended this product and I saw excellent results.  I also use the bottled oil while styling with the dryer, flat iron, etc. And recently started using the spray oil for touch ups. The pricing on Amazon is about half what you&#x27;ll pay in the salon, so I regularly reorder online. I now have the hair of a twenty-something - I wish they made a wrinkle cream!</li>
            <li> I love how this product makes my hair feel. It&#x27;s not heavy and my hair feels really soft since using this product. Will buy this product again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this set at ALL. It made my hair feel dry and I have very silky hair that doesn&#x27;t usually dry out. I don&#x27;t think I will ever return to Agadir again. Just didn&#x27;t work for me. May be great for those who are looking for a sulfate free healthy alternative for their hair but if you&#x27;re concerned with the feel of your hair (which I&#x27;m certain you are), you may want to skip out on this.</li>
            <li> My hair feels dry and like straw when I used this product.  I will not re-order it again.  Only reason that I have given it two stars instead of 1 is that my boyfriend likes it.  So not a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product is really phenomenal. I ordered it back in April and I have only used about half of the shampoo, and a little more than half of the conditioner, so it lasts a long time for the price. I think this works really well for me, and I will order it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a little background on my hair type, since these products are probably not suited for everyone. I live in CO which is very dry, and I have naturally dry, wavy, unruly hair. I am in my mid 20&#x27;s  and highlight my hair, which is very long (almost down to the bottom of my rib cage). To be able to maintain long hair that looks healthy, I need products that are nourishing and can help prevent breakage. This leaves my hair smooth, soft and smelling wonderful (People inquire about what I use.) I love the shampoo, it is so rich and creamy. If there was one complaint I would say that the conditioner is not as thick as I would like. However, I think it still does a pretty nice job conditioning my hair. I always use the Agadir hair oil afterwards which makes a HUGE difference. When all three are used in combination it turns my unmanageable tresses  into silky, pretty waves. I truly noticed the difference when I used my friends products while staying at her house. I could barely run a brush through my hair and it looked frizzy and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think for the majority of people who are looking for a great conditioning product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo/conditioner. Great price - I will buy it again if the price stays good. The only bad thing is that the conditioner had leaked a bit during shipping. The 2 bottles were in a plastic bag so it didn&#x27;t get on any of the others items that I ordered.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  My hair is highlighted and I straighten it every day. This is a high quality product and my stylist commented about how healthy my hair was after I started using it.</li>
            <li> They smell wonderful and my hair feels very healthy and shiny. This is a high quality product. There was a bit of damage during shipping and some of the product seeped into the box.  I contacted Amazon and they resolved  the situation immediately.</li>
            <li> Only thing, if used everyday, made my head itch.</li>
            <li> Friend of mine introduce this product to me. Very good product, good value.  My hair is damaged from coloring , but this shampoo regenerate ( especially if you use in combination with oil ).&lt;br /&gt;I would like to refer Agadir products to my friends.</li>
            <li> I really like the product.  The shampoo gets sudsy but not as much as other shampoos that have sulfates.  I feel like it&#x27;s more gentle on my hair.  The conditioner is light weight but seems to work well and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I colored my hair and using this shampoo/conditioner and moisturing mask keeps my hair abd scalp from feeling dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> i bought it for my girlfriend and the smell is awsome, it like if she was using a new perfume with the smell of this kit, quality is excellent she says, hair is more brilliant and  the hairstylist asked what did she  did because her hair was completly different  than last time</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used in my 65 years of looking.  I have fine hair that has also turned a little grey lately.  This product makes my hair feel like &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; hair with good body.  My daughter and daughter-in-law both also love it.....it is just exceptional....not much else can be said........highly recommend for all types of hair......you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The best ever...I always had trouble finding something that works for me this is it. Buy it... You will love it..</li>
            <li> Excellent product and shipping experience!</li>
            <li> Best value that can be found for this.  I do wish it was packaged a little better as each time a little has came out of the cap into the bag they place them in, but no biggie.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for several years now.  I like it.  I am not saying that this is related, but as a 59 year old man, who still has a lot of his hair, I am happy!  I have used other shampoos that, I have been told by the woman who cuts my hair, are not good for the hair and could accelerate hair loss.  No such problems here.  My hair feels soft and thick after using it.</li>
            <li> the combination of the shampoo and conditioner are great for my hair.  The price of this product in the liter combo is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo that I could use everyday and wouldn&#x27;t dry out my hair. I was also tired of dandruff and using a second shampoo for that problem. I finally found it! I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner. My hair is softer, shinier, and the dry itchy scalp- GONE! It is a little pricey but well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;It also smells really good too.</li>
            <li> First time using the shampoo &amp; love it. I already use Agadir Argon Oil conditioner, hair masque, and Argon oil treatment!</li>
            <li> Love love love love the product. Five star. But every time I&#x27;ve ordered it, it&#x27;s been leaking in the package. Conditioner everywhere!</li>
            <li> it was excellent. I choose this because once I brought this before. I love it.  it was great rating. Thumb</li>
            <li> An amazing product! This really helps my hair after highlights. It was really dry. When I use the oil to flat my hair, the products works.</li>
            <li> I had outbreaks of psoriasis and I haven&#x27;t had one since I started using this product (April started - now August).  Leaves my hair beautiful, I use the oil as well and I love love love the results.  And, this item if you consider the quality, is really affordable.  I just finished the smaller sized bottle last night and it ran me from April to August.</li>
            <li> Love these products. My hair has never been as healthy and shiny. Makes my hair much more manageable and less flyaway.</li>
            <li> Love that it comes with the argan oil samples.  Great deal for the price. This product has lasted me months</li>
            <li> Both the shampoo and conditioner feel great on my freezy hair.  I Highly recommend it.  It lathers well and detangles superbly.</li>
            <li> The Product arrived to me  a damaged</li>
            <li> Conditioner is good. Set arrived and shampoo had opened and was everywhere! I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a long time and the shampoo is not the original: thinner, whiter and smells completely different.</li>
            <li> 1. I did not receive the oil&lt;br /&gt;2. I actually find the shampoo and conditioner to be very drying (the opposite of what you would assume with the Argan Oil)&lt;br /&gt;3. The fragrance irritates my scalp if I use it too often&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed because this got very good reviews.</li>
            <li> Love this product, but packaging left a lot to be desired.  One of the combos arrived in good condition, but the other had been dropped or crushed in shipping, the bottom of the conditioner bottle had split and leaked all over, creating quite a mess and wasting about a third of the product.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner makes my hair so shiny, although it doesn&#x27;t seem to thicken as much as I would like. My hair is extremely thin and I don&#x27;t think any product will work miracles. The argan oil treats the dryness very well. I would recommend this product to others, especially for the bargain price. The bottles are huge!</li>
            <li> Was tired of paying a fortune for this set in the salon&#x27;s, found it here and have been very pleased, quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Received leaking. Conditioner was not the same quality first order received.</li>
            <li> This product is simply amazing. The service from amazon was equally amazing.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Love this combo! Fast delivery and my hair is happy!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this product on September 28th and its now November 30th. I see a very BIG difference with my hair. I have really, really curly hair. That tends to poof out as soon as it dries. And its absolutely ridiculous to manage. Since I started using this shampoo, I dont have to worry about being a medusa look a-like. I literally shampoo and condition, run my hand through it to get all the tangles out in the shower, I dont even bother brushing it after using the shampoo, just untangle with my hands. So many people have begun asking how it is I style my hair. I dont, I just let it dry out after I shower and it looks fabulous. This is now my favorite shampoo in the world. It smells so so so good, and it leaves your hair shiny and healthy looking. Most def recommend to anyone with wild unruly hair like mine!</li>
            <li> I have long salt and pepper hair and struggled to find a product that can take care of my gray hair issues.  This product does it all.  My hair is soft, shiny and healthy.  You only use a small amount so the value is good as well.</li>
            <li> Great product! Hair feels &amp; looks healthy! My husband likes how it smells &amp; started using it as well. Great price for these items too!</li>
            <li> The shampoo came open, waisting 10% of product and the packaging was a mess, i wish i can show the pics of it</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this shampoo and conditioner, after hearing about all the benefits of argan oil. The set arrived well packaged, which aided in containing a minor leak from one of the bottles. The scent from the leak was strong enough to fill the entire bathroom and hall. I was so worried that the product would smell that strong in my hair too, but once the wet cardboard packaging was removed, the scent disappated. It lathers slightly when washing, which I thought didn&#x27;t happen with sulfate-free shampoo? Oh-well, it did the trick. The conditioner didn&#x27;t seem all that great either and it was a tad difficult working it through my hair (straight, blond, medium length, with highlights.) It dried relatively scent free, which was a big plus. As I&#x27;ve mentioned, the scent isn&#x27;t great. If you smelled motel soap in the 80&#x27;s then you know this scent, very old fashioned. My hair didn&#x27;t feel exceptionally soft afterward, just soft, but after two days the real benefit if the shampoo became apparant. I only shampoo my very dry hair every other day, and it usually gets static-y on day two, but using this shampoo it doesn&#x27;t! I&#x27;ve used it for a week now and my hair just keeps getting better, super shiny and soft and no static.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - Works as promised for shiny, soft hair. Great price included shampoo, conditioner, and free sample oil treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Not a luxurious feel while using in the shower, offputting smell. Four stars.</li>
            <li> Agadir Argan Shampoo and Conditioner Combo is excellent. My product for life! I wear my hair short and natural without chemical straighteners and find this product both gentle and healing for my hair which can be dry/ brittle in the winter. I use cream Henna color in my hair and this brand doesn&#x27;t strip the color prematurely. My hair is softer to the touch, and my roots feel conditioned and easier to comb thru to end, great detangling action. The Agadir shampoo and conditioner smell is wonderful - not over powering, Consistency is creamy, not thin, allowing precise placement as you shampoo and condition. So there is little waste. The non-sulfate formula does not mean no suds, the shampoo lathes fine. But it does not break the hair during the shampoo process the way standard sulfate shampoos do. You can feel the &#x27;smoothing&#x27; feel of the shampoo and conditioner as you use them. A little goes along way. It can be expensive, but worth it. And you can find sellers who sell both shampoo and conditioner for the price of one.</li>
            <li> I am going to see who I can give this to. I have tried every combination. shampoo and conditioner, different shampoo with this conditioner, different conditioner with this shampoo and no matter how you do it your hair will be so heavy and and unclean feeling it is ridiculous. It will take a good clarifying shampoo to get this stuff completely out of my hair. I was just looking for some shine and a good conditioner.</li>
            <li> Not as great as the oil&lt;br /&gt;Spray. You can find a better shampoo n conditioner but stick to ther spray</li>
            <li> I  don&#x27;t usually leave reviews, but this stuff was so bad that I feel like I have to....I wouldn&#x27;t pay one dollar for both of these items....They leave your hair smelling bad &amp; hair looks like you haven&#x27;t washed it in weeks....It weighs hair down and looks like a Greasy Hot Mess....I researched a lot before buying this and can&#x27;t understand the reviews being high for this.....Believe me save your money and get something else!! Don&#x27;t say I haven&#x27;t warned you!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for three years now and have purchased the litre combos off of amazon and ebay. This set arrived opened, shampoo all over box and does not lather like its supposed to. Even the container is flimsly plastic, where bottles in the past were more solid arrived with sealed caps. This already had pump installed and not locked, possibly refilled with inferior product</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE LOVE this product.  I will never use another kind of shampoo or conditioner again.  I&#x27;m older and my hair was starting to get very dry (like horse hair).  I used this product and within 2 weeks, I was getting a lot of compliments on my hair.  Made it soft and shiney and smells fabulous.  I even had someone compliment my hair as to looking that of a 18 year olds hair.  That compliment made my day.  FABULOUS FABULOUS FABULOUS!!!!!</li>
            <li> Just like the MoroccanOil Brand but at 1/2 of the price. Love the gigantic bottles. Easy to sit in the shower and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE SIZE AND PRODUCT.  THE ONLY THING I DIDN&#x27;T L;IKE WAS THEY SHOULD TAPE DOWN THE CAPS BECAUSE ONE OF THE CAPS CAME LOOSE AND THERE WAS A MESS.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it but i like the smell since the conditioner had leak out and was all over everything else</li>
            <li> Been using these daily for over a month and really love the products. My hair is smooth, silky and no frizz. Yay!</li>
            <li> as described. Arrived quick! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Great product! And price way even better. Will order more when I need it!&lt;br /&gt;Combo set is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I have very long, fine hair. I hated this shampoo. It made my hair so limp and my scalp felt so dirty I couldn&#x27;t wait to re wash my hair. I used it for 3 days and it felt like that everytime. I tried to like it but I hated it. I returned it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful products.  I have long blonde hair &amp; it was getting brittle from coloring. I went to a new stylist who uses Agadir &amp; my hair has steadily improved.  Use their entire product line with great success.</li>
            <li> Using very small amounts and it works great!! Love how soft my hair is after using and went three days camping and hair wasn&#x27;t greasy like it normally would after two days.</li>
            <li> Smells so good. Leaves my hair feeling soft and oiled (lightly).</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair clean and looking healthy.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered this product. I like the product but each time they were delivered the tops were loose and the product has leaked. I didn&#x27;t say anything the first time thinking it was a one time wonder. I was wrong. Someone needs to check quality control.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt better. I have coarse dry hair and thick too. This has transformed my hair in just a few days. I have been using it for months now, even my hairdresser is impressed.</li>
            <li> Smells so good, and leaves your hair amazingly soft. Caught my husband using it, he said he loves the smell too!</li>
            <li> Exactly the products I needed! Thanks</li>
            <li> Purchased this back in January and I still have about 1/3 of the bottle.  When it comes to shampoo, I&#x27;m not a snob and not picky. All shampoos serve the purpose by cleaning your hair.  But what I love about this particular shampoo is the scent!  It smells exactly like my late mother&#x27;s favorite perfume, Bal A Versailles.  So I guess I have an emotional connection...but it really does smell like the Jean Desprez perfume!  So between the wonderful scent and the fact that it has lasted SO long, It&#x27;s my favorite.  Unfortunately, Amazon says it&#x27;s no longer available..at least for now.  I&#x27;ve purchased other Argan Oil shampoos but none smell as good as this one.&lt;br /&gt;(the conditioner does not have the same scent)</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Love the smell.  Love the feel of my hair I recomend the oil they have too they sent samples and I purchased it as well.</li>
            <li> always love agadir, great product hair feels great after use!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, great value size too!</li>
            <li> Great for course hair</li>
            <li> I love this product and everyone says my hair feels so smooth. And looks shiney too Will definitley buy this again.</li>
            <li> my hair was frizzy and dry, and using this for a week made my hair soft and managable</li>
            <li> I over this stuff.  Been using it for years.  Cheaper from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before purchasing....they where correct.  This stuff is awesome!  I love the way my hair stays looks and feels.  I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> My hair is silky smooth and I get compliments on smell all of the time. Great price compared to in stores as well!</li>
            <li> Love this product line! Unfortunately when shipped, the bottles cap had come lose and the shampoo had spilled all over the inside packaging! What a mess not to mention the wasted shampoo! Shipper should consider covering caps for shipping to avoid loosening!</li>
            <li> I am a black female with mixed, long, curly hair that can get a bit frizzy sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got this, I thought I could just use it once or twice a week, like every other conditioner/shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. But, I found that this method would leave my hair dry, brittle, hard, and tangled. I just wasn&#x27;t seeing what all the other reviews were ranting and raving about. Like a total genius (sarcasm) I tried shampooing once a week and following the &amp;#34;daily&amp;#34; suggestion written on the bottle for the conditioner. That worked wonders. My hair is so much softer, it&#x27;s unbelievable. I definitely see now why people love this product set! It makes a huge difference! And the added oils are fantastic!</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, quick shipping, well packaged. Disliked what it did to my hair though. MADE it coarse and very dry textured; had to go back to a more expensive shampoo for my color treated hair. It does smell great, so I&#x27;m using it as a body wash and am happy with it in that capacity</li>
            <li> Best for natural hair!</li>
            <li> This shampoo  and conditioner is worth the price.my hair is so soft, shiny, manageable and brings out the color of my hair beautifully.its worth every penny.I will continue to purchase this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This set is now a standard in our bathroom.  My hair is shiny and smells wonderful.  My scalp is no longer itchy, as I use this twice a week.  I may use other shampoos, as my stylist says a little variety is healthiest for hair, and I wash my hair every other day, but this raglan shampoo is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.  I initially purchased the oil at a salon for $35, when that was out I ordered more from Amazon and thought I would try the shampoo and conditioner as well.  I am very happy I did, it is awesome, leaves my hair soft and silky smooth but leaves body and doesn&#x27;t fade my color.  I recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like frizzy, dry looking hair.....</li>
            <li> I find this product very help full for me hair, but was a bit disappointed that the pump is not screwed properly. because everything leaked in the box.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like any product that lies about not having harmful  sulfates in it and it has all of the ones that are harmful to your health n hair. I sent it back and sure if I order anything from your company I will have to do a lot of research since you didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> Well I have wavy hair that is heathy but dry. I just got the shampoo and conditioner as well as the oil spray and used it today and love them! My hair is shiny and so soft that I seriously cannot stop touching it! Seems to \\&quot;tame\\&quot; my hair I would say and if you have wavy/curly hair then you know what I mean when I say that although my hair is healthy, if I let it dry naturally, it doesn&#x27;t look shiny or touchable. This makes my hair really shiny/healthy looking. Will for sure continue to buy especially if it means using the flat iron a lot less.</li>
            <li> The shipment was on time. The package has no problem and received as seen on the web. Tahnk you</li>
            <li> Great product!! I love it.</li>
            <li> a lot of product for the money.  If you have dry or treated hair, this is perfect.  The Argan oil adds just the right amount of shine.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo .....I loved it so are my teenage kids ...</li>
            <li> love the item and will diffently purchase again from them.</li>
            <li> feeling good after first usage, i just hope it is natural and does not dry my hair like some of the other products ive used.&lt;br /&gt;only problem i had is that the top was loose when it arrived along with the other free shipping items.. this makes me wonder if the company cares less for the item if it is done through super shipping...</li>
            <li> will not buy again. this is my second try with this brand. dries my hair so bad. love aragon oil but this brand is very drying</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product! Lots of samples too! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> not because I bought one at Kroger and was ver y good but the one on Amazon is completely different. It seems to be a bad imitation I do not recommend. I wasted My money</li>
            <li> My stylist uses this product line and I fell in love with it through her.  It was a little bit pricey at the salon, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon!  I have shoulder-length hair yet I only need two sqirts of the shampoo and three of the conditioner, so I save money over my previous choice of products.  The scent is lovely but not overpowering and lasts for several days between washings.  I highly recommend the Agadir product line!</li>
            <li> Buy something from. Walmart and call it a day, nothing great about the shampoo nor the conditioner, save your money and buy something else.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I&#x27;ve used many shampoos and conditioners over the years but this is by far my favorite. Not only can this product be used daily, but the smell is amazing (great for both men and women).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo:  works into a truly luxurious lather, which I definitely enjoy. It is NOT drying at all - as is often the case with many shampoos I&#x27;ve used - and leaves my hair feeling both clean and supple even immediately after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner:  is light, yet moisturizing - my hair consistently dries with excellent volume and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize:  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND these products. Awesome smell, leaves my hair very supple, soft, shiny, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> Love this set! I was one of those girls...in search of the Holy grail of shampoos/conditioners. Until Agadir. Queue harps. The search is over. Love that it makes my hair silky without feeling weighed down. Pleasant light musk alluring smell</li>
            <li> Product was opened and spilled out</li>
            <li> Product is great. Shampoo has lasted me for over 3 months and the conditioner lasted about 2 months. I was also sharing the product with my roommate. A must buy!</li>
            <li> I saw this oil being made on SciChanel. Then saw this product on Amazon. bought it and it is the best I have ever used for my hair. And for the price it makes a great gift. Everyone I bought it for also thikns it is the GREATEST!!!</li>
            <li> Started using this product through my hairdresser...love how it feels...how it smells...my hair feels great...I have recommended it to others</li>
            <li> So, after years of torturing my hair with other products, I finally found that Argan oil really makes my hair so shiny and touchably soft. Agadir products have brought life back into my dry unruly hair. Because I dye my hair every few months, my ends suffer. I also have an itchy scalp when I use normal shampoo and conditioners or my hair gets dry and frizzy to the point of insanity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product and the oils exclusively for about three months now, and wow, what a difference! My hair is soft for days, and the smell is wonderful. It&#x27;s a bit strong while I&#x27;m using it, then it becomes more subtle when it dries, but it smells really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to what I would pay buying this at the local drugstore, I save more than 50%!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now a devoted customer. I have bought from UglyNBeauty twice now, and will continue ordering from them for both the price as well as shipping. The packaging is always secure enough that I never have to worry about the product leaking out or getting damaged in shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo , conditioner and oil treatment. The shampoo suds nicely and Makes my hair feel soft and clean. The confitioner is light and subtly fragrant. I also use a little on my dry hair to moisturize and it feels so silky soft. The oil treatment is light and gives my hair a beautiful shine.</li>
            <li> I bought this after using Moraccanoil for a few weeks. My first purchase left my hair dry after washing. the conditioner is awesome. But I would never be able to use just the shampoo not mention the cost.  Agadir wasn&#x27;t as expensive, two 33 oz bottles cost about the same as the two 8 oz of the other brand. The shampoo leaves my hair soft and smells awesome I could totally use the shampoo by itself. I won&#x27;t because the  conditioner is amazing. I love the oil treatment it came with. My hair is so soft and shiny. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for 6 months now - i only use 1 squirt whenever i take a shower, otherwise my hair flies all over the place. it smells amazing, and for the most part doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin</li>
            <li> Good value.  Local Kroger has them for way too much price.</li>
            <li> Agadir has the very best hair products on the market. I get my hair colored or toned every six weeks and use blow dryer and curling iron almost every day. Keeping my hair from getting dried out and controlling frizzies is a constant battle, especially as I get older. This shampoo and conditioner really works. I&#x27;ve tried a million different products over the years, including ultra expensive stuff from my salon. Nothing has ever worked as well as this. Gives shiny, soft, manageable hair without being heavy or oily feeling, extends my color longer and no frizzies. Give it a week of use to really see the difference. I use it along with the spray treatment which is a great product too. The spray says speeds drying time by 50% and that is really true. One more thing, the shampoo &amp; conditioner 33.8 oz pair for $41.60 is the best value you will find. The 12.4 oz bottles are $20-$25 per bottle at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> I tried this product as suggested by my daughter, unsure if I would like it.  I love the shampoo &amp; conditioner! I color my hair and my hair is soft looking and manageable and the color lasts longer than ever.  Agadir Argan Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner...you have a new fan!</li>
            <li> Fragrance was offensive to me.  It also made my thick hair feel heavy and greasy.  I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is so rich you will use less than any other!  The lather of the shampoo is so rich it engulfs every strand with gentleness! Conditioner leaves the hair feeling awesome. My hair has the shine I have always wanted!</li>
            <li> I noticed you don&#x27;t have to use a lot for washing and conditioning. Hair feels clean, product has a fresh clean scent.  It says controls frizz. Not sure about that for my hair.  I have curly hair. I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair everyday.  Just rinse with conditioner in between washings to bring back the curl.  That&#x27;s when I see the frizz (and I use a thick serum to control it). Hair feels soft after washing.  The product is good.  I&#x27;m sure it works on all hair.</li>
            <li> I received 2 bottles of conditioner instead of one shampoo and one conditioner. I will buy the shampoo and then leave feedback about the product.</li>
            <li> get this for your girl, your mom, your sister, your aunty and yourself!! this stuff is amazing! guaranteed to get you laid for the next month in the shower and out the shower. smells like tropical heaven but not cheap tropical, also not overpowering. good for any kind of gift. will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> I love it very much. My hair looks moisturized and shine since I used it few months ago.  My hair is exposed to sun a lot but this Shampoo can keep my hair away from looking dry and dull.</li>
            <li> My stylist uses this product which is how I found out about it.  Love the smell!  Your hair smells fresh all day long!  Great non-sulfate product &amp; will never switch to another brand.  Even bought the hairspray as well.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product but sadly I am disappointed. I have a lot of breakage and was hoping that the oils would help smooth some of the fly aways but it just made it look oily and limp. I stopped using the little packets of oil and I still had to wash my hair daily. If you have severly dry hair then this might work for you. I have dry hair and it still was too much for me.</li>
            <li> I buy this shampoo and conditioner all the time and the stuff inside is a different product for sure sad what people will do for money</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner. But I did not get the free oil like it said I would. Oh well..Still like it</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders on my hair! My thick hair is usually drier than a popcorn fart after years of dying it blonde and daily straightening. My hair has become so brittle that I&#x27;ve literally wanted to cut it all of. After my hair dresser used this shampoo and conditioner on me after a cut a few weeks ago I was hooked, my barbed wire hair was suddenly silky smooth (all day long). I thought to myself \\&quot;I don&#x27;t give a crap how much this costs, I&#x27;m buying it!\\&quot;. The free oil is the icing on the cake(stuff is awesome too),these products are Holy Grail material in my opinion!</li>
            <li> This product met my expectations. I have coarse keratin treated hair. The product left my hair super soft and shiny. I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I have natural, virgin hair and I was having a moment of weakness due to the stress of trying to manage coarse, dry hair. However, I received my order ( really quickly thank God) and decided against the chemicals. You literally see results immediately after a good wash and 30 minute deep conditioning. The fragrance is intoxicating. My hair is much softer and shinier after using this. Due to the large size and the fact that I co-wash more than I shampoo, this will probably last about six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minor critique I have is that the shampoo spilled slightly due to the top coming loose, and there no being a hygienic seal to prevent leaking. Other than that, this was a great buy for the cost and the fast shipping was a bonus!</li>
            <li> Great smell make my hair clean shin&lt;br /&gt;Very waxy to style . And  love love the free gift . That&#x27;s why I always order it here .</li>
            <li> This was my secon time that I ordered Agadir Argan Shampoo and Conditioner, but this time I received on of the bottles brokend and Iose part of the product, that is not good.</li>
            <li> My items arrived damaged and half of both bottles emptied out.  The pump was broken on my shampoo bottle as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for about a year now.  This is the first time I have used hair products that actually make a difference.  Especially the leave in treatment...I have never been a fan of leave in treatments because they usually make my hair oily of sticky feeling.  Not this stuff.  Leaves your hair soft and sleek.</li>
            <li> Luv this stuff..  Nice and moisturizing</li>
            <li> Agadir Argan Oil Hair products was everything I expected. My hair shines &amp; is much easier to manage after using this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered Agadir Argan Oil Daily Shampoo + Conditioner \\&quot;Liter Combo Set\\&quot; 33.8 oz w/5 free oil tubes and want to let you know that I am very happy! I was an Ojon client for many years but since they have change their line so that the new shampoo does not have the pleasant smell I liked, so I did not want to use that any more as I am used to lots of complements because of the smell... so I have asked my hair dresser for advice and she gave me to try Agadir oil and I LOVED the sweet smell so I went to look for shampoo and conditioner hoping it will be as nice, and it is! Also, I noticed that I even have a fuller body and silky look, I think much better then with Ojon! So, I am very happy!</li>
            <li> Second time to buy.  Great products!  Curly hair loves the conditioner.  And the sulfate free shampoo gelp keep hair color vibrant!</li>
            <li> I love this product, my hair feels so silky after I use it and it has been great when I&#x27;ve wanted to grow my hair out for prolonging rough feeling ends, which stretches the time between trims.  This is my 2nd time purchasing from this seller. Great price and they shipped it the same day I ordered it and it was packaged securely and the  tops were on tight.</li>
            <li> Only received shampoo. No conditioner!</li>
            <li> These products are wonderful! Great even with color treated hair and smells awesome! Would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Received order as promise. It was package well. It was what I expected...will order again. I have used another product for a couple years but when I tried a sample of this product I loved it. I ordered this smaller bottles to try for longer period. I loved the way my hair felt. So since then I have ordered the larger bottles of the product.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner!!! It&#x27;s sulfate free, makes the hair feel soft, smooth and healthy. I like it better than Moroccan oil shampoo and conditioner. There&#x27;s is not sulfate free and it&#x27;s way to expensive. It doesn&#x27;t even work the same as this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> i keep ordering this product. This my 3rd time getting the same combo. I had highlighted brittle very thin hair. After started using this product I noticed I have softer and stronger hair. Smells very good. Even when you sweat at the gym you will notice a nice after-smell coming out of your hair. Will definitely order again</li>
            <li> This keeps my hair soft and silky.  Argan oil is great for hair!  I recommend it if you have coarse frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Best product for the hair ever</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. My hair was very frizzy and dry, but after using this its silky, soft, and I LOVE the smell..</li>
            <li> I generally use a top line Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, which is what I set out to do when I ran across Agadir products.  I read the reviews, which we very positive and decided to try it.  I am so glad I did.  My hair, which I foil, became so less frizzy and dry.  It is very manageable and healthy,  I no longer have to run a straight iron through it every day.  The shampoo is so creamy and cleans my hair gently.  The conditioner is just as good, but not as thick; which is great.  I love the oil.  I generally use the very expensive Morrocan Oil, and this is certainly just as good, or better.  I highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was a product junkie.  I have tried every product out there.  Trying to get blonde hair shiny is not easy.  It took me 46 years and thousands of dollars, but I have finally found it.  This product does it all. My hair is easy to comb out when I get out of the shower, you can comb through it during the day tangle free, plus it looks and feels healthy.  My true test is when my daughter, who has a disease called RSD/CRPS started losing her hair due to her disease and steroid medication.  Finally, when she was using my shower after surgery, she used my shampoo and conditioner, she looked at her hair brush, which had to be emptied every time she brushed out her hair.  She started cleaning out the brush once a day, then every few days, and now she only has to do it once a week!  This is huge, especially when you are talking about a 17 year old girl!  Do not waist your money on Wen products, that DO NOT WORK, give this a try...you will not be disappointed!  Oh one more benefit, if you are in a hurry you can forget the conditioner a couple times a week, and still be tangle free with shiny hair.  I have never posted or recommended anything befor, but had to share this one.  Good luck, I hope you love it!</li>
            <li> This combo leaves even my completely natural African American clients&#x27; hair super soft, silky and shiny when flat ironed! Not to mention it smells amazing!!!!! Works wonders on extensions as well! The sample oils, which I add a pea sized amount to washed and conditioned towel dried hair, is just the icing on the cake! They made me purchase the 4oz! Definitely will order again!</li>
            <li> Different product... Not good as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I love this product. When I received  the shipment, one of the individual tubes of oil had leaked completely out. That being the case, I only received 4 tubes instead of 5</li>
            <li> Dry hair, curly hair, long hair will benefit from using these products.  They rejuvenate curly locks and allow the true springy, long curls to evolve from frizz.  Having searched long and thoroughly I heartily recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I did not receive the oil treatments that were to be included with my purchase. This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> I love the smell but this is on the heavy side as far as moisture goes.  I&#x27;ve tried mixing it with other brands and it just weighs my hair down too much.  I&#x27;ve also had my daughter try it and she didn&#x27;t care for it, either.  Her hair is unprocessed, long and thick.  My hair is heavily processed and thinner.  This product is too heavy for both of us.  I prefer Moroccanoil brand and my daughter uses either Redken All-Soft or Biolage.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used for dry hair. It moisterizes without weighing your hair down. Will definately keep buying it!!! Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I used it once. It doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve purchased. The conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a dope for my other favor argan oil set since that one is always out of stock on costco.com.  When I came across this set, I was extremely happy since it&#x27;s DOUBLE the size of my old one, but also affordable.  So decided to give this a try.  I got it yesterday and used it for the first time this morning.  The shampoo is GREAT and has a rich texture and cleans and smells well;  So i was excited to try the conditioner and expected more great product.  But conditioner on the other hand, it&#x27;s so watery that the shampoo is thicker than the conditioner.  Totally not what I expected after using of shampoo.  I have thin and color-treated hair; so it is on the dryer side. This conditioner did nothing to smooth my hair.  I would buy the shampoo again but not the conditioner.  I will give it a little more time and hopefully it gets better through more uses.</li>
            <li> These products smell great! They leave my hair feeling great. I will definitely purchase again. I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> shampoo and conditioner smell great the shampoo and conditioner leave my hair smooth and silky</li>
            <li> I have very curly dry hair and this product along with the oil make my hair soft and shiny and keeps the frizz away.  I have tried everything and finally a great product.  I think that if you have straight hair, it will really weigh it down but for my dry curly hair &#x3D; perfection.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I have used it in the past and it smoothes my hair so I don&#x27;t get all those little flyaways and I don&#x27;t use any additional product. When I received my order from this particular seller I was pleasantly surprised that the bottles already had pumps on them. I was a little worried about finding the right fit for them but because it came with I&#x27;m even more in love.</li>
            <li> Will always order this used it for years now on my hair and it took me this long to find what works for my texture and this is it</li>
            <li> I DO NOT USE ANYTHING ELSE ON MY HAIR EXCEPT THIS PRODUCT. I HAVE TOLD MY FRIENDS AND THEY BUY IT TOO. WE HAVE ALL SEEN TRUE CHANGES IN OUR HAIR TEXTURE. I GET COMPLIMENTS ALL THE TIME AND PEOPLE ASK ME IF THEY CAN TOUCH MY HAIR. I ALWAYS TELL THEM SURE AND THEN THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT I USE AND I SALE THIS PRODUCT FOR YOU JUST BY PEOPLE NOTICING THE DIFFERENCE IN MY HAIR. YOU SHOULD TRY THIS TOO IT HAS AN AWESOME SPELL AND IT TRULEY WORKS. V</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful love the smell . leaves your hair smooth and non frizzy. for those who have natural curls great for curls , leaves curls with bounce no frizz, hair is manageable.does not weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> Ordered this quite a while ago.  still have a lot.  shampoo is o.k, but conditioner too heavy, even for my thick, curly, frizzy hair</li>
            <li> Smells great. leaves hair soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> I keep re-ordering this because it leaves my hair very nice and clean and manageable, and when you use the oil is much better</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner, and this set is a great price.  This does a great job of keeping my hair smooth, and it calms my husband&#x27;s itchy scalp.  Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of the s hampoo.  The price was good for argan oil shampoo but I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and manageable.  The oil treatment (In the little packets) makes my hair dry in half the usual time and it makes it shine with no greasy feeling - I rub the leftover into my cuticles.</li>
            <li> shampoo is good. conditioner is not as thick and creamy as i like. both are very nice and fragrant. the additional argan oil leave in conditioner is great..hair is left soft and shiny</li>
            <li> Cleans well, Smells great!  According to my wife anyway.  This one was her purchase, but I sneak some now and again...</li>
            <li> Lost them in the airport for being too big and in my hand luggage.  Really oily so I am not crying over losing them.  Reminded me of the feeling VO5 oil will have in your hair.  If not removed properly your hair will be heavy.</li>
            <li> Love how it leaves my hair, best I&#x27;ve found, and these prices are half what I paid at other stores.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product and have been using it exclusively for the last year.  In addition to the shampoo and conditioner, I also use the oil and hair spray!  It keeps my hair super hydrated and beautifully conditioned, but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  I have super fine hair and this is the only product that works for that!  LOVE LOVE LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Couple of months ago I went to a new salon and got my hair done.  She used this product and the smell was delicious.  Amazon appears to have the cheapest price although I was surprised at how expensive this product line is but a little bit goes a long way so it will last me quite awhile.  I have short course thick naturally curly/frizzy hair. I am so impressed with the results this shampoo has giving me in the short time I have been using it.  Super shiny, healthier looking and the frizziness is noticeably tamed down without having the heavy oily residue of some other frizz taming products (over the years I have tried all the so called high end products).  I only use the conditioner about every other washing and I also bought the Agadir Argan Oil Volumizing Styling and Sculpting Gel Xtreme Hold and a bottle of the pure Argan oil for my skin.  After all these years I have finally found a permanent product that works for my hair type and continues to do an awesome job shampoo after shampoo.</li>
            <li> I do not believe it is agadir. It has dried my hair and my neighbor&#x27;s hair. It is not what it is advertised to be.</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo and conditioner! It leave your hair very silky and shiny! I was purchasing it from another site that was more expensive! I do recommend this product to anyone who would like to control their hair!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. I deal with hair-loss and this has improved my hair health greatly. It&#x27;s formula is awesome. It smells awesome. No sulfates, and argan is extremely good for your hair. REAL argan oil. The pump applicator is a awesome bonus. I have really long hair and these big bottles last a while.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful.  The scent, the lather, how clean and lightweight it makes my long fine hair feel.  Lots of shine and bounce.  I LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I&#x27;m a prime member &amp; this arrived the NEXT DAY after I ordered it!!  How&#x27;d they do that?!?!!?  Awesome :)</li>
            <li> I love love love this shampoo and conditioner, I also like the argan oil spray they have too. leaves hair shiny and silky. will purchase again, love the extra large size and gerat pricing..</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I love Agadir Argan shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I purchase the regular size bottles off of Amazon as well.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I upgraded to the big bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Since I had some leftover from other bottle, I poured both in my hand to compare the color, consistency and scent.&lt;br /&gt;The smaller bottle shampoo has a pink opalescent sheen to it.&lt;br /&gt;The larger bottle shampoo has a white opalescent sheen to it.&lt;br /&gt;They have the same consistency though.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner scent of the larger bottle has a slightly different scent than the smaller bottle. Not a big difference, but I notice it.&lt;br /&gt;Washing my hair with the larger bottles, my hair feels the same!&lt;br /&gt;So, maybe the differences noted are because it is from a different &amp;#34;batch&amp;#34;, or maybe the bigger stuff is diluted by small percent. I am not quite sure. I do know that nothing makes my hair feel like Agadir Argan oil and my hair feels soft and luxurious with the bigger bottles as well. I will update my rating if anything changes.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner.  Makes your hair silky and smooth. The argon oil is also the best for your hair.  No more frizz</li>
            <li> I love the smell! This brand makes almost all good smelling products. The little hair treatments that are included in the package smell very good, which I use more than the actual shampoo and conditioner. This could probably be a better product for people with thinner hair. I have very think, coarse hair and this product just strips the moisture from my strands and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t moisturize much.</li>
            <li> I have long black hair, and I often change the color of my hair (highlighting). I love agadir shampoo and conditioner and I would also recommend its oil (Agadir Argan Oil Hair Treatment). Your hair will be smooth. This won&#x27;t make your hair stronger and as it does not have strong chemicals so you might need to wash your hair often. But after wash effect is good!! I would say go for it.</li>
            <li> Great full curly hair has just the right amount of oil does not leave hair greasy just shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a huge help for my hair. It flakes a lot and gets irritated, but this shampoo keeps it at a level that I don&#x27;t have to use any medication.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner combination.  My hair was damaged from coloring and the sun.  These products repaired my hair and helped it to grow.  I am asked each day what I use on my hair.  It is also a wonderful daily shampoo.  The smell is very clean and refreshing and it doesn&#x27;t over power you with a &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews on things I purchase, but I felt the need to do so with this. Before I purchase something I tend to read the negative reviews first, especially when there a quite a few, then work my way up to the top reviews. I use this product and purchase if from Walgreens normally so some of the reviews concerned me and I kept delaying purchasing it from here. Finally I bit the bullet and just did it. So glad I did!! I want to address many of the negative comments I read for anyone who might be out there who might do the same thing I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First complaint I read: &amp;#34; The shampoo is thick but the conditioner is watery&amp;#34; - this is true. I think that we have become so accustomed to the shampoo being thin and the conditioner being thick. This product does not have to have a thick conditioner because it gives your hair so much moisture in both steps that a thick conditioner would cause it to be weighed down - in my opinion. The conditioner is light but packed with so much goodness for your hair, it completely gets the job done! I am completely platinum (or grey to most) AND I color my hair. It has done my hair a world of good as far as texture, manageability, and color maintenance. Get beyond your normal concept of how shampoo and conditioner normally is and expand your horizons to a new idea on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second complaint I read: &amp;#34;when I got the product, it had spilled inside the package&amp;#34; - this happened to me as well. BUT the package was obviously shipped the way the seller got it. It comes as a set, wrapped in plastic, with a label that clearly states &amp;#34;This is a set. Do not sell separately&amp;#34;. They do not have the ability to ensure the tops are tightened WITHOUT opening the set. So yes, some of the contents had leaked out inside the plastic the product was originally sent in. It is similar to shrink wrap so not much room for moving things around. I would much rather have a small amount of product spill out in transitthan have them open my package, ensure the lid is on tight, then send it to me open and loose. People, stop being so critical. The bottle was still full and the loss was very minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third complaint I read: &amp;#34;The smell is so strong&amp;#34; - yes, it has a strong smell that is very nice to me. Many shampoos and conditioners have strong smells to them. Most are fruity or floral or sweet. Personally I don&#x27;t like my hair to smell like a flower garden or bag of candy.  This product has a spicy, herbal scent very much like something I would expect from a product like this. I enjoy it thoroughly. But of course, I&#x27;m not a fan of the norm, and if you want to stand out from the crowd in a good way, get this product! It is very much like Moroccanoil but somewhat stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth complaint and the one that held me back most: &amp;#34;This is not the real thing&amp;#34; - I don&#x27;t know where these people purchased their product previously, but this is the very same one I get and have been using for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I know that some products are not for everyone, just like some people will just look for something to complain about. I absolutely love this product and won&#x27;t use anything else. I will be purchasing it from here as long as I can! Great value, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner were a complete mess in the plastic packaging it was sent in...the shampoo exploded inside the bag and i was not happy what so ever!!! Also I have been using agadir for over a year and the conditioner really has no scent like it&#x27;s suppose to...i am very disappointed and think that it might not even be the real conditioner inside!!! I buy these products all the time and not once has the conditioner ever not smelled just like the shampoo, but this time it has no sent and I think I paid for something that might have been tampered with...not a happy customer this time around!!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this product on the strength of the reviews, and so far it has not lived up to the hype. Both me &amp; my wife use this, and it leaves our hair feeling dry and unmanageable. I would recommend the Amir Argan Oil Shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Amir-Shampoo-Conditioner-Travel-Moisturizer/dp/B004UBCWXS/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1399849655&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;amir+argan+oil+shampoo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That one is much better. Again, it&#x27;s possible that I got a knockoff of the Agadir, but in any case, what a waste of money and they don&#x27;t allow returns.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, based upon the good reviews.  I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars and not 1 because I will hand it to the vendor for shipping this product in record time.  It arrived at my door so quickly, I was shocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the product, I wish I could be as positive about it.  I used it for a few weeks before getting a haircut.  My hairstylist was shocked by the condition of my hair--it was so dry.  And, indeed, my hair does not feel anymore manageable or tangle-free after using a large dollop of this conditioner on it.  At the same time, however, I noticed that my scalp was getting oily much more quickly than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently joined Equinox and started using the Kiehl&#x27;s shampoo/conditioner products, and that&#x27;s when I really sensed the difference.  Yes, Kiehl&#x27;s is more expensive, but my hair feels nice and fluffy for at least 24 hours.  With this Agadir Argan Oil product, my hair felt like it was beginning to get weighted down 12 hours later.  But it did nothing to nourish my dry ends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, even though I have a bunch of product left (the bottles are pretty large), I&#x27;m going to stop using them and start showering at Equinox more often!</li>
            <li> I love everything about it except the price!</li>
            <li> I chose this product due to the lower pricing as compared with the Morrocan Oil (blue bottles) brand. This product performs nothing like the Morrocan Oil brand. I purchased the large bottles so will use until gone but will not repurchase this brand and will opt for the more expensive Morrocan Oil.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a week and I love it. I was concerned that being oil based that it would be heavy and weigh my hair down, but after a solid week of daily use my hair is not in the least greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo seems like it gives extra bulk to your hair when you shampoo. But when rinsed and dried, there is no extra bulk, and my hair is soft, silky, and have great movement, bounce and exceptional shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner, because of the consistency, entices you to want to use a lot, but you don&#x27;t need it, two or three pumps is enough for medium hair, just work it into the length of the strands with your fingers. It doesn&#x27;t lay on the hair, simply coating it, it seems to actually absorb into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very pleasant, if very strong immediately after shampooing. But the morning after just leaves you with a lovely, soft scent on close contact. This works as well, in my estimation as the Paul Mitchell Moisturizing shampoo I was using, and at half the price. I will gladly purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I swim daily and this product keeps my hair from being dry and frizzy. But you should be warned this product is highly scented. Highly!</li>
            <li> But this stuff is awesome!  I love the argan-oil smell of both (they&#x27;re different, but similar), and I love the feel of the lather.  It&#x27;s the best natural shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve used that actually keeps your hair in good shape while still being affordable to someone who doesn&#x27;t believe in spending ridiculous amounts on personal products.  You don&#x27;t even have to use much, I&#x27;ve had it for a month and I&#x27;m guessing this set will last me a year.</li>
            <li> The bottle came open and the shampoo was all over it. it was messy. I did not get to try it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product once and it was great so when I ran out of shampoo and conditioner I reordered the package deal. The next second time it came in the mail the shampoo and as opened and was spilled all over the ziplock bag.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried the Argan Oil products until now, pleasantly surprised with how well these work.  Makes my crappy, naturally curly and frizzy hair more soft and manageable and smells freakin&#x27; awesome.</li>
            <li> Too Heavy . Not good for hair. Maybe it&#x27;s good for dry hair .</li>
            <li> I love this! It&#x27;s my new Shampoo and Conditioner permanently. My hair is in recovery after many bleachings, dyings, etc. My ends have a tendency to be straw-like. This makes my hair so amazingly soft!! Plus, it smells amazing! My fiance can&#x27;t stop sniffing my hair! A definite must buy!!</li>
            <li> Great great shampoo and conditioner. What more can I say.</li>
            <li> Great product. The oil treatment exceeded my expectations. A little goes a long way. Made my hair easier to comb through when wet. Don&#x27;t need a detangler. My hair is smooth.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is so amazing! It smells absolutely AMAZING and makes my hair softer than any other shampoo i&#x27;ve ever tried. I seriously can&#x27;t get over how much i love this shampoo and conditioner...or the amazing smell!! I highly rcommend this shampoo and condition.&lt;br /&gt;I came back to edit my reviews after using 3/4 of the bottle. While I still absolutely love the shampoo and the smell, I have noticed that it has started to make my hair oily. I think this shampoo is great for dry brittle hair, but after awhile it starts to make it greasy, so I wanted to recommend that after you&#x27;ve used this shampoo for awhile you  may want to alternate between this shampoo and another kind. It you have very dry hair, this product is for you!!!</li>
            <li> I bought Agadir as substitute of Moroccan shampoo since its very expensive. I have no idea how Moroccan shampoo and conditioner feels like but this one feels nice on my hair. It gives you a lot of lether which I never experienced from well know brands like bed head or redkin. It has very nice smell. It gives you very fresh feeling. It does not make your hair greasy. BUT I did not like the conditioner. Its very runny and light weight.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon did not send me the combo instead it sent me 2 bottles of shampoo. I wanted to return but they said I can&#x27;t because of safety regulations. They did refund me for the whole package though. So I am kinda using them for free :) I think I am good for 1 year as 2 bottles of shampoo would last very long for my hair length.</li>
            <li> The Shampoo and Conditioner have such strong fragrance, a cheap smelling kind, which I have not encountered for a long time. I used it once and could not tolerate the smell.</li>
            <li> Bought this hoping to save money . It&#x27;s very pricey at the salon.  This was not the same product. I still had some from the salon to compare it to . It didn&#x27;t smell, look, or feel the same. Very disappointed. Will not be purchasing beauty products from Amazon again</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so clean and light. Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The odor is unpleasant and the products left my fine thin hair heavy and flat.</li>
            <li> Bought this as it was the cheapest Shampoo n Conditioner with Argan oil in it, but how I wish I didn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t help with hair fall, rather makes the hair even more drier! Even dries out the scalp and promotes dandruff and hair fall! Stay away!</li>
            <li> It smelled good but that was about it. I don&#x27;t this particular shampoo and conditioner combo did anything special for my curly hair nor did it keep color any longer.</li>
            <li> Amazing price for this.  I have the keratin treatment for my hair and this is the sulfate free set my stylist most recommends to help the treatment last.  My last treatment was four months ago and other than the new growth, the keratin treatment is still effective. I was concerned sulfate free shampoo would not clean, my hair as well, but my hair is clean and shines when using the shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift set for a friend and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft, silky, and shiny.  And this is a fantastic price.  They started carrying this item at my local drug store for about 10x this price.</li>
            <li> Have used these products for years. Wonderful!!</li>
            <li> I only received the conditioner when my order was received, no shampoo!</li>
            <li> Great line of products!!</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever!  It leaves you hair nice and soft BEFORE conditioner. Don&#x27;t use the conditioner as a sit for 15 minute conditioner, instead, use as directed. When you sit it makes your hair hard. It&#x27;s meant to wash right out.</li>
            <li> great shampoo for my hard to manage hair. smells great too!</li>
            <li> We really like this set.  Have been a fan of Agadir for several years, using various products of theirs.  End up using this shampoo and conditioner 70% of the year, switching out occasionally to give my hair a change.</li>
            <li> I had bought the Conditioner first from Amazon, because I needed a conditioner for my hair badly.  It felt like hay, and had many splint ends.  I&#x27;m a male, who doesn&#x27;t know much about these products, but I did love the conditioner.  After one use of it, my hair felt so soft, and I love playing with my own hair now.  I&#x27;m hoping with the shampoo, it will stay very soft for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner, and not to mention the bonus oil packets (which don&#x27;t make your hair greasy, but instead, soft and silky!) The shampoo really makes my hair feel really clean and I love the smell. The conditioner of course does the trick of smoothing it all out and making it feel oh so good. The oil on your hair is like a cherry on top of the ice cream as the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. I&#x27;m a huge fan of sulfate free shampoos/conditioners and this one is now at the top of my list.</li>
            <li> The price is unbeatable!  This duo arrived safely with everything in tact.  The bottles were double bagged and sealed, ZERO evidence of leaking.  I love this product and what it did for my healthy hair and also later on for my bleached ravaged hair.  Going from black to purple then to removing the purple, my hair was pretty fried and dull.  My hair is shiny, soft, manageable and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this product! It has worked wonders on my dry hair and makes it feel so soft and smell AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> We live in a dry climate &amp; this shampoo is very good. Keeps your hair healthy</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smells wonderful and makes my hair smooth and manageable.  I love that it is sulfate free. Great product and will definitely purchase again</li>
