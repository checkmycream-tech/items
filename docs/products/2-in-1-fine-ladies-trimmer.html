            <li>great price..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy</li>

            <li>GREAT USE IT FOR EYBROWS</li>
            <li>BECAUSE IT DOES WORK GREAT.</li>
            <li>had one I loved by Pretika, but it broke after many years and they don&#x27;t seem to make them anymore.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery great price</li>
            <li>these would be better</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a slim design so it can go mostly anywhere.</li>
            <li>MOSTLY.</li>
            <li>Excellent tool for everyday trimming.</li>
            <li>My first one worked well for many years.</li>
            <li>I call it high-pitched mode because that is the sound it makes - like it got super charged.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the Conair Ladies 2 in 1 Fine Line Personal Trimmer that I purchased throught Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>if more powerful but still, much needed product</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t worth losing skin over.&lt;br</li>
            <li>PRODUCT WAS EXACTLY AS IT WAS PICTURED .</li>
            <li>CAME IN FAST</li>
            <li>Nice for use in all the small areas.  </li>
            <li>I have contacted the sellers and hopefully I can give a little bit of a better rating if they fix this.</li>
            <li>To me this razor is only good for small things like eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Bought new.</li>
            <li>Spent the same amount on them and they even have a light attached..  </li>
            <li>I use it frequently for eyebrows..</li>
            <li>I use thus or my young daughter mustache</li>
            <li>This is good for small trimming areas but if you&#x27;re planning major landscaping, it is pretty slow.</li>
            <li>I could use the other end of my toothbrush on my errant hairs and it would do the same job for free.</li>
            <li>I tried brand new batteries from 3 different packs..</li>
            <li>but then it decides to go into this high pitched mode when you least expect it, and rip the hair right out of your nose, or wherever else you may be grooming.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> To me this razor is only good for small things like eyebrows. I would recommend something bigger if you want to use it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is wonderful..I use it frequently for eyebrows..I wonder what I did before I purchased it?  great find..great price..</li>
            <li> these would be better if more powerful but still, much needed product</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the Conair Ladies 2 in 1 Fine Line Personal Trimmer that I purchased throught Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> This is good for small trimming areas but if you&#x27;re planning major landscaping, it is pretty slow. However, if you&#x27;re patient it will do the job.</li>
            <li> Bought new. Or so I thought. I took the blade off looking for the battery compartment and the back of the blade was rusted and there were hairs in it. I have contacted the sellers and hopefully I can give a little bit of a better rating if they fix this.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has lasted me over 4 years on 1 battery. It cuts close enough for what I want it to cut and it&#x27;s a slim design so it can go mostly anywhere.</li>
            <li> I use thus or my young daughter mustache she is very hairy like her mommy sad face. Quick delivery great price I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> When it arrived, it was the wrong color.&lt;br /&gt;Pink instead of silver, and it was missing the cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> It works as expected...</li>
            <li> WORKS FINE,WOULD BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> Excellent tool for everyday trimming.</li>
            <li> I bought this item, received it on time but it did not work! I tried brand new batteries from 3 different packs.. I emailed seller several different times and have failed to get a reply.. Its been a month now and since then ive had to go to walmart and buy some different trimmers. Spent the same amount on them and they even have a light attached..  Should have went to walmart to begin with.. Lesson Learned!</li>
            <li> Took forever to get and didn&#x27;t work that great.</li>
            <li> This thing hardly worked to begin with; it seemed dull, like it wasn&#x27;t really trimming...but then it decides to go into this high pitched mode when you least expect it, and rip the hair right out of your nose, or wherever else you may be grooming.  I call it high-pitched mode because that is the sound it makes - like it got super charged.  No hair or skin attached to it will be spared when this happens!  Beware.  I threw it away...it wasn&#x27;t worth losing skin over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had one I loved by Pretika, but it broke after many years and they don&#x27;t seem to make them anymore.  This one looked similar, but definitely no comparison!</li>
            <li> Works well! This is the second time I purchase  this product. My first one worked well for many years.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, but it does the job. Nice for use in all the small areas.  Can also be used to touch-up bigger areas.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this unless you don&#x27;t have any hair to shave off. I could use the other end of my toothbrush on my errant hairs and it would do the same job for free.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR AWHILE NOW AND IT STILL WORKS GREAT USE IT FOR EYBROWS MOSTLY. PRODUCT WAS EXACTLY AS IT WAS PICTURED . CAME IN FAST PROBABLY WOULD BUY ANOTHER ONE SOON BECAUSE IT DOES WORK GREAT.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stay sharp that long</li>
