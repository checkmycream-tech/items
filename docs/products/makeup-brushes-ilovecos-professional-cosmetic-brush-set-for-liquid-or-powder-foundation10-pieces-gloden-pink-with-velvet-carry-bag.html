    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>but I was very impressed.</li>
            <li>listing identifies what each brush can be used for but I think you can do what feels best for you or what you are used it.  </li>
            <li>There are 10 brushes in this set, and they all work great!  </li>
            <li>These are a wonderful addition to my kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they have been great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However,  the company did try their best with customer service, and it&#x27;s their service that earns these stars.</li>
            <li>These brushes are great!</li>
            <li>but this is probably the best brush I got for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>A very great deal!</li>

            <li>like this set for home use, for when I have the time and inclination to do a perfect face.</li>
            <li>Even the narrowest brushes exhibit ‚Äúfatter‚Äù handles, thus allowing you to apply finishing touches and still have the best grip for maximum control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I wish there were more variances in the size and shape.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m  rarely going to give a perfectly polished review and very often I don‚Äôt spell check or my dyslexia takes over..</li>

            <li>They actually do better than the one that comes with the product</li>

            <li>It makes me more mindful.</li>
            <li>love love love these brushes..</li>
            <li>I would rather see this set come out with a slotted pouch made of more durable fabric.  </li>
            <li>This brushes were great, nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>This Makeup Brush 10 Pieces Collection is fabulous!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really cute</li>
            <li>but it went away the moment I opened them , definitely will be buying more soon !!!</li>
            <li>The pink handles are fun and the cushy case is a great way to keep brushes together.</li>
            <li>If you love makeup, I think this is an excellent kit for days/nights when you want to do the whole &#x27;flawless&#x27; deal, but you&#x27;ll probably need a separate kit for small detailed eye/lip/brow brushes.</li>
            <li>If you love makeup, I think this is an excellent kit for days/nights when you want to do the whole &#x27;flawless&#x27; deal, but you&#x27;ll probably need a separate kit for small detailed eye/lip/brow brushes.</li>
            <li>Each handle has the company logo on it in gold iLovCos and comes in a nice velvet feel pink drawstring pouch which is ideal for traveling.</li>
            <li>10 brushes in the set, I think this would be good for someone just starting out with makeup and also good for travel.  </li>
            <li>They feel great when putting makeup because of how soft they are.</li>
            <li>Soft Brushes, great application, but they break away from the handles.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and feel very nice against the skin.  </li>
            <li>A couple things, be sure to air out and clean the brushes before you use them.</li>
            <li>These can easily pack away in your purse,carryon or luggage when traveling.</li>
            <li>Easy storage.</li>
            <li>but I had to wait about a week to air them out because they had a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>but the big ones do a beautiful job applying foundation.</li>
            <li>Once the smell goes away, these brushes are fine.  </li>
            <li>They get the job done if you cant dish out the money and work just fine.</li>
            <li>, so I really find I cant ever have too many eye brushes!</li>
            <li>I am amassing a huge collection of makeup brushes.  </li>
            <li>They apply evenly and are easy to clean up.  </li>
            <li>They are fabulous with stencils.</li>
            <li>The quality is great and the bristles do not shed which is a big plus for me.</li>
            <li>I am a beauty junkie, I am not afraid to admit it, and these brushes are absolutely adorable.</li>
            <li>They are light and have rather fat handles</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;re comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>Plus, all the bristles are securely attached (I didn&#x27;t see any shedding).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall a great buy</li>
            <li>Really enjoy these brushes.</li>
            <li>Working with kids, I am always n need of good soft brushes.</li>
            <li>really i will pay more and more</li>
            <li>These brushes are soft and good quality for the price of $16.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this set and recommend it to anyone who wants adorable Makeup Brushes</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s an interesting effect right there.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s an interesting effect right there.</li>
            <li>IT got it in 2 days they&#x27;re so pretty!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes are very high quality, and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I do like that the shapes on some of these brushes are unique, as they work well for contouring and creases.&lt;br</li>
            <li>think this set would be absolutely perfect as a gift or for a young girl just starting to wear makeup.  </li>
            <li>It nice to be able to by a value pack of different sizes.</li>
            <li>Love them , amazingly soft , pretty &amp; well worth the money !!!</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m loving these.</li>
            <li>The skinny brushes are only good for blending,&amp; big chubby brushes are good for foundation/concealer/bronzer.</li>
            <li>I love the wooden handles they are beautifully painted in pink with gold trim on the top.</li>
            <li>Soft nice brushes.</li>
            <li>I really really wanted to love these brushes I looked for a brush set for about a month and decided on these.</li>
            <li>These brushes are super soft with amazing coverage.</li>
            <li>The variety of brushes is great because they are really the only brushes you would need.  </li>
            <li>I assume they were packaged quickly after being made and so they do smell.  </li>
            <li>to love a product that makes your life easier and you look better at the same time!</li>
            <li>I love this brushes the quality its great really soft and easy to handle if your not a pro, they are all fluffy..</li>
            <li>This product is great to use for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Color of the pink is not as bright in person as it is on computer.</li>
            <li>The brushes have a nice wooden handle then the part holding the brush is metal.</li>
            <li>I am extremely surprised how much I like these brushes and how nice</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay if you don&#x27;t care about professional quality and just need anything to use on your face, but it&#x27;s not at all comparable to what I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li>The bristles themselves are so soft I love it.</li>
            <li>I can blend with the more fluffier brushes for an even natural finish.</li>
            <li>They are right up there with my too face brush</li>
            <li>The smaller brushes are good for quick coverage with eye shadow and there is one (in the product photo, on the far right side) that I really like for putting eye color in the crease --</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>Very soft and comfortable makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>I like this set of brushes very much</li>
            <li>They each come individually wrapped so that they are safe in shipping.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for taking the time to read my review!</li>
            <li>I bought them when they first came out</li>
            <li>I just gave it to my daughters.no biggie because they are so pretty</li>
            <li>I noticed that it&#x27;s glued with hot glue</li>
            <li>and luckily I&#x27;m able to glue them back together because I have one</li>
            <li>Pretty packaging.</li>
            <li>These cute brushes come in all different sizes and thickness.</li>
            <li>They are really pretty too</li>
            <li>At first I had no idea what they were..</li>
            <li>It seemed like they were larger and there were more than I thought.</li>
            <li>They were white tipped, so I thought they were the sparsely tipped to hold more powder..</li>
            <li>First, I did not care for the bag.  </li>
            <li>Second, as a newbie to somr of these brushes, I would love to see either a business card,</li>
            <li>The first thing that you will notice upon opening your shipment of the iLoveCos Cosmetic Brushes is their heft.</li>
            <li>So whether for yourself, a loved one, or as a professional starter set, the pink drawstring bag that holds this set will bring a smile to the recipient.</li>
            <li>I think they would also be good if you want to try your hand at contouring (something that I can&#x27;t test because my skin is too pale to make that look work); specific contouring applications are mentioned in the item description for many of the brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft to the touch !!!!</li>
            <li>which brush is which instead of digging for the right brush or dumping out the whole set from the bag.</li>
            <li>Super soft brushes!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d call this a sort of Kabuki line - the brushes are very full, on the large size, and several of them are totally flat across the top.</li>
            <li>I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how each brush is individually inscribed in gold with the company&#x27;s name &amp;#34;ILOVECOS.&amp;#34; The color of the brushes are a beautiful dark pink.</li>
            <li>They come in a nice little drawstring bag.  </li>
            <li>This set is really all you need for make up.  </li>
            <li>They are really soft, worth the buy.</li>
            <li>fast shipping as well</li>
            <li>I opted to just buy the two brushes I really needed from Make Up For Ever for $50 instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another thing is the pouch is very cheapy.</li>
            <li>I have used these for my whole face and did not have to use any additional makeup brushes besides the eyebrows.</li>
            <li>These are very lightweight and dense and picks up product and distributes it where I want it.</li>
            <li>They came in a cute pink bag.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and several brushes for different things.</li>
            <li>I bought them for myself and then went to a wedding and was helping apply makeup and had all these different size brushes available.</li>
            <li>I can say that much</li>
            <li>I have money to buy the things I really need.</li>
            <li>I can never tell looking, but it didn&#x27;t have the one type of brush I really wanted.</li>
            <li>If you like to get really involved with eyeshadows and liners, though, you&#x27;ll need another kit.</li>
            <li>If you like to get really involved with eyeshadows and liners, though, you&#x27;ll need another kit.</li>
            <li>also fast shipping..</li>
            <li>All in all, this set is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>In short, I give these 5 stars.elf, a loved one, or as a professional starter set, the pink drawstring bag that holds this set will bring a smile to the recipient.</li>
            <li>I own several brushes but needed some bigger ones.</li>
            <li>The difference is these brushes are not as densely packed with bristles and after applying foundation or concealer with them i feel the need to blend in more with my fingers or beauty blender due to streakyness.</li>
            <li>(for example, I used three different ones to apply eye shadow so I didn&#x27;t have to clean the brush between shades).  </li>
            <li>I will say it&#x27;s super soft and no shedding so far but come on</li>
            <li>is a very girly, pretty and unusual brush set that works really well for at-home use, for creating really porcelain-like facial looks.</li>
            <li>is a very girly, pretty and unusual brush set that works really well for at-home use, for creating really porcelain-like facial looks.</li>
            <li>Better than any other brush set I have!</li>
            <li>10 brushes themselves are wonderful: thickly packed in the ferrule without being too stiff, soft like bunnies, with pretty ombre tips, and nice pink wooden handles.</li>
            <li>They are mainly for blending foundation, powder, and blush.  </li>
            <li>They are Big but Super Soft!</li>
            <li>They are soft and yet very durable.  </li>
            <li>Also there are a few stray bristles, make sure you trim them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re something I use every day, plus the more I have, the less often I have to wash them!  </li>
            <li>In addition, due to the chunkiness of the grips on the brushes, they are comfortable to hold even with arthritic hands.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes just used them for the first time today and they are soft but firm and dense!!</li>
            <li>When I opened the package, I realized that the makeup brush collection came in a pink drawstring bag that reads, &amp;#34;ILOVECOS&amp;#34; and the phrase &amp;#34;ILOVECOS: To Make You Younger and More Beautiful.&amp;#34; It also has a picture of a lady on the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are a high quality synthetic, and the bag is soft and roomy drawstring.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and they have everything you need for foundation, blush and eyes.  </li>
            <li>Sturdy and soft!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no shocker because they are exactly as the photo shows, but I do want to point out that they are very similar styles.</li>
            <li>My favorite part is you can do a few things with just one brush!</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s mainly for really doing foundation, concealer, and total face coverage.</li>
            <li>often look for unique brush shapes and useful brush shapes because I find myself often not wanting to use a brush that I just put a dark color on for a light color in the same go round when doing my makeup, and so on</li>
            <li>They are very pretty and feminine with pink handles.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The largest brushes are a bit smaller than what I&#x27;m used to for applying powder foundation; however, these offer a little bit more control with respect to where you put product than kabuki-style brushes do, so they have their benefits.  </li>
            <li>I even made my husband feel them because they are so incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li>I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft these are.</li>
            <li>Fixed the problem, but would rather not have to do it.</li>
            <li>I took one out and it was so soft..</li>
            <li>its so soft you start brushing it across your cheek....</li>
            <li>I could have sat there feeling how soft it was all day...</li>
            <li>but so so soft that I don&#x27;t care...</li>
            <li>I have been using sigma bruses for quite some time and soend nearly $459 for my collection.</li>
            <li>My one and only complaint about these brushes is that when I took them out of the bag the smelled very strongly like glue/paint.  </li>
            <li>They had some loose hairs when I first took them out</li>
            <li>Makeup brushes can be pretty pricey, especially if purchased individually.  </li>
            <li>This 8 piece set comes with 4 eye brushes and 4 face brushes of varying size and shape, all of which pick up product well and fit well in my (small) hands.</li>
            <li>But other than that the brushes are very soft and work very well.</li>
            <li>These are not lightweight, cheap brushes; iLoveCos has created a product with thick handles and soft bristles to ensure both comfort and accuracy when applying makeup.</li>
            <li>The Delicate Pink Bag is nice, keeps all my brushes and fits in my purse.</li>
            <li>Other reviews talked about a chemical smell when first opening the brushes, but it didn&#x27;t seem to bother me</li>
            <li>I saw a large pink bag and was like &amp;#34;What?&amp;#34; then I pulled them out and realized they were the brushes I ordered.</li>
            <li>Brushes arrived sooner that expected which was very exiting</li>
            <li>The pink velvet drawstring case they arrive in is very</li>
            <li>you are looking for a set of makeup brushes that are well-made with WOOD handles, comfortable to grip, have soft, dense bristles, and have nearly every brush head (cut) needed, then you cannot go wrong with the iLoveCos Cosmetic Brush Set.</li>
            <li>and I normally leave reviews on the other sites as well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually very lazy with foundation and concealer, rarely contour, and barely bother with a lot of blending.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> but I was very impressed.</li>
            <li> listing identifies what each brush can be used for but I think you can do what feels best for you or what you are used it.  </li>
            <li> There are 10 brushes in this set, and they all work great!  </li>
            <li> These are a wonderful addition to my kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they have been great!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However,  the company did try their best with customer service, and it&#x27;s their service that earns these stars.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great!</li>
            <li> but this is probably the best brush I got for the price I paid.</li>

            <li> like this set for home use, for when I have the time and inclination to do a perfect face.</li>
            <li> Even the narrowest brushes exhibit ‚Äúfatter‚Äù handles, thus allowing you to apply finishing touches and still have the best grip for maximum control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very good brushes for the price I paid.</li>

            <li> I enjoyed the feel of these brushes on my face.  </li>
            <li> The video is more of an unboxing to show the product up close and share my opinions.</li>
            <li> They look really cute on my vanity too.</li>
            <li> I wish there were more variances in the size and shape.</li>
            <li> The quality is ok I would have gave it a better rating</li>
            <li> üëç I just love them üíï</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s holding it longer than most I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> This is the latest set I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m better able to put the color where I want it.  </li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  rarely going to give a perfectly polished review and very often I don‚Äôt spell check or my dyslexia takes over..</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are perfect for many different styles of makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> They actually do better than the one that comes with the product</li>
            <li> It makes me more mindful.</li>
            <li> It makes me more mindful.</li>
            <li> love love love these brushes..</li>
            <li> I would rather see this set come out with a slotted pouch made of more durable fabric.  </li>
            <li> This brushes were great, nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> This Makeup Brush 10 Pieces Collection is fabulous!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really cute</li>
            <li> but it went away the moment I opened them , definitely will be buying more soon !!!</li>
            <li> The pink handles are fun and the cushy case is a great way to keep brushes together.</li>
            <li> If you love makeup, I think this is an excellent kit for days/nights when you want to do the whole &#x27;flawless&#x27; deal, but you&#x27;ll probably need a separate kit for small detailed eye/lip/brow brushes.</li>
            <li> If you love makeup, I think this is an excellent kit for days/nights when you want to do the whole &#x27;flawless&#x27; deal, but you&#x27;ll probably need a separate kit for small detailed eye/lip/brow brushes.</li>
            <li> Each handle has the company logo on it in gold iLovCos and comes in a nice velvet feel pink drawstring pouch which is ideal for traveling.</li>
            <li> 10 brushes in the set, I think this would be good for someone just starting out with makeup and also good for travel.  </li>
            <li> They feel great when putting makeup because of how soft they are.</li>
            <li> Soft Brushes, great application, but they break away from the handles.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and feel very nice against the skin.  </li>
            <li> A couple things, be sure to air out and clean the brushes before you use them.</li>
            <li> These can easily pack away in your purse,carryon or luggage when traveling.</li>
            <li> Easy storage.</li>
            <li> but I had to wait about a week to air them out because they had a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> but the big ones do a beautiful job applying foundation.</li>
            <li> Once the smell goes away, these brushes are fine.  </li>
            <li> They get the job done if you cant dish out the money and work just fine.</li>
            <li> , so I really find I cant ever have too many eye brushes!</li>
            <li> I am amassing a huge collection of makeup brushes.  </li>
            <li> They apply evenly and are easy to clean up.  </li>
            <li> They are fabulous with stencils.</li>
            <li> The quality is great and the bristles do not shed which is a big plus for me.</li>
            <li> I am a beauty junkie, I am not afraid to admit it, and these brushes are absolutely adorable.</li>
            <li> They are light and have rather fat handles</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> Plus, all the bristles are securely attached (I didn&#x27;t see any shedding).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall a great buy</li>
            <li> Really enjoy these brushes.</li>
            <li> Working with kids, I am always n need of good soft brushes.</li>
            <li> really i will pay more and more</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft and good quality for the price of $16.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this set and recommend it to anyone who wants adorable Makeup Brushes</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s an interesting effect right there.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s an interesting effect right there.</li>
            <li> IT got it in 2 days they&#x27;re so pretty!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes are very high quality, and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I do like that the shapes on some of these brushes are unique, as they work well for contouring and creases.&lt;br</li>
            <li> think this set would be absolutely perfect as a gift or for a young girl just starting to wear makeup.  </li>
            <li> It nice to be able to by a value pack of different sizes.</li>
            <li> Love them , amazingly soft , pretty &amp; well worth the money !!!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving these.</li>
            <li> The skinny brushes are only good for blending,&amp; big chubby brushes are good for foundation/concealer/bronzer.</li>
            <li> I love the wooden handles they are beautifully painted in pink with gold trim on the top.</li>
            <li> Soft nice brushes.</li>
            <li> I really really wanted to love these brushes I looked for a brush set for about a month and decided on these.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft with amazing coverage.</li>
            <li> The variety of brushes is great because they are really the only brushes you would need.  </li>
            <li> I assume they were packaged quickly after being made and so they do smell.  </li>
            <li> to love a product that makes your life easier and you look better at the same time!</li>
            <li> I love this brushes the quality its great really soft and easy to handle if your not a pro, they are all fluffy..</li>
            <li> This product is great to use for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Color of the pink is not as bright in person as it is on computer.</li>
            <li> The brushes have a nice wooden handle then the part holding the brush is metal.</li>
            <li> I am extremely surprised how much I like these brushes and how nice</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay if you don&#x27;t care about professional quality and just need anything to use on your face, but it&#x27;s not at all comparable to what I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li> The bristles themselves are so soft I love it.</li>
            <li> I can blend with the more fluffier brushes for an even natural finish.</li>
            <li> They are right up there with my too face brush</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes are good for quick coverage with eye shadow and there is one (in the product photo, on the far right side) that I really like for putting eye color in the crease --</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> Very soft and comfortable makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I like this set of brushes very much</li>
            <li> They each come individually wrapped so that they are safe in shipping.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for taking the time to read my review!</li>
            <li> I bought them when they first came out</li>
            <li> I just gave it to my daughters.no biggie because they are so pretty</li>
            <li> I noticed that it&#x27;s glued with hot glue</li>
            <li> and luckily I&#x27;m able to glue them back together because I have one</li>
            <li> Pretty packaging.</li>
            <li> These cute brushes come in all different sizes and thickness.</li>
            <li> They are really pretty too</li>
            <li> At first I had no idea what they were..</li>
            <li> It seemed like they were larger and there were more than I thought.</li>
            <li> They were white tipped, so I thought they were the sparsely tipped to hold more powder..</li>
            <li> First, I did not care for the bag.  </li>
            <li> Second, as a newbie to somr of these brushes, I would love to see either a business card,</li>
            <li> The first thing that you will notice upon opening your shipment of the iLoveCos Cosmetic Brushes is their heft.</li>
            <li> So whether for yourself, a loved one, or as a professional starter set, the pink drawstring bag that holds this set will bring a smile to the recipient.</li>
            <li> I think they would also be good if you want to try your hand at contouring (something that I can&#x27;t test because my skin is too pale to make that look work); specific contouring applications are mentioned in the item description for many of the brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft to the touch !!!!</li>
            <li> which brush is which instead of digging for the right brush or dumping out the whole set from the bag.</li>
            <li> Super soft brushes!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d call this a sort of Kabuki line - the brushes are very full, on the large size, and several of them are totally flat across the top.</li>
            <li> I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how each brush is individually inscribed in gold with the company&#x27;s name &amp;#34;ILOVECOS.&amp;#34; The color of the brushes are a beautiful dark pink.</li>
            <li> They come in a nice little drawstring bag.  </li>
            <li> This set is really all you need for make up.  </li>
            <li> They are really soft, worth the buy.</li>
            <li> fast shipping as well</li>
            <li> I opted to just buy the two brushes I really needed from Make Up For Ever for $50 instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another thing is the pouch is very cheapy.</li>
            <li> I have used these for my whole face and did not have to use any additional makeup brushes besides the eyebrows.</li>
            <li> These are very lightweight and dense and picks up product and distributes it where I want it.</li>
            <li> They came in a cute pink bag.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and several brushes for different things.</li>
            <li> I bought them for myself and then went to a wedding and was helping apply makeup and had all these different size brushes available.</li>
            <li> I can say that much</li>
            <li> I have money to buy the things I really need.</li>
            <li> I can never tell looking, but it didn&#x27;t have the one type of brush I really wanted.</li>
            <li> If you like to get really involved with eyeshadows and liners, though, you&#x27;ll need another kit.</li>
            <li> If you like to get really involved with eyeshadows and liners, though, you&#x27;ll need another kit.</li>
            <li> also fast shipping..</li>
            <li> All in all, this set is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In short, I give these 5 stars.elf, a loved one, or as a professional starter set, the pink drawstring bag that holds this set will bring a smile to the recipient.</li>
            <li> I own several brushes but needed some bigger ones.</li>
            <li> The difference is these brushes are not as densely packed with bristles and after applying foundation or concealer with them i feel the need to blend in more with my fingers or beauty blender due to streakyness.</li>
            <li> (for example, I used three different ones to apply eye shadow so I didn&#x27;t have to clean the brush between shades).  </li>
            <li> I will say it&#x27;s super soft and no shedding so far but come on</li>
            <li> is a very girly, pretty and unusual brush set that works really well for at-home use, for creating really porcelain-like facial looks.</li>
            <li> is a very girly, pretty and unusual brush set that works really well for at-home use, for creating really porcelain-like facial looks.</li>
            <li> Better than any other brush set I have!</li>
            <li> 10 brushes themselves are wonderful: thickly packed in the ferrule without being too stiff, soft like bunnies, with pretty ombre tips, and nice pink wooden handles.</li>
            <li> They are mainly for blending foundation, powder, and blush.  </li>
            <li> They are Big but Super Soft!</li>
            <li> They are soft and yet very durable.  </li>
            <li> Also there are a few stray bristles, make sure you trim them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re something I use every day, plus the more I have, the less often I have to wash them!  </li>
            <li> In addition, due to the chunkiness of the grips on the brushes, they are comfortable to hold even with arthritic hands.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes just used them for the first time today and they are soft but firm and dense!!</li>
            <li> When I opened the package, I realized that the makeup brush collection came in a pink drawstring bag that reads, &amp;#34;ILOVECOS&amp;#34; and the phrase &amp;#34;ILOVECOS: To Make You Younger and More Beautiful.&amp;#34; It also has a picture of a lady on the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are a high quality synthetic, and the bag is soft and roomy drawstring.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and they have everything you need for foundation, blush and eyes.  </li>
            <li> Sturdy and soft!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no shocker because they are exactly as the photo shows, but I do want to point out that they are very similar styles.</li>
            <li> My favorite part is you can do a few things with just one brush!</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s mainly for really doing foundation, concealer, and total face coverage.</li>
            <li> often look for unique brush shapes and useful brush shapes because I find myself often not wanting to use a brush that I just put a dark color on for a light color in the same go round when doing my makeup, and so on</li>
            <li> They are very pretty and feminine with pink handles.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The largest brushes are a bit smaller than what I&#x27;m used to for applying powder foundation; however, these offer a little bit more control with respect to where you put product than kabuki-style brushes do, so they have their benefits.  </li>
            <li> I even made my husband feel them because they are so incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li> I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft these are.</li>
            <li> Fixed the problem, but would rather not have to do it.</li>
            <li> I took one out and it was so soft..</li>
            <li> its so soft you start brushing it across your cheek....</li>
            <li> I could have sat there feeling how soft it was all day...</li>
            <li> but so so soft that I don&#x27;t care...</li>
            <li> I have been using sigma bruses for quite some time and soend nearly $459 for my collection.</li>
            <li> My one and only complaint about these brushes is that when I took them out of the bag the smelled very strongly like glue/paint.  </li>
            <li> They had some loose hairs when I first took them out</li>
            <li> Makeup brushes can be pretty pricey, especially if purchased individually.  </li>
            <li> This 8 piece set comes with 4 eye brushes and 4 face brushes of varying size and shape, all of which pick up product well and fit well in my (small) hands.</li>
            <li> But other than that the brushes are very soft and work very well.</li>
            <li> These are not lightweight, cheap brushes; iLoveCos has created a product with thick handles and soft bristles to ensure both comfort and accuracy when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> The Delicate Pink Bag is nice, keeps all my brushes and fits in my purse.</li>
            <li> Other reviews talked about a chemical smell when first opening the brushes, but it didn&#x27;t seem to bother me</li>
            <li> I saw a large pink bag and was like &amp;#34;What?&amp;#34; then I pulled them out and realized they were the brushes I ordered.</li>
            <li> Brushes arrived sooner that expected which was very exiting</li>
            <li> The pink velvet drawstring case they arrive in is very</li>
            <li> you are looking for a set of makeup brushes that are well-made with WOOD handles, comfortable to grip, have soft, dense bristles, and have nearly every brush head (cut) needed, then you cannot go wrong with the iLoveCos Cosmetic Brush Set.</li>
            <li> and I normally leave reviews on the other sites as well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually very lazy with foundation and concealer, rarely contour, and barely bother with a lot of blending.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with my order, the brushes aren&#x27;t the same color as the picture shows and after the first use the wooden part came off of several of the brushes.</li>
            <li> You get 5 large and 5 small brushes.  </li>
            <li> These are very unusual makeup brushes, at least to me.</li>
            <li> There are rounded tip brushes, flat tip brushes, tapered tip brushes and angled tip brushes.  </li>
            <li> Flat Blending Brush</li>
            <li> There are a few I&#x27;m not totally sure what they&#x27;re for, but I&#x27;m looking forward to figuring it out and having fun with Jes√©!</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft enough to be non-irritating but stiff enough to provide control when you&#x27;re applying</li>
            <li> Otherwise, chiseled, straight, narrow, and every other type of makeup application necessity is present within the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going</li>
            <li> The tips are slightly different than I had expected.</li>
            <li> This set is so pretty and such a pleasure to use that it makes me slow down and pay attention to the process.</li>
            <li> Or just buy a few extra individual brushes and add them to the pink bag</li>
            <li> Or just buy a few extra individual brushes and add them to the pink bag</li>
            <li> The brushes seemed to work well for both loose and pressed powders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not experience any loose or &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to seeing only a few larger brushes in a kit, and tons of tiny little eyeshadow art ones.</li>
            <li> The ferrule on all of my brushes is secure and I have not experienced excessive shedding on any of my brushes.</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m a big fan of pink!!!</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are pink wood with gold ends.  </li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention, these are pink, so I won&#x27;t lose them on my vanity.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the other downside was the hairs of one of the eyeshadow brushes</li>
            <li> I bought this brush set based on reviews from other customers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also made me look up other makeup techniques than what I&#x27;m used to doing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also no lip liner brush, or anything small enough for brows.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also made me look up other makeup techniques than what I&#x27;m used to doing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also no lip liner brush, or anything small enough for brows.</li>
            <li> This is, I believe, for stippling and blending motions, rather than the sweeping motions usually used with typical American makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With this in mind, iLoveCos created a set of brushes with thick, wooden handles, which allow me to grip each brush with a minimum of discomfort.</li>
            <li> This in a little make up tote with some make up</li>
            <li> Little to no shedding.</li>
            <li> my wife was not excited but is now using them for her crafts.</li>
            <li> They are not cheap.</li>
            <li> Round Blending Brush---eye shadow and primer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;[I received this set as a review sample]h a pleasure to use that it makes me slow down and pay attention to the process.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the small ones yet</li>
            <li> Small Angled</li>
            <li> If there is any complaint involving these brushes, it has to be the lack of a truly fine-point tip.</li>
            <li> It seriously feels like silk on your face.</li>
            <li> No clawed hands or painful cramps while applying makeup; just like fat crayons for younger children, the iLoveCos Cosmetic Brushes are useable by anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, there are times when I have had difficult time reading or watching a no nonsense plain laymen&#x27;s description.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I literally just opened them up and one of them is broken.</li>
            <li> back to the comfort aspect, as someone who suffers from lupus, there are times that holding a pen and/or thin brush can be difficult if not downright impossible.</li>
            <li> Useless now.</li>
            <li> sadly the concealer brush shedded.....</li>
            <li> I was afraid that the pieces of the brush would shed and they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> But, the chemical smell was so bad i could not use them, the smell made me sick, i had to return.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very inconvenient for the people that don&#x27;t have one.</li>
            <li> They had a horrible smell.</li>

            <li> The shipping was super fast. I was able to receive my item in under one week. When I opened the package, I realized that the makeup brush collection came in a pink drawstring bag that reads, &amp;#34;ILOVECOS&amp;#34; and the phrase &amp;#34;ILOVECOS: To Make You Younger and More Beautiful.&amp;#34; It also has a picture of a lady on the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are very high quality, and very easy to use. I love how each brush is individually inscribed in gold with the company&#x27;s name &amp;#34;ILOVECOS.&amp;#34; The color of the brushes are a beautiful dark pink. This product is great to use for everyday use.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving these. I have only used them once but I was very impressed. They had some loose hairs when I first took them out but I took them off and it didn&#x27;t shed any further while applying foundation. Great buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34; That was my statement when I opened these and felt them.  I even made my husband feel them because they are so incredibly soft.  This set comes with 10 brushes.  You get 5 large and 5 small brushes.  There are rounded tip brushes, flat tip brushes, tapered tip brushes and angled tip brushes.  This set is really all you need for make up.  The brushes have a nice wooden handle then the part holding the brush is metal. I  have pulled on the metal and the wooden handle to see if they would come apart and they do not budge.  I have also pulled on the bristles and again, they did not budge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this set would be absolutely perfect as a gift or for a young girl just starting to wear makeup.  The variety of brushes is great because they are really the only brushes you would need.  They feel great when putting makeup because of how soft they are. They apply evenly and are easy to clean up.  They are very pretty and feminine with pink handles.  They come in a nice little drawstring bag.  This in a little make up tote with some make up would be such a perfect gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The listing identifies what each brush can be used for but I think you can do what feels best for you or what you are used it.  I am using more than one for eye shadow and that works for me.  My one and only complaint about these brushes is that when I took them out of the bag the smelled very strongly like glue/paint.  I assume they were packaged quickly after being made and so they do smell.  They each come individually wrapped so that they are safe in shipping.  Once the smell goes away, these brushes are fine.  I am extremely surprised how much I like these brushes and how nice they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided as a promotional sample in exchange for my evaluation and honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> There are 10 brushes in this set, and they all work great!  They are mainly for blending foundation, powder, and blush.  There are a couple for around the eye area also.  I enjoyed the feel of these brushes on my face.  They are soft and yet very durable.  They come in a soft, velvet, pink case with a drawstring.  These brushes are easy to use and I loved the convenient carrying case.  The brushes themselves are pink wood with gold ends.  I did not have any problems with the bristles falling out while I was using them.  I like this set of brushes very much and I think you will too.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:6cfb5501c415697b553f0c44eab2a979]] Fabulous brush set!! Sturdy and soft! The pink handles are fun and the cushy case is a great way to keep brushes together. A couple things, be sure to air out and clean the brushes before you use them. Also there are a few stray bristles, make sure you trim them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using these with my body/face painting. They are fabulous with stencils. Working with kids, I am always n need of good soft brushes. These are a wonderful addition to my kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the video to see the product up close and personal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure - I received this product in exchange for an honest review.

Thanks for taking the time to read my review! ***</li>
            <li> Love, love, love these brushes! I bought them when they first came out and they have been great! They are really soft, worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Very nice and sturdy brushes</li>
            <li> Super soft brushes! Good quality, smell like glue so def. Need to be washed as everybrush before use anyway... fast shipping as well</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.  They&#x27;re okay if you don&#x27;t care about professional quality and just need anything to use on your face, but it&#x27;s not at all comparable to what I&#x27;m used to.  I opted to just buy the two brushes I really needed from Make Up For Ever for $50 instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However,  the company did try their best with customer service, and it&#x27;s their service that earns these stars.</li>
            <li> The best brush and supplier he is very helpful really i will pay more and more</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft these are. They are right up there with my too face brush I looove. They look really cute on my vanity too. Bonus! It&#x27;s no shocker because they are exactly as the photo shows, but I do want to point out that they are very similar styles. I wish there were more variances in the size and shape. None of them are identical, and maybe I just don&#x27;t know which brush should be used. Another thing is the pouch is very cheapy. I just gave it to my daughters.no biggie because they are so pretty I keep them out as decor too.&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount to test and review these.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I love these products but! The skinny brushes are only good for blending,&amp; big chubby brushes are good for foundation/concealer/bronzer.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful dense brushes.I love the wooden handles they are beautifully painted in pink with gold trim on the top.The bristles themselves are so soft I love it.You get 10 makeup brushes in this set and they have what each are used for in the listing.They are perfect and work very well.I am able to give myself a flawless finish with these.I can blend with the more fluffier brushes for an even natural finish.I have used these for my whole face and did not have to use any additional makeup brushes besides the eyebrows.The quality is great and the bristles do not shed which is a big plus for me.Each handle has the company logo on it in gold iLovCos and comes in a nice velvet feel pink drawstring pouch which is ideal for traveling.These can easily pack away in your purse,carryon or luggage when traveling.These are very lightweight and dense and picks up product and distributes it where I want it.Great set!&lt;br /&gt;*Note: Sample was provided for evaluation.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with my order, the brushes aren&#x27;t the same color as the picture shows and after the first use the wooden part came off of several of the brushes. I noticed that it&#x27;s glued with hot glue and luckily I&#x27;m able to glue them back together because I have one but it&#x27;s very inconvenient for the people that don&#x27;t have one. But other than that the brushes are very soft and work very well.</li>
            <li> Bought these during Prime Day for a great price. I own several brushes but needed some bigger ones. The quality is ok I would have gave it a better rating but one of the handles unglued when I received the package.</li>
            <li> I love this brushes the quality its great really soft and easy to handle if your not a pro, they are all fluffy.. They came in a cute pink bag. Also they came in another bag and individually wrapped wich its a big thubs upüëç I just love them üíï</li>
            <li> Love them , amazingly soft , pretty &amp; well worth the money !!! The smell was nothing big , everyone just makes a big deal out of it but it went away the moment I opened them , definitely will be buying more soon !!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great!</li>
            <li> Very good brushes for the price I paid. Easy to clean and several brushes for different things. Bristles do come off with use but this is probably the best brush I got for the price I paid. It&#x27;s holding it longer than most I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I am a beauty junkie, I am not afraid to admit it, and these brushes are absolutely adorable. They are a high quality synthetic, and the bag is soft and roomy drawstring. This 8 piece set comes with 4 eye brushes and 4 face brushes of varying size and shape, all of which pick up product well and fit well in my (small) hands. The ferrule on all of my brushes is secure and I have not experienced excessive shedding on any of my brushes. I do like that the shapes on some of these brushes are unique, as they work well for contouring and creases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often look for unique brush shapes and useful brush shapes because I find myself often not wanting to use a brush that I just put a dark color on for a light color in the same go round when doing my makeup, and so on, so I really find I cant ever have too many eye brushes! Not to mention, these are pink, so I won&#x27;t lose them on my vanity.&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Pretty packaging. Very soft and comfortable makeup brushes. Little to no shedding. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I am amassing a huge collection of makeup brushes.  They&#x27;re something I use every day, plus the more I have, the less often I have to wash them!  This is the latest set I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty happy with them.  They are light and have rather fat handles so they&#x27;re comfortable to hold.  The metal part that secures the bristles is well-fastened to the handle.  Plus, all the bristles are securely attached (I didn&#x27;t see any shedding).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The largest brushes are a bit smaller than what I&#x27;m used to for applying powder foundation; however, these offer a little bit more control with respect to where you put product than kabuki-style brushes do, so they have their benefits.  The smaller brushes are good for quick coverage with eye shadow and there is one (in the product photo, on the far right side) that I really like for putting eye color in the crease -- I feel like I&#x27;m better able to put the color where I want it.  The one I used for blush was excellent -- picked up exactly the right amount of color.  The brushes seemed to work well for both loose and pressed powders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am probably not using the brushes as they were intended to be used (for example, I used three different ones to apply eye shadow so I didn&#x27;t have to clean the brush between shades).  However, I am finding that the brushes work well, regardless of what you use them for.  The bristles are soft enough to be non-irritating but stiff enough to provide control when you&#x27;re applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With 10 brushes in the set, I think this would be good for someone just starting out with makeup and also good for travel.  I think they would also be good if you want to try your hand at contouring (something that I can&#x27;t test because my skin is too pale to make that look work); specific contouring applications are mentioned in the item description for many of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.</li>
            <li> Brushes arrived sooner that expected which was very exiting but I had to wait about a week to air them out because they had a strong chemical smell. I haven&#x27;t used the small ones yet but the big ones do a beautiful job applying foundation. they don&#x27;t waist any product at all. great for someone who wears makeup every day.</li>
            <li> These are good quality brushes at an unbelievably cheap price!  They are softer than the more expensive brushes that I purchased individually and these are not shedding at all. Their handles are also heavier than the others.  I will update if, for some reason, they do not hold up well over time.</li>
            <li> LOVE Them! They are Big but Super Soft! It seriously feels like silk on your face. I have Elf, Ulta, MAC, &amp; Younique brushes but these are by far, the best! You do have to air them out &amp; give them a good wash but these are amazing! Better than any other brush set I have! I love that it came with a bag to put them in! Easy storage. I got this product for My Honest review &amp; I love Them!</li>
            <li> Soft Brushes, great application, but they break away from the handles. I&#x27;ve had to fix them all its superglue. Fixed the problem, but would rather not have to do it.</li>
            <li> Soft nice brushes. Several different shapes. A very great deal!</li>
            <li> These cute brushes come in all different sizes and thickness. They are not cheap. I was afraid that the pieces of the brush would shed and they don&#x27;t. It nice to be able to by a value pack of different sizes. One may never know when they may need a different size brush and it comes in handy.I bought them for myself and then went to a wedding and was helping apply makeup and had all these different size brushes available. The brushes are soft to the touch !!!!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes just used them for the first time today and they are soft but firm and dense!! They are really pretty too the only two downsides were that when I removed the brushes out of the packaging they had the chemical smell. However I washed them and that is gone now and the other downside was the hairs of one of the eyeshadow brushes was bent out of shape. Not a big deal because I will find a use for it!! Overall a great buy I recommend it and I even shared on Facebook and someone else has already purchase!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft I can say that much but the bristles keeps falling out</li>
            <li> very easy to clean and great with foundation</li>
            <li> LOVE IT got it in 2 days they&#x27;re so pretty!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these! And the price is even better!! Would definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> The brushes would have been great had the handles been better quality. Within 5 uses each brush has separated from the wooden handle. Useless now.</li>
            <li> This is a great selection of brushes.  The bristles are very soft and they have everything you need for foundation, blush and eyes.  There are a few I&#x27;m not totally sure what they&#x27;re for, but I&#x27;m looking forward to figuring it out and having fun with Jes√©!</li>
            <li> these were great brushes easy to use love love love them.</li>
            <li> Very nice set!! I just started exploring the world of makeup and these feel great on my skin!!! Also I&#x27;m a big fan of pink!!! So it&#x27;s a perfect combination!!!</li>
            <li> When I opened the box, I was jazzed over how big these were. At first I had no idea what they were..I saw a large pink bag and was like &amp;#34;What?&amp;#34; then I pulled them out and realized they were the brushes I ordered. It seemed like they were larger and there were more than I thought. I took one out and it was so soft.. You know the type.. You feel it with your hand and its so soft you start brushing it across your cheek....LOL.. I could have sat there feeling how soft it was all day...LOL.. The tips are slightly different than I had expected. They were white tipped, so I thought they were the sparsely tipped to hold more powder.. They are standard tipped. but so so soft that I don&#x27;t care...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER:&lt;br /&gt;MY No Nonsense Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt; I could copy the description or retell you that you have already read in the description, But you&#x27;ve already read it. I will try and tell you what I see, smell, hear, what happens, and my opinion as well as I can. So it&#x27;s easier for you decide if this is the product is suitable for the job you need it to do or for what you&#x27;re wanting to give someone. I have money to buy the things I really need. However, there are times when I have had difficult time reading or watching a no nonsense plain laymen&#x27;s description.&lt;br /&gt;As a frugal shopper that I am, I used a coupon code for this item in order to purchase and review this product. I use coupon codes that I receive before I purchase the items I use and shop on discount site regardless  and I normally leave reviews on the other sites as well.&lt;br /&gt; I have no connection to this seller and I shop for items I use in my home or give as gifts. I have never been offered anything in return and at times I give no feedback. My review is my honest opinion and experience with this item. I&#x27;m  rarely going to give a perfectly polished review and very often I don‚Äôt spell check or my dyslexia takes over.. But I will do my best to be honest with you.</li>
            <li> sadly the concealer brush shedded.....alot.....like it all came off</li>
            <li> They had a horrible smell. The smell was similar to glue and it wouldn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> I have been using sigma bruses for quite some time and soend nearly $459 for my collection. These brushes are shaped just like those. The difference is these brushes are not as densely packed with bristles and after applying foundation or concealer with them i feel the need to blend in more with my fingers or beauty blender due to streakyness. They get the job done if you cant dish out the money and work just fine.</li>
            <li> Color of the pink is not as bright in person as it is on computer.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush set based on reviews from other customers. They are great quality, better than any I have gotten in the stores like Walmart, Rite Aid, etc. Other reviews talked about a chemical smell when first opening the brushes, but it didn&#x27;t seem to bother me; I let them air out for a day and they were good to go! I love the number of brushes that come in the set! It was more than I needed! I would recommend these to others!</li>
            <li> I really really wanted to love these brushes I looked for a brush set for about a month and decided on these. I literally just opened them up and one of them is broken. I will say it&#x27;s super soft and no shedding so far but come on üòû I kinda want a refund.</li>
            <li> I can never tell looking, but it didn&#x27;t have the one type of brush I really wanted.</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes are a dream. Great for blending. Work better than brushes 10 times the money!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of these and I am blown away!&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely fantastic makeup brushes that comes with a very cute bag that I love carrying.&lt;br /&gt;These are perfect for many different styles of makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;They help you look your best by the control they give you when using these items.&lt;br /&gt;Normally i used whatever came with the makeup.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes has changed that philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;I am a big believer in makeup brushes now. They actually do better than the one that comes with the product and they last longer and do not fall off the end of the tiny sticks on eye shadows.&lt;br /&gt;Got to love a product that makes your life easier and you look better at the same time!</li>
            <li> These are very unusual makeup brushes, at least to me. I&#x27;m used to seeing only a few larger brushes in a kit, and tons of tiny little eyeshadow art ones. This kit is specific - it&#x27;s mainly for really doing foundation, concealer, and total face coverage. It&#x27;s for the full-on, flawless face look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d call this a sort of Kabuki line - the brushes are very full, on the large size, and several of them are totally flat across the top. This is, I believe, for stippling and blending motions, rather than the sweeping motions usually used with typical American makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what the Amazon blurb suggests for their use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.Round Blending Brush---Powder Foundation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.Angled Blending Brush---Foundation around nose and mouth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.Flat Blending Brush---Foundation around nose and mouth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.Tapered Contouring Brush---Conceal around eyes and nose&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.Angled Contouring Brush---Blush and Bronzer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.Small Tapered Contouring Brush---Conceal on rounded areas like the nose&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.Small Flat Blending Brush---Conceal under eyes and around your nose&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.Small Round Blending Brush---eye shadow and primer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9.Small Angled Contouring Brush---Contouring hollows of cheek and sides of the nose&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. Small Angled Blending Brush--- Stipple conceal and blemishes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notice only one of these brushes is specifically aimed at applying eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY THOUGHTS:&lt;br /&gt;The 10 brushes themselves are wonderful: thickly packed in the ferrule without being too stiff, soft like bunnies, with pretty ombre tips, and nice pink wooden handles. The handles are a good length, too. The pink velvet drawstring case they arrive in is very feminine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this set for home use, for when I have the time and inclination to do a perfect face. I&#x27;m usually very lazy with foundation and concealer, rarely contour, and barely bother with a lot of blending. This set is so pretty and such a pleasure to use that it makes me slow down and pay attention to the process. It makes me more mindful. That&#x27;s an interesting effect right there. It&#x27;s also made me look up other makeup techniques than what I&#x27;m used to doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDATION:&lt;br /&gt;This is a very girly, pretty and unusual brush set that works really well for at-home use, for creating really porcelain-like facial looks. If you like to get really involved with eyeshadows and liners, though, you&#x27;ll need another kit. There&#x27;s also no lip liner brush, or anything small enough for brows. The focus here is on foundation, concealing, blending, contouring and bronzing. If you love makeup, I think this is an excellent kit for days/nights when you want to do the whole &#x27;flawless&#x27; deal, but you&#x27;ll probably need a separate kit for small detailed eye/lip/brow brushes. Or just buy a few extra individual brushes and add them to the pink bag (there&#x27;s plenty of room).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[I received this set as a review sample]h a pleasure to use that it makes me slow down and pay attention to the process.

            <li> These are amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes works very good</li>
            <li> my wife was not excited but is now using them for her crafts.</li>
            <li> Very good quality for a fraction of the price..love love love these brushes..also fast shipping..I would recommend that you wash them before use because of the sharpie sent but that goes away...overall A+++</li>
            <li> Makeup brushes can be pretty pricey, especially if purchased individually.  It was convienient and  a great value to be able to purchase a set like this.  The brushes are well made.  The bristles are soft and feel very nice against the skin.  I did not experience any loose or &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; bristles from this set.  The handles are easy to grip and feel to be of good quality.  I would only make two recommendations to make this set a 5 start rating in my mind.  First, I did not care for the bag.  It doesnt match the quality of this set and seems like an afterthought. I would rather see this set come out with a slotted pouch made of more durable fabric.  It would be easier to see at a glance which brush is which instead of digging for the right brush or dumping out the whole set from the bag. Second, as a newbie to somr of these brushes, I would love to see either a business card, print out, email/website tip suggestion on how to use each brush.  Perhaps a name/label on the brush handle would be helpful as well.  All in all, this set is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this set with a discount for evaluation purposes.</li>
            <li> This brushes were great, nice and soft.  But, the chemical smell was so bad i could not use them, the smell made me sick, i had to return.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy these brushes. Only wish they had what each one was used for. Got a discounted price</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft with amazing coverage. Eye brushes are great and so are face brushes. My favorite part is you can do a few things with just one brush! I would definitely recommend to anyone and everyone</li>
            <li> This Makeup Brush 10 Pieces Collection is fabulous! These brushes are soft and good quality for the price of $16. I used them today to do my makeup and all I have to say is I&#x27;m sold. The brushes hold product well and get the job done. They&#x27;re really cute and I haven&#x27;t noticed shedding at all! The Delicate Pink Bag is nice, keeps all my brushes and fits in my purse. I love everything about this set and recommend it to anyone who wants adorable Makeup Brushes Set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided with a sample of this product and in return I&#x27;m offering up my honest feedback after testing and inspection. All statements and information in my reviews are comprised of my personal thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li> The first thing that you will notice upon opening your shipment of the iLoveCos Cosmetic Brushes is their heft. These are not lightweight, cheap brushes; iLoveCos has created a product with thick handles and soft bristles to ensure both comfort and accuracy when applying makeup. In addition, due to the chunkiness of the grips on the brushes, they are comfortable to hold even with arthritic hands. No clawed hands or painful cramps while applying makeup; just like fat crayons for younger children, the iLoveCos Cosmetic Brushes are useable by anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another feature of the iLoveCos Brushes (henceforth abbreviated as ILCCB) are the dense bristles used in each brush. Whether applying rouge or putting the finishing touch on your smoky eye makeup, the ILCCB set will pick up and retain enough makeup that you may only need one application, rather than having to return repeatedly to the makeup. If there is any complaint involving these brushes, it has to be the lack of a truly fine-point tip. Otherwise, chiseled, straight, narrow, and every other type of makeup application necessity is present within the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back to the comfort aspect, as someone who suffers from lupus, there are times that holding a pen and/or thin brush can be difficult if not downright impossible. With this in mind, iLoveCos created a set of brushes with thick, wooden handles, which allow me to grip each brush with a minimum of discomfort. Even the narrowest brushes exhibit ‚Äúfatter‚Äù handles, thus allowing you to apply finishing touches and still have the best grip for maximum control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Say&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a set of makeup brushes that are well-made with WOOD handles, comfortable to grip, have soft, dense bristles, and have nearly every brush head (cut) needed, then you cannot go wrong with the iLoveCos Cosmetic Brush Set. If you have difficulty grasping traditional makeup brushes, these are practically a godsend as well. So whether for yourself, a loved one, or as a professional starter set, the pink drawstring bag that holds this set will bring a smile to the recipient. In short, I give these 5 stars.elf, a loved one, or as a professional starter set, the pink drawstring bag that holds this set will bring a smile to the recipient. In short, I give these 5 stars.</li>
