            <li>Great for moisturizing your skin from head to toe!  </li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>The best moisturizer ever.  </li>
            <li>This cream is sticky; it&#x27;s gooey; it&#x27;s greasy--and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is the best moisturizing cream I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>Trust me , this is the BEST BUY.</li>

            <li>It works great!</li>
            <li>it is a very good product</li>
            <li>Eucerin is a very good face creme.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It works so good and its just amazing!</li>
            <li>Healing is a good word for it.</li>
            <li>Really good stuff.</li>
            <li>This creme provides a nice moisture barrier to protect and heal the skin.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This stuff absolutely works great.</li>
            <li>Think this is more for the face.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I feel really safe in using it.</li>
            <li>I live in the hot tropics of South Florida, and this moisterizing creme is excellent.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to use on skin especially for bedridden patient&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;tknow what I can say about this except it does a vey nice job.</li>
            <li>It is easier to smooth and use on body.  </li>
            <li>so you really have to massage it in your skin or warm it up in your hands</li>
            <li>I do not know if it will treat the problem permanently, but it helped right away to make it better.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Eucerin Original Moisturizing Creme, price is $18.99 for one 16oz container.  </li>
            <li>I DID NOT order the Eucerin Original Healing Soothing Repair Creme, price is $19.94 for TWO 16oz containers.  </li>
            <li>But what I received was one 16oz Eucerin Original Healing Soothing Repair Creme.  </li>
            <li>I WANT the 16oz Eucerin ORIGINAL MOISTURIZING CREME.  </li>
            <li>7months pregnant</li>
            <li>Eucerine is different though, its the best stuff out there with simple ingredients that don&#x27;t irritate your skin (and I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve tried several other moisturizers and thought I was satisfied, this really is superior to all of them.</li>
            <li>highly recommend Eucerin moisturizing creme (original).</li>
            <li>I recently started using it daily for my body and as always this product works great, my friend work at a store that features Lancôme, Dior, Estée Lauder...</li>
            <li>It is hard to find the original formula in the large jar, so this was a good find.</li>
            <li>I think that using a really good moisturizer to help with elasticity is the best way to fight stretch marks and this Creme is fragrance free, rich and thick, I like to use the eucerin calming cream during the day because is less thick and this one(original healing) at night time, I pile on this Creme because I am supper worried about getting stretch marks</li>
            <li>This product removes dry skin spots and makes skin very smooth when used consistently.</li>
            <li>So you&#x27;re getting a good pure product as you can get, and if you have very dry sensitive skin, can&#x27;t tolerate fragrance</li>
            <li>I certainly would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about as pure an emollient that you can buy:  </li>
            <li>It very softening and smoothing.  </li>
            <li>I suspect BB creams might be too much.</li>
            <li>I comfortable with Eucerin daily for all my need.</li>
            <li>I am a guy, I don&#x27;t look at creams or lotions much.</li>
            <li>and I want to prevent them as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>very minor, you can sleep with it easily.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt, and in 1 or 2 nights of putting this on, my skin is back to moisturized and healthy, even if it was cracked open and bleeding the night before.</li>
            <li>It helps your dry skin not to be dry any more!</li>
            <li>of this time the price is just about a buck higher than a local discount pharmacy, so if the price stays this way I will stock up on this product through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find large size locally.</li>
            <li>One draw back is that it is very greasy, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;Doctors have recommend it to friends and family, as young as infants.</li>
            <li>The item arrived timely, but what good is it for the wrong item to timely arrive?</li>
            <li>; my skin is normally dry, I feel that there&#x27;s nothing quiet like eucerin, specially now that I am</li>
            <li>My doctor told me to use this for athlete&#x27;s foot and I am also using it for the incredibly dry skin on my feet and (believe it or not) behind my ears!</li>
            <li>When I got into the medical field though, I have had to order patients many different topical thing for dry skin etc.</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s thick, yes it&#x27;s hard to spread but most importantly:  </li>
            <li>but if you have really dry sensitive skin, you know that something that works to help heal the skin is worth the minor effort it takes to spread it on the body where needed.  </li>
            <li>Very thick, fragrance free and can be used for the whole family.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed that within just five or six days my exceptionally dry skin is much, much improved</li>
            <li>I use it myself when I get home from work, and apply it lightly and it absorbs in (or washes off) slowly over the hours before bed.</li>
            <li>The cream has worked for my elderly mother who had feet that had \\&quot;cracked skin\\&quot; but also I suspect it has been the Eucerin that has helped with a more recent problem with split nails (nails form ridges and thin with consequent splitting).  </li>
            <li>I have used it nightly for 5 years to clear up dry skin on one of my knees.</li>

            <li> otherwise it&#x27;ll just sit there for a few mins or it rub off on your clothes, specially if you live in a cold area.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve had it all my life, I live in a part of the country that gets bone dry in the wintertime making dry skin worse.  </li>
            <li> There is minimal pain when the skin is that damaged, (water hurts cuts, nothing is going to not hurt one)</li>
            <li> All other products indicate that you need to avoid sun exposure because of the Alpha Hydroxy.</li>
            <li> (very hard for me to avoid direct sunlight).</li>
            <li> You can use as much or as little as needed and not have to be concerned with burning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to order again because I&#x27;m concerned that they will again just send me the cheaper item even though I ordered the more expensive item.  </li>
            <li> Her geriatric doctor recommended a heavy cream for thinning skin and Eucerin</li>
            <li> I have trouble during the colder months with my skin on my hands cracking and bleeding through the skin.</li>
            <li> ; I use it on my belly everyday to keep it hydrated.</li>
            <li> All of these lotions with all this extra stuff like tea tree oil, and calming nutrients unfortunately doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Check it out, hard to beat results.</li>
            <li> Too thick.</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> yes, it heals really bad dry skin.  </li>
            <li> And I know a thing about bad dry skin</li>
            <li> and I have bought a lot, (expensive)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s used by pharmacists as the base for prescription drugs that require a cream base to apply topically.  </li>
            <li> Artificial with the coloring apect.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use on skin especially for bedridden patient&#x27;s.  It is the best bang for price and its utility.</li>
            <li> With my oily skin I find this doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out. It very softening and smoothing.  Healing is a good word for it. I suspect BB creams might be too much. Too thick. Artificial with the coloring apect. I comfortable with Eucerin daily for all my need.</li>
            <li> I am a guy, I don&#x27;t look at creams or lotions much. When I got into the medical field though, I have had to order patients many different topical thing for dry skin etc. A basic is Eucerin cream. This year I finally picked up a tub of it to take care of my cracking hands. Washing hands and wearing glove in the hospital all day will kill the hands. This stuff absolutely works great. I use is about twice a week, but my hands are saved all week. One draw back is that it is very greasy, so if you plan to use it at night before you go to bed, you might get a pair of gloves to cover up the hands and save the pillow. I use it myself when I get home from work, and apply it lightly and it absorbs in (or washes off) slowly over the hours before bed. Check it out, hard to beat results.</li>
            <li> Great for moisturizing your skin from head to toe!  Very thick, fragrance free and can be used for the whole family.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for my baby&#x27;s chopped cheeks. This is the only product that works for us. I do not know if it will treat the problem permanently, but it helped right away to make it better.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I have used it nightly for 5 years to clear up dry skin on one of my knees.I ordered with confidence and ease from Amazon. I couldn&#x27;t find large size locally.</li>
            <li> for my face. Really good stuff. I would recommend it to all my friends. it is a very good product</li>
            <li> I ordered the Eucerin Original Moisturizing Creme, price is $18.99 for one 16oz container.  I DID NOT order the Eucerin Original Healing Soothing Repair Creme, price is $19.94 for TWO 16oz containers.  But what I received was one 16oz Eucerin Original Healing Soothing Repair Creme.  I WANT the 16oz Eucerin ORIGINAL MOISTURIZING CREME.  But since this is a third party, Amazon can only refund my money and have me return the item.  They can not have the item replaced.  I&#x27;m afraid to order again because I&#x27;m concerned that they will again just send me the cheaper item even though I ordered the more expensive item.  The item arrived timely, but what good is it for the wrong item to timely arrive?</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff I will ever use! It works so good and its just amazing! It helps your dry skin not to be dry any more!</li>
            <li> Eucerin is a very good face creme. I really don&#x27;tknow what I can say about this except it does a vey nice job.</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer ever.  wish you will export it to Israel....</li>
            <li> It was only after I read reviews on the web that I started to see Eucerin stocked in drugstores and at Kaiser, which makes a statement itself.  The cream has worked for my elderly mother who had feet that had \\&quot;cracked skin\\&quot; but also I suspect it has been the Eucerin that has helped with a more recent problem with split nails (nails form ridges and thin with consequent splitting).  Her geriatric doctor recommended a heavy cream for thinning skin and Eucerin fills the bill for everything.  A bargain, too, for what it does.</li>
            <li> I ended up ordering the lotion.  It is easier to smooth and use on body.  Think this is more for the face.</li>
            <li> This product removes dry skin spots and makes skin very smooth when used consistently. I certainly would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s thick, yes it&#x27;s hard to spread but most importantly:  yes, it heals really bad dry skin.  And I know a thing about bad dry skin, I&#x27;ve had it all my life, I live in a part of the country that gets bone dry in the wintertime making dry skin worse.  I&#x27;ve heard all the negatives about this basic Eucerin product but if you have really dry sensitive skin, you know that something that works to help heal the skin is worth the minor effort it takes to spread it on the body where needed.  Also, note:  this has no fragrance whatsoever.  It&#x27;s about as pure an emollient that you can buy:  it&#x27;s used by pharmacists as the base for prescription drugs that require a cream base to apply topically.  So you&#x27;re getting a good pure product as you can get, and if you have very dry sensitive skin, can&#x27;t tolerate fragrance, just want to heal the cracking and itching - try this.  It&#x27;s the one product I&#x27;d probably take on a desert island with me.  Seriously.  I can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t want to think about living without it.</li>
            <li> This cream is sticky; it&#x27;s gooey; it&#x27;s greasy--and it&#x27;s wonderful. Although I&#x27;ve tried several other moisturizers and thought I was satisfied, this really is superior to all of them. My doctor told me to use this for athlete&#x27;s foot and I am also using it for the incredibly dry skin on my feet and (believe it or not) behind my ears! I&#x27;m amazed that within just five or six days my exceptionally dry skin is much, much improved and I intend on sticking with Eucerin moisturizing cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find that the cream is just so gooey that it isn&#x27;t practical to use this during the day, just apply it at night before going to bed. It will still work wonders. I also like another reviewer&#x27;s idea; he writes that you could apply this to your hands and then cover them with gloves to keep the cream on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of this time the price is just about a buck higher than a local discount pharmacy, so if the price stays this way I will stock up on this product through Amazon. It&#x27;s convenient to have it delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Eucerin moisturizing creme (original). You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have trouble during the colder months with my skin on my hands cracking and bleeding through the skin. This creme provides a nice moisture barrier to protect and heal the skin.</li>
            <li> I live in the hot tropics of South Florida, and this moisterizing creme is excellent. All other products indicate that you need to avoid sun exposure because of the Alpha Hydroxy. You can use as much or as little as needed and not have to be concerned with burning. (very hard for me to avoid direct sunlight).</li>
            <li> Downside: there really is no really bad downside except that is very thick so you really have to massage it in your skin or warm it up in your hands otherwise it&#x27;ll just sit there for a few mins or it rub off on your clothes, specially if you live in a cold area.&lt;br /&gt;Doctors have recommend it to friends and family, as young as infants. That&#x27;s why I feel really safe in using it. I recently started using it daily for my body and as always this product works great, my friend work at a store that features Lancôme, Dior, Estée Lauder... and she alway making me tried a lot of different moisturizers and I have bought a lot, (expensive); my skin is normally dry, I feel that there&#x27;s nothing quiet like eucerin, specially now that I am 7months pregnant; I use it on my belly everyday to keep it hydrated. I think that using a really good moisturizer to help with elasticity is the best way to fight stretch marks and this Creme is fragrance free, rich and thick, I like to use the eucerin calming cream during the day because is less thick and this one(original healing) at night time, I pile on this Creme because I am supper worried about getting stretch marks and I want to prevent them as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizing cream I&#x27;ve ever owned. It doesn&#x27;t hurt, and in 1 or 2 nights of putting this on, my skin is back to moisturized and healthy, even if it was cracked open and bleeding the night before. There is minimal pain when the skin is that damaged, (water hurts cuts, nothing is going to not hurt one) very minor, you can sleep with it easily. All of these lotions with all this extra stuff like tea tree oil, and calming nutrients unfortunately doesn&#x27;t work. They all made my skin irritated and burn. Eucerine is different though, its the best stuff out there with simple ingredients that don&#x27;t irritate your skin (and I have sensitive skin). Trust me , this is the BEST BUY. I would recommend the plain/original Eucerine, I&#x27;ve had the best experience with it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. It is hard to find the original formula in the large jar, so this was a good find.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my stomach for itching during my pregnancy. It works great! It did however arrive with a cracked lid :(</li>
