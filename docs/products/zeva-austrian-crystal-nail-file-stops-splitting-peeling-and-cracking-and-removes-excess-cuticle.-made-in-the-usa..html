            <li>I am delighted with this file.  </li>
            <li>I bought a kit that had this file in it and to me this was the most valuable thing in the kit!</li>
            <li>Basically, I love it!</li>
            <li>I love them now!</li>
            <li>, thats how much I love it!</li>
            <li>I have been searching for something to stop my fingernails from splitting from top to bottom because of the ridges and in just one week the splitting has stopped!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>These are amazing files for rounding the edges of my nails and making them stronger.  </li>
            <li>Even the case they arrive in is a handy way to keep them.  </li>
            <li>Everyone should own one; I carry it with me at all times.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so thrilled I had to write.</li>
            <li>I own four of them and will never use an emery board again.</li>
            <li>It is night and day better than the Sassella crystal file in my opinion (and I had already liked the Sassella file.)  </li>
            <li>The seller was most courteous to me in explaining it all</li>
            <li>The texture reminds me of a very fine pumice stone, and unlike emery boards, crystal files, diamond/metal files . . .</li>
            <li>My nails are so strong and healthy!</li>
            <li>This file seems well made, I think it would be better used for polishing than filing as its a very fine grit.</li>
            <li>This a very fine file, it takes a while, I&#x27;d like one of the sides to be more course.</li>
            <li>I wish I could give this nail file more stars because I don&#x27;t think I could ever go without it</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Thanks to this great nail file which seals my nails as I file...</li>
            <li>and I wondered if a better nail file might alleviate this problem.</li>
            <li>Many guitarists use glass nail files or nail paper.  </li>
            <li>This seems to me like a more robust glass nail file.  </li>
            <li>And I love that it does not wear out.</li>
            <li>loveitloveitloveit Love.</li>
            <li>It makes doing my nails more enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Zeva Austrian Crystal nail files for years and they are wonderful and last for years.  </li>
            <li>It feels so much better</li>
            <li>My index fingers have always split and I&#x27;ve never been able to grow my nails at all.</li>
            <li>I had one of these years ago and I am so glad I now have another one.</li>
            <li>and the I don&#x27;t have to file them as often:))</li>
            <li>Your nails will be better the more you use this.</li>
            <li>However, after using this on all of my nails I can safely say that THEY ARE ALL PEELING NOW.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I googled &amp;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you can break it if you try, though.  </li>
            <li>So glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>My nails are looking much better because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to end my love affair with gel manicures and try to turn the health of my nails around.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful and will last forever.</li>
            <li>The smaller end also allows for smoothing the cuticle and seems ideally shaped for this use.    </li>
            <li>, I carry it in my shoulder bag where ever I go, my nails are longer and stronger and they don&#x27;t break as easy like they use to.</li>
            <li>It comes in a convenient case to store it in and it&#x27;s easy to get in and out.  </li>
            <li>I wear natural buffed nails and this works great to keep the edges smooth.</li>
            <li>The edges of his nails are really strong now.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best file I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Does a fine job, &amp; the durable holder protects the file.</li>
            <li>The shape and design of it are well-executed;  the material it is made of gives a smooth filing that doesn&#x27;t damage my nails.  </li>
            <li>This file results in a perfectly smooth nail tip.</li>
            <li>They do a great job of filing and smoothing nails and are easy to keep clean with a simple washing.  </li>
            <li>The ZEVA product instructions say that that it will remove the micro-cracks and it files your nails smooth.  </li>
            <li>The smooth sides could be a little rougher, but all in all it is a remarkable and ingenious product that you fall in love with.</li>
            <li>A unique product.  </li>
            <li>What I found is that the reason the glass file is supposed to be better is because it has a higher grit level</li>
            <li>I am especially delighted with its extra function of being able to smooth out cuticles and rough skin with its tip, like an eraser - a skin eraser, if you like!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really is true that it is more gentle on your nails and even cuticles.  </li>
            <li>But, once I&#x27;d gotten used to its unique texture I am getting to like it very much!</li>
            <li>Really helps my nails look better.</li>
            <li>The order arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when using the crystal file is how smooth the edges of my nails feel.</li>
            <li>Other than that, my skin gets very dry around the nail, and this file works great to smooth it out in preparation for a nice lotioning.</li>
            <li>What I can say is that there is a definite change for the better!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve tried nearly every type of nail file out there, but I have never used anything like my Zeva!!  </li>
            <li>I have tried lots of different nail files and this one is amazing.  </li>
            <li>B00283O7LK Sassella Crystal Glass Nail File, 5.5 Inches, Free Carrying Case]] and thought it was much better than prior files;</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth the $$.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I love that you don&#x27;t have to file your nails in only one direction and that it makes the edges ribbon smooth.  </li>
            <li>The file comes in a plastic case, which is nice and makes it easy to find (if you&#x27;re like me and maintain an organized mess).</li>
            <li>Strange to say that I didn&#x27;t expect it to be really that good</li>
            <li>lasts forever, looks cool, easy to slip into handbag) and the Zeva Austrian Crystal Nail File (cool material, healing for nails, great for cuticle erasing) - so the ultimate nail file would be superthin, lasts forever, looks cool with unique material, and has a filing surface right to the edges (ie no blank surface on the edge which makes it a pain to file in tight corners</li>
            <li>Since I started using the Zeva french manicure nail polish at the same time as the Zeva file, maybe both contributed to the great improvement in my nails.  </li>
            <li>Especially its description of how it&#x27;s made with a superheated porcelain compound with aluminum oxide (Austrian crystal) suspended in the porcelain in crystalline form, then ground by hand until very smooth, and how it helps to progressively repair your nails and make them stronger and smoother with continued use.</li>
            <li>I first tried [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>My first one was given to me</li>
            <li>I love that you can use it to push back your cuticles and shave them off too, without a cuticle clipper.</li>
            <li>Have been using my first one for months.</li>
            <li>When I first got this file, I gave it a three star rating.  </li>
            <li>This file does exactly what is advertised.  </li>
            <li>The tips of my nails actually feel better.</li>
            <li>They are healthy and all the same length.</li>
            <li>I bought my first one at the Mall of America, after getting a demo from the gal at a Zeva kiosk.</li>
            <li>At first my nail flourished but by the end of 2013 my nails were splitting, peeling and cracking.</li>
            <li>However, I am going to persist and if I find I can give a better rating, I will come back and do so.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I lost mine a few years ago and searched for a good replacement for it, but nothing comes close.  </li>
            <li>positive is that is easier to use at the side of the nails, and perhaps that is what I will use the glass file for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But my nails are no longer separating and are growing long and healthy again.      </li>
            <li>I will be quiting the Protandum because of the cost so then the real results will be evident.</li>
            <li>I wore solar and gel nails for a long time and am trying to get my nails healthy again.</li>
            <li>I have used a ceramic file in the past and loved it</li>
            <li>I needed something that was gentle to my nails because I often am not.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend Zeva products to everyone.</li>
            <li>It really does seal the nail.</li>
            <li>If you read about this file, you will see that whoever created this file really understands nails because I learned so much from that information.</li>
            <li>Using as directed in the detailed instructions that came with the file, I removed the cuticle skin that was adhered to the nail and pushed back the cuticles with ease.</li>
            <li>This product is very helpful for splitting, aging nails.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it good for filing nails, but it is also fantastic for buffing rough pieces of skin around nails: it can reach places other files can&#x27;t because the entire item is a file--sides, top and bottom.</li>
            <li>I recently replaced my original Zeva file...</li>
            <li>The file works better than any other file I have used.  </li>
            <li>It has a different grade file level on each end; the smaller side provides smoother finishing than the larger side, but I mostly use the larger side since it is just about perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I so thrilled to finally found this after looking for so long.</li>
            <li>My nails have been chipping and peeling as I have gotten older.</li>
            <li>I was stuck using Nail Envy which you may know is high maintenance.</li>
            <li>Multi-purpose product that is gentle on soft, brittle nails.</li>
            <li>It does not look like any nail file you have ever seen, but I wasn&#x27;t surprised, thanks to the photos and description on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Alas, they are in good shape.</li>
            <li>Since I have been following the instructions exactly, the nicks have disappeared.  </li>
            <li>My husband does not usual like or use nail files.  </li>
            <li>They work fine but didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>Beats glass by far and keeps nails from splitting.  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t break, though it wasn&#x27;t a far fall.</li>
            <li>I carry one in my purse and have one near \\&quot;my chair\\&quot; at home.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think a file could really be that different, but it is.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy, and has survived floating around in my purse for the last couple of years.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little time and patience, but it is worth it!</li>
            <li>and you can get the same thing with a regular file that has a higher grit level.</li>
            <li>The other reviewers were right.  </li>
            <li>I got exactly what I expected in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>I have only used my new Zeva file once</li>
            <li>When no other nail file seemed to work for me</li>
            <li>- this is the major drawback of the diamancel).</li>
            <li>The only natural nail care kit out there that is reusable and lasts.</li>
            <li>I am a massage therapist and need short and soft nails.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I just give up and go back to my old file.</li>
            <li>I do my nails every Sunday and post them on the social media.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure that was not good!)</li>
            <li>The file is useful for getting rid of the occasional loose piece of dry cuticle without using nippers and as the last edge smoothing step after shaping with a different file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first saw it, I was surprised at how thick it was, so I won&#x27;t be carrying it around in my handbag.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for the kit but was kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li>Hard to try something new with this high price I know,</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My nails are looking much better because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to end my love affair with gel manicures and try to turn the health of my nails around.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful and will last forever.</li>
            <li> The smaller end also allows for smoothing the cuticle and seems ideally shaped for this use.    </li>
            <li> , I carry it in my shoulder bag where ever I go, my nails are longer and stronger and they don&#x27;t break as easy like they use to.</li>
            <li> It comes in a convenient case to store it in and it&#x27;s easy to get in and out.  </li>
            <li> I wear natural buffed nails and this works great to keep the edges smooth.</li>
            <li> The edges of his nails are really strong now.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best file I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Does a fine job, &amp; the durable holder protects the file.</li>
            <li> The shape and design of it are well-executed;  the material it is made of gives a smooth filing that doesn&#x27;t damage my nails.  </li>
            <li> This file results in a perfectly smooth nail tip.</li>
            <li> They do a great job of filing and smoothing nails and are easy to keep clean with a simple washing.  </li>
            <li> The ZEVA product instructions say that that it will remove the micro-cracks and it files your nails smooth.  </li>
            <li> The smooth sides could be a little rougher, but all in all it is a remarkable and ingenious product that you fall in love with.</li>
            <li> A unique product.  </li>
            <li> What I found is that the reason the glass file is supposed to be better is because it has a higher grit level</li>
            <li> I am especially delighted with its extra function of being able to smooth out cuticles and rough skin with its tip, like an eraser - a skin eraser, if you like!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really is true that it is more gentle on your nails and even cuticles.  </li>
            <li> But, once I&#x27;d gotten used to its unique texture I am getting to like it very much!</li>
            <li> Really helps my nails look better.</li>
            <li> The order arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when using the crystal file is how smooth the edges of my nails feel.</li>
            <li> Other than that, my skin gets very dry around the nail, and this file works great to smooth it out in preparation for a nice lotioning.</li>
            <li> What I can say is that there is a definite change for the better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve tried nearly every type of nail file out there, but I have never used anything like my Zeva!!  </li>
            <li> I have tried lots of different nail files and this one is amazing.  </li>
            <li> B00283O7LK Sassella Crystal Glass Nail File, 5.5 Inches, Free Carrying Case]] and thought it was much better than prior files;</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth the $$.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I love that you don&#x27;t have to file your nails in only one direction and that it makes the edges ribbon smooth.  </li>
            <li> The file comes in a plastic case, which is nice and makes it easy to find (if you&#x27;re like me and maintain an organized mess).</li>
            <li> Strange to say that I didn&#x27;t expect it to be really that good</li>
            <li> lasts forever, looks cool, easy to slip into handbag) and the Zeva Austrian Crystal Nail File (cool material, healing for nails, great for cuticle erasing) - so the ultimate nail file would be superthin, lasts forever, looks cool with unique material, and has a filing surface right to the edges (ie no blank surface on the edge which makes it a pain to file in tight corners</li>
            <li> Since I started using the Zeva french manicure nail polish at the same time as the Zeva file, maybe both contributed to the great improvement in my nails.  </li>
            <li> Especially its description of how it&#x27;s made with a superheated porcelain compound with aluminum oxide (Austrian crystal) suspended in the porcelain in crystalline form, then ground by hand until very smooth, and how it helps to progressively repair your nails and make them stronger and smoother with continued use.</li>
            <li> I first tried [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> My first one was given to me</li>
            <li> I love that you can use it to push back your cuticles and shave them off too, without a cuticle clipper.</li>
            <li> Have been using my first one for months.</li>
            <li> When I first got this file, I gave it a three star rating.  </li>
            <li> This file does exactly what is advertised.  </li>
            <li> The tips of my nails actually feel better.</li>
            <li> They are healthy and all the same length.</li>
            <li> I bought my first one at the Mall of America, after getting a demo from the gal at a Zeva kiosk.</li>
            <li> At first my nail flourished but by the end of 2013 my nails were splitting, peeling and cracking.</li>
            <li> However, I am going to persist and if I find I can give a better rating, I will come back and do so.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I lost mine a few years ago and searched for a good replacement for it, but nothing comes close.  </li>
            <li> positive is that is easier to use at the side of the nails, and perhaps that is what I will use the glass file for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But my nails are no longer separating and are growing long and healthy again.      </li>
            <li> I will be quiting the Protandum because of the cost so then the real results will be evident.</li>
            <li> I wore solar and gel nails for a long time and am trying to get my nails healthy again.</li>
            <li> I have used a ceramic file in the past and loved it</li>
            <li> I needed something that was gentle to my nails because I often am not.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend Zeva products to everyone.</li>
            <li> It really does seal the nail.</li>
            <li> If you read about this file, you will see that whoever created this file really understands nails because I learned so much from that information.</li>
            <li> Using as directed in the detailed instructions that came with the file, I removed the cuticle skin that was adhered to the nail and pushed back the cuticles with ease.</li>
            <li> This product is very helpful for splitting, aging nails.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it good for filing nails, but it is also fantastic for buffing rough pieces of skin around nails: it can reach places other files can&#x27;t because the entire item is a file--sides, top and bottom.</li>
            <li> I recently replaced my original Zeva file...</li>
            <li> The file works better than any other file I have used.  </li>
            <li> It has a different grade file level on each end; the smaller side provides smoother finishing than the larger side, but I mostly use the larger side since it is just about perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I so thrilled to finally found this after looking for so long.</li>
            <li> My nails have been chipping and peeling as I have gotten older.</li>
            <li> I was stuck using Nail Envy which you may know is high maintenance.</li>
            <li> Multi-purpose product that is gentle on soft, brittle nails.</li>
            <li> It does not look like any nail file you have ever seen, but I wasn&#x27;t surprised, thanks to the photos and description on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Alas, they are in good shape.</li>
            <li> Since I have been following the instructions exactly, the nicks have disappeared.  </li>
            <li> My husband does not usual like or use nail files.  </li>
            <li> They work fine but didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Beats glass by far and keeps nails from splitting.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t break, though it wasn&#x27;t a far fall.</li>
            <li> I carry one in my purse and have one near \\&quot;my chair\\&quot; at home.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think a file could really be that different, but it is.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy, and has survived floating around in my purse for the last couple of years.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little time and patience, but it is worth it!</li>
            <li> and you can get the same thing with a regular file that has a higher grit level.</li>
            <li> The other reviewers were right.  </li>
            <li> I got exactly what I expected in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I have only used my new Zeva file once</li>
            <li> When no other nail file seemed to work for me</li>
            <li> - this is the major drawback of the diamancel).</li>
            <li> The only natural nail care kit out there that is reusable and lasts.</li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist and need short and soft nails.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I just give up and go back to my old file.</li>
            <li> I do my nails every Sunday and post them on the social media.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure that was not good!)</li>
            <li> The file is useful for getting rid of the occasional loose piece of dry cuticle without using nippers and as the last edge smoothing step after shaping with a different file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first saw it, I was surprised at how thick it was, so I won&#x27;t be carrying it around in my handbag.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for the kit but was kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hard to try something new with this high price I know,</li>
            <li> I was looking to buy a second diamancel nail file (that&#x27;s great too, with its very thin profile, light flexible metal and infinitely lasting and reusable quality - only drawback is the small border without the filing surface which makes it hard to get to the tight spots on corners of your nails), and I came across this product which intrigued me, so I ordered it to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> issue with it is the broad sides of the file are too smooth and therefore, useless because they don&#x27;t file away anything.  </li>
            <li> A selling point for me was also how long these files last.  </li>
            <li> If you use it frequently enough (daily, or every other day or so), you won&#x27;t need to trim either.  </li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ve never had them this long....</li>
            <li> Then I carefully filed each brittle nail, and will continue to do so daily for a week as directed until my nails are stronger.</li>
            <li> cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen only minimal reduction in peeling from using this file.  </li>
            <li> I expect this will last quite a long time due to its thickness.</li>
            <li> No flakey nail mess while filing and no rough edges.</li>
            <li> I am just going to finally get another one for my other purse.</li>
            <li> I can saw back &amp; forth at my fragile nails to my little heart&#x27;s content.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other type of file on my nails, and people constantly think my nails are artifical.</li>
            <li> Giving it an original three stars was unfair since it was my fault.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other crystal file products thinking it should be the same.</li>
            <li> My nails were peeling and separating before they could grow very long</li>
            <li> You can use a broad or narrow side depending on your preference or nail size/length.  </li>
            <li> I just bought this new one because I misplaced the longer half, which was easier to handle.</li>
            <li> , I bought myself a spare and gave a few others as stocking stuffers last year.  </li>
            <li> Even my 2 prior crystal files pale in comparison.  </li>
            <li> you can just &amp;#34;file&amp;#34; off your dry cuticles and all the dry skin around your nails with it - no more clipping dry cuticles!</li>
            <li> Then I looked into the Zeva nail system and was convinced by other reviews to try it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other glass filings files that were a coating on plastic.</li>
            <li> and I will not hesitate to buy other products from this seller.  </li>
            <li> I was intrigued  by other  people&#x27;s reviews</li>
            <li> I use the narrow sides of the file for smoothing and the edges for dry</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sold on the thick ceramic format of the Zeva, but it was the only type of file not in my collection...  </li>
            <li> Another plus is that you can sand down and seal up hang nails and overgrown cuticles.</li>
            <li> very foreign to me.  </li>
            <li> Since using this, I&#x27;ve had considerably less breaks/cracks/splits.  </li>
            <li> I recently gave up salon gel manicures and was left with my old thin fragile nails and stubborn dry cuticle skin that seems to grow up my nails in a thin layer and was impossible for me to remove.</li>
            <li> No more careful one-direction nonsense and still no peeling!  </li>
            <li> It takes a little longer to file because it dusts the tip of the nail.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday, sometimes twice a day.</li>
            <li> In my case the nicks would eventually destroy my nails.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble with a thumb that always peels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine for about a month, carefully following the instructions provided, and not one broken nail.</li>
            <li> I thought I was probably stupid to purchase a file for $15, but now I see they are WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> Anytime I use the Sassella, which I keep as a backup file in my purse, it feels a little clumsy in comparison.</li>
            <li> no more layers.  </li>
            <li> Nothing I&#x27;ve used in the past has worked as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick ceramic miracle-ness also buffs away the dead skin around your nails - just rest it against your skin as you</li>
            <li> No more snags.</li>
            <li> No more layering.</li>
            <li> No more nail hardeners, you just need this file.</li>
            <li> Using this file wrong was not to my benefit, obviously.  </li>
            <li> File lightly &amp; no more than 40 seconds to do all nails.</li>
            <li> Add to your manicure routine, no more buying nail files.</li>
            <li> Never gets dull.</li>
            <li> after at least 10 years of use!</li>
            <li> I am very hard on my hands whether doing things around the house or craft projects.  </li>
            <li> My thin nails flake &amp; chip All.</li>
            <li> I swear my nails got worse.</li>
            <li> Filing made them worse.</li>
            <li> Even with an equally expensive glass file.  </li>
            <li> After talking I discovered that I was using the file wrong.  </li>
            <li> If you have problem nails you cannot go wrong with this file.  </li>
            <li> I find the file uncomfortable to hold and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I gave Quimica a bad review months ago</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with Zeva&#x27;s Ridgefiller base coat and Cuticle Oil pen.</li>
            <li> I have two of these nail files and would hate to be without them.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> You will never need another file! Beats glass by far and keeps nails from splitting.  You can file in any direction.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this nail file more stars because I don&#x27;t think I could ever go without it, I carry it in my shoulder bag where ever I go, my nails are longer and stronger and they don&#x27;t break as easy like they use to. I love it and I would recommend it for ever and ever!</li>
            <li> When no other nail file seemed to work for me I purchased a Zeva Austrian Crystal Nail File.   I often work in my garden and wooded area and use leather gloves to protect my hands. My nails were always splitting and tearing and would separate into layers.  Thanks to this great nail file which seals my nails as I file...no more layers.  I also use a Zeva cuticle oil pen and together, with the nail file, my nails have improved 100%.  Zeva has great products for excellent nail care.</li>
            <li> This is the file that will not cause damage to my nails and actually helps them.  I needed something that was gentle to my nails because I often am not.  So I need all the help I can get.</li>
            <li> My nails were peeling and separating before they could grow very long and I wondered if a better nail file might alleviate this problem. I first tried [[ASIN:B00283O7LK Sassella Crystal Glass Nail File, 5.5 Inches, Free Carrying Case]] and thought it was much better than prior files; yet my problem wasn&#x27;t solved.     Then I looked into the Zeva nail system and was convinced by other reviews to try it.  I bought a kit that had this file in it and to me this was the most valuable thing in the kit! It is night and day better than the Sassella crystal file in my opinion (and I had already liked the Sassella file.)  Since I started using the Zeva french manicure nail polish at the same time as the Zeva file, maybe both contributed to the great improvement in my nails.  But my nails are no longer separating and are growing long and healthy again.      This file is a pleasure to use.  The shape and design of it are well-executed;  the material it is made of gives a smooth filing that doesn&#x27;t damage my nails.  Anytime I use the Sassella, which I keep as a backup file in my purse, it feels a little clumsy in comparison. At home I always use the Zeva file.  It has a different grade file level on each end; the smaller side provides smoother finishing than the larger side, but I mostly use the larger side since it is just about perfect for everyday use. The smaller end also allows for smoothing the cuticle and seems ideally shaped for this use.    I have dropped the Zeva file and it didn&#x27;t break, though it wasn&#x27;t a far fall. It comes in a convenient case to store it in and it&#x27;s easy to get in and out.  It&#x27;s a great nail file.  Basically, I love it!</li>
            <li> This file works well, and I like that you can wash it and that it seems that it will last forever. My first one was given to me but I dropped it and it broke. It didn&#x27;t shatter or anything. I just bought this new one because I misplaced the longer half, which was easier to handle. The file comes in a plastic case, which is nice and makes it easy to find (if you&#x27;re like me and maintain an organized mess). Other than that, my skin gets very dry around the nail, and this file works great to smooth it out in preparation for a nice lotioning.</li>
            <li> Many guitarists use glass nail files or nail paper.  This seems to me like a more robust glass nail file.  I use it daily and it&#x27;s worth the $$.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading reviews. My nails have been chipping and peeling as I have gotten older. This file, when used as directed, seems to seal the edges of my nails and minimizes the chipping and especially the peeling. I use it in combination with Zeva&#x27;s Ridgefiller base coat and Cuticle Oil pen. Nothing I&#x27;ve used in the past has worked as well. Another plus is that you can sand down and seal up hang nails and overgrown cuticles. And I love that it does not wear out. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> What can I say except &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34;!  The other reviewers were right.  This is hands down the best file I have ever used.  Even my 2 prior crystal files pale in comparison.  I will definitely purchase another.  It shapes and smooths my nails without leaving snags.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since 1999.  Absolutely recommend Zeva products to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this for years.It had a different name but it is the same. The only natural nail care kit out there that is reusable and lasts.It&#x27;s the best file there is. I so thrilled to finally found this after looking for so long.</li>
            <li> I have finally got my flaky nails under control. They are not as prone to breaking or splitting. It takes a little time and patience, but it is worth it!</li>
            <li> This file is amazing! I have had one for 15 years and it still works so well!!!! Use it all the time. I am just going to finally get another one for my other purse. I love that you can use it to push back your cuticles and shave them off too, without a cuticle clipper. No flakey nail mess while filing and no rough edges. When I bought one 15 years ago I thought I was probably stupid to purchase a file for $15, but now I see they are WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> My thin nails flake &amp; chip All. The. Time.  Even with an equally expensive glass file.  I wasn&#x27;t sold on the thick ceramic format of the Zeva, but it was the only type of file not in my collection...  This file is LIFE CHANGING! loveitloveitloveit Love. It.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know how all those snobby/pretty nail files promise to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; the nail edge?  Well this ugly/gray Zeva file actually DOES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can saw back &amp; forth at my fragile nails to my little heart&#x27;s content.  No more careful one-direction nonsense and still no peeling!  Woo!  It&#x27;s thick ceramic miracle-ness also buffs away the dead skin around your nails - just rest it against your skin as you file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails have never looked so good!</li>
            <li> Strange to say that I didn&#x27;t expect it to be really that good but it is.  It really is true that it is more gentle on your nails and even cuticles.  It makes doing my nails more enjoyable.  My nails used to split all the time and now they just seem to be stronger.  I know I&#x27;ve never had them this long....very foreign to me.  Would definitely recommend.  Hard to try something new with this high price I know, but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> This file seems well made, I think it would be better used for polishing than filing as its a very fine grit.</li>
            <li> This file results in a perfectly smooth nail tip. I&#x27;ve tried other glass filings files that were a coating on plastic. They work fine but didn&#x27;t last very long. I expect this will last quite a long time due to its thickness.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the price. This is my second one. I do my nails every Sunday and post them on the social media. Have been using my first one for months. Would recommend. Great file.</li>
            <li> I have two of these nail files and would hate to be without them.  I carry one in my purse and have one near \\&quot;my chair\\&quot; at home.  They do a great job of filing and smoothing nails and are easy to keep clean with a simple washing.  Even the case they arrive in is a handy way to keep them.  Great product.</li>
            <li> The best way to shape your nails! No more snags. No more layering. Helps seal the edges. I won&#x27;t use any other type of file on my nails, and people constantly think my nails are artifical.</li>
            <li> This a very fine file, it takes a while, I&#x27;d like one of the sides to be more course.</li>
            <li> Does a fine job, &amp; the durable holder protects the file.</li>
            <li> A unique product.  Everyone should own one; I carry it with me at all times.  The smooth sides could be a little rougher, but all in all it is a remarkable and ingenious product that you fall in love with.</li>
            <li> I just received this today and haven&#x27;t tried it as yet, but it sounds like it will be awesome  : )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Zeva Austrian Crystal nail files for years and they are wonderful and last for years.  Definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> It really does seal the nail. It feels so much better that I keep looking for something to file. Alas, they are in good shape. Totally worth it. I didn&#x27;t think a file could really be that different, but it is.</li>
            <li> I swear my nails got worse.</li>
            <li> Multi-purpose product that is gentle on soft, brittle nails. It&#x27;s a keeper. I take it with me everywhere I go.</li>
            <li> It works wonders! My index fingers have always split and I&#x27;ve never been able to grow my nails at all. I love them now!</li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist and need short and soft nails. This file has been doing me well for 8 years until it dropped and broke so I bought another, thats how much I love it!</li>
            <li> Helps nails grow longer and stronger</li>
            <li> Best file I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> This file is awesome. Takes a while to get used it but it can reach your nail at every angle. I use this everyday, sometimes twice a day. It doesn&#x27;t harm your nails and I even use it while I had gel polish on. My nails are so strong and healthy! No more nail hardeners, you just need this file. If you read about this file, you will see that whoever created this file really understands nails because I learned so much from that information. I have three that I use: one by my bed that I use every night before I go to sleep, one in my purse, and one in my manicure kit. Trust me, you won&#x27;t regret buying this!</li>
            <li> I had one of these years ago and I am so glad I now have another one. I find that my nails are looking healthier and do not split &amp; break like they use to and the I don&#x27;t have to file them as often:))</li>
            <li> When I first got this file, I gave it a three star rating.  When the seller saw my review they immediately contacted me.  After talking I discovered that I was using the file wrong.  I have several nicks on my nails that just won&#x27;t go away.  In my case the nicks would eventually destroy my nails.  Using this file wrong was not to my benefit, obviously.  I was using it just whenever and the nicks would not seal.  The seller explained that I needed to use it on all ten nails every night for a total of about 40-50 seconds. Since I have been following the instructions exactly, the nicks have disappeared.  Giving it an original three stars was unfair since it was my fault.  The seller was most courteous to me in explaining it all and I will not hesitate to buy other products from this seller.  This file does exactly what is advertised.  If you have problem nails you cannot go wrong with this file.  THANK YOU Zeva Nails for taking the time to care and for a product that takes care of an issue I have had for years !!!!!</li>
            <li> This was not what I thought</li>
            <li> This file does a great job! I have been searching for something to stop my fingernails from splitting from top to bottom because of the ridges and in just one week the splitting has stopped! I use the file every morning just like the instructions say for 30 to 40 seconds to buff the tip of each nail and I can&#x27;t believe it has worked so well!</li>
            <li> This is the second crystal file I&#x27;ve purchased. I didn&#x27;t believe that just filing my nails would allow me to grow linger, healthier nails. I was stuck using Nail Envy which you may know is high maintenance. The first thing I noticed when using the crystal file is how smooth the edges of my nails feel. It takes a little longer to file because it dusts the tip of the nail. No jagged or torn edges. You will feel the difference. The tips of my nails actually feel better. Within a week my nails were noticeably lengthening. They are healthy and all the same length. I can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> Really good nail file.  Never gets dull.</li>
            <li> Awesome file. Your nails will be better the more you use this.</li>
            <li> I got one of these files over 10 years ago, and I found it to be the easiest-to-use, longest-lasting file I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I love that you don&#x27;t have to file your nails in only one direction and that it makes the edges ribbon smooth.  I lost mine a few years ago and searched for a good replacement for it, but nothing comes close.  I&#x27;m so happy that to find the files online.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with a thumb that always peels. I bought this based on the good reviews. However, after using this on all of my nails I can safely say that THEY ARE ALL PEELING NOW. Wish I had returned it.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued  by other  people&#x27;s reviews so I bought one.  I am glad I did.  I have tried lots of different nail files and this one is amazing.  I am very hard on my hands whether doing things around the house or craft projects.  The ZEVA product instructions say that that it will remove the micro-cracks and it files your nails smooth.  I have seen no nicks on my nails since I have started to use the Zeva nail file.  A selling point for me was also how long these files last.  I had read from customers  that the nail file had lasted 13 years and were just now looking to replace it.  Very happy with the purchase.  My husband does not usual like or use nail files.  He tried this and was impressed on how it makes the end of his nails smooth.  The edges of his nails are really strong now.</li>
            <li> These are amazing files for rounding the edges of my nails and making them stronger.  I consider this file a crucial part of my nail care routine and have used since I discovered it some years ago.  I use give these files as gifts for my close friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I googled &amp;#34;best nail files&amp;#34; and discovered the Zeva Austrian Crystal nail file. I had no idea it existed. I recently gave up salon gel manicures and was left with my old thin fragile nails and stubborn dry cuticle skin that seems to grow up my nails in a thin layer and was impossible for me to remove. (My nail tech used a dremel to remove it and I&#x27;m sure that was not good!) I have only used my new Zeva file once but I&#x27;m so thrilled I had to write. Using as directed in the detailed instructions that came with the file, I removed the cuticle skin that was adhered to the nail and pushed back the cuticles with ease. Then I carefully filed each brittle nail, and will continue to do so daily for a week as directed until my nails are stronger. It does not look like any nail file you have ever seen, but I wasn&#x27;t surprised, thanks to the photos and description on Amazon. Thank you Zeva, for a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve tried nearly every type of nail file out there, but I have never used anything like my Zeva!!  The texture reminds me of a very fine pumice stone, and unlike emery boards, crystal files, diamond/metal files . . . it has another dimension.  You can use a broad or narrow side depending on your preference or nail size/length.  Since using this, I&#x27;ve had considerably less breaks/cracks/splits.  If you use it frequently enough (daily, or every other day or so), you won&#x27;t need to trim either.  It is very sturdy, and has survived floating around in my purse for the last couple of years.  I&#x27;m sure you can break it if you try, though.  I was so happy with it, I bought myself a spare and gave a few others as stocking stuffers last year.  The recipients love them too!!!</li>
            <li> The file is useful for getting rid of the occasional loose piece of dry cuticle without using nippers and as the last edge smoothing step after shaping with a different file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issue with it is the broad sides of the file are too smooth and therefore, useless because they don&#x27;t file away anything.  I use the narrow sides of the file for smoothing and the edges for dry cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen only minimal reduction in peeling from using this file.  It still gets my nails smoother than glass files, but not enough to consider it a holy grail product.</li>
            <li> This product is very helpful for splitting, aging nails.  Eliminates the constant snagging on your clothes. So glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Love this. Use it on everyone in my family. Cuticles, and tips.</li>
            <li> Love it! This is the only nail file I will use. I own four of them and will never use an emery board again.</li>
            <li> Zeva might finally be the answer to stop my nails from peeling, splitting, breaking. I literally have never had nails. Tried everything. Filing made them worse. But I see a difference after using this file for a week. File lightly &amp; no more than 40 seconds to do all nails. Zeva file with Quimica Hardener seems to be the answer to fixing decades of nubby nails. I gave Quimica a bad review months ago cause it hurt my nail beds. But it was my fault for overusing. Zeva file daily + Quimica weekly is strengthening my nails. They look whiter. Still short but getting there.</li>
            <li> I was looking to buy a second diamancel nail file (that&#x27;s great too, with its very thin profile, light flexible metal and infinitely lasting and reusable quality - only drawback is the small border without the filing surface which makes it hard to get to the tight spots on corners of your nails), and I came across this product which intrigued me, so I ordered it to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first saw it, I was surprised at how thick it was, so I won&#x27;t be carrying it around in my handbag. But, once I&#x27;d gotten used to its unique texture I am getting to like it very much! Especially its description of how it&#x27;s made with a superheated porcelain compound with aluminum oxide (Austrian crystal) suspended in the porcelain in crystalline form, then ground by hand until very smooth, and how it helps to progressively repair your nails and make them stronger and smoother with continued use. I am especially delighted with its extra function of being able to smooth out cuticles and rough skin with its tip, like an eraser - a skin eraser, if you like!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I wish I could get a nail file that combines the best of the Diamancel file (superthin metal, lasts forever, looks cool, easy to slip into handbag) and the Zeva Austrian Crystal Nail File (cool material, healing for nails, great for cuticle erasing) - so the ultimate nail file would be superthin, lasts forever, looks cool with unique material, and has a filing surface right to the edges (ie no blank surface on the edge which makes it a pain to file in tight corners - this is the major drawback of the diamancel).</li>
            <li> I recently replaced my original Zeva file...after at least 10 years of use! I bought my first one at the Mall of America, after getting a demo from the gal at a Zeva kiosk. These are truly wonderful files, so kind to your fingernails. As much as I love it for my nails, i especially love that  you can just &amp;#34;file&amp;#34; off your dry cuticles and all the dry skin around your nails with it - no more clipping dry cuticles! I can&#x27;t imagine ever using an emery board on my nails again in this lifetime!</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I expected in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I wear natural buffed nails and this works great to keep the edges smooth.</li>
            <li> I am delighted with this file.  Not only is it good for filing nails, but it is also fantastic for buffing rough pieces of skin around nails: it can reach places other files can&#x27;t because the entire item is a file--sides, top and bottom. My nails are looking much better because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not grate across the nails: it almost glides across them; it feels entirely different from the metal files I&#x27;ve been using for years, and which I won&#x27;t use anymore. Kudos to Zeva for a great ergonomic design!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this nail file four months ago and I wanted to see if this file actually stop Splitting, Peeling and Cracking before I submitted an official review. I am happy to report that this nail did stop splitting, peeling and cracking. I had been eying this nail file for some time but I was hesitate because of the price. For the majority of 2013 I went to the salon and get a gel manicure. At first my nail flourished but by the end of 2013 my nails were splitting, peeling and cracking. I decided to end my love affair with gel manicures and try to turn the health of my nails around. Four months later and my nails are stronger then they were before I started the gel manicures. If you are looking for a nail file that actual does what it claims look no further!</li>
            <li> What I can say is that there is a definite change for the better! I don&#x27;t know yet if it&#x27;s because of this file or the Protandum I&#x27;ve been taking. I will be quiting the Protandum because of the cost so then the real results will be evident.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why this works, but it does!  I&#x27;ve been using mine for about a month, carefully following the instructions provided, and not one broken nail.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful and will last forever. Really helps my nails look better. Add to your manicure routine, no more buying nail files.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful crystal file. I have tried other crystal file products thinking it should be the same. They are not! This file does what it says and with regular use makes your nails stronger. I ordered extra so I always have one with me. I love it!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stop your nails from peeling. I had high hopes for the kit but was kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> The order arrived quickly.  The file works better than any other file I have used.  I don&#x27;t have to be concerned with which direction I file and it smooths both the nails and the cuticles.</li>
            <li> I wore solar and gel nails for a long time and am trying to get my nails healthy again. When I saw this file, I wanted to try it because splitting, peeling and cracking are a problem for me. I find the file uncomfortable to hold and difficult to use. Sometimes I just give up and go back to my old file. However, I am going to persist and if I find I can give a better rating, I will come back and do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One positive is that is easier to use at the side of the nails, and perhaps that is what I will use the glass file for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I did the research I should have before the purchase. What I found is that the reason the glass file is supposed to be better is because it has a higher grit level and you can get the same thing with a regular file that has a higher grit level. I have used a ceramic file in the past and loved it but this just hasn&#x27;t worked that well for me.</li>
