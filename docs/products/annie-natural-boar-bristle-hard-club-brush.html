            <li>This will be used for many years.</li>
            <li>but I was more than pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Works better as a brush than a club.  </li>
            <li>- some are but most are plastic</li>
            <li>So cheap I ordered two</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>Not even worth the $2 charged.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Very nice, stiff brush for my beard.</li>
            <li>My first review of this was great, but as I continued to use the brush, it became more apparent that it wasn&#x27;t intended to last very long.</li>
            <li>Also, within the first couple of uses the bristles started falling out.</li>
            <li>Just a pretty crappy brush.</li>
            <li>Maybe I should&#x27;ve put it in hot water.</li>
            <li>Bristles coming out on the first use.  </li>
            <li>After first use some bristles are already smashed, but I kind of expected that because of the thickness of my beard.</li>
            <li>some lay wild from their original set of bristles.</li>
            <li>This brush makes both mine and my husband&#x27;s hair very shiny.  </li>
            <li>very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>highly recommended for anyone looking for a beard brush</li>
            <li>Maybe with more use the bristles will separate and comb through my hair a little easier.</li>
            <li>Bristles are stiff without being scratchy on the scalp (I&#x27;m bald on top</li>
            <li>course enough for a beard, still soft on the face.</li>

            <li> the bristles fell out because I was trying to detangle long hair or anything.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a normal hard brush</li>
            <li> No issues with loose bristles.</li>
            <li> These hard bristles help train the beard, keeps it soft and removes any dry skin under the beard.</li>
            <li> I gave her a few swats with the back of this, and now she&#x27;s actin&#x27; like she has some hotdamned sense!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this brush needs a little breaking in time, but these bristles don&#x27;t comb through my hair as easily as my old boar bristle brush.  </li>
            <li> I removed evry other column from the brush to make my waves wider.</li>
            <li> This is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Wish the bristles were a bit longer, they do not go all the way through my thick beard on an up stroke, but they do on a down stroke.</li>
            <li> No more screaming while brushing out tangles.</li>
            <li> Not a very good Brush.</li>
            <li> Too hard and not all of the bristles are boars hair</li>
            <li> The bristles bend uncontrollably at the base if the brush &amp; do not return to their normal structure</li>
            <li> It may also be weak</li>
            <li> I tried to use it as a club against an angry hippie and all it did was make his hair look</li>
            <li> They feel very weak at the base of the brush.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Very nice, stiff brush for my beard.</li>
            <li> NOT 100% boar bristles. There are boar bristles...and the bristles that are boars are probably 100% boar... But most of the bristles are zero percent boar. Also, within the first couple of uses the bristles started falling out. This brush was purchased for my husbands beard - so it&#x27;s not like the bristles fell out because I was trying to detangle long hair or anything. Just a pretty crappy brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this brush needs a little breaking in time, but these bristles don&#x27;t comb through my hair as easily as my old boar bristle brush.  I think the bristles are compactly held.  Maybe with more use the bristles will separate and comb through my hair a little easier.</li>
            <li> Best brush for beard and fine hair on three year old girls hair. No more screaming while brushing out tangles.</li>
            <li> My first review of this was great, but as I continued to use the brush, it became more apparent that it wasn&#x27;t intended to last very long. I was looking for a normal hard brush BCuz I already had a wolfing brush. The bristles bend uncontrollably at the base if the brush &amp; do not return to their normal structure some lay wild from their original set of bristles. They feel very weak at the base of the brush. Maybe I should&#x27;ve put it in hot water. It may also be weak BCuz I removed evry other column from the brush to make my waves wider. I&#x27;ve been using this brush over a month now. Use UR own discernment.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these when my lady was gettin&#x27; outta line.  I gave her a few swats with the back of this, and now she&#x27;s actin&#x27; like she has some hotdamned sense!  Best purchase I ever made in this relationship!  :D</li>
            <li> This only contains a few real boar bristles, the rest is plastic/nylon. Not 100% boar bristle as it says. This is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Bristles coming out on the first use.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Not even worth the $2 charged.  Would not recommend this product,</li>
            <li> I like this brush because the bristles can be felt on my scalp.  When I initially began using it, some of the bristles came out, but not to the extent that it effected the usefulness of the brush.</li>
            <li> Great price! Wish the bristles were a bit longer, they do not go all the way through my thick beard on an up stroke, but they do on a down stroke. After first use some bristles are already smashed, but I kind of expected that because of the thickness of my beard. Works well for my purpose of spreading beard oil through my beard. So cheap I ordered two so I don&#x27;t have to worry for quite awhile. Worth it!</li>
            <li> Bristles are stiff without being scratchy on the scalp (I&#x27;m bald on top so I notice these things). No issues with loose bristles. A little small in the handle area for large hands, but still very usable. This will be used for many years. I do recommend this brush especially for under $5 including shipping.</li>
            <li> Just what the Doctor ordered</li>
            <li> Not a very good Brush.</li>
            <li> As a guy, i never thoought i&#x27;d shop for a brush but I was more than pleased with the purchase. as the cheapest boar bristle brush i could find, i was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> course enough for a beard, still soft on the face. highly recommended for anyone looking for a beard brush</li>
            <li> This brush is great, it gets through my daughter&#x27;s long hair without causing pain and crying. It distributes oils perfectly and leaves hair feeling silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> This brush makes both mine and my husband&#x27;s hair very shiny.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I require.  I use one for my beard and am waiting for another for my hair.  These hard bristles help train the beard, keeps it soft and removes any dry skin under the beard.</li>
            <li> Works better as a brush than a club.  I tried to use it as a club against an angry hippie and all it did was make his hair look very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice quality bristles and assembly.</li>
            <li> Too hard and not all of the bristles are boars hair - some are but most are plastic</li>
