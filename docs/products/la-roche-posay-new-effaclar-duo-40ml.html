    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great stuff!</li>
            <li>Work perfectly for my acne.</li>
            <li>Very good!</li>
            <li>Good price, excellent delivery</li>
            <li>Amazing product, good price!!</li>
            <li>I had been using the OG Effaclar Duo for a while and was happy with it.</li>
            <li>It has a nice fragrance..sort of a floral fragrance.</li>
            <li>I think it applies nicely and doesn&#x27;t flake or &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; like the orig formula could.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>6th order I&#x27;ve placed here) product arrived early and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Great product, I am still happy with the results as a multiple return purchaser.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s better than the US version</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Delivery takes longer, but the product will be satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s not working but could have been much better.  </li>
            <li>One thing to know is that effaclar may trigger more acne at the beginning because it acts from the inside out.</li>
            <li>As for product, I love it.</li>
            <li>and I feel that this one nourishes the skin better.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s actually nice and fades quickly.</li>
            <li>Perfect, and recommended by my dermatologist in France...works if you have light acne, hormone related ( menopause, etc...)</li>
            <li>I tried a sample an love the results, is so light</li>
            <li>This product really keeps my face in good conditions.</li>
            <li>Better than original duo</li>
            <li>Now i will have to spend more money and order the original.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t find the need for additional moisturizer when I use this in the mornings, but when I do it&#x27;s a light gel formula</li>
            <li>but so far it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Originally I was using Effaclar duo (THE US version) because it was recommended by my derm.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the results of La Roche-Posay Effaclar K Daily</li>
            <li>I love La Roche Possay and am their loyal user but honestly, this product is not worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!!!</li>
            <li>It is different formula &amp; consistency than original DUO &amp; it works much better.</li>
            <li>far so good, it helps keep my acne at bay - but whether or not the scar/spot reducing ingredients are working only time will tell.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t compare to the original formula, even with the new added ingredient.</li>
            <li>I really like it, it helps keep my acne calm.  </li>
            <li>but definitely leaves your skin feeling comfortable and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about how effective it is because my skin has been acne-free for a while (maybe because of these products?)</li>
            <li>Following the directions, my acne has subsided tremendously.  </li>
            <li>It looks smoother and some of my newer pimple spots are completely gone.</li>
            <li>Product came early.</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer - I just switched from the regular Effaclar Duo (without the &#x27;+&#x27;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;First takes: much thinner than OG duo, which I actually like.</li>
            <li>As usual, I strongly recommend to only buy LaRoche- posey products Made in FRANCE.</li>
            <li>In fact, didn&#x27;t produce nearly  the same results.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I tried a sample an love the results, is so light and literally you could see the results within 2 days</li>
            <li> Originally I was using Effaclar duo (THE US version) because it was recommended by my derm. I wanted to test out this one (the French version) and see how that works. It has a nice fragrance..sort of a floral fragrance. I notice it but after I put it on and wait a few moments it disappears. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s better than the US version but so far it&#x27;s good. I&#x27;ll give it a month and see how it works out.  Update  6/10/15 ok so the fragrance isn&#x27;t that bad...it&#x27;s actually nice and fades quickly. I DID notice that alot of my shine is gone. By the time I get to work, my shiny t zone is virtually non existent. Also, I had a pimple a few weeks ago and put this on it, when I woke up the next morning the Pimple had drastically reduced in size.  Update 6/27/15. I was looking in the mirror the other day and noticed my skin is glowing. It looks smoother and some of my newer pimple spots are completely gone. Get this.</li>
            <li> Unclogs dirty pores and whiteheads!! Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Work perfectly for my acne.Love them. Bought twice from the seller.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, good price!!</li>
            <li> Better than original duo</li>
            <li> I really like it, it helps keep my acne calm.  I Use 2.5% benzyol peroxide underneath this before i go to bed. No new pimples the next day.</li>
            <li> Din&#x27;t like the product.</li>
            <li> Delivery takes longer, but the product will be satisfied.</li>
            <li> still have dark spots after few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I love La Roche Possay and am their loyal user but honestly, this product is not worth the money.  I was very pleased with the results of La Roche-Posay Effaclar K Daily Renovating Anti-Relapse Acne Treatment.  So, I thought the duo is an enhanced version-- but not, it is not.  In fact, didn&#x27;t produce nearly  the same results. It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s not working but could have been much better.  I will not repurchase again, but will get back to the effaclar K daily renovating.  One thing to know is that effaclar may trigger more acne at the beginning because it acts from the inside out. That is brings the deep comedones to the surface; just wanted to note that because, while reading I came across a lot of reviews about this acne-provoking tendency of the effaclar products.  Once, however, the skin clears up somewhat, then this seemingly bad acne subsides and actually disappears ...</li>
            <li> Good price, excellent delivery</li>
            <li> Product came early. Very good!</li>
            <li> Great product, I am still happy with the results as a multiple return purchaser.</li>
            <li> I have to give 5 stairs to this seller b/c once again (this is about 6th order I&#x27;ve placed here) product arrived early and in perfect condition. I highly recommend them!!! As for product, I love it. It is different formula &amp; consistency than original DUO &amp; it works much better. It is creamier and stronger... Matter of fact, I only use this one every other day. As usual, I strongly recommend to only buy LaRoche- posey products Made in FRANCE.</li>
            <li> Perfect, and recommended by my dermatologist in France...works if you have light acne, hormone related ( menopause, etc...)</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t purchase this product again. It doesn&#x27;t compare to the original formula, even with the new added ingredient. Now i will have to spend more money and order the original.</li>
            <li> This product really keeps my face in good conditions. Its purpose works in fact.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer - I just switched from the regular Effaclar Duo (without the &#x27;+&#x27;) and I feel that this one nourishes the skin better. I&#x27;m not sure about how effective it is because my skin has been acne-free for a while (maybe because of these products?) but definitely leaves your skin feeling comfortable and moisturized. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist.  Following the directions, my acne has subsided tremendously.  My skin appears softer as the larger pores have shrunk.</li>
            <li> I had been using the OG Effaclar Duo for a while and was happy with it. When I read that they had &#x27;improved&#x27; the formula, adding moisturizer &amp; spot/scar reducing properties I was excited to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First takes: much thinner than OG duo, which I actually like. I think it applies nicely and doesn&#x27;t flake or &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; like the orig formula could.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find the need for additional moisturizer when I use this in the mornings, but when I do it&#x27;s a light gel formula and it blends perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good, it helps keep my acne at bay - but whether or not the scar/spot reducing ingredients are working only time will tell.</li>
