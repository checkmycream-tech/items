    <ol>
            <li> I have been using Renewing Eye Cream by Murad for one year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has done everything the product claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen a dramatic improvement.</li>
            <li> Thick but not greasy and very absorbant. NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS. Does it&#x27;s job perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love this product it worked great for me..but not my friend. She is younger than I am and had different skin issues, but the renewing eye cream worked wonders on her. I mix this with the vitamin c mask for lightening and skin renewal products and am thrilled with immediate results.  The murad website offers resources for specific types of skin aging and also a what is your skin type questionnaire to help you choose what is best for you.  I have used many murad products and have found the kits are a good way to try and see which products best suit me as I have hormonal and aging issues. Do your research and you will find a mix of murad products that should work for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks, nothing yet!</li>
            <li> Much less expensive then in the spa!</li>
            <li> Not rich enough for me, prefer a creamier cream. Probably will not purchase this product again. Do like that it&#x27;s not a jar but a tube dispenser.</li>
            <li> This cream is a must have for me.  Without it, my eyes are puffy in the am. I find the combination of the Murad Vitamin C in the am and this at night helps greatly with fine lines and dark circles around my eyes</li>
            <li> My sister told me that she has been using this product for more than a year.  She noticed that it helps to reduce her eye puffiness.  So I started using this less than a month ago.  I usually have a little bit of eye puffiness in the morning.  I noticed the under eye&#x27;s area looks better now.  However, I do not think it is good in terms of treating wrinkles around the eyes.  Actually, the Murad Intensive Wrinkle Reducer works well with eyes&#x27;s area too.</li>
            <li> delivered on time, it was a gift</li>
            <li> Buying at this quantity saves me a fortune and allows me to use excellent products on a daily basis. Thanks!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t hurt the eyes and makes them look fresh</li>
            <li> I like this product for now. It has a pretty good consistency and seems to keep my eyes looking brighter.</li>
            <li> Love the Murad brand but this eye cream makes my face all sticky. Maybe expired?</li>
            <li> What a great deal!  The product was exactly what I expected and was just as advertised.  I will order this again!</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream . I tried not using when I ran out . Never again I could really notice wrinkles under my eyes after my make up was applied. I am 44 and people often tell me I don&#x27;t look my age. I use several of murad products . It makes a difference .</li>
            <li> murad eye cream is always best</li>
            <li> This my firs purchased Murad purchase and I love it! Large tube of Eye Cream will last me for long time. I just need a amount of the match head to moisture my both eyes. Recommended seller as well-great communication and service.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly. Looks and feels like the much smaller quantity I buy from the Murad website. I have been using the renewing eye cream for 2 or 3 years now. It works well with my skin maintaining a more youthful appearance. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Murad Renewing Eye Cream is my favorite eye cream for day and night.  I am so happy it comes in Salon Size.</li>
            <li> The best eye cream ever!</li>

            <li> Expected results sooner.  Have not seen what it promised to do.  You can tell when a product works from the first try.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream.</li>
