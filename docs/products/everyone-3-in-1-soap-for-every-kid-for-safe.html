            <li>, it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>Smells great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my daughters sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I feel great about buying a product that is natural and never tested on animals.</li>
            <li>and I feel better letting my children use this product than the phlates filled store bought.</li>
            <li>Smells great, does the job, natural.</li>
            <li>It smells great, makes fun bubble baths, cleans well and bonus doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes or sensitive skin.</li>

            <li>organic enough for me and the  size is great for the price.</li>
            <li>I have been using it on my skin-sensitive son for several years and love the smell, lack of irritation, good pump, etc.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair so nice and clean but really really moisturized...</li>
            <li>The boys are squeaky clean</li>
            <li>My son spotted it &amp; with his special needs had to put in bathroom in his spot for stuff.</li>
            <li>and I love the large size and the pump.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my children to use for both, but I think it dulls their hair and isn&#x27;t a great cleanser.</li>
            <li>All natural and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Smells really good and works for the entire family.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am more than familiar with the lack of lather from products free of all sulfates including the naturally derived ones.</li>
            <li>this product works well and smells great to and has none of those chemicals that are in the other brands...</li>
            <li>The value per ounce is super.</li>
            <li>The value per ounce is super.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to finally find a soap that works for my kids.</li>
            <li>Makes a soft soap &amp; the convenience of the top makes this our go to soap for bath time.</li>
            <li>The good thing is I am not as allergic to it as other things.</li>
            <li>Smell is just right and doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>We like to put the right soaps and lotions on our children&#x27;s skin but also have a budget.</li>
            <li>For those transitioning to more natural less toxic products it will be easier to switch because the lathering performance is good.</li>
            <li>the price is right and the ingredients are pretty \\&quot;clean\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>Does a good job removing soil, markers and paint from little fingers.</li>
            <li>The scent smells really nice and the bottle is large so the soap lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to figure out what the scent actually is though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have not been able to figure out what the scent actually is though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not trying to shower in pure lemon juice and salt</li>
            <li>YUMMY safe lasts a really long time!!!</li>
            <li>We highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li>My sister purchased this for my kids at whole foods</li>
            <li>This soap has always been gentle on my kids skin and eyes.</li>
            <li>It really does lather up well too.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the lowest rating on EWG&#x27;s database but it&#x27;s far better than the standard children&#x27;s bath products.</li>
            <li>Until I can find something even more gentle and less toxic in a large size with a pump, I&#x27;m sticking with Everyone Soap.</li>
            <li>but I assume based on the suds in the tub that my younger siblings are clean</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a reasonable price and healthy for our little ones skin.</li>
            <li>It look like its takes dirt off better than my previous washes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only brand I buy for my daughter because of the simple ingredients and fabulous smell!</li>
            <li>Since Im not usually allergic to scents I really prefer a stronger scent.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh scent and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Note, I live in Los Angeles..</li>
            <li>I use this for my in-home childcare - I am careful what the children clean their hands with and are exposed to.</li>
            <li>Smells nice Subtle without being over-powering and perfumy.</li>
            <li>and then brands started making similar available at our local store.</li>
            <li>Two of my children have very sensitive skin, and they have had zero problems using this soap.</li>
            <li>His hair is very soft everytime he uses iy.</li>
            <li>normally have very dry skin, this bodywash did not dry me out extra like most others do.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>For those transitioning to more natural less toxic products it will be easier to switch because the lathering performance is good.this as its simply a preference and not a product fault.</li>
            <li>I notice that we rarely need lotion after the shower, because it doesn&#x27;t dry our skin out!</li>
            <li>It leaves their skin soft, and there has been no build up in their hair when they use it as shampoo.</li>
            <li>Use this on our 3 1/2 year old and our 6mth old baby.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t  have a lot of chemicals.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li>I use it for me, adult.</li>
            <li>I ran across this brand in a local coop - and it was very pricey.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>Does not irritate my 3 year old&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t irritate their sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It came in quickly but was open in box with nothing to keep kid closed</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very affordable and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>So we will use as is &amp; hope the other one we ordered comes in full &amp; not open.</li>
            <li>I barely write reviews or rate products, but I have to be collaborative on this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The normal hand pumps seem to need to be refilled/replaced constantly, but this one seems to just last forever.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, 40 years later there are tons of products with less chemicals that smell nice and arent the chemical laden, depressing phisoderm and cetaphil lotions and cleansers.</li>
            <li>I think this is fine for a body soap, but it&#x27;s not necessarily a great choice for a shampoo.</li>

            <li> It smells great, makes fun bubble baths, cleans well and bonus doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Lathers nice and is gentle on the kids skin.</li>
            <li> organic enough for me and the  size is great for the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my skin-sensitive son for several years and love the smell, lack of irritation, good pump, etc.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair so nice and clean but really really moisturized...</li>
            <li> The boys are squeaky clean</li>
            <li> My son spotted it &amp; with his special needs had to put in bathroom in his spot for stuff.</li>
            <li> and I love the large size and the pump.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my children to use for both, but I think it dulls their hair and isn&#x27;t a great cleanser.</li>
            <li> All natural and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Smells really good and works for the entire family.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am more than familiar with the lack of lather from products free of all sulfates including the naturally derived ones.</li>
            <li> this product works well and smells great to and has none of those chemicals that are in the other brands...</li>
            <li> The value per ounce is super.</li>
            <li> The value per ounce is super.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled to finally find a soap that works for my kids.</li>
            <li> Makes a soft soap &amp; the convenience of the top makes this our go to soap for bath time.</li>
            <li> The good thing is I am not as allergic to it as other things.</li>
            <li> Smell is just right and doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> We like to put the right soaps and lotions on our children&#x27;s skin but also have a budget.</li>
            <li> For those transitioning to more natural less toxic products it will be easier to switch because the lathering performance is good.</li>
            <li> the price is right and the ingredients are pretty \\&quot;clean\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> Does a good job removing soil, markers and paint from little fingers.</li>
            <li> The scent smells really nice and the bottle is large so the soap lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have not been able to figure out what the scent actually is though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not been able to figure out what the scent actually is though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not trying to shower in pure lemon juice and salt</li>
            <li> YUMMY safe lasts a really long time!!!</li>
            <li> We highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> My sister purchased this for my kids at whole foods</li>
            <li> This soap has always been gentle on my kids skin and eyes.</li>
            <li> It really does lather up well too.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the lowest rating on EWG&#x27;s database but it&#x27;s far better than the standard children&#x27;s bath products.</li>
            <li> Until I can find something even more gentle and less toxic in a large size with a pump, I&#x27;m sticking with Everyone Soap.</li>
            <li> but I assume based on the suds in the tub that my younger siblings are clean</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a reasonable price and healthy for our little ones skin.</li>
            <li> It look like its takes dirt off better than my previous washes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only brand I buy for my daughter because of the simple ingredients and fabulous smell!</li>
            <li> Since Im not usually allergic to scents I really prefer a stronger scent.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh scent and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Note, I live in Los Angeles..</li>
            <li> I use this for my in-home childcare - I am careful what the children clean their hands with and are exposed to.</li>
            <li> Smells nice Subtle without being over-powering and perfumy.</li>
            <li> and then brands started making similar available at our local store.</li>
            <li> Two of my children have very sensitive skin, and they have had zero problems using this soap.</li>
            <li> His hair is very soft everytime he uses iy.</li>
            <li> normally have very dry skin, this bodywash did not dry me out extra like most others do.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> For those transitioning to more natural less toxic products it will be easier to switch because the lathering performance is good.this as its simply a preference and not a product fault.</li>
            <li> I notice that we rarely need lotion after the shower, because it doesn&#x27;t dry our skin out!</li>
            <li> It leaves their skin soft, and there has been no build up in their hair when they use it as shampoo.</li>
            <li> Use this on our 3 1/2 year old and our 6mth old baby.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t  have a lot of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> I use it for me, adult.</li>
            <li> I ran across this brand in a local coop - and it was very pricey.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate my 3 year old&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t irritate their sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It came in quickly but was open in box with nothing to keep kid closed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very affordable and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> So we will use as is &amp; hope the other one we ordered comes in full &amp; not open.</li>
            <li> I barely write reviews or rate products, but I have to be collaborative on this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The normal hand pumps seem to need to be refilled/replaced constantly, but this one seems to just last forever.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, 40 years later there are tons of products with less chemicals that smell nice and arent the chemical laden, depressing phisoderm and cetaphil lotions and cleansers.</li>
            <li> I think this is fine for a body soap, but it&#x27;s not necessarily a great choice for a shampoo.</li>
            <li> I also think it stings his eyes but not sure, as he doesn&#x27;t say much.</li>
            <li> but I do want as little chemicals as possible without completely drying out my skin and not paying $50 an oz.</li>
            <li> but it is a whole lot better for you than the crap you buy at run of the mill store and its way cheaper than stuff you get from the health foods stores.</li>
            <li> but it is a whole lot better for you than the crap you buy at run of the mill store and its way cheaper than stuff you get from the health foods stores.</li>
            <li> The bottle is bigger than I expected which was a plus.  </li>
            <li> think for the folks who are worried about this product, I tend to think that as a 40+ aged person, my generation seemed to survive soap, and this has the chemical in question as the last listed ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to buy as long as they can supply.</li>
            <li> The scent is acceptable but doesnt smell like coconut or tropical, certainly not strong for those sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li> But it still tends to dry out skin.</li>
            <li> My older son complained that it made his scalp itch.</li>
            <li> last 2 brands I went through would leave my skin very dry; one organic, the other from Bath &amp; Body</li>
            <li> product will be my standards and the seller my single source.&lt;br /&gt;Tahnk you.</li>
            <li> I needed a product that :Does not make me sweat, is not overwhelming, hydrate my skin yet still natural.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Amazon mom and was so disappointed i could not buy it here because i don&#x27;t live near a whole foods</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds buying all kinds of products before until I read about this product on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Ive even had allergic reactions to organic products with very few chemicals, right now my head is itching like crazy because I tried a new shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents.</li>
            <li> would not recommend this product for use on a child due to the phenoxyethanol.</li>
            <li> would not recommend this product for use on a child due to the phenoxyethanol.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of EO&#x27;s products because they are so well priced for not containing parabens, phthalates and other toxins.  </li>
            <li> This product contains Sodium Coco-Sulfate which isnt too bad, it aids in the foaming up of the product so its more &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; to those not familiar with using less toxic products.  </li>
            <li> Usually my kids end up wasting a lot of soap, but this has been being used on 3 kids for the last month and 1/2 and we&#x27;re not even half way done with the bottle yet.</li>
            <li> They can&#x27;t spill it and waste all the soap!</li>
            <li> I usually get.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not that serious.</li>
            <li> Really weak smell</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars but the pump was broken and the soap leaked out in the box</li>
            <li> Usually I use a castile soap but the scents are so depressing I wanted to try something</li>
            <li> or they are so expensive</li>
            <li> You wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> Sadly it doesn&#x27;t stick around.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was also disappointed that the pump was completely broken off when the bottle arrived, but I chose to use it as a refill in an existing dispenser in the shower.</li>
            <li> insane itching</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Awesome product! Smells great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my daughters sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> We love this soap. It smells great, makes fun bubble baths, cleans well and bonus doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes or sensitive skin. We only buy products that have not been tested on animals and this fits the bill. It&#x27;s also very affordable and lasts a long time. We highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> Super Love this soap! I&#x27;m always looking for &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; products for my family - I don&#x27;t want tons of chemicals on our bodies. But so many of them that I have tried don&#x27;t work too well or they are so expensive, I never order them twice in a row... but I will definitely stick with this one. Love it and the price!</li>
            <li> Smells good, cleans well. Love it!</li>
            <li> Note: THE INGREDIENTS LIST ON AMAZON IS INCOMPLETE AND DOES NOT LIST PHENOXYETHANOL. I know better and should have checked their site and slacked off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the product-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by saying I am allergic to just about everything that comes in contact with your skin. When I was 6 I had a reaction to bubble bath and my skin peeled off. Fortunately, 40 years later there are tons of products with less chemicals that smell nice and arent the chemical laden, depressing phisoderm and cetaphil lotions and cleansers. Ive even had allergic reactions to organic products with very few chemicals, right now my head is itching like crazy because I tried a new shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am more than familiar with the lack of lather from products free of all sulfates including the naturally derived ones. This product contains Sodium Coco-Sulfate which isnt too bad, it aids in the foaming up of the product so its more &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; to those not familiar with using less toxic products.  But it still tends to dry out skin. The good thing is I am not as allergic to it as other things. I still get some itching but not insane itching I usually get. Usually I use a castile soap but the scents are so depressing I wanted to try something fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why only 3 stars? The ingredients list. It contains phenoxyethanol. It is a bigger problem being in childrens products, if I remember correctly its an endocrine disruptor. Dont take my word for it me do your own research. It is an ingredient that is being removed form the acceptable organic product list. So products including it cannot get organic certification. If it had not been a childs product it would have been 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather is good, 3 pumps in a bath puff is plenty. The scent is acceptable but doesnt smell like coconut or tropical, certainly not strong for those sensitive to scents. Since Im not usually allergic to scents I really prefer a stronger scent. My rating does not reflect this as its simply a preference and not a product fault. I have not been able to figure out what the scent actually is though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product for use on a child due to the phenoxyethanol. The value per ounce is super. I prefer a cleaner ingredient list but it is a whole lot better for you than the crap you buy at run of the mill store and its way cheaper than stuff you get from the health foods stores. For those transitioning to more natural less toxic products it will be easier to switch because the lathering performance is good.this as its simply a preference and not a product fault.

            <li> This is a household staple; I like the smell and it&#x27;s just a nice, non-irritating all around soap. I use it on myself as well as my child. No gross ingredients and it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt the kids eyes, it smells good, works well.  Its soap.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and I love this soap for my boys! All natural and smells amazing. The boys are squeaky clean and I feel great about buying a product that is natural and never tested on animals. Buy this soap! You wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> My kids love this soap! The scent is great. Two of my children have very sensitive skin, and they have had zero problems using this soap. It leaves their skin soft, and there has been no build up in their hair when they use it as shampoo. I&#x27;m thrilled to finally find a soap that works for my kids.</li>
            <li> Use this on our 3 1/2 year old and our 6mth old baby. Love the smell (not too overpowering). Makes a soft soap &amp; the convenience of the top makes this our go to soap for bath time.</li>
            <li> All four of my picky kids love the smell and I feel better letting my children use this product than the phlates filled store bought.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this soap. It smells so good, and it&#x27;s very mild on the skin. I notice that we rarely need lotion after the shower, because it doesn&#x27;t dry our skin out!</li>
            <li> This soap smells amazing! The bottle is bigger than I expected which was a plus.  My kids don&#x27;t compain about it hurting their eyes and they smell so good when they get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought everyone soap and I am very pleased with this item.  The scent smells really nice and the bottle is large so the soap lasts a long time.  Good product!</li>
            <li> We bought these as we wanted to find some better soaps for our kids that didn&#x27;t have a ton of chemicals.  I did a fair amount of reading on the chemicals involved with this vs. say, a J&amp;J product you would see in hospitals.  Almost all of the ingredients are things a non-chemist would be able to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think for the folks who are worried about this product, I tend to think that as a 40+ aged person, my generation seemed to survive soap, and this has the chemical in question as the last listed ingredient.  I think EO would put this to rest by saying the amount of concentration included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, it smells great, works for all of my kids, and after buying one bottle to try, we are re-upping with 2 more.  The kids enjoy the bath/shower, and the smell reminds my wife and i of our honeymoon in Hawaii ! :)</li>
            <li> I barely write reviews or rate products, but I have to be collaborative on this one.&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, I have ashy skin. I needed a product that :Does not make me sweat, is not overwhelming, hydrate my skin yet still natural.  I have spent hundreds buying all kinds of products before until I read about this product on Amazon.  Voila! my race is over in addition to the body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;This product will be my standards and the seller my single source.&lt;br /&gt;Tahnk you.</li>
            <li> this has to be one of my top favorite soaps for our kiddos, Ive even used it! :0) the price is right and the ingredients are pretty \\&quot;clean\\&quot;...we top off the shower or bath with the Everyone lotion (which I now use for everything including my face with great results). Happy momma!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It smells great and works wonderful on my little boy! His hair is very soft everytime he uses iy.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of EO&#x27;s products because they are so well priced for not containing parabens, phthalates and other toxins.  I use the Everyone Soap which isn&#x27;t that bubbly for bubble bath.  This one is way bubblier and the bubbles last throughout the bath.  My kids love it and the smell is great! I get to keep my soap and my kids&#x27; theirs.</li>
            <li> Smells great, does the job, natural. We love it!</li>
            <li> My pump broke off also. I like the sent. It doesn&#x27;t linger in my son&#x27;s hair that I noticed. I also think it stings his eyes but not sure, as he doesn&#x27;t say much.</li>
            <li> YUMMY safe lasts a really long time!!! Great for you, your kids and babies, animals and the environment. Great value of use and price!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this soap...the scent is great-almost like the smell of sunscreen at the beach...&amp; I bought it for our guest bath since it&#x27;s a 3 in 1 soap (hair, body &amp; bubble bath) but decided to keep it for myself (definitely not a kid) &amp; will get another one for the guests.</li>
            <li> Bubble bath is wonderful! I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t  have a lot of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Great for everything except for hair, does not lather as much as needed.</li>
            <li> Product smells great and kids love it!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> My sister purchased this for my kids at whole foods and i love it.. I&#x27;m an Amazon mom and was so disappointed i could not buy it here because i don&#x27;t live near a whole foods.. I&#x27;m glad i can buy it here now. this product works well and smells great to and has none of those chemicals that are in the other brands...thank you Amazon for once again making me a happy happy customer!!!!</li>
            <li> Very good soap for the price, we use for the whole family!</li>
            <li> It came in quickly but was open in box with nothing to keep kid closed so we lost the top part of soap. My son spotted it &amp; with his special needs had to put in bathroom in his spot for stuff. He was so happy to get it I could rip it away &amp; say we need to return. So we will use as is &amp; hope the other one we ordered comes in full &amp; not open.</li>
            <li> This is a bathroom staple in our house. It&#x27;s got a great light scent and I love the large size and the pump. I also love that you can use it as shampoo, body wash and bubble bath. This soap has always been gentle on my kids skin and eyes. It doesn&#x27;t have the lowest rating on EWG&#x27;s database but it&#x27;s far better than the standard children&#x27;s bath products. Until I can find something even more gentle and less toxic in a large size with a pump, I&#x27;m sticking with Everyone Soap.</li>
            <li> I use it for me, adult. Just crossed the word &amp;#34;kids&amp;#34; out and wrote my name.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s organic enough for me and the  size is great for the price. I&#x27;m not trying to shower in pure lemon juice and salt but I do want as little chemicals as possible without completely drying out my skin and not paying $50 an oz. The size is great the price and purity.&lt;br /&gt;The last 2 brands I went through would leave my skin very dry; one organic, the other from Bath &amp; Body Works.&lt;br /&gt;I normally have very dry skin, this bodywash did not dry me out extra like most others do.&lt;br /&gt;My skin might even be more moist than it as been in months if not years.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s know where the feeling of not being bodily dehydrate originated. Note, I live in Los Angeles..&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, it works great. It look like its takes dirt off better than my previous washes.&lt;br /&gt;Smell amazing. Sadly it doesn&#x27;t stick around. I wanted to smell to stick with me. But it&#x27;s not that serious.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and packaging was excellent. No damage or spills in box. I use this for my in-home childcare - I am careful what the children clean their hands with and are exposed to. Smell is just right and doesn&#x27;t linger. Does a good job removing soil, markers and paint from little fingers. I ran across this brand in a local coop - and it was very pricey. Compare prices, as this price point knocks competitors out. I&#x27;ll continue to buy as long as they can supply.</li>
            <li> I love everyone soap! Use it for everything at kid&#x27;s bath time.</li>
            <li> Great scent. Kids love it....and then brands started making similar available at our local store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s says for kids but my husband and hi use it, it smells pretty good. Gentle for skin and make beautiful hair! Love it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap! Smells delicious, easy to use pump, foams readily, and best of all- it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> This soap smells amazing, but not overpowering. Kids love it. Does not irritate my 3 year old&#x27;s sensitive skin. Love the pump. Usually my kids end up wasting a lot of soap, but this has been being used on 3 kids for the last month and 1/2 and we&#x27;re not even half way done with the bottle yet.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  It&#x27;s the only brand I buy for my daughter because of the simple ingredients and fabulous smell!</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling hand pump soap I&#x27;ve found yet. The size is great as well. The normal hand pumps seem to need to be refilled/replaced constantly, but this one seems to just last forever.</li>
            <li> We like to put the right soaps and lotions on our children&#x27;s skin but also have a budget. This soap fits the bill perfectly. It&#x27;s a reasonable price and healthy for our little ones skin.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars but the pump was broken and the soap leaked out in the box it came in.  The smell is good and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> My kids like it and it doesn&#x27;t irritate their sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Really weak smell but I assume based on the suds in the tub that my younger siblings are clean</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my skin-sensitive son for several years and love the smell, lack of irritation, good pump, etc.</li>
            <li> Great for every part of the body~! Kids love it and loves the scent!</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Smells really good and works for the entire family.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was really good and the article came on time.</li>
            <li> This soap is great.  Smells real nice and doesn&#x27;t require a lot to be used.  Also makes it awesome that you just need one product for body and hair.  It really does lather up well too.  Great product!</li>
