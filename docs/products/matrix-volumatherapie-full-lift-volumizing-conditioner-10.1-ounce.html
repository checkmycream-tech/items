            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It provides great conditioning, detangles my fine tresses, and most importantly, it&#x27;s PARABEN-FREE, so perfect for fine hair!</li>
            <li>Great price for the size and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anything that smells this good must be made with fine ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love this shampoo or conditioner...leaves my hair feeling not moisturized..</li>
            <li>I love how this conditioner makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Nothing much to say about the product, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>My hair is softer and much more manageable.</li>
            <li>I personally love this conditioner and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>What I love is that I get 3 times the amount for 10 more dollars.</li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>I buy Biolage because I love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>Also bought the pump screw on top for easy access.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to be able to purchase this.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s fine with not lots of body/  </li>
            <li>It is gentle on my hair and gives it nice body.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love Biolage products and the price on this large bottle</li>
            <li>so I have no idea if the volumetherapie or full lift features worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Package arrived quickly and was packaged well.</li>
            <li>Upon looking at the biolage website, it appears this particular style &amp;#34;volumatherapie&amp;#34; is no longer sold, so I am pretty sure my  hunch is correct.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft but takes curl better.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hair healthy and not dry.</li>
            <li>Mostly I see the smaller tubes...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately I bought this large size, which, if I continue to use the microscopic amounts to remove dryness, will last many years.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to see the improvement in my hair&#x27;s appearance from the very first application of this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>for the price I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>I don;t have anything unusual to my hair</li>
            <li>I bought this to give my hair some \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; as it is fine and thinning and goes flat quickly.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This conditioner does a good job at keeping my hair from getting too dry, but does not weigh my waves/curls down.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal..</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does remove dryness, so it&#x27;s a good conditioner for that and would probably work well for people with thick and perhaps coarse hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i seem to have to apply more than usual but</li>
            <li>I worry these may have sat in a hot southern warehouse for a while and have changed consistency.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if this is safe...</li>
            <li>(Although since I am 68 years old, I don&#x27;t think she will lose any sleep).</li>
            <li>Seemingly no harsh ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I am a 44 year old woman who colors her hair every 4 to 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>Consequently, my hair has some breakage from the frequent chemical processing.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair.  </li>

            <li> Strange consistency and odor.  </li>

            <li> I have med/long hair that is thick and wavy.</li>
            <li> but the consistency is really slick and it has a bad smell like a bottle of conditioner that has sat on the shelf for a few years.  </li>
            <li> Dries out your hair really bad, and makes it stiff.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair.  After a wash, my bangs just hang limply.  This product adds volume and bounce.  I LOVE it.  If I get up the nerve to use it on my entire head, watch out Cindy Crawford. (Although since I am 68 years old, I don&#x27;t think she will lose any sleep).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this shampoo or conditioner...leaves my hair feeling not moisturized..I won&#x27;t be buying this brand again.</li>
            <li> Strange consistency and odor.  I wonder if this is expired?  It was sealed when I got it but the consistency is really slick and it has a bad smell like a bottle of conditioner that has sat on the shelf for a few years.  Upon looking at the biolage website, it appears this particular style &amp;#34;volumatherapie&amp;#34; is no longer sold, so I am pretty sure my  hunch is correct.</li>

It does not appear to add volume.&lt;br /&gt;It does remove dryness, so it&#x27;s a good conditioner for that and would probably work well for people with thick and perhaps coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I bought this large size, which, if I continue to use the microscopic amounts to remove dryness, will last many years.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Biolage products and the price on this large bottle is incredible.  It definitely rivals even the beauty supply stores and it&#x27;s delivered to my door!  Love it!</li>
            <li> This shampoo works well for me and adds volume to my thin limp hair.  It&#x27;s also a good buy online from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love Biolage products, but they are so expensive in local stores and salons. Great price for the size and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s fine with not lots of body/  This help volumize and strengthen it.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is a fabulous product.  I&#x27;ve had trouble finding this product in the liter size locally so it&#x27;s great that I can get it here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used thus product for years. It&#x27;s great!!</li>
            <li> My hair is so fine and thin that it always lays flat on my head if I use anything other than this product!  This is a great affordable price.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Keeps my hair healthy and not dry.</li>
            <li> I buy Biologe for the smell, this does not smell like the Biologe I&#x27;ve bought at the salon and i seem to have to apply more than usual but for the price I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> Good quality product.  Seemingly no harsh ingredients.  Leaves hair soft but takes curl better.  Not &amp;#34;high volume&amp;#34; like a gel but gives thin hair enough body that curls hold.  Good partner to the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Package arrived quickly and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> I love how this conditioner makes my hair feel.  I have med/long hair that is thick and wavy. This conditioner does a good job at keeping my hair from getting too dry, but does not weigh my waves/curls down.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this shampoo at a store and like tt so i ordered it on Amazon so there would be no need to find a store that carries it in ahte area I moved to.</li>
            <li> I have VERY fine, thin hair that tangles horribly after shampooing. Not anymore!!! This conditioner is awesome. It provides great conditioning, detangles my fine tresses, and most importantly, it&#x27;s PARABEN-FREE, so perfect for fine hair! It doesn&#x27;t weigh mine down at all.</li>
            <li> Works great. Love it.</li>
            <li> The smell and consistency on this conditioner where quite a bit off, from when I purchase at a salon.  I worry these may have sat in a hot southern warehouse for a while and have changed consistency.  Not sure if this is safe...this didn&#x27;t come from warehouse but third party, hence my safety concern.</li>
            <li> Works well on my hair</li>
            <li> Nothing much to say about the product, it&#x27;s great. The shipping and handling was A++.</li>
            <li> I am a 44 year old woman who colors her hair every 4 to 6 weeks. Consequently, my hair has some breakage from the frequent chemical processing.  I have used what I considered a good quality drugstore conditioner for years.  I was very surprised to see the improvement in my hair&#x27;s appearance from the very first application of this conditioner.  This product has a wonderful smell. My hair is softer and much more manageable.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price. I have been really worried lately on Amazon about fake products but this one seems to be legit. This is a product to create volume and sometimes will cause my hair to tangle as there is little product left on the strands to eliminate build-up. Unite 7 Seconds will ease brushing and not add weight if that is your issue.</li>
            <li> Dries out your hair really bad, and makes it stiff. I would not buy it again, and I don;t have anything unusual to my hair it&#x27;s normal.. this conditioner is not moisturizing in any way and no it did not provide volume. Just dried my hair out. I use Sebastian Drench now and I&#x27;m happier and safer.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. Smells great, lots of lift.</li>
            <li> Great product, will be buying this one again !</li>
            <li> I personally love this conditioner and have been using it for years. What I love is that I get 3 times the amount for 10 more dollars. You just can&#x27;t beat that. Buying the regular tubes of conditioner in the store feel so wasteful compared to this. Also bought the pump screw on top for easy access. Just love it. Will always buy this product.</li>
            <li> I buy Biolage because I love the way it smells.  There is no better smelling shampoo or conditioner on the market.  I have short hair so I have no idea if the volumetherapie or full lift features worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything that smells this good must be made with fine ingredients.  I recommend to all who can afford</li>
