            <li>Nice!</li>
            <li>They apply makeup perfectly and they work better than those colored &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; sponges.</li>
            <li>they are a bit flimsy and doesnt have a good grip to it.</li>
            <li>Good for art products.</li>
            <li>but they work good for what I needed them for.</li>
            <li>Good price - they don&#x27;t come apart and liquid doesn&#x27;t soak into them like some I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>They are a good size and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i gave it two stars because it works good for nail art.</li>
            <li>Good for a one or two time use.</li>
            <li>This product applies my makeup really good and also removes it.  </li>
            <li>The material is good, not too cheat.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li>Good quality, good density, good value.  </li>
            <li>For this purpose they are really exceptional.</li>
            <li>These wedges perform just as good job as the promises of the beauty blenders and better for a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased that I did and that I ordered two packages.</li>
            <li>great price, glad I bought them.</li>
            <li>nice product, good quality.</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, great!</li>
            <li>Love these...easy to use!</li>
            <li>Sponges from Walmart, Walgreens even the dollar tree are better!</li>
            <li>and I love that I can buy it in this quantity!</li>
            <li>I was a fairy in Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream and it required a lot of makeup, and these were great for application and easily disposable.</li>
            <li>We own a very high end seasonal detail business and these work perfect for all those nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li>and they work great leaving a smooth surface.  </li>
            <li>I bought them because I didnt have time to go to Ulta and get the nice ones.</li>
            <li>It is really nice.</li>
            <li>They work perfectly for what she wants them to do.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be honest, there are a LOT of makeup application sponges out there</li>
            <li>It is nice that they come in bulk.</li>
            <li>Nice size bag.</li>
            <li>They are nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s best to limit a wedge to 2 or 3 colors before discarding it and using a new wedge.</li>
            <li>They are good quality and it&#x27;s such a good price!!!</li>
            <li>They are not porous and very easy to use to apply foundation.</li>
            <li>Pretty good!</li>
            <li>They are soft and do a wonderful job.</li>
            <li>Handy triangular shape for most any job at the makeup table.  </li>
            <li>this sponge is smooth and is good for blending the colours.</li>
            <li>Product is VERY cheap.</li>
            <li>These are very light and flimsy.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever used sponges for make up and they are very nice.</li>
            <li>anyways I will keep practicing I may get better results soon.</li>
            <li>I would recommend getting the pack of 100 from Ulta and they work much better.</li>
            <li>The picture makes them look as if they have a better quality.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;re able to get it on your face.</li>
            <li>I will use the product until I find something better.</li>
            <li>ABOUT 3 x&#x27;S MORE MAKEUP THAN THE WEDGES</li>
            <li>They were cheap and are effective.</li>
            <li>Because they absorb more, I tend to need to use more makeup when using them -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the product, my expectations were met and I don&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the product and the amount you get for the price.</li>
            <li>Any more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much, much, much better than using fingers.</li>
            <li>I blend everything with these, LOVE THE SIZE.</li>
            <li>I think this product is ok and it came as described, but the sponges do not feel as dense as what I buy in the store</li>
            <li>These work perfect for the extra detailing touch for any vehicle.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m spoiled to the smoother, better quality ones.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>These are great and working out really well.</li>
            <li>I am sure they would work as well or better on your face.  </li>
            <li>great purchase and fast shipment.</li>
            <li>I had to use more way more foundation.</li>
            <li>Okay I ordered 100 wedges at leats thats what this states</li>
            <li>My favorite make up sponge</li>
            <li>The texture of this product is a bit rougher and more absorbant than those I&#x27;m used to using.  </li>
            <li>Used to be able to get these in town, was so glad to find them on line.  </li>
            <li>nice sponges good texture soft with very fine pores.  </li>
            <li>Good price, but these have a funny smell to them.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product and I probably will buy more, as soon as possible.</li>
            <li>These are a great value when working a large event, they are great for personal use as well.</li>
            <li>They feel more like a paper towel than the smooth as silk</li>
            <li>Great prize for so many of them:) I use this for liquid foundation, facial washes,and to wipe things off with makeup remover!</li>
            <li>These get the job done for sure, but the texture is not so friendly.</li>
            <li>These fall apart very quickly and need to be replaced after 1-2 uses.</li>
            <li>i go through these very quickly .</li>
            <li>It spreads the layers evenly on your skin and you can remove smudges off easily.  </li>
            <li>You WANT the wedges to absorb whatever drama that bottle of glitter nailpolish or cheap foundation has in store for you and only deposit the right amount of awesome.  </li>
            <li>it is what is said it was and look forward to working with them in my new makeup trunk and a good price.</li>
            <li>The wedge sponge for make up does not come in with a fine texture.</li>
            <li>This is fine if you&#x27;re applying cheap nailpolish, cheap foundation, or cheap eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>These sponges are cheap, it&#x27;s great that you have a big bag, but what&#x27;s the point when they don&#x27;t blend like you want it to?</li>
            <li>I want a smooth feel when apply makeup...</li>
            <li>and I needed them on the cheap.   </li>
            <li>They were great for costume makeup and theatrical makeup.</li>
            <li>Does not apply make up smoothly, leaves streaks.</li>
            <li>These are a great buy when you consider what you get in a traditional retail package.</li>
            <li>LATEX FREE, hypoallergenic, A PURR-FECT product for make-up application.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I knew I was buying cheap foam</li>
            <li>Price is cheap.</li>
            <li>But hey, these are so cheap you might not mind.</li>
            <li>/&gt;very easy to clean an store</li>
            <li>The Amount is good and they are too soft on the skin</li>
            <li>Came right on time in a lovely purple package to hold them.</li>
            <li>The wedges that are intact are great, but many of them are unusable due to this flaw.</li>
            <li>Will be very useful for our textile conservation and cleaning project.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase and will purchase more products from this buyer in the future.</li>
            <li>they do exactly what they are supposed to do :)</li>
            <li>The wedges are fine and the value for the price is good, but several of the wedges in the package I received were damaged.</li>
            <li>Love the wedge they help with foundation and mistakes need another bag almost empty good choice if u buy them</li>
            <li>Merely good enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did not pay to much for these.</li>
            <li>Good for hygiene but don&#x27;t think this bag is going to last you forever.</li>
            <li>thanks for making them available and easy to get.</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>Delivery very fast!</li>
            <li>Omg have these and have so many left because you can reuse and reuse em and clean them!</li>
            <li>These are my first and long time lovers and I continue loving them!</li>
            <li>The foam was disintegrating as I used it, on the first use!</li>
            <li>These are cheap, porous wedges that absorb too much of the foundation.</li>
            <li>For everyday use, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy and cheaply made</li>
            <li>I was looking for something for makeup, found it absorbed a lot of my makeup product.</li>
            <li>These are good, but you have to be careful when using</li>
            <li>You need Fresh sponges for each actor, for health reasons.</li>
            <li>Nice big bag of cosmetic wedges!  </li>
            <li>Smaller than I expected but ended up being perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good temporary product, and since a package comes with a lot, these will last you quite a while (depending on how much makeup you wear).</li>
            <li>Nice sponges but smaller than you would guess from the photo on the bag.  </li>
            <li>These wedges were so porous that they absorbed my foundation right into them.</li>
            <li>I bought these particular wedges mainly for the price, and they were good for the price, too, but I think you&#x27;d be better off buying slightly more expensive, albeit, better quality wedges.</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;re probably not saving me as much money as I originally thought.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know maybe their flimsiness makea them good for other purposes?</li>
            <li>The foundation I use these for soaks right through them.</li>
            <li>Although they are the right price for the quality, and they get the job done</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t absorb your makeup right away</li>
            <li>I have bought much larger sponges at the beauty supply store, which I actually like better for make up use, but if the smaller format of these cut sponges fit your needs then you will be happy with them.  </li>
            <li>I bought these to due nail art things (gradients, apply glitter more evenly) and they work perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>VERY REASONABLE PROCE, AND CAM BE WASHED OUT AND USED AAGAIN.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using cosmetic wedges like this one for years now and they have their pros and cons, but this particular one is a great bargain at a little over $7 for 100-count bag.</li>
            <li>up a decent amount of foundation into a new wedge/sponge, but after that initial &#x27;soak&#x27; it is good</li>
            <li>Exactly what my granddaughter was looking for.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of these in the future.</li>
            <li>These wedges work OK, but their texture is rougher and they absorb more makeup than others I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li>and sometimes it can be difficult to figure out what is best  to use.</li>
            <li>They do exactly what they&#x27;re meant to.  </li>
            <li>and they have a funny smell.</li>
            <li>Work very well for what I need them for!</li>
            <li>If you instead prefer tailored application, consistent performance, or a semi-absorbent wedge, I&#x27;d suggest going with a brand name.</li>
            <li>Wedges are very soft and it is exactly  what I was expecting!</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I think it may be allowing for a more even application because instead of leaving streaks its more likely to absorb product.  </li>
            <li>They came quick and rhey are so soft.</li>
            <li>These sponges would be good for removing makeup and exfoliating your face but they are not very good for applying makeup which is what I bought the sponges for: applying makeup.  </li>
            <li>These sponges would be good for removing makeup and exfoliating your face but they are not very good for applying makeup which is what I bought the sponges for: applying makeup.</li>
            <li>I order the large bag since I use it for both purposes.  </li>
            <li>I always have a ton of uses for these from putting on make up to &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; something that demands a gentle touch.</li>
            <li>Compared to the ones I&#x27;ve picked up in my local drug store, these are not as smooth to the touch.  </li>
            <li>The liquid makeup just seeps straight through.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really crappy quality.</li>
            <li>really like nothing I&#x27;ve ever smelled before.  </li>
            <li>rough, not like the sponges i purchased at the drug store, more porous</li>
            <li>These are very low-quality, even for my standards.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much .</li>
            <li>They are very porious and flimsy.  </li>
            <li>The sponges are too porous and soak up too much product.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I feel it&#x27;s absorbing my concealer off my face instead of blending it.</li>
            <li>resistant, does not fall apart or absobe to much</li>
            <li>besides that they are not very expensive</li>
            <li>The shipping is super fast and you can&#x27;t get a bigger bag for the value.</li>
            <li>Found that the foundation just absorbed into the pad and barely made it to my face.</li>
            <li>Not sure whose product \\&quot;Honest</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay, but really cheap and thin.</li>
            <li>It was decent quality and they got the job done.</li>
            <li>I bought the beauty blenders much to my regret and waste of money as they did for me nothing better than these wedges do.</li>
            <li>For the purpose that I bought these sponges, they perform adequately, but they are not the same quality of the &amp;#34;bulk&amp;#34; sponges I would buy from, say, Target&#x27;s brand.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product mainly to do nail art sponging...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by the high quality claim.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Product seeps through other side of wedge very quickly.</li>
            <li>They were a bit rough on my skin and didn&#x27;t spread so smoothly.</li>
            <li>I should have bought make-up wedge at target as I normally did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I normally use when I apply some shimmer on my legs.</li>
            <li>right now I want the rest of the wedges or my money back</li>
            <li>it is very soft and moves a lot when i want fix the concealer</li>
            <li>I am not sure if it&#x27;s because I am used to using brushes most of the time</li>
            <li>Pretty simple - the wedges are puffy and flexible.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and gental on your skin and work like unafordable sponges!</li>
            <li>My only problem with it was that you do get what you pay for, meaning that the sponge itself is slightly more porous than I expected as a professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li>Pretty standard wedges.</li>
            <li>Product was just as expected, and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super thin and cheap.</li>
            <li>They are not stiff.</li>
            <li>The large sponge clumps are actually square pieces that pull apart into two wedges.  </li>
            <li>Spend a little more money and buy sponges that are actually useable.</li>
            <li>Uniform wedge shape - no problem there,    a little wider than the more expensive kind.  </li>
            <li>However, these were much lighter weight than I expected, very pourous, so they soak up a lot of cosmetics, and tend to shred a bit when applying make-up.  </li>
            <li>I am also surprised the sponge didn&#x27;t swell up when whet</li>
            <li>Wedges provide a different texture on card stock in comparison to using ink straight from the ink pad.</li>
            <li>These are soft durable sponges.  </li>
            <li>I actually don&#x27;t mind, really.</li>
            <li>These wedges are too soft to apply foundation.</li>
            <li>On the one hand, I think this may result in wasted product over time and not as comfortable a feel on application.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product, not sure if I&#x27;ll get it again or return to my previous brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to wet these in water first before using them to put my bb cream on.</li>
            <li>Came exactly how I expected it to!</li>
            <li>Yes, people would usually use it for make-up, but Ilike to use them for special nail art design.</li>
            <li>I like to use a fresh sponge everyday to prevent bacteria build-up.</li>
            <li>When they say latex free them mean it.  </li>
            <li>For me d wedges are too small and fragile, but I guess I expected more.</li>
            <li>However, these sponges are very porous and rough, very similar to a kitchen dish sponge.  </li>
            <li>However, these sponges are very porous and rough, very similar to a kitchen dish sponge.</li>
            <li>they have been very hard to fine</li>
            <li>Poor quality, falls apart easily.</li>
            <li>If using these on   other people (who expect very soft plush texture) look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>You can also use these wedges to apply versa mark clear ink to stencils especially in small detailed areas.</li>

            <li> Nice!</li>
            <li> They apply makeup perfectly and they work better than those colored &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; sponges.</li>
            <li> they are a bit flimsy and doesnt have a good grip to it.</li>
            <li> Good for art products.</li>
            <li> but they work good for what I needed them for.</li>
            <li> Good price - they don&#x27;t come apart and liquid doesn&#x27;t soak into them like some I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> They are a good size and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i gave it two stars because it works good for nail art.</li>

            <li> Good quality, good density, good value.  </li>
            <li> For this purpose they are really exceptional.</li>
            <li> These wedges perform just as good job as the promises of the beauty blenders and better for a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased that I did and that I ordered two packages.</li>
            <li> great price, glad I bought them.</li>
            <li> nice product, good quality.</li>
            <li> I love these!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, great!</li>
            <li> Love these...easy to use!</li>
            <li> Sponges from Walmart, Walgreens even the dollar tree are better!</li>
            <li> and I love that I can buy it in this quantity!</li>
            <li> I was a fairy in Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream and it required a lot of makeup, and these were great for application and easily disposable.</li>
            <li> We own a very high end seasonal detail business and these work perfect for all those nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li> and they work great leaving a smooth surface.  </li>
            <li> I bought them because I didnt have time to go to Ulta and get the nice ones.</li>
            <li> It is really nice.</li>
            <li> They work perfectly for what she wants them to do.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest, there are a LOT of makeup application sponges out there</li>
            <li> It is nice that they come in bulk.</li>
            <li> Nice size bag.</li>
            <li> They are nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s best to limit a wedge to 2 or 3 colors before discarding it and using a new wedge.</li>
            <li> They are good quality and it&#x27;s such a good price!!!</li>
            <li> They are not porous and very easy to use to apply foundation.</li>
            <li> Pretty good!</li>
            <li> They are soft and do a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> Handy triangular shape for most any job at the makeup table.  </li>
            <li> this sponge is smooth and is good for blending the colours.</li>
            <li> Product is VERY cheap.</li>
            <li> These are very light and flimsy.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used sponges for make up and they are very nice.</li>
            <li> anyways I will keep practicing I may get better results soon.</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting the pack of 100 from Ulta and they work much better.</li>
            <li> The picture makes them look as if they have a better quality.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re able to get it on your face.</li>
            <li> I will use the product until I find something better.</li>
            <li> ABOUT 3 x&#x27;S MORE MAKEUP THAN THE WEDGES</li>
            <li> They were cheap and are effective.</li>
            <li> Because they absorb more, I tend to need to use more makeup when using them -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the product, my expectations were met and I don&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the product and the amount you get for the price.</li>
            <li> Any more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much, much, much better than using fingers.</li>
            <li> I blend everything with these, LOVE THE SIZE.</li>
            <li> I think this product is ok and it came as described, but the sponges do not feel as dense as what I buy in the store</li>
            <li> These work perfect for the extra detailing touch for any vehicle.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m spoiled to the smoother, better quality ones.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> These are great and working out really well.</li>
            <li> I am sure they would work as well or better on your face.  </li>
            <li> great purchase and fast shipment.</li>
            <li> I had to use more way more foundation.</li>
            <li> Okay I ordered 100 wedges at leats thats what this states</li>
            <li> My favorite make up sponge</li>
            <li> The texture of this product is a bit rougher and more absorbant than those I&#x27;m used to using.  </li>
            <li> Used to be able to get these in town, was so glad to find them on line.  </li>
            <li> nice sponges good texture soft with very fine pores.  </li>
            <li> Good price, but these have a funny smell to them.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and I probably will buy more, as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> These are a great value when working a large event, they are great for personal use as well.</li>
            <li> They feel more like a paper towel than the smooth as silk</li>
            <li> Great prize for so many of them:) I use this for liquid foundation, facial washes,and to wipe things off with makeup remover!</li>
            <li> These get the job done for sure, but the texture is not so friendly.</li>
            <li> These fall apart very quickly and need to be replaced after 1-2 uses.</li>
            <li> i go through these very quickly .</li>
            <li> It spreads the layers evenly on your skin and you can remove smudges off easily.  </li>
            <li> You WANT the wedges to absorb whatever drama that bottle of glitter nailpolish or cheap foundation has in store for you and only deposit the right amount of awesome.  </li>
            <li> it is what is said it was and look forward to working with them in my new makeup trunk and a good price.</li>
            <li> The wedge sponge for make up does not come in with a fine texture.</li>
            <li> This is fine if you&#x27;re applying cheap nailpolish, cheap foundation, or cheap eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li> These sponges are cheap, it&#x27;s great that you have a big bag, but what&#x27;s the point when they don&#x27;t blend like you want it to?</li>
            <li> I want a smooth feel when apply makeup...</li>
            <li> and I needed them on the cheap.   </li>
            <li> They were great for costume makeup and theatrical makeup.</li>
            <li> Does not apply make up smoothly, leaves streaks.</li>
            <li> These are a great buy when you consider what you get in a traditional retail package.</li>
            <li> LATEX FREE, hypoallergenic, A PURR-FECT product for make-up application.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I knew I was buying cheap foam</li>
            <li> Price is cheap.</li>
            <li> But hey, these are so cheap you might not mind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;very easy to clean an store</li>
            <li> The Amount is good and they are too soft on the skin</li>
            <li> Came right on time in a lovely purple package to hold them.</li>
            <li> The wedges that are intact are great, but many of them are unusable due to this flaw.</li>
            <li> Will be very useful for our textile conservation and cleaning project.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase and will purchase more products from this buyer in the future.</li>
            <li> they do exactly what they are supposed to do :)</li>
            <li> The wedges are fine and the value for the price is good, but several of the wedges in the package I received were damaged.</li>
            <li> Love the wedge they help with foundation and mistakes need another bag almost empty good choice if u buy them</li>
            <li> Merely good enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did not pay to much for these.</li>
            <li> Good for hygiene but don&#x27;t think this bag is going to last you forever.</li>
            <li> thanks for making them available and easy to get.</li>
            <li> Came quickly.</li>
            <li> Delivery very fast!</li>
            <li> Omg have these and have so many left because you can reuse and reuse em and clean them!</li>
            <li> These are my first and long time lovers and I continue loving them!</li>
            <li> The foam was disintegrating as I used it, on the first use!</li>
            <li> These are cheap, porous wedges that absorb too much of the foundation.</li>
            <li> For everyday use, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy and cheaply made</li>
            <li> I was looking for something for makeup, found it absorbed a lot of my makeup product.</li>
            <li> These are good, but you have to be careful when using</li>
            <li> You need Fresh sponges for each actor, for health reasons.</li>
            <li> Nice big bag of cosmetic wedges!  </li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected but ended up being perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good temporary product, and since a package comes with a lot, these will last you quite a while (depending on how much makeup you wear).</li>
            <li> Nice sponges but smaller than you would guess from the photo on the bag.  </li>
            <li> These wedges were so porous that they absorbed my foundation right into them.</li>
            <li> I bought these particular wedges mainly for the price, and they were good for the price, too, but I think you&#x27;d be better off buying slightly more expensive, albeit, better quality wedges.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re probably not saving me as much money as I originally thought.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know maybe their flimsiness makea them good for other purposes?</li>
            <li> The foundation I use these for soaks right through them.</li>
            <li> Although they are the right price for the quality, and they get the job done</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t absorb your makeup right away</li>
            <li> I have bought much larger sponges at the beauty supply store, which I actually like better for make up use, but if the smaller format of these cut sponges fit your needs then you will be happy with them.  </li>
            <li> I bought these to due nail art things (gradients, apply glitter more evenly) and they work perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> VERY REASONABLE PROCE, AND CAM BE WASHED OUT AND USED AAGAIN.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using cosmetic wedges like this one for years now and they have their pros and cons, but this particular one is a great bargain at a little over $7 for 100-count bag.</li>
            <li> up a decent amount of foundation into a new wedge/sponge, but after that initial &#x27;soak&#x27; it is good</li>
            <li> Exactly what my granddaughter was looking for.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> These wedges work OK, but their texture is rougher and they absorb more makeup than others I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> and sometimes it can be difficult to figure out what is best  to use.</li>
            <li> They do exactly what they&#x27;re meant to.  </li>
            <li> and they have a funny smell.</li>
            <li> Work very well for what I need them for!</li>
            <li> If you instead prefer tailored application, consistent performance, or a semi-absorbent wedge, I&#x27;d suggest going with a brand name.</li>
            <li> Wedges are very soft and it is exactly  what I was expecting!</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I think it may be allowing for a more even application because instead of leaving streaks its more likely to absorb product.  </li>
            <li> They came quick and rhey are so soft.</li>
            <li> These sponges would be good for removing makeup and exfoliating your face but they are not very good for applying makeup which is what I bought the sponges for: applying makeup.  </li>
            <li> These sponges would be good for removing makeup and exfoliating your face but they are not very good for applying makeup which is what I bought the sponges for: applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I order the large bag since I use it for both purposes.  </li>
            <li> I always have a ton of uses for these from putting on make up to &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; something that demands a gentle touch.</li>
            <li> Compared to the ones I&#x27;ve picked up in my local drug store, these are not as smooth to the touch.  </li>
            <li> The liquid makeup just seeps straight through.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really crappy quality.</li>
            <li> really like nothing I&#x27;ve ever smelled before.  </li>
            <li> rough, not like the sponges i purchased at the drug store, more porous</li>
            <li> These are very low-quality, even for my standards.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much .</li>
            <li> They are very porious and flimsy.  </li>
            <li> The sponges are too porous and soak up too much product.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I feel it&#x27;s absorbing my concealer off my face instead of blending it.</li>
            <li> resistant, does not fall apart or absobe to much</li>
            <li> besides that they are not very expensive</li>
            <li> The shipping is super fast and you can&#x27;t get a bigger bag for the value.</li>
            <li> Found that the foundation just absorbed into the pad and barely made it to my face.</li>
            <li> Not sure whose product \\&quot;Honest</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay, but really cheap and thin.</li>
            <li> It was decent quality and they got the job done.</li>
            <li> I bought the beauty blenders much to my regret and waste of money as they did for me nothing better than these wedges do.</li>
            <li> For the purpose that I bought these sponges, they perform adequately, but they are not the same quality of the &amp;#34;bulk&amp;#34; sponges I would buy from, say, Target&#x27;s brand.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly to do nail art sponging...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the high quality claim.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Product seeps through other side of wedge very quickly.</li>
            <li> They were a bit rough on my skin and didn&#x27;t spread so smoothly.</li>
            <li> I should have bought make-up wedge at target as I normally did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I normally use when I apply some shimmer on my legs.</li>
            <li> right now I want the rest of the wedges or my money back</li>
            <li> it is very soft and moves a lot when i want fix the concealer</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it&#x27;s because I am used to using brushes most of the time</li>
            <li> Pretty simple - the wedges are puffy and flexible.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and gental on your skin and work like unafordable sponges!</li>
            <li> My only problem with it was that you do get what you pay for, meaning that the sponge itself is slightly more porous than I expected as a professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li> Pretty standard wedges.</li>
            <li> Product was just as expected, and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super thin and cheap.</li>
            <li> They are not stiff.</li>
            <li> The large sponge clumps are actually square pieces that pull apart into two wedges.  </li>
            <li> Spend a little more money and buy sponges that are actually useable.</li>
            <li> Uniform wedge shape - no problem there,    a little wider than the more expensive kind.  </li>
            <li> However, these were much lighter weight than I expected, very pourous, so they soak up a lot of cosmetics, and tend to shred a bit when applying make-up.  </li>
            <li> I am also surprised the sponge didn&#x27;t swell up when whet</li>
            <li> Wedges provide a different texture on card stock in comparison to using ink straight from the ink pad.</li>
            <li> These are soft durable sponges.  </li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t mind, really.</li>
            <li> These wedges are too soft to apply foundation.</li>
            <li> On the one hand, I think this may result in wasted product over time and not as comfortable a feel on application.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product, not sure if I&#x27;ll get it again or return to my previous brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to wet these in water first before using them to put my bb cream on.</li>
            <li> Came exactly how I expected it to!</li>
            <li> Yes, people would usually use it for make-up, but Ilike to use them for special nail art design.</li>
            <li> I like to use a fresh sponge everyday to prevent bacteria build-up.</li>
            <li> When they say latex free them mean it.  </li>
            <li> For me d wedges are too small and fragile, but I guess I expected more.</li>
            <li> However, these sponges are very porous and rough, very similar to a kitchen dish sponge.  </li>
            <li> However, these sponges are very porous and rough, very similar to a kitchen dish sponge.</li>
            <li> they have been very hard to fine</li>
            <li> Poor quality, falls apart easily.</li>
            <li> If using these on   other people (who expect very soft plush texture) look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> You can also use these wedges to apply versa mark clear ink to stencils especially in small detailed areas.</li>
            <li> Product is so inferior, rough, tears easily, and not good for makeup application on me or my clients.</li>
            <li> These sponges are not very dense and are cut much smaller than standard makeup wedges.  </li>
            <li> The sponges arrived with the package open and loose all over the box.  </li>
            <li> I dab a little foundation and a little moisturizer (Pevonia creme) on the narrow end of the sponge for smooth application.</li>
            <li> It also made my foundation look patchy especially when used wet.</li>
            <li> These wedges work well enough, but I find them to be rough.  </li>
            <li> However the feeling   is very very gritty and rough on the face.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time fan of wedges for makeup application.</li>
            <li> The sponge is not smooth like a latex sponge, and I found it difficult to apply my make up smoothly with this sponge.  </li>
            <li> The sponge is not smooth like a latex sponge, and I found it difficult to apply my make up smoothly with this sponge.</li>
            <li> These babies are so rough and porous.</li>
            <li> Texture is a bit rough.</li>
            <li> used this when I apply foundation primer and foundation and feels too rough on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also they are firm enough to cut up if I need to make, say teeth for fxmakeup.</li>
            <li> Poor quality and very porous.</li>
            <li> I use them a few times and then onto the next one.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t firm enough compared to what they look like.</li>
            <li> They also fall apart before you get your foundation applied and are rough like the other reviewers have reported.</li>
            <li> on the other hand will be looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> You can usually use one wedge for 2 or 3 different colors without contaminating another color.</li>
            <li> but if you are working with other people having a bag of them is a must...</li>
            <li> Works well for applying concealer and other makeups.</li>
            <li> I have to use two at once to keep the makeup from seeping through to my fingers on the other side.</li>
            <li> These are decent but fall apart easily and smell horrible</li>
            <li> The sponges are a little rough but seeing as I am using them on myself</li>
            <li> Texture is a little rough on you face.</li>
            <li> they are a little rough but some people like that.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> But not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Horrible smell but still good</li>
            <li> These sponges sort of soak it up, liquid foundation doesn&#x27;t go on thick enough with these.</li>
            <li> Have quite an odd smell</li>
            <li> Mess on your hands.</li>
            <li> terrible, much too soft, not even enough strength to put the makeup on</li>
            <li> Flimsy, poor quality, I can&#x27;t even bare to use them...</li>
            <li> The shape fits into tight spaces.  </li>
            <li> This is one of those things that just makes life a little easier.</li>
            <li> And while I don&#x27;t need 100 makeup sponges, these little guys are versatile to use for non-makeup purposes too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> IT WILL EAT UP YOUR ENTIRE BOTTLE IN A FEW DAYS !!!</li>
            <li> Whatever it is made out of is not smooth.</li>
            <li> WASTED MY MAKEUP.  </li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I really like using this product the one thing that&#x27;s bad</li>
            <li> Your missing out if you dont have these!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money!</li>
            <li> I USUALLY USED.  </li>
            <li> wedge design makes it easier to get even coverage, especially small areas (like inner eye)&lt;br /&gt;Can</li>
            <li> I use cosmetic wedges every day but these are made of something different and they had a weird smell.  </li>
            <li> To start, they&#x27;re excessively &amp;#34;absorbent&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have really small hands.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews (I read them all the time tho)</li>
            <li> Super porous! Makes them terrible for putting foundation on!</li>
            <li> These are a little thin</li>
            <li> I feel the sponge sucks up the makeup</li>
            <li> Very small.</li>
            <li> not very easy to use, make the face looks fake with BB cream</li>
            <li> I thought that these were going to be the same quality of the ones I usually buy, but I was disappointed when I realized that they were so spongy compared to the ones I like.</li>
            <li> Not a good product for even application.</li>
            <li> These sponges are not good for make up applications.</li>
            <li> have a really bad smell, small in size, not for makeup use, if you want to apply foundation woth it, it would go all the way to the other side of the wedge.</li>
            <li> but I find these wedges very hard to use.</li>
            <li> One side for base + powder blending, other side for eye shadows, small end for blushers.</li>
            <li> Poor quality cosmetic sponge.</li>
            <li> Personally, i hate those collapsible non-sponges that they sell in big boxes and pharmacies these days!</li>
            <li> Are you tired of wasting product by spraying it everywhere ?</li>
            <li> They do have an unusual smell but nothing terrible.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so thin and a bit scratchy.</li>
            <li> Ended up wasting expensive foundation and decided to stick to my liquid foundation brush.</li>
            <li> But I ordered the wrong ones.</li>
            <li> They also smell weird and ate up my makeup.</li>
            <li> A Fail, Its Sticky &amp; Splotchy</li>
            <li> But From Time To Time I Retry &amp; It Still Fails, Even My Friend Didn&#x27;t Like It.</li>
            <li> should have read the review by M. Davis below which basically sums up how bad this are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are terrible and make it difficult to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> but I was so upset and disappointed with this product I needed to share.</li>
            <li> Was very unhappy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I use these wedges to apply base makeup.</li>
            <li> These things have an awful texture that make them impossible to use for foundation makeup</li>
            <li> The texture is horrifying.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> They smell awful.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE !!</li>
            <li> Horrible!  </li>
            <li> Those are terrible.</li>
            <li> nail art ot have terrible smell.</li>
            <li> They also have this awful smell</li>
            <li> Very bad quality!</li>
            <li> Horrible!!</li>
            <li> These are horrible!</li>
            <li> They smell horrible.</li>
            <li> And the quality it&#x27;s horrible!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I am not sure if it&#x27;s because I am used to using brushes most of the time but I find these wedges very hard to use. they are a bit flimsy and doesnt have a good grip to it. It also made my foundation look patchy especially when used wet. I am also surprised the sponge didn&#x27;t swell up when whet it just stayed the same size. anyways I will keep practicing I may get better results soon.</li>
            <li> I love these! They are good quality and it&#x27;s such a good price!!!</li>
            <li> I always have a ton of uses for these from putting on make up to &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; something that demands a gentle touch.</li>
            <li> I use these to create gradients for nail art. For this purpose they are really exceptional.</li>
            <li> I like because these can be considered disposable...very inexpensive, so use once then toss - so no washing of these...Nice!</li>
            <li> These areconvenient to buy ad use, and I use them every day.  thanks for making them available and easy to get.</li>
            <li> Super porous! Makes them terrible for putting foundation on!</li>
            <li> Compared to the ones I&#x27;ve picked up in my local drug store, these are not as smooth to the touch.  The texture feels a bit gritty.  I would not recommend.  I want a smooth feel when apply makeup...this did not provide that.</li>
            <li> I definitely will not be buying these again. They smell awful. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the high quality claim. These babies are so rough and porous. The liquid makeup just seeps straight through.</li>
            <li> I use this product for manicures, and it works great.  Brush polish onto cosmetic wedge, and press onto part or your entire nail. I get the best results from OPI glitter polish.</li>
            <li> The foundation I use these for soaks right through them. I bought them because I didnt have time to go to Ulta and get the nice ones. I would recommend getting the pack of 100 from Ulta and they work much better.</li>
            <li> Wedges are very soft and it is exactly  what I was expecting! Delivery very fast! I am buying again when I need.</li>
            <li> I use these for foundation application.  They are soft and do a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> The wedges are fine and the value for the price is good, but several of the wedges in the package I received were damaged. They were perforated so that when I tried to use the wedges they would come apart. The wedges that are intact are great, but many of them are unusable due to this flaw.</li>
            <li> Texture is a bit rough. Good for art products. I was looking for something for makeup, found it absorbed a lot of my makeup product.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really crappy quality.</li>
            <li> These sponges are not very dense and are cut much smaller than standard makeup wedges.  Throwing out the package and will not buy again.</li>
            <li> These are cheap, porous wedges that absorb too much of the foundation. I don&#x27;t like them. So now, I just use my fingers for my foundation anyway.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look the way they look in the picture. The picture makes them look as if they have a better quality. Although they are the right price for the quality, and they get the job done</li>
            <li> These wedges work well enough, but I find them to be rough.  They feel more like a paper towel than the smooth as silk feel I&#x27;ve come to expect in cosmetic wedges.</li>
            <li> Pretty simple - the wedges are puffy and flexible. They don&#x27;t absorb your makeup right away so you&#x27;re able to get it on your face. I still prefer to use a brush though.</li>
            <li> Horrible smell but still good</li>
            <li> This is not what I am use to.  Whatever it is made out of is not smooth. I will use the product until I find something better.</li>
            <li> Very good value. I like to use a fresh sponge everyday to prevent bacteria build-up. I actually prefer the Katz sponges but can&#x27;t find them anymore. These are good, but you have to be careful when using so you don&#x27;t get streaky or blotchy foundation application.</li>
            <li> I really like using this product the one thing that&#x27;s bad is I feel the sponge sucks up the makeup</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and I probably will buy more, as soon as possible. It is really nice.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my granddaughter was looking for. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Smaller than what I thought they would be but they work good for what I needed them for.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price!</li>
            <li> Omg have these and have so many left because you can reuse and reuse em and clean them! They are so soft and gental on your skin and work like unafordable sponges! Great prize for so many of them:) I use this for liquid foundation, facial washes,and to wipe things off with makeup remover! Your missing out if you dont have these!</li>
            <li> The wedge sponge for make up does not come in with a fine texture. It leaves marks on my face after I used that for liquid foundation. Price is also not the best.</li>
            <li> Good price - they don&#x27;t come apart and liquid doesn&#x27;t soak into them like some I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> very low quality. I should have bought make-up wedge at target as I normally did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this when I apply foundation primer and foundation and feels too rough on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so I normally use when I apply some shimmer on my legs.</li>
            <li> Product is VERY cheap. It&#x27;s not a makeup quality sponge. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money!</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE !! WASTED MY MAKEUP.  IT SOAKS UP ABOUT 3 x&#x27;S MORE MAKEUP THAN THE WEDGES I USUALLY USED.  BUYER BEWARE.  IF YOU ARE USING THESE TO APPLY FOUNDATION, DO NOT GET THESE.. IT WILL EAT UP YOUR ENTIRE BOTTLE IN A FEW DAYS !!!</li>
            <li> Very good value! As we apply make-up at a Halloween event each year, we go thru a lot of these. You need Fresh sponges for each actor, for health reasons. These are a great value when working a large event, they are great for personal use as well. All in all a nice, well made, quality sponge at a great value!</li>
            <li> Poor quality, falls apart easily.</li>
            <li> Wanted to use this product for liquid foundation. Found that the foundation just absorbed into the pad and barely made it to my face. Ended up wasting expensive foundation and decided to stick to my liquid foundation brush.</li>
            <li> Well, I needed a lot of these and I needed them on the cheap.   Got what I paid for.  Uniform wedge shape - no problem there,    a little wider than the more expensive kind.  However the feeling   is very very gritty and rough on the face. I&#x27;m only using them  for myself, so it&#x27;s something that I can put up with - doesn&#x27;t   seem to effect the application of make up. If using these on   other people (who expect very soft plush texture) look elsewhere.  Merely good enough.</li>
            <li> Horrible!  Breaks apart while using it.</li>
            <li> The sponges are a little rough but seeing as I am using them on myself I don&#x27;t mind. They were cheap and are effective. Also they are firm enough to cut up if I need to make, say teeth for fxmakeup.</li>
            <li> Great for nail art! Thank you!</li>
            <li> These are decent but fall apart easily and smell horrible</li>
            <li> I use these for nail art. They work well</li>
            <li> Not a good product for even application. Just pieces of foam.</li>
            <li> These wedges work well for putting on make-up. They are a good size and inexpensive. They work well because you can toss them when done preventing bacteria build-up that can harm your skin.This is one of those things that just makes life a little easier. I keep them on the bathroom counter in a decorative glass container. I will be buying more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money. They are terrible and make it difficult to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for single-use wedges that will get makeup all over your fingers, you&#x27;ve found them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I on the other hand will be looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> They were great for costume makeup and theatrical makeup. I was a fairy in Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream and it required a lot of makeup, and these were great for application and easily disposable.</li>
            <li> they do exactly what they are supposed to do :)</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. Product seeps through other side of wedge very quickly. Mess on your hands. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> These wedges work OK, but their texture is rougher and they absorb more makeup than others I have purchased in the past.  Because they absorb more, I tend to need to use more makeup when using them - so they&#x27;re probably not saving me as much money as I originally thought.</li>
            <li> Too thin for me but cheap</li>
            <li> Poor quality and very porous. Does not apply make up smoothly, leaves streaks.</li>
            <li> These wedges were so porous that they absorbed my foundation right into them. Was very unhappy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The sponges arrived with the package open and loose all over the box.  They also fall apart before you get your foundation applied and are rough like the other reviewers have reported.</li>
            <li> These wedges I received were the ones described.  But I ordered the wrong ones.</li>
            <li> They sponges smell horrendous-- really like nothing I&#x27;ve ever smelled before.  I&#x27;ve never smelled a cadaver but I&#x27;d have to assume this is what these sponges smell like.  They also absorb all of the foundation and transfer none on to your skin.  Spend a little more money and buy sponges that are actually useable.</li>
            <li> I love them!! They are perfect for nail art! Yes, people would usually use it for make-up, but Ilike to use them for special nail art design.</li>
            <li> I purchased these wedges to use with distressed ink &amp; stencils for cards and mixed media. You can usually use one wedge for 2 or 3 different colors without contaminating another color. Wedges provide a different texture on card stock in comparison to using ink straight from the ink pad. You can also use these wedges to apply versa mark clear ink to stencils especially in small detailed areas. Although these are cosmetic wedges, I would recommend them for various art projects. They can start to shred with a lot of use so it&#x27;s best to limit a wedge to 2 or 3 colors before discarding it and using a new wedge.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these for doing nail designs!  They work perfectly for what she wants them to do.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Pretty good! I have to wet these in water first before using them to put my bb cream on.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, great!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay, but really cheap and thin. I&#x27;m glad I did not pay to much for these.</li>
            <li> Poor quality cosmetic sponge.</li>
            <li> Satisfactory. Does the job.</li>
            <li> These are a great buy for the money and quantity. They apply makeup perfectly and they work better than those colored &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; sponges. Those are terrible. My only problem with it was that you do get what you pay for, meaning that the sponge itself is slightly more porous than I expected as a professional makeup artist. For everyday use, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Nice big bag of cosmetic wedges!  These are a great buy when you consider what you get in a traditional retail package.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the product, my expectations were met and I don&#x27;t regret this purchase. Happy I bought it. AJW</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the product and the amount you get for the price. The reason I&#x27;m giving this product a 3 is because it smells funky.</li>
            <li> nice product, good quality.</li>
            <li> have a really bad smell, small in size, not for makeup use, if you want to apply foundation woth it, it would go all the way to the other side of the wedge. it is very soft and moves a lot when i want fix the concealer so it doesn&#x27;t work at all for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i gave it two stars because it works good for nail art. definitely not going to buy it again even for nail art ot have terrible smell.</li>
            <li> rough, not like the sponges i purchased at the drug store, more porous</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest, there are a LOT of makeup application sponges out there and sometimes it can be difficult to figure out what is best  to use. I&#x27;ve been using cosmetic wedges like this one for years now and they have their pros and cons, but this particular one is a great bargain at a little over $7 for 100-count bag. And while I don&#x27;t need 100 makeup sponges, these little guys are versatile to use for non-makeup purposes too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The wedge design makes it easier to get even coverage, especially small areas (like inner eye)&lt;br /&gt;Can use to achieve the ombre nail polish look&lt;br /&gt;Can use for costume or sx makeup&lt;br /&gt;Can use for art/craft projects&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Can &#x27;crumble&#x27; apart, especially on an older/well-used wedge&lt;br /&gt;Soaks up a decent amount of foundation into a new wedge/sponge, but after that initial &#x27;soak&#x27; it is good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend and feel this is a great bargain versus drugstore prices. And eventually I will order again once I use up all 100 of them.</li>
            <li> Texture is a little rough on you face.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to everyone .. are of very good quality and very beautiful .. besides that they are not very expensive</li>
            <li> Good for a one or two time use. Any more and they shred, leaving white bits on your face.</li>
            <li> These fall apart very quickly and need to be replaced after 1-2 uses. Good for hygiene but don&#x27;t think this bag is going to last you forever.</li>
            <li> This product applies my makeup really good and also removes it.  I order the large bag since I use it for both purposes.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love the wedge they help with foundation and mistakes need another bag almost empty good choice if u buy them</li>
            <li> I used these to spread foundation on my face instead of using my fingers. It was decent quality and they got the job done. They were a bit rough on my skin and didn&#x27;t spread so smoothly. I bought these particular wedges mainly for the price, and they were good for the price, too, but I think you&#x27;d be better off buying slightly more expensive, albeit, better quality wedges.</li>
            <li> Came right on time in a lovely purple package to hold them. Has 100 as the title states, and they are perfect for whatever you will be using them for!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super thin and cheap. They also have this awful smell so I won&#x27;t use them on my face, maybe to take off nail polish.</li>
            <li> They do exactly what they&#x27;re meant to.  I use them to apply primer, moisturizer, sometime concealer, foundation, etc...  It&#x27;s much, much, much better than using fingers.</li>
            <li> I use these for blending mixed media art projects and they work well. The shipping is super fast and you can&#x27;t get a bigger bag for the value.</li>
            <li> 100 for the cost of 30     i like to use these to apply make up then use makeup brushes to blend in the makeup</li>
            <li> Did not like the material it was made of, which did not hold the makeup as desired.</li>
            <li> nice sponges good texture soft with very fine pores.  Handy triangular shape for most any job at the makeup table.  These are a great deal!</li>
            <li> Does the job for my wifes Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> Not sure whose product \\&quot;Honest Consumer\\&quot; was writing about, but I have used these exclusively for a couple of years now and exclusively via Amazon. LATEX FREE, hypoallergenic, A PURR-FECT product for make-up application. I blend everything with these, LOVE THE SIZE. One side for base + powder blending, other side for eye shadows, small end for blushers. I don&#x27;t use make-up every day, but when I do, this is IT. Personally, i hate those collapsible non-sponges that they sell in big boxes and pharmacies these days! THANKFUL for THESE WONDER WEDGES!</li>
            <li> THESE ARE WONDERFUL FOR APPLYING LOTIONDS AND CREAMS.  VERY REASONABLE PROCE, AND CAM BE WASHED OUT AND USED AAGAIN.</li>
            <li> Perfect for applying foundation or blending makeup.</li>
            <li> Have used these for years without any problems. I have both rosacea and a latex sensitivity. I dab a little foundation and a little moisturizer (Pevonia creme) on the narrow end of the sponge for smooth application. Am re-ordering now...</li>
            <li> Product was just as expected, and shipped quickly. Will be very useful for our textile conservation and cleaning project. Great!</li>
            <li> I think this product is ok and it came as described, but the sponges do not feel as dense as what I buy in the store and they have a funny smell.</li>
            <li> I did not care for these at all.  I use cosmetic wedges every day but these are made of something different and they had a weird smell.  In the trash they went.</li>
            <li> i did not order these for makeup. infact, i wouldnt use them for makeup, i tried with my foundation and it doesnt blend well. i use them for blending nail polish for my nail clients. does its job in that department!</li>
            <li> I have been a long time fan of wedges for makeup application. I bought the beauty blenders much to my regret and waste of money as they did for me nothing better than these wedges do. These wedges perform just as good job as the promises of the beauty blenders and better for a fraction of the price! These are my first and long time lovers and I continue loving them!</li>
            <li> The price is good!  However, these were much lighter weight than I expected, very pourous, so they soak up a lot of cosmetics, and tend to shred a bit when applying make-up.  Probably won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> The material is good, not too cheat. Great for makeup application.</li>
            <li> not very easy to use, make the face looks fake with BB cream</li>
            <li> These work perfect for the extra detailing touch for any vehicle. Are you tired of wasting product by spraying it everywhere ? We own a very high end seasonal detail business and these work perfect for all those nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li> After I purchased these I discovered they were latex. I have no problem with latex but beware if you do.</li>
            <li> Have quite an odd smell</li>
            <li> Cheaply made. Falls apart immediately. Will never order again.</li>
            <li> These are very low-quality, even for my standards. The foam was disintegrating as I used it, on the first use! They also smell weird and ate up my makeup. They might work for nail polish, but don&#x27;t bother if tour want to put on makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using these for samples of stuff that I give out.  Work very well for what I need them for!</li>
            <li> They do their job. I use them for costume makeup.</li>
            <li> Very bad quality! Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> I thought that these were going to be the same quality of the ones I usually buy, but I was disappointed when I realized that they were so spongy compared to the ones I like. I will try them out and see if they work just as well. It is nice that they come in bulk.</li>
            <li> I knew I was buying cheap foam but these were&lt;br /&gt;Worse than the cheaper options at the store.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much . They came quick and rhey are so soft.</li>
            <li> I used this for blending my liquid foundation. They work well. I also used them for applying blush and it looked great.</li>
            <li> I use wedges when I put on make up almost daily they have been very hard to fine so I decided to order them from Amazon and I am very pleased that I did and that I ordered two packages. Yes meet every expectation</li>
            <li> The Amount is good and they are too soft on the skin</li>
            <li> Very flimsy and cheaply made</li>
            <li> They work as well as you could hope. Pretty standard wedges.</li>
            <li> These sponges are made in the US, and that is a plus for me.  However, these sponges are very porous and rough, very similar to a kitchen dish sponge.  These sponges would be good for removing makeup and exfoliating your face but they are not very good for applying makeup which is what I bought the sponges for: applying makeup.  Now I have 99 of these sponges that I may not use.  The sponge is not smooth like a latex sponge, and I found it difficult to apply my make up smoothly with this sponge.  For make up application I don&#x27;t recommend this sponge, and I won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> Good price, but these have a funny smell to them.</li>
            <li> A lil too foamy &amp; pore -us....</li>
            <li> I use these wedges to apply base makeup. I like to use the wedge several times, front and back, before throwing them out. These are very light and flimsy. Sometimes I only get one use because they would split.</li>
            <li> These makeup sponges are great in the sense that there are a TON of them at a great price.  For the purpose that I bought these sponges, they perform adequately, but they are not the same quality of the &amp;#34;bulk&amp;#34; sponges I would buy from, say, Target&#x27;s brand.  To start, they&#x27;re excessively &amp;#34;absorbent&amp;#34;.  This is fine if you&#x27;re applying cheap nailpolish, cheap foundation, or cheap eyeshadow.  You WANT the wedges to absorb whatever drama that bottle of glitter nailpolish or cheap foundation has in store for you and only deposit the right amount of awesome.  If you have a purpose that will require you to absorb a lot of drama from your cosmetic applications, these sponges are for you. If you instead prefer tailored application, consistent performance, or a semi-absorbent wedge, I&#x27;d suggest going with a brand name.</li>
            <li> Product is so inferior, rough, tears easily, and not good for makeup application on me or my clients. Waste of my money!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have read the review by M. Davis below which basically sums up how bad this are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;These sponges are made in the US, and that is a plus for me. However, these sponges are very porous and rough, very similar to a kitchen dish sponge. These sponges would be good for removing makeup and exfoliating your face but they are not very good for applying makeup which is what I bought the sponges for: applying makeup. Now I have 99 of these sponges that I may not use. The sponge is not smooth like a latex sponge, and I found it difficult to apply my make up smoothly with this sponge. For make up application I don&#x27;t recommend this sponge, and I won&#x27;t order it again.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The texture is horrifying. It gets the job done but I&#x27;m spoiled to the smoother, better quality ones. These get the job done for sure, but the texture is not so friendly.</li>
            <li> These are a little thin but if you are working with other people having a bag of them is a must... i go through these very quickly .</li>
            <li> Nice size bag. Came quickly.</li>
            <li> Bought This For My Nails To Do Ombre Effects &amp; It Was A Fail, Its Sticky &amp; Splotchy It Could Be A Matte Nail Polish &amp; Still Wouldn&#x27;t Go On Fully. I Don&#x27;t Remember The Shipping Because It Was Sometime Last Year &amp; Now Remembering To Do A Review. But From Time To Time I Retry &amp; It Still Fails, Even My Friend Didn&#x27;t Like It.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected but ended up being perfect for my needs. They do have an unusual smell but nothing terrible. I use them a few times and then onto the next one. Love them.</li>
            <li> These are great and working out really well. There is NO smell at all. This is the first time I have ever used sponges for make up and they are very nice. They are not stiff. They are quite flexible. If you need a stiffer sponge, you would need a tear shaped blending sponge.</li>
            <li> They are very porious and flimsy.  When foundation is put on the wedge and applied to the face, it leaves lines and doesn&#x27;t apply well.</li>
            <li> The sponges are too porous and soak up too much product.  I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> these appear rectangular in the bag in the product photo. they are actually triangles still stuck together. i thought they would be bulkier. i couldn&#x27;t find the sponges i like best so i go these. they are a little rough but some people like that.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time. I am very pleased with my purchase and will purchase more products from this buyer in the future.</li>
            <li> Price is cheap. But not worth the money. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Works well for applying concealer and other makeups. It spreads the layers evenly on your skin and you can remove smudges off easily.  Each wedge only lasts a number of times before it begins to shred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good temporary product, and since a package comes with a lot, these will last you quite a while (depending on how much makeup you wear).</li>
            <li> Love these...easy to use!</li>
            <li> Very small. I have really small hands.</li>
            <li> These are soft durable sponges.  The shape fits into tight spaces.  I am using these to help apply handles to pottery mugs and they work great leaving a smooth surface.  I am sure they would work as well or better on your face.  They are nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;A lot like memory foam texture.</li>
            <li> These sponges are not good for make up applications. They aren&#x27;t firm enough compared to what they look like. Definitely a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I bought these to due nail art things (gradients, apply glitter more evenly) and they work perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> it is what is said it was and look forward to working with them in my new makeup trunk and a good price.</li>
            <li> great purchase and fast shipment.</li>
            <li> These kinda suck. They&#x27;re so thin and a bit scratchy. Sometimes I feel it&#x27;s absorbing my concealer off my face instead of blending it. But hey, these are so cheap you might not mind. I actually don&#x27;t mind, really.</li>
            <li> The package arrived half-sealed. Some wedges came out of the bag and left in the packaging box. For sanitary purpose, I got rid of those unsealed wedges. These wedges are too soft to apply foundation. I would not buy these again.</li>
            <li> These things have an awful texture that make them impossible to use for foundation makeup</li>
            <li> For me d wedges are too small and fragile, but I guess I expected more. As opposed to what I had previously.&lt;br /&gt;I got no choice than to use it.</li>
            <li> Came exactly how I expected it to!😊👍</li>
            <li> Horrible!! I bought these to apply liquid foundation and do not recommend this item for that purpose! I don&#x27;t know maybe their flimsiness makea them good for other purposes? For liquid foundation application they&#x27;re too flimsy compared to any I&#x27;ve ever used. I had to use more way more foundation. These sponges sort of soak it up, liquid foundation doesn&#x27;t go on thick enough with these. Sponges from Walmart, Walgreens even the dollar tree are better! I don&#x27;t usually write reviews (I read them all the time tho) but I was so upset and disappointed with this product I needed to share.</li>
            <li> great price, glad I bought them.</li>
            <li> These are horrible! They smell horrible. They smell like you rubbed a bunch of latex gloves on your face!  And the quality it&#x27;s horrible! I used 1 and threw the bag away!</li>
            <li> terrible, much too soft, not even enough strength to put the makeup on, they fall apart!!!!!</li>
            <li> Best wedges you can buy, I use mine for nail art</li>
            <li> Okay I ordered 100 wedges at leats thats what this states I only got six so im livid right now I want the rest of the wedges or my money back</li>
            <li> Flimsy, poor quality, I can&#x27;t even bare to use them...so I don&#x27;t. I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I use these to do stenciling. They aren&#x27;t quite as &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; as I might have wanted but, they do the job.</li>
            <li> I was tasked to do my cousin&#x27;s bridesmaids&#x27; makeups for her wedding and these wedges worked great. They are not porous and very easy to use to apply foundation. My finished products all looked gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Good quality, good density, good value.  My favorite make up sponge and I love that I can buy it in this quantity!</li>
            <li> I do not like these. I have to use two at once to keep the makeup from seeping through to my fingers on the other side.</li>
            <li> These sponges are cheap, it&#x27;s great that you have a big bag, but what&#x27;s the point when they don&#x27;t blend like you want it to?</li>
            <li> Nice sponges but smaller than you would guess from the photo on the bag.  The large sponge clumps are actually square pieces that pull apart into two wedges.  I have bought much larger sponges at the beauty supply store, which I actually like better for make up use, but if the smaller format of these cut sponges fit your needs then you will be happy with them.  I just wish they were a tiny bit larger.</li>
            <li> awesome price for amount of sponges.  works great w liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> excelent price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very resistant, does not fall apart or absobe to much product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for foundation and blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very easy to clean an store</li>
            <li> The texture of this product is a bit rougher and more absorbant than those I&#x27;m used to using.  On the one hand, I think this may result in wasted product over time and not as comfortable a feel on application.  On the other hand, I think it may be allowing for a more even application because instead of leaving streaks its more likely to absorb product.  Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product, not sure if I&#x27;ll get it again or return to my previous brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good value though.</li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly to do nail art sponging...this sponge is smooth and is good for blending the colours. Definitely a good buy. I would recommend this to anyone...</li>
            <li> Used to be able to get these in town, was so glad to find them on line.  When they say latex free them mean it.  Plus great for putting makeup on...doesn&#x27;t have that rubbery feel or smell.</li>
