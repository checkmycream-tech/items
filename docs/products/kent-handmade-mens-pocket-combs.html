            <li>Great deal for the price</li>

            <li>Great combs but cheaper ones would probably be just as good.</li>
            <li>I gave these as stalking stuffers for my spouse and he loved them.  </li>

            <li>Package got to me quick, the Kent combs are awesome!</li>
            <li>These are amazing.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always happy with how smoothly they go through my hair.</li>
            <li>And let me tell you, they are SO NICE.</li>
            <li>Nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t pull any hairs out when you use them which is nice when you are combing your face.</li>
            <li>Top quality and feels good in the hand and running them through my hair and beard.</li>
            <li>Nice comb set.</li>
            <li>Nice comb set.</li>
            <li>Easy to lose I guess, but good for JUST the mustache.</li>
            <li>Great quality, no disappointment there.  </li>
            <li>The largest comb was able to straighten out my beard hairs without pulling them, and I used the medium comb for my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this set and would recommend it to anyone with hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they will be used for many years to come.  </li>
            <li>but they feel so much better for hair and beard work than you cheapo combs.</li>
            <li>I will sometimes decide to use this instead of my boar brush, but not often :)  </li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this comb ...</li>
            <li>Glad I bought them.</li>
            <li>Mustache comb is a favorite.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this for my beard</li>
            <li>The middle one is perfect for my beard.</li>
            <li>They really feel great, like a massage</li>
            <li>The combs themselves are great!&lt;br /&gt;Anyone with a beard and mustache would love them.</li>
            <li>Solid comb set, and perfect for face fur</li>
            <li>Everything you would expect from a comb:)</li>
            <li>Buy it!:)</li>
            <li>Very nice set of combs, work very well.</li>
            <li>These combs are great, and of high quality.</li>
            <li>Do not accept anything but the original!</li>
            <li>most comfortable combs to use</li>
            <li>He said these are really smooth and make his beard more manageable.</li>
            <li>I never knew that a good comb would really make a difference.</li>
            <li>some can be lost easily.</li>
            <li>The words do rub off really easily</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and product met my expectations!</li>
            <li>great deal, using the r7t as my daily pocket comb for stache and beard, the 10t is a bit fine for my beard and the moustache comb tends to rip out hairs when I use wax.</li>
            <li>Nice little set of combs, great quality.</li>
            <li>The two larger are great for running through my silky smooth beard hair.</li>
            <li>The combs scream plastic, and appear too cheap for a gift.  </li>
            <li>I was instructed to throw away my cheap plastic combs if I didn&#x27;t want them splitting my beard that I was trying to grow.</li>
            <li>After using all three, the smallest is tiny but it is great for taming my lip scarf.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t feel flimsy or cheap.</li>
            <li>The feel, the weight, the smooth edges.</li>
            <li>They are smooth and don&#x27;t pull at your hair.</li>
            <li>Goes through hair smoothly</li>
            <li>After using cheap combs for my mustache and hair, these were like a massage compared to the scratching feeling of a cheap comb.</li>
            <li>Fantastic set of combs.</li>
            <li>I use them primarily on my beard.</li>
            <li>High quality, smooth and durable set of combs perfect for grooming and maintaining facial hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t rinse off the oil, and when I&#x27;m in a hurry it tames my beard pretty famously.</li>
            <li>So glad I searched Amazon first</li>
            <li>Seriously, it is a quality product, good finish, comfortable, good feel.</li>
            <li>these combs are great, I use them every single day</li>
            <li>These make a really great gift because when the person uses them for the first time, they know immediately how different they are.  </li>
            <li>Everthing was as discribed and full met my expectations.</li>
            <li>Never thought I would spend this much on combs, but I absolutely love them all.</li>
            <li>They are definitely worth the added cost versus cheap combs.</li>
            <li>Quality is apparent, love these combs!</li>
            <li>I will from now on be a loyal customer of this comb company.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are far better quality and don&#x27;t pul your hair as they comb it like cheap plastic molded combs do.</li>
            <li>, It makes a difference as it makes you feel more sophisticated to have such a well made object.  </li>
            <li>Worth the buy.</li>
            <li>So worth the money of you</li>
            <li>This is such a nice brand of combs.</li>
            <li>Looks right.</li>
            <li>Feels right.</li>
            <li>Is Right.</li>
            <li>I probably didn&#x27;t really need the middle sized comb, but it&#x27;s nice to have in the arsenal</li>
            <li>once tame, I switch to the finer side to clean areas up and give it a nice uniform</li>
            <li>Really!</li>
            <li>He is fond of all 3 of them for different purposes but the mustache comb is the favorite.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be shopping for more combs and brushes now that I am aware there is a big difference that the quality makes.</li>
            <li>great combs, really surprised I haven&#x27;t lost the little one yet.</li>
            <li>It may not seem like much but a real handmade comb just feels right.</li>
            <li>Okay I owned one comb that I probably got for $1 somewhere a long time ago.</li>
            <li>Great price compared to other brands and those &amp;#34;suggested wooden beard grooming utensils&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>A large comb would be about an eight inch comb, which I already have , and use every day and is kept in the medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li>Great set glide through my thick beard with easy and minimal damage.</li>
            <li>and I would have liked the maybe to be etched in just to add a little quality but for the price I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>I should have noted the sizes more carefully.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a cheap comb for the last year on my beard.  </li>
            <li>Quality combs really do make a difference.  </li>
            <li>Kent&#x27;s combs are gentle on the skin/scalp.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very well made.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like these that much.</li>
            <li>There is definitely something to be said for these hand made and smooth buffed combs.</li>
            <li>I really like these combs.</li>
            <li>very sturdy</li>
            <li>I bought this comb set for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Have a nice heft to them without being heavy.</li>
            <li>The moustache comb is useless unless you&#x27;d like to keep one on the go, and it&#x27;d be nice to see a bit more of a variance in size.  </li>
            <li>the ridiculously small comb works perfectly to work mustache wax and to shape the mustache; the dual tine and the fine tined combs both work excellently to tame my curly, inch long beard.</li>
            <li>He has a big full beard and always complains about combs snagging and pulling on it.</li>
            <li>But wow, once you use these you can&#x27;t go back to cheap combs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product I already received today all the 3 combs are just special the little one fits into the wallet to have on hand at any moment I already paid what I request!!!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend .</li>
            <li>The material that it&#x27;s made of is highly durable.</li>
            <li>~ The 81T.  Absolutely love this little thing.  </li>
            <li>I could tell right away that they were a solid, well-made product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never go back back to using a cheap comb again.</li>
            <li>They are smooth from the tip and all the way down each tooth.</li>
            <li>I use the small comb on my moustache, and the medium sized comb has been so good to my beard (don&#x27;t comb it wet.</li>
            <li>Those old cheap combs we always had are very pokey, they rip out my hairs, and they get dirty easily.  </li>
            <li>Forget those old crappy combs you have and get these.</li>
            <li>Just picking up a Kent comb you can feel the quality and realistically for only a few bucks more.</li>
            <li>I finally got tired of it and decided that I needed to buy a good one.</li>
            <li>Wow, who thought a nice comb could be a game changer?</li>
            <li>I rarely use the largest comb, but totally would if my hair or beard got that long, but we&#x27;re not there, yet.</li>
            <li>The little tiny guy fits into my wallet so I can easily take it everywhere.</li>
            <li>High quality, and should last if taken care of.</li>
            <li>so the small comb is not very useful for me, but the other two work great for my goatee.</li>
            <li>The smallest one is REALLY small and pretty much just a mustache comb.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve only lost one so far.</li>
            <li>It is so smooth going through my thick beard.  </li>
            <li>Other combs I have used pull at my beard with their sharp edges, but these Kent combs glide right through.</li>
            <li>Never leave home with at least one of these awesome bad boys</li>

            <li> The two larger are great for running through my silky smooth beard hair.</li>
            <li> The combs scream plastic, and appear too cheap for a gift.  </li>
            <li> I was instructed to throw away my cheap plastic combs if I didn&#x27;t want them splitting my beard that I was trying to grow.</li>
            <li> After using all three, the smallest is tiny but it is great for taming my lip scarf.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t feel flimsy or cheap.</li>
            <li> The feel, the weight, the smooth edges.</li>
            <li> They are smooth and don&#x27;t pull at your hair.</li>
            <li> Goes through hair smoothly</li>
            <li> After using cheap combs for my mustache and hair, these were like a massage compared to the scratching feeling of a cheap comb.</li>
            <li> Fantastic set of combs.</li>
            <li> I use them primarily on my beard.</li>
            <li> High quality, smooth and durable set of combs perfect for grooming and maintaining facial hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t rinse off the oil, and when I&#x27;m in a hurry it tames my beard pretty famously.</li>
            <li> So glad I searched Amazon first</li>
            <li> Seriously, it is a quality product, good finish, comfortable, good feel.</li>
            <li> these combs are great, I use them every single day</li>
            <li> These make a really great gift because when the person uses them for the first time, they know immediately how different they are.  </li>
            <li> Everthing was as discribed and full met my expectations.</li>
            <li> Never thought I would spend this much on combs, but I absolutely love them all.</li>
            <li> They are definitely worth the added cost versus cheap combs.</li>
            <li> Quality is apparent, love these combs!</li>
            <li> I will from now on be a loyal customer of this comb company.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are far better quality and don&#x27;t pul your hair as they comb it like cheap plastic molded combs do.</li>
            <li> , It makes a difference as it makes you feel more sophisticated to have such a well made object.  </li>
            <li> Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> So worth the money of you</li>
            <li> This is such a nice brand of combs.</li>
            <li> Looks right.</li>
            <li> Feels right.</li>
            <li> Is Right.</li>
            <li> I probably didn&#x27;t really need the middle sized comb, but it&#x27;s nice to have in the arsenal</li>
            <li> once tame, I switch to the finer side to clean areas up and give it a nice uniform</li>
            <li> Really!</li>
            <li> He is fond of all 3 of them for different purposes but the mustache comb is the favorite.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be shopping for more combs and brushes now that I am aware there is a big difference that the quality makes.</li>
            <li> great combs, really surprised I haven&#x27;t lost the little one yet.</li>
            <li> It may not seem like much but a real handmade comb just feels right.</li>
            <li> Okay I owned one comb that I probably got for $1 somewhere a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Great price compared to other brands and those &amp;#34;suggested wooden beard grooming utensils&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> A large comb would be about an eight inch comb, which I already have , and use every day and is kept in the medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li> Great set glide through my thick beard with easy and minimal damage.</li>
            <li> and I would have liked the maybe to be etched in just to add a little quality but for the price I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I should have noted the sizes more carefully.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a cheap comb for the last year on my beard.  </li>
            <li> Quality combs really do make a difference.  </li>
            <li> Kent&#x27;s combs are gentle on the skin/scalp.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very well made.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like these that much.</li>
            <li> There is definitely something to be said for these hand made and smooth buffed combs.</li>
            <li> I really like these combs.</li>
            <li> very sturdy</li>
            <li> I bought this comb set for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Have a nice heft to them without being heavy.</li>
            <li> The moustache comb is useless unless you&#x27;d like to keep one on the go, and it&#x27;d be nice to see a bit more of a variance in size.  </li>
            <li> the ridiculously small comb works perfectly to work mustache wax and to shape the mustache; the dual tine and the fine tined combs both work excellently to tame my curly, inch long beard.</li>
            <li> He has a big full beard and always complains about combs snagging and pulling on it.</li>
            <li> But wow, once you use these you can&#x27;t go back to cheap combs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product I already received today all the 3 combs are just special the little one fits into the wallet to have on hand at any moment I already paid what I request!!!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend .</li>
            <li> The material that it&#x27;s made of is highly durable.</li>
            <li> ~ The 81T.  Absolutely love this little thing.  </li>
            <li> I could tell right away that they were a solid, well-made product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back back to using a cheap comb again.</li>
            <li> They are smooth from the tip and all the way down each tooth.</li>
            <li> I use the small comb on my moustache, and the medium sized comb has been so good to my beard (don&#x27;t comb it wet.</li>
            <li> Those old cheap combs we always had are very pokey, they rip out my hairs, and they get dirty easily.  </li>
            <li> Forget those old crappy combs you have and get these.</li>
            <li> Just picking up a Kent comb you can feel the quality and realistically for only a few bucks more.</li>
            <li> I finally got tired of it and decided that I needed to buy a good one.</li>
            <li> Wow, who thought a nice comb could be a game changer?</li>
            <li> I rarely use the largest comb, but totally would if my hair or beard got that long, but we&#x27;re not there, yet.</li>
            <li> The little tiny guy fits into my wallet so I can easily take it everywhere.</li>
            <li> High quality, and should last if taken care of.</li>
            <li> so the small comb is not very useful for me, but the other two work great for my goatee.</li>
            <li> The smallest one is REALLY small and pretty much just a mustache comb.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only lost one so far.</li>
            <li> It is so smooth going through my thick beard.  </li>
            <li> Other combs I have used pull at my beard with their sharp edges, but these Kent combs glide right through.</li>
            <li> Never leave home with at least one of these awesome bad boys</li>
            <li> From the rave reviews I mistakenly assumed they were much larger, a small medium and large comb set.</li>
            <li> I tried using my old comb this morning, and it felt very rough in comparison, so I won&#x27;t be doing that again.</li>
            <li> 2 pocket sized combs and a small precision moustache comb are very conveniently sized and portable.</li>
            <li> Only negative, which isn&#x27;t really one, is the marking begin to fade with use.</li>
            <li> I keep in the center console of 4runner, and use it multiple times daily.  </li>
            <li> After 6+ months of daily use, I have yet to have a single tooth chip off, and I have got some thick/beastly hair (both on my face and scalp!)</li>
            <li> The long comb is what I use while applying my beard oil each morning, and it works wonders with helping spread it evenly throughout.</li>
            <li> Due to the small size they are unsuitable for a large hand.  </li>
            <li> I started growing my beard out and found that it just continually pulled at the hair and was rough on my face.</li>
            <li> how well made these are and how much different they are from the usual plastic combs.  </li>
            <li> Built like every other kent brush.</li>
            <li> Wet follicles are delicate and you can still pull some hairs out, stealing bushiness), especially when I apply some beard oil in there.</li>
            <li> Buy kent combs, you&#x27;ll realize how bad those cheap plastic combs form the supermarket are after using these once.</li>
            <li> The smallest one is useless unless you have a mustache or a small mouse to comb but the price was right for all three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These won&#x27;t scratch your scalp, and go through your hair smoother then your typical combs.</li>
            <li> is something ever goes missing.</li>
            <li> I use two of them everyday</li>
            <li> He uses them everyday with beard balm and his beard isn&#x27;t as unruly as it used o be.</li>
            <li> A man&#x27;s got needs when he is bored in traffic!!! :)</li>
            <li> The combs are way too small for a mans hand. .  </li>
            <li> There is no more hair pulling or face scratching with this set.</li>
            <li> I have never felt even one catch in my beard yet, and I usually get catches continually while combing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used molded combs my entire life, and never thought anything was wrong with them.</li>
            <li> No more ripping beard hairs out with 99 cent combs.</li>
            <li> This comb gets the least amount of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly</li>
            <li> These combs appear to clean the hair as they comb and they also spread the oils around in the hair without getting all nasty on the inside somehow.  </li>
            <li> have very thick hair to comb through.</li>
            <li> I find myself reaching for it when bored in traffic or need those whispy&#x27;s tamed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably doing it wrong.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> great set...no complaints</li>
            <li> The combs are way too small for a mans hand. .  From the rave reviews I mistakenly assumed they were much larger, a small medium and large comb set. A large comb would be about an eight inch comb, which I already have , and use every day and is kept in the medicine cabinet.  I have no need for two petite pocket combs.  I should have noted the sizes more carefully.  Due to the small size they are unsuitable for a large hand.  I am returning the combs.  I had ordered two sets as gifts.  The combs scream plastic, and appear too cheap for a gift.  As a gift the combs could  be mistaken as having been bought from a dollar store, so they have been sent back.</li>
            <li> perfect kit to start grooming your beard. well made and feels great</li>
            <li> Purchased this in order to comb my beard when it was getting out of hand. The largest comb was able to straighten out my beard hairs without pulling them, and I used the medium comb for my hair. I like them a lot. They seem to be made of durable plastic, I&#x27;ve left them in my back pocket without breaking them. Only negative, which isn&#x27;t really one, is the marking begin to fade with use. Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> My son loves the 3 comb set for use on his beard and hair.  One to keep in his car, one on his person, and one at home.  The package arrived as advertised.</li>
            <li> all shapes and sizes come in handy!</li>
            <li> Okay I owned one comb that I probably got for $1 somewhere a long time ago. I started growing my beard out and found that it just continually pulled at the hair and was rough on my face. I finally got tired of it and decided that I needed to buy a good one. These had great reviews, so I decided to give them a try. I could tell right away that they were a solid, well-made product. They are smooth from the tip and all the way down each tooth. There is no more hair pulling or face scratching with this set. The mustache comb is a must have, and I never leave home without it. I probably didn&#x27;t really need the middle sized comb, but it&#x27;s nice to have in the arsenal is something ever goes missing. The long comb is what I use while applying my beard oil each morning, and it works wonders with helping spread it evenly throughout. I love this set and would recommend it to anyone with hair.</li>
            <li> These combs are great. I can&#x27;t wait to use the mustache comb.</li>
            <li> I gave these as stalking stuffers for my spouse and he loved them.  I&#x27;m sure they will be used for many years to come.  I must for any gent expecially those with facial hair too.</li>
            <li> I have been using a cheap comb for the last year on my beard.  These combs are great.  I do not get any snags or pulls as i use them.  It is so smooth going through my thick beard.  So worth the money of you have very thick hair to comb through.</li>
            <li> This set is perfect for a man&#x27;s beard arsenal. the ridiculously small comb works perfectly to work mustache wax and to shape the mustache; the dual tine and the fine tined combs both work excellently to tame my curly, inch long beard. I have never felt even one catch in my beard yet, and I usually get catches continually while combing. All in all, excellent products for a good price.</li>
            <li> great combs, really surprised I haven&#x27;t lost the little one yet.</li>
            <li> Quality combs really do make a difference.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it but they feel so much better for hair and beard work than you cheapo combs.</li>
            <li> these combs are great, I use them every single day and I don&#x27;t know how I lived without them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and it&#x27;s counterfeit (replica). DON&#x27;T BUY. The finish and the lettering it&#x27;s just not a finish quality that a company like Kent would do.</li>
            <li> Everthing was as discribed and full met my expectations.</li>
            <li> Purchased the Comb Set of 3 several months ago.  This is a 6+ month review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First ~ The 81T.  Absolutely love this little thing.  I keep in the center console of 4runner, and use it multiple times daily.  I find myself reaching for it when bored in traffic or need those whispy&#x27;s tamed.  I&#x27;ve also been known to dig it deep in to my chin hair and let it hang for several minutes at a time.  A man&#x27;s got needs when he is bored in traffic!!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next Up ~ The FOT.  This stay&#x27;s in my drawer in the bathroom.  I don&#x27;t use this one often, accept when applying beard oil/condition.  I will sometimes decide to use this instead of my boar brush, but not often :)  This comb gets the least amount of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly ~ The R7T.  Use this with Layrite Brown Tub Pomade.  Absolutely LOVE this comb ... I start with the larger side, once tame, I switch to the finer side to clean areas up and give it a nice uniform look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all Kent products, these are well made, and a necessity for any man in his daily arsenal.  After 6+ months of daily use, I have yet to have a single tooth chip off, and I have got some thick/beastly hair (both on my face and scalp!)</li>
            <li> Great product! Works so well at combing through hair without damaging it! Really!</li>
            <li> Very nice set of combs, work very well.</li>
            <li> Well made, quality set of combs.  Glad I bought them.</li>
            <li> great deal, using the r7t as my daily pocket comb for stache and beard, the 10t is a bit fine for my beard and the moustache comb tends to rip out hairs when I use wax. I&#x27;m probably doing it wrong. Great material and manufacturing, teeth are perfect and not warping at all after months of use.</li>
            <li> I was instructed to throw away my cheap plastic combs if I didn&#x27;t want them splitting my beard that I was trying to grow. I bought this set and a can of beard oil, and also a shampoo and conditioner set with argan oil in it. I use the small comb on my moustache, and the medium sized comb has been so good to my beard (don&#x27;t comb it wet. Wet follicles are delicate and you can still pull some hairs out, stealing bushiness), especially when I apply some beard oil in there. I don&#x27;t rinse off the oil, and when I&#x27;m in a hurry it tames my beard pretty famously. I rarely use the largest comb, but totally would if my hair or beard got that long, but we&#x27;re not there, yet. Doubt I will be. Happy to have purchased.</li>
            <li> I want all of the combs they offer these are perfect for my husbands beard</li>
            <li> Beautiful combs! Perfect lil stocking stuffers. Arrived on time and was packaged with care.</li>
            <li> I bought these combs after growing a beard and committing to taking good care of it. And let me tell you, they are SO NICE. I&#x27;ve used molded combs my entire life, and never thought anything was wrong with them. However, after using these combs for just one day, I&#x27;ll never buy a molded comb again. Kent&#x27;s combs are gentle on the skin/scalp. They&#x27;re very well made.  I tried using my old comb this morning, and it felt very rough in comparison, so I won&#x27;t be doing that again. I&#x27;ll probably invest in another set just to have on hand, as I have a tendency to misplace combs.</li>
            <li> Great combs and I&#x27;ve only lost one so far.</li>
            <li> My husband said this was the lamest Christmas gift when he opened. Guess what? He uses these damn combs every.single.day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product I already received today all the 3 combs are just special the little one fits into the wallet to have on hand at any moment I already paid what I request!!!! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😉😉😉</li>
            <li> Great 3 pack of combs for beard care. After using all three, the smallest is tiny but it is great for taming my lip scarf. The two larger are great for running through my silky smooth beard hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back back to using a cheap comb again. These are amazing.</li>
            <li> This is such a nice brand of combs. They don&#x27;t feel flimsy or cheap. Have a nice heft to them without being heavy. Mustache comb is a favorite.</li>
            <li> Great combs...... Nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Great combs but cheaper ones would probably be just as good.</li>
            <li> Great combs, but some can be lost easily.</li>
            <li> Never thought I would spend this much on combs, but I absolutely love them all.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like these that much. But wow, once you use these you can&#x27;t go back to cheap combs. They are also incredibly sturdy. I can see them lasting years.</li>
            <li> Excellent set of quality combs. I use each one every day!</li>
            <li> I carry and use these combs daily.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it and keeps the medium size one in his pocket at all times!  He wanted to purchase them from the art of shaving which they are approx $25-$40 there, for 1!  So glad I searched Amazon first and he is very happy with this set.</li>
            <li> What a difference. The feel, the weight, the smooth edges. My lines look cleaner as well. So glad I bought this for my beard, he&#x27;s very happy.</li>
            <li> Loved all 3 sizes and the handmade quality can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Great set of combs and my beard loves them!</li>
            <li> Package shipped quicly. Combs are of great quality. A+</li>
            <li> I use this comb set for beard grooming and have been very happy with the results. They are definitely worth the added cost versus cheap combs. These don&#x27;t pull any hairs out when you use them which is nice when you are combing your face.</li>
            <li> Never leave home with at least one of these awesome bad boys</li>
            <li> These combs are great, and of high quality. The middle one is perfect for my beard.</li>
            <li> Other combs I have used pull at my beard with their sharp edges, but these Kent combs glide right through.</li>
            <li> These combs are awesome you feel the quality in your hand while you just hold the combs. The skill that the combs go through my hair is like a precision tool. I will from now on be a loyal customer of this comb company.</li>
            <li> Great combs, really good price! These won&#x27;t scratch your scalp, and go through your hair smoother then your typical combs.</li>
            <li> Kent combs are superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mustache comb is glorious.</li>
            <li> These combs are perfect for beards and all types of hair. I would definitely recommend these combs</li>
            <li> All of the essential combs for a beard or mustache in one set.  Excellent combs and sizes.  Go for it.</li>
            <li> These are perfect, but everyone already knows that. Buy kent combs, you&#x27;ll realize how bad those cheap plastic combs form the supermarket are after using these once.</li>
            <li> Forget those old crappy combs you have and get these. They are smooth and don&#x27;t pull at your hair. Great for your head of hair and your beard too.</li>
            <li> Kent combs are the BEST combs on earth.  Bar none.  Do not accept anything but the original!</li>
            <li> Gave on to my brother only needed two but it was a great deal</li>
            <li> Great set glide through my thick beard with easy and minimal damage. The words do rub off really easily and I would have liked the maybe to be etched in just to add a little quality but for the price I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Great set of combs, and they arrived in a timely fashion</li>
            <li> These are awesome combs! No more ripping beard hairs out with 99 cent combs. There is definitely something to be said for these hand made and smooth buffed combs. The smallest one is REALLY small and pretty much just a mustache comb. Easy to lose I guess, but good for JUST the mustache. I carry the middle one called the FOT in my pocket every day to comb my beard. Works like a charm!</li>
            <li> I really like these combs. The smallest one is useless unless you have a mustache or a small mouse to comb but the price was right for all three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the larger combs are pretty small.  Both are travel size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to buy another set as my son has taken the largest one from my bathroom. The one I have leftis the one I use in my travel kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are far better quality and don&#x27;t pul your hair as they comb it like cheap plastic molded combs do.</li>
            <li> My husband loves them.</li>
            <li> Wow, who thought a nice comb could be a game changer? I&#x27;ve been using crappy drug store brand combs for years on my beautiful Zeus like beard. What a mistake. Just picking up a Kent comb you can feel the quality and realistically for only a few bucks more.</li>
            <li> High quality, smooth and durable set of combs perfect for grooming and maintaining facial hair. 2 pocket sized combs and a small precision moustache comb are very conveniently sized and portable. Excellent value!</li>
            <li> Excellent combs. I use two of them everyday and I&#x27;m always happy with how smoothly they go through my hair.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and product met my expectations!</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect comb set for a man. Kent makes the best comb I&#x27;ve seen. Top quality and feels good in the hand and running them through my hair and beard. Spot on!!!</li>
            <li> Looks right. Feels right. Is Right.</li>
            <li> Great quality, no disappointment there.  The moustache comb is useless unless you&#x27;d like to keep one on the go, and it&#x27;d be nice to see a bit more of a variance in size.  I really only use the largest one</li>
            <li> Goes through hair smoothly</li>
            <li> Bought for the hubby and thought the 3 pack made a great deal.  He is fond of all 3 of them for different purposes but the mustache comb is the favorite.  He carries two with him, the mustache comb and the course/fine while leaving the third comb at home.  I use that third comb from time to time and now I must get some for myself.  I had no idea how well made these are and how much different they are from the usual plastic combs.  These make a really great gift because when the person uses them for the first time, they know immediately how different they are.  They really feel great, like a massage and they do not shred or split the hairs.  Those old cheap combs we always had are very pokey, they rip out my hairs, and they get dirty easily.  These combs appear to clean the hair as they comb and they also spread the oils around in the hair without getting all nasty on the inside somehow.  My hairs are not ripped out in the comb after combing.  Hubby&#x27;s beard is softer too.  You feel nicer holding these in your hand, It makes a difference as it makes you feel more sophisticated to have such a well made object.  I&#x27;ll be shopping for more combs and brushes now that I am aware there is a big difference that the quality makes.</li>
            <li> Nice comb set. High quality, and should last if taken care of.</li>
            <li> I am a convert now. I never knew that a good comb would really make a difference. After using cheap combs for my mustache and hair, these were like a massage compared to the scratching feeling of a cheap comb. This is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Awesome combs. My Beard loves them! The little tiny guy fits into my wallet so I can easily take it everywhere.</li>
            <li> Perfect combo for price</li>
            <li> Good build quality. very sturdy</li>
            <li> most comfortable combs to use</li>
            <li> Fantastic set of combs. I use them primarily on my beard.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy!  Quality is apparent, love these combs!</li>
            <li> Awesome! Delivered on time as stated with projected time. The combs themselves are great!&lt;br /&gt;Anyone with a beard and mustache would love them. Great price compared to other brands and those &amp;#34;suggested wooden beard grooming utensils&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a mustache so the small comb is not very useful for me, but the other two work great for my goatee.</li>
            <li> It may not seem like much but a real handmade comb just feels right. Definitely a durable quality comb set. I especially like the moustache comb. I highly recommend .</li>
            <li> Built like every other kent brush. Really solid and quality.</li>
            <li> Works great. Nice comb set.</li>
            <li> Package got to me quick, the Kent combs are awesome! I recommend them any dude growing a Beard!</li>
            <li> I bought this comb set for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it. He uses them everyday with beard balm and his beard isn&#x27;t as unruly as it used o be. The material that it&#x27;s made of is highly durable. He has kept the middle sized comb in his pocket for touch ups and it&#x27;s still intact.</li>
            <li> Good product, delivered as advertised</li>
            <li> Solid comb set, and perfect for face fur</li>
            <li> It is quality stuff. Everything you would expect from a comb:) Seriously, it is a quality product, good finish, comfortable, good feel. Buy it!:)</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband for Christmas. He has a big full beard and always complains about combs snagging and pulling on it. He said these are really smooth and make his beard more manageable. He&#x27;ll honestly sit there for hours and comb it if I didn&#x27;t mention how crazy he is. Great deal for the price and I&#x27;m happy he&#x27;s happy</li>
            <li> Nice little set of combs, great quality.</li>
