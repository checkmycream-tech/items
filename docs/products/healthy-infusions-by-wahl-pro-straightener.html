    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Your friends will be impressed!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is the best straightner</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is one of the best dryers she has used.</li>
            <li>and my style looks best when straightened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe one day I will get one of those $200 fancy irons, but for now this is perfect and since I don&#x27;t have money to burn I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li>This product is beautiful looking, and works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- very good value for the money</li>
            <li>The LCD screen allows you to control the temperature an the conditioning strips leave your hair shiny and beautiful.    </li>
            <li>Great thing about this is that after an hour, it shuts off automatically even if you aren&#x27;t using it.  </li>
            <li>My wife is very satisfied with this product, and I am happy it gets her out the door faster, so it&#x27;s good all around!</li>
            <li>The blue-glow of the LCD screen said, \\&quot;high-tech\\&quot; ... which I associated with \\&quot;superior product.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The width is good and it heated up in an acceptable amount of time.  </li>
            <li>The straightener is quite good without bothering with it.    </li>
            <li>This straightener comes with one conditioning strip good for aprox 20 applications.  </li>
            <li>and she loved it.  </li>
            <li>She considers it nearly as good as the Farouk Chi</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m probably like most women and use way more heat-based hair appliances than can possibly be good for one&#x27;s locks, the lower settings do an excellent job without the frying experience.    </li>
            <li>Imagine her joy when I presented her with the 1 ¼\\&quot; Healthy Infusions Pro Straightener by Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall we are fairly happy with the Wahl Healthy Infusions Pro Straightener.  </li>
            <li>The swivel cord is one of the nice details that make this a good deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used both Paul Mitchell and a Chi iron for straightening, and I liked the idea of the straightener \\&quot;protecting\\</li>
            <li>Moisture strip is a nice bonus -</li>
            <li>Swivel cord is nice  *</li>
            <li>The shut-off feature is also nice.  </li>
            <li>The auto-shutoff feature is nice too.    </li>
            <li>I have to say, I&#x27;m not a fan of putting any kind of product on my hair.</li>
            <li>I liked the swivel cord feature.</li>
            <li>I even tried letting the product warm up for longer than the 90 seconds recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This straightener is fine; it doesn&#x27;t burn the hair, and the comb attachment is very nice.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s my frugal nature, or the pretty results i got from the Wahl, but at this price point, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a very good investment indeed.</li>
            <li>It seems to be more efficient (and probably more cost effective) to use a spray conditioner</li>
            <li>/&gt;It warms up quickly, does a good job of drying your hair without damaging and seems to be well built.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this about one year or more</li>
            <li>- I didn&#x27;t use the Healthy Infusions by Walh Pro Straightner for about 6 months since I never bothered to flatten my hair after I washed it.</li>
            <li>ok, I did for the part on how to lock the heat setting [set your temperature, and then press and hold the button to lock it</li>
            <li>so the flattener opens up and starts safely heating up on the table while you prep your hair with gel or whatever.</li>
            <li>more flat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would like it to be able to change sides or flip it on the flattener,</li>
            <li>Healthy Infusion technology utilizing a conditioning attachment that holds the conditioning strip and comb to condition as you straighten.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I would like it to be able to change sides or flip it on the flattener,</li>
            <li>Healthy Infusion technology utilizing a conditioning attachment that holds the conditioning strip and comb to condition as you straighten.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Yea, because it&#x27;s OFF.&lt;br /&gt;- my hair feels nice and smooth after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This thing is suppose to &#x27;condition&#x27; and make my hair look better, not damage it!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I like the idea of a conditioning strip, but I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference to be honest.</li>
            <li>so I gave the Healthy Infusions a try.  </li>
            <li>You are able to control the heat within about a 200F degree range.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gave my hair more weight than I care for.</li>
            <li>Even still, I wish that the ingredients were more environmentally-friendly/healthy for hair.    </li>
            <li>I love the temperature</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is much sturdier and more attractive than the straighteners I&#x27;ve seen at beauty shops.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you like your hair tools to look designer, then you&#x27;ll love this hair straightener from Wahl.</li>
            <li>With all the sleekness and sophistication of Dolce &amp; Gabbana, this will look downright sexy just sitting on your vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It says 90 seconds, but I&#x27;d give it 5 minutes or more.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner also appears insufficient for any but the most well-conditioned hair with infrequent usage.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned to love it.  </li>
            <li>The comb did seem to help in making sure my hair was evenly distributed on the plates.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I was extremely pleased with the results of the Wahl&#x27;s Healthy Infusions Pro Straightener.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B001E6OCVC Healthy Infusions by Wahl Conditioning Strips (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was planning on giving 3 stars to this straightener, but my hair really did look great after using it, so it does deserve 4 stars.</li>
            <li>You have to buy more after that.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easily my favorite</li>
            <li>My husband said I looked like Britney, I said more like Gwyneth.  </li>
            <li>I use it with Wahl Healthy Infusion hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>wife and I have come to know Wahl as a manufacturer of quality hair trimming and styling products, so we were confident that this Healthy Infusions straightener would be a well built product.  </li>
            <li>product package included the 1 ¼\\&quot; Healthy Infusions Pro Straightener, with an attached comb and conditioning strip, as well as an operating manual and registration card.  </li>
            <li>I must add that on days when I use this I wash and condition with appropriate shampoo, I love the ones from GHD and when I use a heat spray ( Tresseme)</li>
            <li>First, the iron did a good job straightening my hair (thick/coarse), so I was pleased with that,</li>
            <li>/&gt;It heats relatively quickly and has a nice \\&quot;locking\\&quot; feature which stops you from accidentally changing the settings and frying your hair.  </li>
            <li>The weight is good, she is able to style her hair without much work.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly straight hair to start with but this really made it wonderful</li>
            <li>if I paid for this and didn&#x27;t get it from Vine for free I would love is as much as I love it now.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get the Healthy Infusions Pro Straightener by Wahl.</li>
            <li>The price is within the range of comparable hair straighteners, and I do like the comb attachment (even though it does come off too easily).  </li>
            <li>Easy to store since it can be camped</li>
            <li>This allows even heating on both plates, as well as easy storage with it</li>
            <li>can easily control the temperature (I used the highest, 410 degrees)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Overall we are fairly happy with the Wahl Healthy Infusions Pro Straightener.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so much that it combs your hair, but acts more like a guide to pull the hair taut between the tourmaline plates - a nice touch.    </li>
            <li>in all, it&#x27;s fine, though a bit pricey for what you get in my opinion.</li>
            <li>- and I was impressed that a cheaper straightener worked just as well, if not better, than my favorite CHI iron.</li>
            <li>for quick touch ups, it could be okay</li>
            <li>Wonderful blue back light LCD display shows the selected temperature setting up to 410 degrees, and a handy little guide to help you choose which setting is best for your type of hair.    </li>
            <li>I expected great results from the Wahl Healthy Infusions Pro Straightener.</li>
            <li>The iron is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It makes the hair bouncy and smooth to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really is a fantastic iron and the strips work wonders--notice a HUGE difference without them.</li>
            <li>To me that would be more useful, that way</li>
            <li>The locking mechanism on the end is also fabulous.</li>
            <li>Another thoughtful feature is that the plates \\&quot;lock&#x27; to make storage a breeze</li>
            <li>The conditioner stick on the end helped to smooth the layers</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold and is well balanced.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and even though the moisturizing strip makes the hair a tiny bit greasy</li>
            <li>The variable temperature settings and display were very useful.  </li>
            <li>This one has a more slick look to it, a lot more attractive if it&#x27;ll be sitting out in your bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li>found the hair straightener worked best at the higher range of the recommended temperatures and like the small comb attachment (wish it would stay attached better).  </li>
            <li>I received this today and was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>straightener seemed pretty self explanatory, but I still read through the directions just to be sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many of the higher end straighteners ($100 and up) over the years - Solano Sapphire, CHI, FHI, GHD, etc.)</li>
            <li>Let me explain: most flat irons have heating plates that extend fully from side-to-side, which allows you to \\&quot;flip\\&quot; the ends of your hair and use it as kind of a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>We have spent a great deal of money on special dryers with straighteners, curling irons, and straightening irons as well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not dangerous to leave the flattener on, or even if you accidently touch the flattener while it&#x27;s heating up, it&#x27;s still pretty safe to handle even on the hottest 410F setting.</li>
            <li>My hair came out pretty nice and straight after use.  </li>
            <li>It works much faster than a blow dryer, she is able to style her hair in 1/4 of the time compared to a dryer.    </li>
            <li>If she uses the recommended heat setting for her hair, she needs to run her hair through the straightener more than once, which then applies too much conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I am giving this product 4 stars, based on it doing a good job at straightening hair, and because of the digital controls, LCD display, and for the convenience of the conditioning feature when sometimes desired.  </li>
            <li>I am giving this product 4 stars, based on it doing a good job at straightening hair, and because of the digital controls, LCD display, and for the convenience of the conditioning feature when sometimes desired.  </li>
            <li>She liked the ability to test at a low temperature and raise it to what is needed she has fine hair and wanted to experiment and not cause damage.  </li>
            <li>swiveling cord does help for easier maneuvering of the iron in different positions, which is just next best to a cordless one.</li>
            <li>Even afterwards, it was adequate</li>
            <li>it heats up quickly and yes it is lightweight.</li>
            <li>It heats up fairly quickly and the hair glides through it without snagging.  </li>
            <li>I do like how it&#x27;s very easy to close, even when heated, as the latch is no where near the heating element.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I have no problems giving the Healthy Infusions Straightener a hearty recommendation - especially if you are looking for a great value on a non-salon quality product.</li>
            <li>Because of the healthy claim, I was hoping this flat iron would produce better results on my hair.     </li>
            <li>This hair straightener blends in needed moisture and conditioner in a very practical, easy way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I found the temperature of 275 to work and not singe my hair, so I haven&#x27;t use it with a higher heat yet , although I&#x27;m sure it will work for those with really stubborn hair.</li>
            <li>The Wahl Pro Pro Flat Iron Straightener 1 1/4\\&quot; is a great flat iron but is more on the pricey side.  </li>
            <li>The heat setting display isn&#x27;t kidding; this baby gets HOT when the dial is turned up!</li>
            <li>The iron includes a comb attachment which works great in helping to comb through your hair while straightening and the conditioning strip is a neat little gimmick.  </li>
            <li>I was able to style the right and left side just as easily.</li>
            <li>This unit is by FAR my favorite.  </li>
            <li>All in all I beleive it is definetly worth the money.</li>
            <li>Since I aspire to a pin-straight look (which is why I straighten rarely), I took my time with the Wahl ...</li>
            <li>love the blue LED light.</li>
            <li>Digital display is nice  </li>
            <li>Yes, they cost more but the results and professional quality justify the price for me.</li>
            <li>After a few times I was able to curl the ends under for a nice style.</li>
            <li>Located above the buttons is a nice backlit LCD display, which shows the selected temperature.  </li>
            <li>However, she is unsure of how useful the conditioning strips are at this point.  </li>
            <li>(I had to really clench the plates together to get them to fit right).  </li>
            <li>* Heated pretty quickly    </li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>The LCD makes it easier to set the right temperature.</li>
            <li>The installation manual includes instructions for assembling the comb/conditioner attachments, but ours were already attached to the straightener right out of the package.  </li>
            <li>&quot; straightening iron, she wanted to try a smaller iron to see if it would give her better control while providing adequate results.  </li>
            <li>The digital display, the swivel cord, multiple heat settings are nice features, but perhaps my favorite one is the attached comb.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND for the person who just sometimes wants to iron their hair, sometimes change up their hairstyle - easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND for the person who just sometimes wants to iron their hair, sometimes change up their hairstyle - easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So it does have some good qualities and is not a bad iron overall, but for the same price, I&#x27;d recommend the Jilbere.</li>
            <li>This is very important for me being I&#x27;m left handed, and I shut off my conair alll the time.</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast, about a minute.  </li>
            <li>Wahl also offers a 2\\&quot; version of the Healthy Infusions Pro Straightener, for those who desire the larger size.es the recommended heat setting for her hair, she needs to run her hair through the straightener more than once, which then applies too much conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It is far from being a perfect product, but my daughter and I feel it is above average and worthy of a recommendation.  </li>
            <li>It is far from being a perfect product, but my daughter and I feel it is above average and worthy of a recommendation.  </li>
            <li>It also boasts a speedy heat up time of 90 seconds or less, and is backed by an impressive 5-year limited warranty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and well, I really like it!</li>
            <li>Or you can redo the same parts to make sure it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>However, if your ironing your hair, and you accidently touch your head, it will sting a bit but overall pretty safe I think for teenagers and</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was the comb attachment, but it was happening even after removing it.</li>
            <li>It takes about 90 seconds to heat up, and once it is hot, it works like a charm.  </li>
            <li>I did like the digital display of being able to set the temperature</li>
            <li>(If you want to know if the conditioner is being applied, look at the hot plates after ironing a section of hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair was soft and smooth, so I&#x27;d like to think it helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first straightener was a Revlon that I paid about $20 for.</li>
            <li>the other hand, I love the comb feature!</li>
            <li>The conditioning strips alone would deter me from ever buying this product since that is just more money out of your pocket in the future.    </li>
            <li>that my daughter has used this device for over a week, she is fairly pleased with the overall performance.  </li>
            <li>This means plugging in and heating two products instead of one, and adding more time to her overall hair preparation.  </li>
            <li>This means plugging in and heating two products instead of one, and adding more time to her overall hair preparation.  </li>
            <li>When deciding what to take with her (given airline weight limitations on luggage), this was the first hair-care item that went into her suitcase.  </li>
            <li>overall, a very useful product!</li>
            <li>overall, a very useful product!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t go too fast, it works better if you heat up sections of your hair for a second or two.</li>
            <li>Overall, most of my hair was \\&quot;kind of straight\\&quot; except for the root area which was still a little unkempt.    </li>
            <li>otherwise the buttons are pretty easy to understand, and functional for left or right-handed</li>
            <li>otherwise the buttons are pretty easy to understand, and functional for left or right-handed</li>
            <li>This straightener works fine and has enough features to make the price very reasonable.</li>
            <li>The conditioner attachment does not do such a great job but there are other features that make this dryer an unbeatable deal for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even with that I&#x27;ve always been interested in experimenting with straight hair on a temporary basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That pretty much sums up the pro&#x27;s of this product.    </li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much considering the price range</li>
            <li>The digital temperature control and LCD display is a great high-tech feature, but that is about all that really stands out with this model, other than the conditioning attachment.  </li>
            <li>The digital temperature control and LCD display is a great high-tech feature, but that is about all that really stands out with this model, other than the conditioning attachment.  </li>
            <li>according to the settings for fine hair, it didn&#x27;t feel like it got hot enough so my hair didn&#x27;t get as straight as i&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>However, those with finer or wavy hair that is easily straightened may have a different experience.</li>
            <li>and I certainly won&#x27;t be spending the money to replace them.</li>
            <li>Definitely an upgrade from the cheapies you&#x27;d find at Walmart but a nice compromise for those who aren&#x27;t willing to dish out the big money for a straightener.</li>
            <li>these handy features do NOT help the fact that the product does not get hot enough to actually straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>* Handle lock latch and swivel cord with hanging hookair feeling nice and soft, not burnt or dry.</li>
            <li>I liked that it had a little LCD backlit screen to control the temperature, and also that you can lock it, so hitting the buttons won&#x27;t change the temp.</li>
            <li>but then I found some things about this iron that I didn&#x27;t like as much.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair and depend heavily on straight irons, straight iron accessories for my hair dryer and am a slave to it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>cannot really comment on the conditioning strips because I cannot tell a noticeable difference between when it is clamped on the unit and when it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>They practically give away printers because the real money is in the print cartridges.  </li>
            <li>The price of the Wahl is reasonable, but I guess I&#x27;m just spoiled.</li>
            <li>I have very wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I have always wondered what it would be like to have straight hair.</li>
            <li>comb/conditioner slip on seems cheaply made and doesn&#x27;t seem like it would last.</li>
            <li>The swivel cord made it much easier to maneuver while straightening and the lock keeps it shut during storage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is important to read the operating manual, as it explains how to remove and reinstall the conditioning/comb attachment, as well as illustrations for switching the comb and conditioning strip to different sides, depending on how you intend to hold the straightener.  </li>
            <li>She feels that the conditioning strip can be helpful, at times, but will probably not use it much.  </li>

            <li>the hair is really supermodel straight and stays that way all day.</li>
            <li>, the strip really makes no difference</li>
            <li>and yes, it looks nice with the blue digital LED display, yes</li>
            <li>Wahl also offers a 2\\&quot; version of the Healthy Infusions Pro Straightener, for those who desire the larger size.</li>
            <li>With the included comb it removes an entire step from the process and gives me a clean, straight look instead of the sometimes rushed look</li>
            <li>If the price were very much higher than it is, I&#x27;d say spend a few more bucks and go with a Babyliss or a Chi on sale, and after reading a lot of reviews.    </li>
            <li>This curling iron did about as well as my Conair or my T3 Tourmaline Wet to Dry (see my reviews on those products as well), not as good as my Jilbere.  </li>
            <li>Moreover, I question how for how long these strips will be available ...</li>
            <li>First let me say that I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>However, the innovations fall short of offering any true benefits.</li>
            <li>so I usually moisturize vigilantly on my own.</li>
            <li>It does do a decent job at straightening, but doesn&#x27;t really do any better job than my daughter&#x27;s previous straightener, which was half the cost of this Wahl Healthy Infusions Pro model.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s heavy duty, gets really hot and straightens the hair fast and easily.    </li>
            <li>heats up quickly, cools down quickly as well</li>
            <li>Even the boyfriend said my straightened hair looked nice, and girls know how their men hardly ever notice changes haha.     </li>
            <li>digital display gives you accurate temperature settings, so you can completely control the amount of heat being applied to your hair.</li>
            <li>As for the Wahl Healthy Infusions Straightener itself, she likes the product and plans to continue using it, but will also continue using her previous 2\\&quot; straightening iron, which has plates that allow her to flip out her hair without the need of using a separate curling</li>

            <li>I tried it on a curly wig that I have, because I have gotten my hair cut super short.  </li>
            <li>The extra features make the extra cost somewhat worthwhile, esp.</li>
            <li>The Wahl Pro Straightener makes a decent attempt at being a revolutionary straightener.</li>
            <li>This particular model utilizes an attachment, which holds a conditioning strip and a comb, allowing you to condition your hair as you straighten it.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>of the conditioning strip seems high, but the straightener doesn&#x27;t have to have the conditioning strip to work</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Definitely does take the frizz out, and leaves your hair feeling nice and soft, not burnt or dry.</li>
            <li>It required a little work on my end to section off hair but I enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>like that there&#x27;s a blue LED display, easy to read and buttons are small but easy to press</li>

            <li>First, a little background on my hair type because I think it is important in evaluating the product.</li>
            <li>Then when it&#x27;s ready, you just take some hair [not too much or too little] and then put it inside the Healthy Infusions flattener and slowly slide it along from the top to the end,</li>
            <li>/&gt;The more gimmicky conditioner strip was not as helpful  </li>
            <li>but I still went over my hair a few times and even then was not fully satisfied with the end result.  </li>
            <li>I normally slather on the heat protection cream, so</li>
            <li>However, we are not convinced that the conditioning feature of this straightener is really worth the added cost of the device, not to mention the ongoing cost one would have in constantly buying replacement strips.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, if you want just a good, regular, straightener that works, and don&#x27;t mind throwing away the extra attachment, then it&#x27;s not bad, but I personally don&#x27;t care much to pay extra for an attachment that I wouldn&#x27;t use again.r that works, and don&#x27;t mind throwing away the extra attachment, then it&#x27;s not bad, but I personally don&#x27;t care much to pay extra for an attachment that I wouldn&#x27;t use again.</li>
            <li>If I was in a hurry and just wanted a quick touch-up, I did feel less concern about not applying product first.  </li>
            <li>I find that a hot oil treatment once a week ( heat up coconut or olive oil for 20 seconds, spread on dry hair and keep as long as possible, then shampoo out twice and condition) is good enough and protects my hair for straightening.    </li>
            <li>I have straight, fairly thick hair, so I like using my straightening iron to contour the ends(in or out depending on my haircut) and just to make my hair more sleek and</li>
            <li>straightener had a lot of features that intrigued me: being able to pick how hot it goes and the built in conditioning strip both intrigued me because I worry that my current flat iron may damage or over dry my hair.</li>
            <li>I flat iron my hair on a daily basis as my hair is fine</li>
            <li>I purchased my old straightener for about $20 less, and I&#x27;ve certainly gotten my use out of it and been pleased with it overall.    </li>
            <li>I typically use a wet/dry straightener for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I know if it is getting hot enough.  </li>
            <li>The product does not get hot enough to take the wave out of my hair- even on the hottest setting (the book said to use one of the coolest settings for my hair type- that was usless).</li>
            <li>She too thought it did not get hot enough to allow for styling- even on the hottest setting.</li>
            <li>When using the conditioner/comb attachment, the hair is supposed to pass through the comb first, then through the ceramic plates, and last over the conditioning strip.  </li>
            <li>, it made the hair look different, even my doorman noticed, asking what I did to it, funny considering I never got any comments from him on anything</li>
            <li>The flat iron looks wonderful, like something an expensive salon would use and charge you big bucks for.    </li>
            <li>The conditioning strip is supposed to last for approximately 20 full uses, and replacement strips can be purchased, in packs of 3, at local retailers and on the Internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So even though the plate is pretty large (length-wise), your hair is being straightened unevenly because you have no idea how much heat was transferred to the part on the bottom, which also ends up taking longer to straighten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was no \\&quot;burning\\&quot; smell when I flat ironed my hair and although the hair was still hot to the touch it didn&#x27;t feel like I was burning the life out of it.</li>
            <li>My wife is very particular about hair dryers, we have purchased about a dozen of them in the last two or three years including some higher-end models.</li>
            <li>The straightener has one large power button, and three smaller buttons, for temperature up/down adjustments and to lock the settings to prevent accidental setting changes while styling your hair.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just spoiled by my T3, but my voteis that since you are already paying a hefty price for this product why not invest a little more and get the T3 or a similar high-end, healthy-hair straightener.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just simple to use, you don&#x27;t even need to really read instructions...</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a bit of weight to the flattener, not too light or too heavy</li>
            <li>The whole thing is quite durable material and just simple to use and setup.</li>
            <li>The whole thing is quite durable material and just simple to use and setup.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that the straightener has different heat settings that you can control, and ceramic plates with a tourmaline additive.  </li>
            <li>most of them end up somehow damaging hair, or at least leaving it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(one thing my creaky old Conair lacks, and</li>
            <li>When using the spray moisturizer she found her hair comes out shiny and soft.    </li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised to see that the results weren&#x27;t reflected in the price.</li>
            <li>The small comb attachment seems to help keep the hair in the iron and is a good \\&quot;assist\\&quot; in going down the hair</li>
            <li>My hair dries into a very thick, natural wave and some days that&#x27;s fine, but sometimes I just want to tone it down a bit and make it more manageable and</li>
            <li>While it does heat up quickly it is not as fast as some other models (The Healthy Infusions takes about 5 minutes to heat up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The flat iron was much easier to use then.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t hold up to the healthy claim, as the conditioning strip seemed to be pretty useless.</li>
            <li>The flat iron did an OK job, but I don&#x27;t think it is any better or worse than other flat irons (could just be my hair type).</li>
            <li>However, when I clamped the straightener together, there was a noticeable gap on the bottom half of the heating plates, while the top half connected seamlessly</li>
            <li>Straighteners can range from pretty cheap to very expensive and having owned a few, I think this one fits nicely in the middle.</li>
            <li>I can see how a lot of people would enjoy this feature, but for me personally, I don&#x27;t like my hair to feel greasy or heavy with product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tiny LCD panel shows you the exact temperature (It includes a guide for different temperatures for different types of hair).</li>
            <li>On the bottom of the handle, right next to the attached power cord, is a slide clip, which is used to lock the straightener closed when not in use.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it did heat up high enough, but never retained enough heat after each pass.</li>
            <li>Until now, I have been using a professional grade straightener for the last two years.</li>
            <li>My hair was not as straight as I expected to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty thick and very curly</li>
            <li>I initially purchased this iron because it had big ceramic plates and didn&#x27;t know much about flat ironing my hair.</li>
            <li>this flat iron by far surpasses the others...</li>
            <li>As other reviewers noted the moisturizer strips don&#x27;t do a whole lot.  </li>
            <li>I have very thick, and very curly hair, I rarely straighten it because it is a pain to do, and never quite looks \\&quot;healthy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>There is no little lip or stand to hold the flat iron in place on the countertop.  </li>
            <li>My hair is about 3 inches below my shoulders, and very thick; this Wahl Pro straightener was just the right width, and worked very well on my coarser hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She also found that she has to select a fairly high heat setting, in order to achieve adequate straightening results with a single pass, even though her hair isn&#x27;t veryheavy or thick.  </li>
            <li>I tested this hair straightener on long, thick wavy hair and medium length fine hair, and set the temperatures within the ranges recommended by the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>I have long, dry, very coarse, very wavy, colored and highlighted hair.  </li>
            <li>, there&#x27;s really no reason not to get this straightener if you&#x27;re in the market for a new one.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and thin and I set up the temperature for that type of hair (225)</li>
            <li>She does say that when using the conditioning strip her hair tends to remain straight longer, and it gives a little added shine to her hair.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Your friends will be impressed!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is the best straightner</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one of the best dryers she has used.</li>
            <li> and my style looks best when straightened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe one day I will get one of those $200 fancy irons, but for now this is perfect and since I don&#x27;t have money to burn I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li> This product is beautiful looking, and works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- very good value for the money</li>
            <li> The LCD screen allows you to control the temperature an the conditioning strips leave your hair shiny and beautiful.    </li>
            <li> Great thing about this is that after an hour, it shuts off automatically even if you aren&#x27;t using it.  </li>
            <li> My wife is very satisfied with this product, and I am happy it gets her out the door faster, so it&#x27;s good all around!</li>
            <li> The blue-glow of the LCD screen said, \\&quot;high-tech\\&quot; ... which I associated with \\&quot;superior product.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The width is good and it heated up in an acceptable amount of time.  </li>
            <li> The straightener is quite good without bothering with it.    </li>
            <li> This straightener comes with one conditioning strip good for aprox 20 applications.  </li>
            <li> and she loved it.  </li>
            <li> She considers it nearly as good as the Farouk Chi</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m probably like most women and use way more heat-based hair appliances than can possibly be good for one&#x27;s locks, the lower settings do an excellent job without the frying experience.    </li>
            <li> Imagine her joy when I presented her with the 1 ¼\\&quot; Healthy Infusions Pro Straightener by Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall we are fairly happy with the Wahl Healthy Infusions Pro Straightener.  </li>
            <li> The swivel cord is one of the nice details that make this a good deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used both Paul Mitchell and a Chi iron for straightening, and I liked the idea of the straightener \\&quot;protecting\\</li>
            <li> Moisture strip is a nice bonus -</li>
            <li> Swivel cord is nice  *</li>
            <li> The shut-off feature is also nice.  </li>
            <li> The auto-shutoff feature is nice too.    </li>
            <li> I have to say, I&#x27;m not a fan of putting any kind of product on my hair.</li>
            <li> I liked the swivel cord feature.</li>
            <li> I even tried letting the product warm up for longer than the 90 seconds recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This straightener is fine; it doesn&#x27;t burn the hair, and the comb attachment is very nice.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my frugal nature, or the pretty results i got from the Wahl, but at this price point, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a very good investment indeed.</li>
            <li> It seems to be more efficient (and probably more cost effective) to use a spray conditioner</li>
            <li> /&gt;It warms up quickly, does a good job of drying your hair without damaging and seems to be well built.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this about one year or more</li>
            <li> - I didn&#x27;t use the Healthy Infusions by Walh Pro Straightner for about 6 months since I never bothered to flatten my hair after I washed it.</li>
            <li> ok, I did for the part on how to lock the heat setting [set your temperature, and then press and hold the button to lock it</li>
            <li> so the flattener opens up and starts safely heating up on the table while you prep your hair with gel or whatever.</li>
            <li> more flat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would like it to be able to change sides or flip it on the flattener,</li>
            <li> Healthy Infusion technology utilizing a conditioning attachment that holds the conditioning strip and comb to condition as you straighten.&lt;br /</li>

            <li> Healthy Infusion technology utilizing a conditioning attachment that holds the conditioning strip and comb to condition as you straighten.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Yea, because it&#x27;s OFF.&lt;br /&gt;- my hair feels nice and smooth after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This thing is suppose to &#x27;condition&#x27; and make my hair look better, not damage it!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I like the idea of a conditioning strip, but I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference to be honest.</li>
            <li> so I gave the Healthy Infusions a try.  </li>
            <li> You are able to control the heat within about a 200F degree range.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gave my hair more weight than I care for.</li>
            <li> Even still, I wish that the ingredients were more environmentally-friendly/healthy for hair.    </li>
            <li> I love the temperature</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is much sturdier and more attractive than the straighteners I&#x27;ve seen at beauty shops.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you like your hair tools to look designer, then you&#x27;ll love this hair straightener from Wahl.</li>
            <li> With all the sleekness and sophistication of Dolce &amp; Gabbana, this will look downright sexy just sitting on your vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It says 90 seconds, but I&#x27;d give it 5 minutes or more.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner also appears insufficient for any but the most well-conditioned hair with infrequent usage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to love it.  </li>
            <li> The comb did seem to help in making sure my hair was evenly distributed on the plates.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I was extremely pleased with the results of the Wahl&#x27;s Healthy Infusions Pro Straightener.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001E6OCVC Healthy Infusions by Wahl Conditioning Strips (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was planning on giving 3 stars to this straightener, but my hair really did look great after using it, so it does deserve 4 stars.</li>
            <li> You have to buy more after that.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easily my favorite</li>
            <li> My husband said I looked like Britney, I said more like Gwyneth.  </li>
            <li> I use it with Wahl Healthy Infusion hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> wife and I have come to know Wahl as a manufacturer of quality hair trimming and styling products, so we were confident that this Healthy Infusions straightener would be a well built product.  </li>
            <li> product package included the 1 ¼\\&quot; Healthy Infusions Pro Straightener, with an attached comb and conditioning strip, as well as an operating manual and registration card.  </li>
            <li> I must add that on days when I use this I wash and condition with appropriate shampoo, I love the ones from GHD and when I use a heat spray ( Tresseme)</li>
            <li> First, the iron did a good job straightening my hair (thick/coarse), so I was pleased with that,</li>
            <li> /&gt;It heats relatively quickly and has a nice \\&quot;locking\\&quot; feature which stops you from accidentally changing the settings and frying your hair.  </li>
            <li> The weight is good, she is able to style her hair without much work.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly straight hair to start with but this really made it wonderful</li>
            <li> if I paid for this and didn&#x27;t get it from Vine for free I would love is as much as I love it now.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get the Healthy Infusions Pro Straightener by Wahl.</li>
            <li> The price is within the range of comparable hair straighteners, and I do like the comb attachment (even though it does come off too easily).  </li>
            <li> Easy to store since it can be camped</li>
            <li> This allows even heating on both plates, as well as easy storage with it</li>
            <li> can easily control the temperature (I used the highest, 410 degrees)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Overall we are fairly happy with the Wahl Healthy Infusions Pro Straightener.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so much that it combs your hair, but acts more like a guide to pull the hair taut between the tourmaline plates - a nice touch.    </li>
            <li> in all, it&#x27;s fine, though a bit pricey for what you get in my opinion.</li>
            <li> - and I was impressed that a cheaper straightener worked just as well, if not better, than my favorite CHI iron.</li>
            <li> for quick touch ups, it could be okay</li>
            <li> Wonderful blue back light LCD display shows the selected temperature setting up to 410 degrees, and a handy little guide to help you choose which setting is best for your type of hair.    </li>
            <li> I expected great results from the Wahl Healthy Infusions Pro Straightener.</li>
            <li> The iron is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> It makes the hair bouncy and smooth to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really is a fantastic iron and the strips work wonders--notice a HUGE difference without them.</li>
            <li> To me that would be more useful, that way</li>
            <li> The locking mechanism on the end is also fabulous.</li>
            <li> Another thoughtful feature is that the plates \\&quot;lock&#x27; to make storage a breeze</li>
            <li> The conditioner stick on the end helped to smooth the layers</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold and is well balanced.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and even though the moisturizing strip makes the hair a tiny bit greasy</li>
            <li> The variable temperature settings and display were very useful.  </li>
            <li> This one has a more slick look to it, a lot more attractive if it&#x27;ll be sitting out in your bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li> found the hair straightener worked best at the higher range of the recommended temperatures and like the small comb attachment (wish it would stay attached better).  </li>
            <li> I received this today and was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> straightener seemed pretty self explanatory, but I still read through the directions just to be sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many of the higher end straighteners ($100 and up) over the years - Solano Sapphire, CHI, FHI, GHD, etc.)</li>
            <li> Let me explain: most flat irons have heating plates that extend fully from side-to-side, which allows you to \\&quot;flip\\&quot; the ends of your hair and use it as kind of a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> We have spent a great deal of money on special dryers with straighteners, curling irons, and straightening irons as well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not dangerous to leave the flattener on, or even if you accidently touch the flattener while it&#x27;s heating up, it&#x27;s still pretty safe to handle even on the hottest 410F setting.</li>
            <li> My hair came out pretty nice and straight after use.  </li>
            <li> It works much faster than a blow dryer, she is able to style her hair in 1/4 of the time compared to a dryer.    </li>
            <li> If she uses the recommended heat setting for her hair, she needs to run her hair through the straightener more than once, which then applies too much conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I am giving this product 4 stars, based on it doing a good job at straightening hair, and because of the digital controls, LCD display, and for the convenience of the conditioning feature when sometimes desired.  </li>

            <li> She liked the ability to test at a low temperature and raise it to what is needed she has fine hair and wanted to experiment and not cause damage.  </li>
            <li> swiveling cord does help for easier maneuvering of the iron in different positions, which is just next best to a cordless one.</li>
            <li> Even afterwards, it was adequate</li>
            <li> it heats up quickly and yes it is lightweight.</li>
            <li> It heats up fairly quickly and the hair glides through it without snagging.  </li>
            <li> I do like how it&#x27;s very easy to close, even when heated, as the latch is no where near the heating element.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I have no problems giving the Healthy Infusions Straightener a hearty recommendation - especially if you are looking for a great value on a non-salon quality product.</li>
            <li> Because of the healthy claim, I was hoping this flat iron would produce better results on my hair.     </li>
            <li> This hair straightener blends in needed moisture and conditioner in a very practical, easy way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I found the temperature of 275 to work and not singe my hair, so I haven&#x27;t use it with a higher heat yet , although I&#x27;m sure it will work for those with really stubborn hair.</li>
            <li> The Wahl Pro Pro Flat Iron Straightener 1 1/4\\&quot; is a great flat iron but is more on the pricey side.  </li>
            <li> The heat setting display isn&#x27;t kidding; this baby gets HOT when the dial is turned up!</li>
            <li> The iron includes a comb attachment which works great in helping to comb through your hair while straightening and the conditioning strip is a neat little gimmick.  </li>
            <li> I was able to style the right and left side just as easily.</li>
            <li> This unit is by FAR my favorite.  </li>
            <li> All in all I beleive it is definetly worth the money.</li>
            <li> Since I aspire to a pin-straight look (which is why I straighten rarely), I took my time with the Wahl ...</li>
            <li> love the blue LED light.</li>
            <li> Digital display is nice  </li>
            <li> Yes, they cost more but the results and professional quality justify the price for me.</li>
            <li> After a few times I was able to curl the ends under for a nice style.</li>
            <li> Located above the buttons is a nice backlit LCD display, which shows the selected temperature.  </li>
            <li> However, she is unsure of how useful the conditioning strips are at this point.  </li>
            <li> (I had to really clench the plates together to get them to fit right).  </li>
            <li> * Heated pretty quickly    </li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> The LCD makes it easier to set the right temperature.</li>
            <li> The installation manual includes instructions for assembling the comb/conditioner attachments, but ours were already attached to the straightener right out of the package.  </li>
            <li> &quot; straightening iron, she wanted to try a smaller iron to see if it would give her better control while providing adequate results.  </li>
            <li> The digital display, the swivel cord, multiple heat settings are nice features, but perhaps my favorite one is the attached comb.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND for the person who just sometimes wants to iron their hair, sometimes change up their hairstyle - easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND for the person who just sometimes wants to iron their hair, sometimes change up their hairstyle - easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So it does have some good qualities and is not a bad iron overall, but for the same price, I&#x27;d recommend the Jilbere.</li>
            <li> This is very important for me being I&#x27;m left handed, and I shut off my conair alll the time.</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast, about a minute.  </li>
            <li> Wahl also offers a 2\\&quot; version of the Healthy Infusions Pro Straightener, for those who desire the larger size.es the recommended heat setting for her hair, she needs to run her hair through the straightener more than once, which then applies too much conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It is far from being a perfect product, but my daughter and I feel it is above average and worthy of a recommendation.  </li>
            <li> It is far from being a perfect product, but my daughter and I feel it is above average and worthy of a recommendation.  </li>
            <li> It also boasts a speedy heat up time of 90 seconds or less, and is backed by an impressive 5-year limited warranty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and well, I really like it!</li>
            <li> Or you can redo the same parts to make sure it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> However, if your ironing your hair, and you accidently touch your head, it will sting a bit but overall pretty safe I think for teenagers and</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was the comb attachment, but it was happening even after removing it.</li>
            <li> It takes about 90 seconds to heat up, and once it is hot, it works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> I did like the digital display of being able to set the temperature</li>
            <li> (If you want to know if the conditioner is being applied, look at the hot plates after ironing a section of hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair was soft and smooth, so I&#x27;d like to think it helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first straightener was a Revlon that I paid about $20 for.</li>
            <li> the other hand, I love the comb feature!</li>
            <li> The conditioning strips alone would deter me from ever buying this product since that is just more money out of your pocket in the future.    </li>
            <li> that my daughter has used this device for over a week, she is fairly pleased with the overall performance.  </li>
            <li> This means plugging in and heating two products instead of one, and adding more time to her overall hair preparation.  </li>
            <li> This means plugging in and heating two products instead of one, and adding more time to her overall hair preparation.  </li>
            <li> When deciding what to take with her (given airline weight limitations on luggage), this was the first hair-care item that went into her suitcase.  </li>
            <li> overall, a very useful product!</li>
            <li> overall, a very useful product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t go too fast, it works better if you heat up sections of your hair for a second or two.</li>
            <li> Overall, most of my hair was \\&quot;kind of straight\\&quot; except for the root area which was still a little unkempt.    </li>
            <li> otherwise the buttons are pretty easy to understand, and functional for left or right-handed</li>
            <li> otherwise the buttons are pretty easy to understand, and functional for left or right-handed</li>
            <li> This straightener works fine and has enough features to make the price very reasonable.</li>
            <li> The conditioner attachment does not do such a great job but there are other features that make this dryer an unbeatable deal for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even with that I&#x27;ve always been interested in experimenting with straight hair on a temporary basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That pretty much sums up the pro&#x27;s of this product.    </li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much considering the price range</li>
            <li> The digital temperature control and LCD display is a great high-tech feature, but that is about all that really stands out with this model, other than the conditioning attachment.  </li>
            <li> The digital temperature control and LCD display is a great high-tech feature, but that is about all that really stands out with this model, other than the conditioning attachment.  </li>
            <li> according to the settings for fine hair, it didn&#x27;t feel like it got hot enough so my hair didn&#x27;t get as straight as i&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> However, those with finer or wavy hair that is easily straightened may have a different experience.</li>
            <li> and I certainly won&#x27;t be spending the money to replace them.</li>
            <li> Definitely an upgrade from the cheapies you&#x27;d find at Walmart but a nice compromise for those who aren&#x27;t willing to dish out the big money for a straightener.</li>
            <li> these handy features do NOT help the fact that the product does not get hot enough to actually straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> * Handle lock latch and swivel cord with hanging hookair feeling nice and soft, not burnt or dry.</li>
            <li> I liked that it had a little LCD backlit screen to control the temperature, and also that you can lock it, so hitting the buttons won&#x27;t change the temp.</li>
            <li> but then I found some things about this iron that I didn&#x27;t like as much.  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair and depend heavily on straight irons, straight iron accessories for my hair dryer and am a slave to it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> cannot really comment on the conditioning strips because I cannot tell a noticeable difference between when it is clamped on the unit and when it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> They practically give away printers because the real money is in the print cartridges.  </li>
            <li> The price of the Wahl is reasonable, but I guess I&#x27;m just spoiled.</li>
            <li> I have very wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have always wondered what it would be like to have straight hair.</li>
            <li> comb/conditioner slip on seems cheaply made and doesn&#x27;t seem like it would last.</li>
            <li> The swivel cord made it much easier to maneuver while straightening and the lock keeps it shut during storage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is important to read the operating manual, as it explains how to remove and reinstall the conditioning/comb attachment, as well as illustrations for switching the comb and conditioning strip to different sides, depending on how you intend to hold the straightener.  </li>
            <li> She feels that the conditioning strip can be helpful, at times, but will probably not use it much.  </li>
            <li> She feels that the conditioning strip can be helpful, at times, but will probably not use it much.  </li>
            <li> the hair is really supermodel straight and stays that way all day.</li>
            <li> , the strip really makes no difference</li>
            <li> and yes, it looks nice with the blue digital LED display, yes</li>
            <li> Wahl also offers a 2\\&quot; version of the Healthy Infusions Pro Straightener, for those who desire the larger size.</li>
            <li> With the included comb it removes an entire step from the process and gives me a clean, straight look instead of the sometimes rushed look</li>
            <li> If the price were very much higher than it is, I&#x27;d say spend a few more bucks and go with a Babyliss or a Chi on sale, and after reading a lot of reviews.    </li>
            <li> This curling iron did about as well as my Conair or my T3 Tourmaline Wet to Dry (see my reviews on those products as well), not as good as my Jilbere.  </li>
            <li> Moreover, I question how for how long these strips will be available ...</li>
            <li> First let me say that I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> However, the innovations fall short of offering any true benefits.</li>
            <li> so I usually moisturize vigilantly on my own.</li>
            <li> It does do a decent job at straightening, but doesn&#x27;t really do any better job than my daughter&#x27;s previous straightener, which was half the cost of this Wahl Healthy Infusions Pro model.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s heavy duty, gets really hot and straightens the hair fast and easily.    </li>
            <li> heats up quickly, cools down quickly as well</li>
            <li> Even the boyfriend said my straightened hair looked nice, and girls know how their men hardly ever notice changes haha.     </li>
            <li> digital display gives you accurate temperature settings, so you can completely control the amount of heat being applied to your hair.</li>
            <li> As for the Wahl Healthy Infusions Straightener itself, she likes the product and plans to continue using it, but will also continue using her previous 2\\&quot; straightening iron, which has plates that allow her to flip out her hair without the need of using a separate curling</li>

            <li> I tried it on a curly wig that I have, because I have gotten my hair cut super short.  </li>
            <li> The extra features make the extra cost somewhat worthwhile, esp.</li>
            <li> The Wahl Pro Straightener makes a decent attempt at being a revolutionary straightener.</li>
            <li> This particular model utilizes an attachment, which holds a conditioning strip and a comb, allowing you to condition your hair as you straighten it.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> of the conditioning strip seems high, but the straightener doesn&#x27;t have to have the conditioning strip to work</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Definitely does take the frizz out, and leaves your hair feeling nice and soft, not burnt or dry.</li>
            <li> It required a little work on my end to section off hair but I enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> like that there&#x27;s a blue LED display, easy to read and buttons are small but easy to press</li>
            <li> like that there&#x27;s a blue LED display, easy to read and buttons are small but easy to press</li>
            <li> First, a little background on my hair type because I think it is important in evaluating the product.</li>
            <li> Then when it&#x27;s ready, you just take some hair [not too much or too little] and then put it inside the Healthy Infusions flattener and slowly slide it along from the top to the end,</li>
            <li> /&gt;The more gimmicky conditioner strip was not as helpful  </li>
            <li> but I still went over my hair a few times and even then was not fully satisfied with the end result.  </li>
            <li> I normally slather on the heat protection cream, so</li>
            <li> However, we are not convinced that the conditioning feature of this straightener is really worth the added cost of the device, not to mention the ongoing cost one would have in constantly buying replacement strips.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, if you want just a good, regular, straightener that works, and don&#x27;t mind throwing away the extra attachment, then it&#x27;s not bad, but I personally don&#x27;t care much to pay extra for an attachment that I wouldn&#x27;t use again.r that works, and don&#x27;t mind throwing away the extra attachment, then it&#x27;s not bad, but I personally don&#x27;t care much to pay extra for an attachment that I wouldn&#x27;t use again.</li>
            <li> If I was in a hurry and just wanted a quick touch-up, I did feel less concern about not applying product first.  </li>
            <li> I find that a hot oil treatment once a week ( heat up coconut or olive oil for 20 seconds, spread on dry hair and keep as long as possible, then shampoo out twice and condition) is good enough and protects my hair for straightening.    </li>
            <li> I have straight, fairly thick hair, so I like using my straightening iron to contour the ends(in or out depending on my haircut) and just to make my hair more sleek and</li>
            <li> straightener had a lot of features that intrigued me: being able to pick how hot it goes and the built in conditioning strip both intrigued me because I worry that my current flat iron may damage or over dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I flat iron my hair on a daily basis as my hair is fine</li>
            <li> I purchased my old straightener for about $20 less, and I&#x27;ve certainly gotten my use out of it and been pleased with it overall.    </li>
            <li> I typically use a wet/dry straightener for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I know if it is getting hot enough.  </li>
            <li> The product does not get hot enough to take the wave out of my hair- even on the hottest setting (the book said to use one of the coolest settings for my hair type- that was usless).</li>
            <li> She too thought it did not get hot enough to allow for styling- even on the hottest setting.</li>
            <li> When using the conditioner/comb attachment, the hair is supposed to pass through the comb first, then through the ceramic plates, and last over the conditioning strip.  </li>
            <li> , it made the hair look different, even my doorman noticed, asking what I did to it, funny considering I never got any comments from him on anything</li>
            <li> The flat iron looks wonderful, like something an expensive salon would use and charge you big bucks for.    </li>
            <li> The conditioning strip is supposed to last for approximately 20 full uses, and replacement strips can be purchased, in packs of 3, at local retailers and on the Internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So even though the plate is pretty large (length-wise), your hair is being straightened unevenly because you have no idea how much heat was transferred to the part on the bottom, which also ends up taking longer to straighten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was no \\&quot;burning\\&quot; smell when I flat ironed my hair and although the hair was still hot to the touch it didn&#x27;t feel like I was burning the life out of it.</li>
            <li> My wife is very particular about hair dryers, we have purchased about a dozen of them in the last two or three years including some higher-end models.</li>
            <li> The straightener has one large power button, and three smaller buttons, for temperature up/down adjustments and to lock the settings to prevent accidental setting changes while styling your hair.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just spoiled by my T3, but my voteis that since you are already paying a hefty price for this product why not invest a little more and get the T3 or a similar high-end, healthy-hair straightener.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just simple to use, you don&#x27;t even need to really read instructions...</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a bit of weight to the flattener, not too light or too heavy</li>
            <li> The whole thing is quite durable material and just simple to use and setup.</li>
            <li> The whole thing is quite durable material and just simple to use and setup.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that the straightener has different heat settings that you can control, and ceramic plates with a tourmaline additive.  </li>
            <li> most of them end up somehow damaging hair, or at least leaving it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (one thing my creaky old Conair lacks, and</li>
            <li> When using the spray moisturizer she found her hair comes out shiny and soft.    </li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised to see that the results weren&#x27;t reflected in the price.</li>
            <li> The small comb attachment seems to help keep the hair in the iron and is a good \\&quot;assist\\&quot; in going down the hair</li>
            <li> My hair dries into a very thick, natural wave and some days that&#x27;s fine, but sometimes I just want to tone it down a bit and make it more manageable and</li>
            <li> While it does heat up quickly it is not as fast as some other models (The Healthy Infusions takes about 5 minutes to heat up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The flat iron was much easier to use then.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t hold up to the healthy claim, as the conditioning strip seemed to be pretty useless.</li>
            <li> The flat iron did an OK job, but I don&#x27;t think it is any better or worse than other flat irons (could just be my hair type).</li>
            <li> However, when I clamped the straightener together, there was a noticeable gap on the bottom half of the heating plates, while the top half connected seamlessly</li>
            <li> Straighteners can range from pretty cheap to very expensive and having owned a few, I think this one fits nicely in the middle.</li>
            <li> I can see how a lot of people would enjoy this feature, but for me personally, I don&#x27;t like my hair to feel greasy or heavy with product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tiny LCD panel shows you the exact temperature (It includes a guide for different temperatures for different types of hair).</li>
            <li> On the bottom of the handle, right next to the attached power cord, is a slide clip, which is used to lock the straightener closed when not in use.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it did heat up high enough, but never retained enough heat after each pass.</li>
            <li> Until now, I have been using a professional grade straightener for the last two years.</li>

            <li> My hair is pretty thick and very curly</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this iron because it had big ceramic plates and didn&#x27;t know much about flat ironing my hair.</li>
            <li> this flat iron by far surpasses the others...</li>
            <li> As other reviewers noted the moisturizer strips don&#x27;t do a whole lot.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, and very curly hair, I rarely straighten it because it is a pain to do, and never quite looks \\&quot;healthy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> There is no little lip or stand to hold the flat iron in place on the countertop.  </li>
            <li> My hair is about 3 inches below my shoulders, and very thick; this Wahl Pro straightener was just the right width, and worked very well on my coarser hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She also found that she has to select a fairly high heat setting, in order to achieve adequate straightening results with a single pass, even though her hair isn&#x27;t veryheavy or thick.  </li>
            <li> I tested this hair straightener on long, thick wavy hair and medium length fine hair, and set the temperatures within the ranges recommended by the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> I have long, dry, very coarse, very wavy, colored and highlighted hair.  </li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s really no reason not to get this straightener if you&#x27;re in the market for a new one.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and thin and I set up the temperature for that type of hair (225)</li>
            <li> She does say that when using the conditioning strip her hair tends to remain straight longer, and it gives a little added shine to her hair.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, you can detach the comb/conditioner strip and use it as a normal straightening iron, but then you&#x27;ve already paid extra for a useless attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve been through several flat irons, including the $190 CHI Nano, have even had several keratin treatments done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this straightener on myself (fine, thick, curly) and on my daughter (normal, thick, wavy).</li>
            <li> Trying to flat iron my hair before then left it still quite frizzy and wavy.  </li>
            <li> And though a serious investment, it was worth every cent.</li>

            <li> It might sound silly, but I think everyone has left the house before going \\&quot;did</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly useless as far as I can tell, and God knows any number of styling products can produce a much better result at a much lower cost (these strips are expensive when it&#x27;s time to replace them.)    </li>
            <li> The comb made it difficult to run the flat iron smoothly through my hair, so I got rid of it.  </li>
            <li> I usually use the [[ASIN:B000BTSLHO T3 Tourmaline Straightener]] because it is highly recommended by stylists for its protective properties.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t think you will be using a straightener continuously for half an hour</li>
            <li> The conditioning strip is an odd add-on.</li>
            <li> However, it also leaves a slight waxy feeling to her hair, which she says makes her feel like her hair is somewhat greasy and in need of being washed.  </li>
            <li> Turns out theres a little gap between the heating plate and the rest of the body, and your hair can get caught in it.</li>
            <li> The product itself was a little cumbersome ...</li>

            <li> Worse still, the comb attachment pulled my hair (though I had thoroughly brushed it before I even began).</li>
            <li> The advantage, however, is that you don&#x27;t have to waste money on resupplying conditioning cartridges, since they appear to have no effect/little effect on the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just me having trouble adjusting to the product.  </li>
            <li> It also has solid ceramic heating plates, with Tourmaline additive, and a thin aluminum backing plate on each heating plate for durability, to prevent breaking from accidental drops.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- the design is not ideal; there is a small space between the plates and the handle, and my hair got caught several times&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this about one year or more - I didn&#x27;t use the Healthy Infusions by Walh Pro Straightner for about 6 months since I never bothered to flatten my hair after I washed it. But then, I made a new year&#x27;s resolution to try a little harder and look nicer - and so I pulled the flattener out of the box and fired it up [ie, plugged it into the wall and tried it].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months and well, I really like it! It&#x27;s just simple to use, you don&#x27;t even need to really read instructions...ok, I did for the part on how to lock the heat setting [set your temperature, and then press and hold the button to lock it so you don&#x27;t accidently press it off or change settings while doing your hair]. Otherwise, really simple to use, just plug it in, undo the cord-prong lock so the flattener opens up and starts safely heating up on the table while you prep your hair with gel or whatever. Then when it&#x27;s ready, you just take some hair [not too much or too little] and then put it inside the Healthy Infusions flattener and slowly slide it along from the top to the end, don&#x27;t go too fast, it works better if you heat up sections of your hair for a second or two. Or you can redo the same parts to make sure it&#x27;s more flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not dangerous to leave the flattener on, or even if you accidently touch the flattener while it&#x27;s heating up, it&#x27;s still pretty safe to handle even on the hottest 410F setting. However, if your ironing your hair, and you accidently touch your head, it will sting a bit but overall pretty safe I think for teenagers and such once you teach them the proper functions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a bit of weight to the flattener, not too light or too heavy but if you have alot of hair, it will take awhile and alot of arm strength [ahah]! I have hair a bit longer than shoulder length and it takes about 15 minutes out of the shower to flatten after I&#x27;ve lightly dried my hair. Definitely does take the frizz out, and leaves your hair feeling nice and soft, not burnt or dry. I do like the function of the clip-on brush, although it only seems to work for the right-handed person? I would like it to be able to change sides or flip it on the flattener, otherwise the buttons are pretty easy to understand, and functional for left or right-handed people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that there&#x27;s a blue LED display, easy to read and buttons are small but easy to press and there&#x27;s a safety lock for the settings and at the end of the flattener so that it locks together and isn&#x27;t open when you put it away in the drawer when not in use. You can curl the long cord around the flattener too. The whole thing is quite durable material and just simple to use and setup. Who knew all those years why I never bothered to flatten my hair? I always thought it was so hard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, a very useful product!

            <li> I have the Conair CS4JCS Ceramic Hair Straightener, 3/4-Inch Plates, which for the price, did as needed and expected. I have straight, fairly thick hair, so I like using my straightening iron to contour the ends(in or out depending on my haircut) and just to make my hair more sleek and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- My Conair is yellow and black. Not cute at all. This one has a more slick look to it, a lot more attractive if it&#x27;ll be sitting out in your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;- I liked that it had a little LCD backlit screen to control the temperature, and also that you can lock it, so hitting the buttons won&#x27;t change the temp. This is very important for me being I&#x27;m left handed, and I shut off my conair alll the time. Wondering why it&#x27;s not hot? Yea, because it&#x27;s OFF.&lt;br /&gt;- my hair feels nice and smooth after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It snagged and pulled on my hair at times. At first I thought it was the comb attachment, but it was happening even after removing it. Turns out theres a little gap between the heating plate and the rest of the body, and your hair can get caught in it. This thing is suppose to &#x27;condition&#x27; and make my hair look better, not damage it!&lt;br /&gt;- quite heavy...I found my arm getting tired faster then usual.&lt;br /&gt;- I like the idea of a conditioning strip, but I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference to be honest. That is, unless I went over a spot too many times, then it weighed down my hair and made it look dirty. Plus, it&#x27;s replaceable? Which says to me: more ways for wahl to make random money off your one purchase. It&#x27;d prefer something that&#x27;s permanently part of the product that doesn&#x27;t have to be replaced, and that doesn&#x27;t leave residue. Yea, I know, near impossible, but thats what I would like.&lt;br /&gt;- the price of the replacements. If they were say, a buck a piece, I could see getting replacements. But these are 6 dollars each(which needs to be purchased in a pack of 3 for 18 dollars). ummm..no?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s fine, though a bit pricey for what you get in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I tested this hair straightener on long, thick wavy hair and medium length fine hair, and set the temperatures within the ranges recommended by the manufacturer.  The only instructions for this product are on the box, so if you are an instruction reader, don&#x27;t discard the box right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the hair straightener worked best at the higher range of the recommended temperatures and like the small comb attachment (wish it would stay attached better).  The small comb attachment seems to help keep the hair in the iron and is a good \\&quot;assist\\&quot; in going down the hair shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more gimmicky conditioner strip was not as helpful  and I probably won&#x27;t replace it when it runs out since the hair straightener works just as well without the conditioning strip.  I didn&#x27;t notice any conditioner added to my hair while I was testing this product.  It seems to be more efficient (and probably more cost effective) to use a spray conditioner instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this hair straightener.  The price is within the range of comparable hair straighteners, and I do like the comb attachment (even though it does come off too easily).  Recommended.</li>
            <li> First, the iron did a good job straightening my hair (thick/coarse), so I was pleased with that, but then I found some things about this iron that I didn&#x27;t like as much.  I had high hopes for this product.  I have used both Paul Mitchell and a Chi iron for straightening, and I liked the idea of the straightener \\&quot;protecting\\&quot; my hair with the conditioning strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good idea in theory, bad idea in practice.  I really like the fact that the straightener has different heat settings that you can control, and ceramic plates with a tourmaline additive.  But, the build of the iron wasn&#x27;t well-manufactured, and the comb/conditioning strip wore unevenly and was unwieldy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats relatively quickly and has a nice \\&quot;locking\\&quot; feature which stops you from accidentally changing the settings and frying your hair.  However, when I clamped the straightener together, there was a noticeable gap on the bottom half of the heating plates, while the top half connected seamlessly (I had to really clench the plates together to get them to fit right).  So even though the plate is pretty large (length-wise), your hair is being straightened unevenly because you have no idea how much heat was transferred to the part on the bottom, which also ends up taking longer to straighten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I did not end up liking the comb/conditioner combo.  The conditioning strip wore out a lot faster than I anticipated and it also unevenly coated my hair, giving some clumps a waxy feel when I was washing it out.  Luckily, you can detach the comb/conditioner strip and use it as a normal straightening iron, but then you&#x27;ve already paid extra for a useless attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I was disappointed that the straightener only straightened.  Let me explain: most flat irons have heating plates that extend fully from side-to-side, which allows you to \\&quot;flip\\&quot; the ends of your hair and use it as kind of a curling iron.  This one did not do that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, if you want just a good, regular, straightener that works, and don&#x27;t mind throwing away the extra attachment, then it&#x27;s not bad, but I personally don&#x27;t care much to pay extra for an attachment that I wouldn&#x27;t use again.r that works, and don&#x27;t mind throwing away the extra attachment, then it&#x27;s not bad, but I personally don&#x27;t care much to pay extra for an attachment that I wouldn&#x27;t use again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flat iron.  I have used the Chi Iron for a long time.  My cord was getting intermittent and not holding heat so I gave the Healthy Infusions a try.  I was intrigued by the conditioner plates.  I now can not imagine NOT having them.  The iron is fabulous.  The LCD screen allows you to control the temperature an the conditioning strips leave your hair shiny and beautiful.    If you are at all hesitating about this purchase.  Don&#x27;t.  I have curly hair and depend heavily on straight irons, straight iron accessories for my hair dryer and am a slave to it.  This unit is by FAR my favorite.  It&#x27;s heavy duty, gets really hot and straightens the hair fast and easily.    Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The Wahl Pro Pro Flat Iron Straightener 1 1/4\\&quot; is a great flat iron but is more on the pricey side.  The flat iron looks wonderful, like something an expensive salon would use and charge you big bucks for.    The iron includes a comb attachment which works great in helping to comb through your hair while straightening and the conditioning strip is a neat little gimmick.  You get about 20 uses per strip, and a box of 3 strips (60 uses) will cost you about $18.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but you CAN use the flat iron WITHOUT the add-on.      Wonderful blue back light LCD display shows the selected temperature setting up to 410 degrees, and a handy little guide to help you choose which setting is best for your type of hair.    It takes about 90 seconds to heat up, and once it is hot, it works like a charm.  My hair came out pretty nice and straight after use.  The feel of product is solid, sturdy, but not too heavy.     Great thing about this is that after an hour, it shuts off automatically even if you aren&#x27;t using it.  It might sound silly, but I think everyone has left the house before going \\&quot;did i unplug the iron?\\&quot;, with this feature, you won&#x27;t have to worry about that.          After trying Wahl products, I recommend you give them a try.  This product is beautiful looking, and works wonderfully.  Your friends will be impressed!</li>
            <li> The comb and the conditioner attachment may feel a little awkward to use, but the conditioner does work. It makes the hair bouncy and smooth to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The swiveling cord does help for easier maneuvering of the iron in different positions, which is just next best to a cordless one. The tiny LCD panel shows you the exact temperature (It includes a guide for different temperatures for different types of hair). Auto-off is a plus, but the 60 minutes is too long before it auto shuts-off. That seems a lot of wasted energy before it turns off automatically.  I don&#x27;t think you will be using a straightener continuously for half an hour straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost of the conditioning strip seems high, but the straightener doesn&#x27;t have to have the conditioning strip to work so you can use it as a regular straightener if you want.  It is only 120V so you cannot bring it with you if you travel to countries that utilize 220v.</li>
            <li> ---- This review is being done by my WIFE---- (My hair is already straight!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My hair is medium length, colored, and semi-straight. Until now, I have been using a professional grade straightener for the last two years. The \\&quot;Heathy Fusion Pro-Straightener\\&quot; is comparable to these more expensive products... while I have noticed some minor differences such as a little less \\&quot;Clamping\\&quot; power. This requires me to have to go over my hair 2 times before I get the desired straightness - when compared to some of the more expensive competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things that I do enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The automatic shut-off (after 60 minutes) has been allowed me to leave my house with some peace-of-mind that my home will not burn down while I am gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You are able to control the heat within about a 200F degree range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to store since it can be camped shut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Moisture strip is a nice bonus - but it does add a recurring expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- On the edge of the straightener there is a comb feature that allows you to brush your hair while straightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I have not noticed any damage to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Areas for improvement-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- While it does heat up quickly it is not as fast as some other models (The Healthy Infusions takes about 5 minutes to heat up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It does not have an anti-slip surface which makes it tough to keep from falling off our granite vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The cord does not rotate with the unit, so it has a tendency to get tangled up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Overall, I have no problems giving the Healthy Infusions Straightener a hearty recommendation - especially if you are looking for a great value on a non-salon quality product. 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this iron because it had big ceramic plates and didn&#x27;t know much about flat ironing my hair. Since then I&#x27;ve been through several flat irons, including the $190 CHI Nano, have even had several keratin treatments done. When used correctly (those are the KEY words) this flat iron by far surpasses the others... It really is a fantastic iron and the strips work wonders--notice a HUGE difference without them.</li>
            <li> I usually shy away from flat irons that are this wide because it is harder to control and get to hard to reach areas. It required a little work on my end to section off hair but I enjoyed using it. There was no \\&quot;burning\\&quot; smell when I flat ironed my hair and although the hair was still hot to the touch it didn&#x27;t feel like I was burning the life out of it. I like the digital read on the display box. All in all I beleive it is definetly worth the money. Don&#x27;t waste your money on those $200-$300 flat irons. This one does the same job for less!</li>
            <li> I expected great results from the Wahl Healthy Infusions Pro Straightener. The blue-glow of the LCD screen said, \\&quot;high-tech\\&quot; ... which I associated with \\&quot;superior product.\\&quot; Unfortunately, I found the straightener awkward and ineffective.    I have medium thickness, long (mid-back) hair. Since it is wavy, I either play-up the waves or straighten them (depending on my mood). I usually use the [[ASIN:B000BTSLHO T3 Tourmaline Straightener]] because it is highly recommended by stylists for its protective properties. And though a serious investment, it was worth every cent. I picked up this Wahl straightener for travel purposes and gave it a test run before packing it away in my luggage. The results were, unfortunately, disappointing.     The product itself was a little cumbersome ... with the comb attachment adding extra thickness and heft. Worse still, the comb attachment pulled my hair (though I had thoroughly brushed it before I even began). When I finished straightening, hair was stuck in the comb area and in the seams of the straightener ... hair that had been pulled out. Since I aspire to a pin-straight look (which is why I straighten rarely), I took my time with the Wahl ... but it simply could not manage the job. The unwieldiness of the instrument made it difficult to get close to the roots. Overall, most of my hair was \\&quot;kind of straight\\&quot; except for the root area which was still a little unkempt.    The conditioning strip is an odd add-on. It gave my hair more weight than I care for. Moreover, I question how for how long these strips will be available ... a year? Then what? Even still, I wish that the ingredients were more environmentally-friendly/healthy for hair.    Finally, the Wahl does not come with a protective bag/travel bag (unlike similar brands) ... so take that into consideration when purchasing (you may want to put a protective bag in your cart).     The Wahl straightener did not fulfill my personal needs. Maybe I&#x27;m just spoiled by my T3, but my voteis that since you are already paying a hefty price for this product why not invest a little more and get the T3 or a similar high-end, healthy-hair straightener.</li>
            <li> This hair straightener blends in needed moisture and conditioner in a very practical, easy way.&lt;br /&gt;I love the blue LED light. I love the temperature display.&lt;br /&gt;The added comb is for thick hair ensuring all individual hairs are straightened.&lt;br /&gt;It is much sturdier and more attractive than the straighteners I&#x27;ve seen at beauty shops.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best straightner I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I did a friends hair with it and she was especially delightd with the results.&lt;br /&gt;You choose the temperature and there is also a temperature lock setting.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this product highly enough</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and thin and I set up the temperature for that type of hair (225) It did&#x27;t work so I change it to (330). now it worked but not as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachment is too wide and It&#x27;s too heavy to handle it. my hair got stuck in the brush. I didnt notice the conditioner it doesnt make a difference as the hairdryier did.&lt;br /&gt;when I finished. My hair was not as straight as I expected to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this straightener on myself (fine, thick, curly) and on my daughter (normal, thick, wavy). It works like a champ on the first pass, even on the usual trouble spots.  The conditioner doesn&#x27;t go on so thick that you can feel it, but it definitely improved the smoothness of our hair post-ironing.</li>
            <li> I typically use a wet/dry straightener for my fine hair. I could feel the product being put on my hair as it straightened which left my hair a little greasy afterwards. according to the settings for fine hair, it didn&#x27;t feel like it got hot enough so my hair didn&#x27;t get as straight as i&#x27;m used to. I also didn&#x27;t like that i couldn&#x27;t use it on wet hair. for quick touch ups, it could be okay but i don&#x27;t like the price of the infusion strips and that i can&#x27;t find them in stores. i would have to purchase them online. of course, it can be used without the strips but then it defeats the purpose. it did the job, just not as well as i had hoped for.</li>
            <li> My wife is very particular about hair dryers, we have purchased about a dozen of them in the last two or three years including some higher-end models. most of them end up somehow damaging hair, or at least leaving it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best dryers she has used. The conditioner attachment does not do such a great job but there are other features that make this dryer an unbeatable deal for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush attachment makes it easier to dry your hair, eliminating the need to use a separate brush. The LCD makes it easier to set the right temperature. The swivel cord is one of the nice details that make this a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It warms up quickly, does a good job of drying your hair without damaging and seems to be well built. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> First, a little background on my hair type because I think it is important in evaluating the product. I have very thick, and very curly hair, I rarely straighten it because it is a pain to do, and never quite looks \\&quot;healthy\\&quot;. Because of the healthy claim, I was hoping this flat iron would produce better results on my hair.     I found the conditioning strip to be useless and ended up taking it off when switching to the other side of my head. The flat iron was much easier to use then. I did like the digital display of being able to set the temperature (I went up to 410 degrees), but found it weird that it didn&#x27;t tell me what the current iron temperature was. To me that would be more useful, that way I know if it is getting hot enough.  The flat iron did an OK job, but I don&#x27;t think it is any better or worse than other flat irons (could just be my hair type). The flat iron did straighten my hair. The side that I used the conditioning strip on, did not look any healthier than the other side (or with other straighteners).    Pros:  * Swivel cord is nice  * Digital display is nice  * Heated pretty quickly    Cons:  * Conditioning strip (just don&#x27;t use it)  * Did burn my fingers a few times when holding the flat iron closed on my hair      All in all, the product is So-So, but it doesn&#x27;t hold up to the healthy claim, as the conditioning strip seemed to be pretty useless. However, those with finer or wavy hair that is easily straightened may have a different experience.</li>
            <li> If you like your hair tools to look designer, then you&#x27;ll love this hair straightener from Wahl. With all the sleekness and sophistication of Dolce &amp; Gabbana, this will look downright sexy just sitting on your vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The digital display gives you accurate temperature settings, so you can completely control the amount of heat being applied to your hair. The locking mechanism on the end is also fabulous. This allows even heating on both plates, as well as easy storage with it clamped closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative I have to this straightener is that the plates are too small for me. I have really long, curly hair and with these small plates, it takes an hour + just to straighten my hair. I prefer straighteners with larger plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot really comment on the conditioning strips because I cannot tell a noticeable difference between when it is clamped on the unit and when it isn&#x27;t. The advantage, however, is that you don&#x27;t have to waste money on resupplying conditioning cartridges, since they appear to have no effect/little effect on the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the lack of performance of the conditioning strips, I&#x27;m deducting 1 star, but in terms of straightening hair, this gets the job done as well as any.</li>
            <li> I have long, dry, very coarse, very wavy, colored and highlighted hair.  This curling iron did about as well as my Conair or my T3 Tourmaline Wet to Dry (see my reviews on those products as well), not as good as my Jilbere.  In fact, I did a head-to-head test with the Conair 2-in-1 and there was no discernable difference between the two, even though the Conair&#x27;s max temp is 395 degrees.  Like all my previous flat irons, it does occasionally pull a few hairs.    The Wahl took quite a bit of time to heat up to 410 degrees.  It says 90 seconds, but I&#x27;d give it 5 minutes or more.  Trying to flat iron my hair before then left it still quite frizzy and wavy.  Even afterwards, it was adequate but I still went over my hair a few times and even then was not fully satisfied with the end result.  Upon careful examination, I found that the plates do not fit tightly together.    About the attachments--I&#x27;m not sold.  The comb made it difficult to run the flat iron smoothly through my hair, so I got rid of it.  I was left with one conditioning strip.  There is at least a small section of hair that does not receive any conditioner prior to being subjected to the flat iron.  IMHO, that could be problematic over time.  The conditioner also appears insufficient for any but the most well-conditioned hair with infrequent usage.  I normally slather on the heat protection cream, so I just don&#x27;t see how an imperceptible surface coating could offer enough protection.  (If you want to know if the conditioner is being applied, look at the hot plates after ironing a section of hair.  You will see faint wet streaks.)  If I was in a hurry and just wanted a quick touch-up, I did feel less concern about not applying product first.  I can&#x27;t shake the suspicion that I could regret that shortcut in the long run, though.    I switched to a bagless vacuum because I got tired of the expense and hassle of getting bags.  They practically give away printers because the real money is in the print cartridges.  And, while this curling iron seems a bargain at under $50, it would cost well over $100/year in conditioning strips.  That&#x27;s a year&#x27;s worth of Biolage fortifying heat styler, even at the ridiculous amounts I go through.    There is no little lip or stand to hold the flat iron in place on the countertop.  I&#x27;m always afraid it will spin into something and melt it.  I do like how it&#x27;s very easy to close, even when heated, as the latch is no where near the heating element.  That offers me some peace of mind with 3 small children running around.  The shut-off feature is also nice.  So it does have some good qualities and is not a bad iron overall, but for the same price, I&#x27;d recommend the Jilbere.</li>
            <li> This straightener is fine; it doesn&#x27;t burn the hair, and the comb attachment is very nice.  I&#x27;ve often wondered why manufacturers don&#x27;t include that on all models of straighteners.  The width is good and it heated up in an acceptable amount of time.  I tried it on a curly wig that I have, because I have gotten my hair cut super short.  But after I decide to grow it out again (which I undoubtedly will), this straightener will be waiting for me!</li>
            <li> I received this today and was excited to try it out. First let me say that I have naturally curly hair.  When I was younger I absolutely hated it, but as I&#x27;ve grown older I&#x27;ve learned to love it.  Even with that I&#x27;ve always been interested in experimenting with straight hair on a temporary basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straightener seemed pretty self explanatory, but I still read through the directions just to be sure. I started out with small sections and with some help from my daughter I was finished in 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the heat is adjustable and can be locked in. My hair is pretty thick and very curly so I set it at 370. The comb did seem to help in making sure my hair was evenly distributed on the plates. The conditioning strips may or may have not made a difference, I will try next time without them to see if I notice any change.  My hair was soft and smooth, so I&#x27;d like to think it helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was extremely pleased with the results of the Wahl&#x27;s Healthy Infusions Pro Straightener. I&#x27;ve looked into the replacement conditioning strips and unless they go down in price, that would be the only negative I have about this product. [[ASIN:B001E6OCVC Healthy Infusions by Wahl Conditioning Strips (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve added in a before and after picture of my hair so that you can see the results. If you have any questions, please comment and I will respond.</li>
            <li> I always meant to buy an expensive straightener \\&quot;one of these days,\\&quot; but I&#x27;ve been creaking along on a Conair straightener i got several years ago that worked fine for my thick, wavy, and long hair.    The Wahl Pro Straightener is similar to the Conair, but with improvements in design and quality.     The digital display, the swivel cord, multiple heat settings are nice features, but perhaps my favorite one is the attached comb. I got used to that on the old Conair I have, and I must admit, at least for me, it makes straightening to a lot faster and smoother. It&#x27;s not so much that it combs your hair, but acts more like a guide to pull the hair taut between the tourmaline plates - a nice touch.    The heat setting display isn&#x27;t kidding; this baby gets HOT when the dial is turned up! Since I&#x27;m probably like most women and use way more heat-based hair appliances than can possibly be good for one&#x27;s locks, the lower settings do an excellent job without the frying experience.    Another thoughtful feature is that the plates \\&quot;lock&#x27; to make storage a breeze (one thing my creaky old Conair lacks, and boy, am i tired of that thing falling on me in the linen closet!)    This straightener works fine and has enough features to make the price very reasonable. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t get the conditioning strip. It&#x27;s fairly useless as far as I can tell, and God knows any number of styling products can produce a much better result at a much lower cost (these strips are expensive when it&#x27;s time to replace them.)    The conditioning strip is a gimmick, and an unnecessary one. The straightener is quite good without bothering with it.    The price of the Wahl is reasonable, but I guess I&#x27;m just spoiled. I purchased my old straightener for about $20 less, and I&#x27;ve certainly gotten my use out of it and been pleased with it overall.    The Wahl is a pricier replacement. The extra features make the extra cost somewhat worthwhile, esp. since the Conair model I had isn&#x27;t being manufacturered anymore.    If the price were very much higher than it is, I&#x27;d say spend a few more bucks and go with a Babyliss or a Chi on sale, and after reading a lot of reviews.    Maybe it&#x27;s my frugal nature, or the pretty results i got from the Wahl, but at this price point, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a very good investment indeed.</li>
            <li> I was planning on giving 3 stars to this straightener, but my hair really did look great after using it, so it does deserve 4 stars. I&#x27;ve used many of the higher end straighteners ($100 and up) over the years - Solano Sapphire, CHI, FHI, GHD, etc.) - and I was impressed that a cheaper straightener worked just as well, if not better, than my favorite CHI iron. My hair is about 3 inches below my shoulders, and very thick; this Wahl Pro straightener was just the right width, and worked very well on my coarser hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- very good value for the money&lt;br /&gt;- works well on long, thicker hair&lt;br /&gt;- can easily control the temperature (I used the highest, 410 degrees)&lt;br /&gt;- heats up quickly, cools down quickly as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- the design is not ideal; there is a small space between the plates and the handle, and my hair got caught several times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I found the comb/conditioning strip attachment useless. The comb attachments just snagged my hair, the conditioning strip did nothing at all. I saw no difference between using the conditioning strip and not using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- If you do choose to use the conditioning strip, it&#x27;s an added expense because you have to keep buying refills.</li>
            <li> This straightener comes with one conditioning strip good for aprox 20 applications.  You have to buy more after that.  There is a removable attachment that holds a comb on one side and the conditioning strip on the other.  You can remove the comb attachment and an additional strip for conditioning on both side if you want. I do believe I noticed my hair being conditioned as I straightened but it is a litte difficult to manage.  I ended up appling conditioning spray, removing the attachment and using the straightener alone.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife as one of the Amazon Vine offerings, in a timely stroke of luck she was looking for one when it was offered.    The variable temperature settings and display were very useful.  She liked the ability to test at a low temperature and raise it to what is needed she has fine hair and wanted to experiment and not cause damage.  It works much faster than a blow dryer, she is able to style her hair in 1/4 of the time compared to a dryer.    As other reviewers noted the moisturizer strips don&#x27;t do a whole lot.  She found she needed a spray on moisturizer designed for these types of irons.  When using the spray moisturizer she found her hair comes out shiny and soft.    The weight is good, she is able to style her hair without much work.  It heats up very fast, about a minute.  The auto-shutoff feature is nice too.    My wife is very satisfied with this product, and I am happy it gets her out the door faster, so it&#x27;s good all around!</li>
            <li> Straighteners can range from pretty cheap to very expensive and having owned a few, I think this one fits nicely in the middle. My first straightener was a Revlon that I paid about $20 for. It had a temp indicator, auto turn off and warmed up in about minute. This Wahl straightener has these same standard features in addition to the removeable comb and conditioner strip. I have to say, I&#x27;m not a fan of putting any kind of product on my hair. I don&#x27;t use gel or mousse or hair spray or anything. I just don&#x27;t like stuff on my hair, so I&#x27;m not a fan of the strip and I certainly won&#x27;t be spending the money to replace them. I can see how a lot of people would enjoy this feature, but for me personally, I don&#x27;t like my hair to feel greasy or heavy with product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I love the comb feature! Being a busy mom, I often just jump out of the shower in the morning and get ready in somewhat of a rush and don&#x27;t have time to be terribly picky about my hair. My hair dries into a very thick, natural wave and some days that&#x27;s fine, but sometimes I just want to tone it down a bit and make it more manageable and that&#x27;s where my straighteners come in. With the included comb it removes an entire step from the process and gives me a clean, straight look instead of the sometimes rushed look I get when I just don&#x27;t have time to make a fuss over it. I&#x27;ve never felt like it was tugging or pulling at my hair. It&#x27;s easily my favorite feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With auto turn off, temp indicator and the other extras, there&#x27;s really no reason not to get this straightener if you&#x27;re in the market for a new one. Definitely an upgrade from the cheapies you&#x27;d find at Walmart but a nice compromise for those who aren&#x27;t willing to dish out the big money for a straightener.</li>
            <li> The Wahl Pro Straightener makes a decent attempt at being a revolutionary straightener. However, the innovations fall short of offering any true benefits. My wife used this straightener for about 2 weeks and yes, it looks nice with the blue digital LED display, yes it heats up quickly and yes it is lightweight. That pretty much sums up the pro&#x27;s of this product.    The conditioning strip is rather useless and the ceramic plates never heated up high enough to straighten my wife&#x27;s slightly thicker hair. Maybe it did heat up high enough, but never retained enough heat after each pass. Eventually she took out the conditioning strips because it left her hair rather greasy looking but did leave the comb attached.    For the price, I would recommend the other well known brands for simplicity and proven results (T3, CHI, etc.). Yes, they cost more but the results and professional quality justify the price for me. The conditioning strips alone would deter me from ever buying this product since that is just more money out of your pocket in the future.

            <li> I have had this product for about a month . I have very wavy hair. I have always wondered what it would be like to have straight hair. It took about 5 minutes to straighten my long hair. The conditioner stick on the end helped to smooth the layers so the ends didn&#x27;t look frizzy. After a few times I was able to curl the ends under for a nice style. I liked the swivel cord feature. I was able to style the right and left side just as easily. My husband said I looked like Britney, I said more like Gwyneth.  I would recommend this product. I use it with Wahl Healthy Infusion hair dryer.  Mrs. Rhodeymark</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get the Healthy Infusions Pro Straightener by Wahl. I flat iron my hair on a daily basis as my hair is fine but I have a lot of it and it tends to want to curl and my style looks best when straightened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This straightener had a lot of features that intrigued me: being able to pick how hot it goes and the built in conditioning strip both intrigued me because I worry that my current flat iron may damage or over dry my hair. Well let me tell you there is NO worry about that with this product. The product does not get hot enough to take the wave out of my hair- even on the hottest setting (the book said to use one of the coolest settings for my hair type- that was usless). The conditioning strip seems pretty useless to me because even on the highest setting this straightener did not do its job- so there was no way it could possibly damage my hair.  Not to mention that snap on comb/conditioner slip on seems cheaply made and doesn&#x27;t seem like it would last. I even tried letting the product warm up for longer than the 90 seconds recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were two features of this product that I did like- those being the swivel cord and the locking feature that keeps the straightener shut. The swivel cord made it much easier to maneuver while straightening and the lock keeps it shut during storage. However- these handy features do NOT help the fact that the product does not get hot enough to actually straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even had my mom try the product to see if it was just me having trouble adjusting to the product.  She too thought it did not get hot enough to allow for styling- even on the hottest setting. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> When it comes to hair styling, the women in my household are fanatics.  We have spent a great deal of money on special dryers with straighteners, curling irons, and straightening irons as well.  Even though my teenage daughter usually uses a 2\\&quot; straightening iron, she wanted to try a smaller iron to see if it would give her better control while providing adequate results.  Imagine her joy when I presented her with the 1 ¼\\&quot; Healthy Infusions Pro Straightener by Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I have come to know Wahl as a manufacturer of quality hair trimming and styling products, so we were confident that this Healthy Infusions straightener would be a well built product.  This particular model utilizes an attachment, which holds a conditioning strip and a comb, allowing you to condition your hair as you straighten it.  It also has solid ceramic heating plates, with Tourmaline additive, and a thin aluminum backing plate on each heating plate for durability, to prevent breaking from accidental drops.  The device has a digital electronic heating control system, offering 8 different heat settings, from 200 to 410 degrees.  It also boasts a speedy heat up time of 90 seconds or less, and is backed by an impressive 5-year limited warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product package included the 1 ¼\\&quot; Healthy Infusions Pro Straightener, with an attached comb and conditioning strip, as well as an operating manual and registration card.  The installation manual includes instructions for assembling the comb/conditioner attachments, but ours were already attached to the straightener right out of the package.  The straightener has one large power button, and three smaller buttons, for temperature up/down adjustments and to lock the settings to prevent accidental setting changes while styling your hair.  Located above the buttons is a nice backlit LCD display, which shows the selected temperature.  On the bottom of the handle, right next to the attached power cord, is a slide clip, which is used to lock the straightener closed when not in use.  The power cord is fairly long (approx. 8 feet) and is attached to the handle with a handy swivel base, which also includes a loop for hanging the straightener from a hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to read the operating manual, as it explains how to remove and reinstall the conditioning/comb attachment, as well as illustrations for switching the comb and conditioning strip to different sides, depending on how you intend to hold the straightener.  The manual also reminds you to remove the plastic guard, which covers the conditioning strip, and to replace the guard when the straightener is stored between uses.  Since the guard is plastic it can melt, from the heat of the iron, if not removed before using the device.  When using the conditioner/comb attachment, the hair is supposed to pass through the comb first, then through the ceramic plates, and last over the conditioning strip.  If desired, the device can be used without the comb and conditioning strip attachment.  The conditioning strip is supposed to last for approximately 20 full uses, and replacement strips can be purchased, in packs of 3, at local retailers and on the Internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that my daughter has used this device for over a week, she is fairly pleased with the overall performance.  It is comfortable to hold and is well balanced.  It heats up fairly quickly and the hair glides through it without snagging.  However, she is unsure of how useful the conditioning strips are at this point.  She does say that when using the conditioning strip her hair tends to remain straight longer, and it gives a little added shine to her hair.  However, it also leaves a slight waxy feeling to her hair, which she says makes her feel like her hair is somewhat greasy and in need of being washed.  She also found that she has to select a fairly high heat setting, in order to achieve adequate straightening results with a single pass, even though her hair isn&#x27;t veryheavy or thick.  If she uses the recommended heat setting for her hair, she needs to run her hair through the straightener more than once, which then applies too much conditioner.  In order to prevent over conditioning, she sometimes has to remove the conditioning/comb attachment so she can run her hair through the heating plates a second time.  She also stated that this straightener doesn&#x27;t provide a way to flip out her hair at the bottom, like her other straightener does.  This is because the ceramic plates are not close enough to the edge of the straightener.  This recessed plate design does help prevent accidental burns, but it also requires my daughter to use a curling iron, to flip out the bottom of her hair, after she uses the straightener.  This means plugging in and heating two products instead of one, and adding more time to her overall hair preparation.  She feels that the conditioning strip can be helpful, at times, but will probably not use it much.  As for the Wahl Healthy Infusions Straightener itself, she likes the product and plans to continue using it, but will also continue using her previous 2\\&quot; straightening iron, which has plates that allow her to flip out her hair without the need of using a separate curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall we are fairly happy with the Wahl Healthy Infusions Pro Straightener.  However, we are not convinced that the conditioning feature of this straightener is really worth the added cost of the device, not to mention the ongoing cost one would have in constantly buying replacement strips.  The digital temperature control and LCD display is a great high-tech feature, but that is about all that really stands out with this model, other than the conditioning attachment.  It does do a decent job at straightening, but doesn&#x27;t really do any better job than my daughter&#x27;s previous straightener, which was half the cost of this Wahl Healthy Infusions Pro model.  I am giving this product 4 stars, based on it doing a good job at straightening hair, and because of the digital controls, LCD display, and for the convenience of the conditioning feature when sometimes desired.  It is far from being a perfect product, but my daughter and I feel it is above average and worthy of a recommendation.  Wahl also offers a 2\\&quot; version of the Healthy Infusions Pro Straightener, for those who desire the larger size.es the recommended heat setting for her hair, she needs to run her hair through the straightener more than once, which then applies too much conditioner.

            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much considering the price range but I was pleasantly surprised to see that the results weren&#x27;t reflected in the price. I must add that on days when I use this I wash and condition with appropriate shampoo, I love the ones from GHD and when I use a heat spray ( Tresseme) the hair is really supermodel straight and stays that way all day. I have fairly straight hair to start with but this really made it wonderful, it made the hair look different, even my doorman noticed, asking what I did to it, funny considering I never got any comments from him on anything and he&#x27;s been working in my building for years. Even the boyfriend said my straightened hair looked nice, and girls know how their men hardly ever notice changes haha.     I found the temperature of 275 to work and not singe my hair, so I haven&#x27;t use it with a higher heat yet , although I&#x27;m sure it will work for those with really stubborn hair. This is a great product and even though the moisturizing strip makes the hair a tiny bit greasy I have no problem detaching it and not using it, the strip really makes no difference and I dye my hair so I usually moisturize vigilantly on my own. I find that a hot oil treatment once a week ( heat up coconut or olive oil for 20 seconds, spread on dry hair and keep as long as possible, then shampoo out twice and condition) is good enough and protects my hair for straightening.    0verall if I paid for this and didn&#x27;t get it from Vine for free I would love is as much as I love it now. Maybe one day I will get one of those $200 fancy irons, but for now this is perfect and since I don&#x27;t have money to burn I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li> My 20-year-old daughter recently departed for a year-long stay in the UK to spend her junior year studying abroad.  I gave her one of these hair irons recently and she loved it.  When deciding what to take with her (given airline weight limitations on luggage), this was the first hair-care item that went into her suitcase.  She considers it nearly as good as the Farouk Chi she purchased a few years ago at 3 times the price.</li>
