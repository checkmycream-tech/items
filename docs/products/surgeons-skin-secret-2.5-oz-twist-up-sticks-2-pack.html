            <li> This waxy balm works on hands, elbows, chapped lips, and is the only thing my husband uses to soothe and soften the dry cracked skin on his heels.  </li>

            <li> When I was younger, I had a BUNCH of surgeries on my lower legs, ankles, and feet, and at one point my physical therapist pulled out a big jar of beeswax and used it to help my scars heal up, especially one that was super tight and painful-</li>

            <li> Great for dry feet. Keeps them from cracking.</li>
            <li> This has been saving factor for his cracked dry hands for last 3 years. First shipment l&lt;br /&gt;of the season.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that helps dry, cracked, bleeding hands. My husband got severe 2nd degree burns from a defective gas oven that exploded on him when he reached to light the pilot and now some areas of his hands don&#x27;t have the top epidermis.  In the winter months, he has to use this or he&#x27;s in a lot of pain. We&#x27;ve been using this product on his hands and our knuckles and chapped lips for at least 10 years.  Safe for the whole family.</li>
            <li> this stuff is wonderful.  we only use the unscented because it does not sting at all on very sore skin.  my son tends to stick out his tongue when concentrating and will get very red on the face from it.  this clears it fast and keeps it from recurring.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and I love it. Works on splits on your hands. Helps on heals and dry spots.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It does take some time to work it into the skin, but it helps heal cracks around finger tips and nails.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for 4 years. We use to purchase it from QVC but unscented is no longer available there.&lt;br /&gt;This is my 2nd order through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It works better and lasts longer than other lotions and sticks that we previously have used.</li>
            <li> Great book. My kids love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time.... it is awesome for itchy skin.  Whether it be a mosquito bite or just dry itchy skin..it works!</li>
            <li> The  2.5 oz. Twist Up Stick is a great healer for your skin, especially around your finger nails.  I&#x27;ve used the product (scented and unscented) for several years and find it to be one of the best, if not the best, cure for cracked skin around the finger nails. In  most cases when the product is applied to cracked skin along the finger nails before you go to bed the \\&quot;crack\\&quot; is closed and healed when you get up.</li>
            <li> As runners and hikers, my husband and I use this product for practically daily to prevent blisters on feet and skin chafing..  It is heavy duty and works better than Glide. The roll on stick makes it easy to apply.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a RN.  She washes her hands constantly. Surgeon&#x27;s Secret Brand continues to work after multiple hand washings. It&#x27;s also great for heels, knees, and elbows. Easy to use because you do not contaminate product by putting fingers in moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This waxy balm works on hands, elbows, chapped lips, and is the only thing my husband uses to soothe and soften the dry cracked skin on his heels.  Each stick is a very generous size and lasts a long time.  We could not be without this at our house, especially during cold weather.</li>
            <li> Awesome product..use it everyday</li>
            <li> I have had very dry hands and was told about this product.  I wanted my husband to use it too so I got unscented.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like a lady, so he will use it, but it does smell like a sheep.  Not horrible, but it did take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Good price for volume</li>
            <li> Great stuff, really helps my dh&#x27;s psoriasis with no chemicals!</li>
            <li> I have a problem with cracked heals and body lotion does not help. Using the beeswax moisturizer daily and nightly works for me.</li>
            <li> Keeps. My hands in great shape</li>
            <li> I like this stuff for feet.  Don&#x27;t buy scented, unscented is much better.  Scents are too strong.</li>
            <li> Its a wonderful product. When my legs get itchy at night its easy to use in the dark and calms my itchy exema skin.</li>
            <li> We love this stuff.  I am a nurse and my dear daughter a welder (yes I said welder) and a farmer.  Our hands take a beating.  I just purchased these for her. She was nearly out of her last supply.  I am always happy to be able to do nice, if practical things for her. Thank you for making it easy to order, pay and have things sent to my loved ones.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for over 10 years.  My finger tips would crack and bleed during dry winter months - Surgeon&#x27;s stick heals and prevents this painful condition.  Nothing better - would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I purchased a smaller sample of this product at the AQS quilt show in Grand Rapids, MI just to try it on the psoriasis on my feet.  Psoriasis is a skin condition where your body makes and flakes off too many skin cells, too quickly.  It always leaves skin very dry, rough and itchy.  I got a chance to speak with the creator of this product and decided to give it a try.  It worked great!  My feet are now flake free and don&#x27;t itch or look red.  I was happy to see that Amazon carried it so that I don&#x27;t have to ever run out.</li>
            <li> We have used Surgeon&#x27;s Secret for many years.  It heals crackes and cuts on hands as well as feet.  We highly recommend this product.  Try it once and you will be back for more.</li>
            <li> When I was younger, I had a BUNCH of surgeries on my lower legs, ankles, and feet, and at one point my physical therapist pulled out a big jar of beeswax and used it to help my scars heal up, especially one that was super tight and painful- it truly felt like the surgeon had stitched my skin to the inside of my leg. The beeswax was the only thing to get it to heal, and it worked almost immediately.. Ever since then I have been on the lookout for a pure beeswax product, but have never been able to find it. I really thought that maybe I imagined it, but then I found this- and it&#x27;s the *same* thing. Even the smell is the same (slightly smoke-y smell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a distance swimmer and I get terrible seam-line rashes and burns on my skin from some of my racing suits combined with chlorine (especially on my collarbones), and *nothing* helps. For months I have been using a skin balm with cortizone, just to make swimming bearable. But nothing was helping the skin actually heal. I kid you not- I put this stuff on as soon as I got it, and the next morning, the rashes were considerably better. A few days later, they were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what it is about beeswax, but it&#x27;s magic for sensitive skin, super-dry skin, rashes, skin that needs to heal, etc. I&#x27;ve used a million and one different moisturizers and lotions and nothing has worked like it. I&#x27;m so glad I found it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beeswax is amazing, but what it&#x27;s *not* is lightweight- this is a waxy, sticky balm that leaves a thick layer of goo behind. It can be massaged into skin, but it will not completely absorb. You probably don&#x27;t want to apply this all over your body- just on areas that need extra help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stick is fairly large- I was expecting a super-size lipstick but what came is more of a large, round deodorant size &amp;#34;roll up&amp;#34; of beeswax. So I was super pleased with the generous size of the product- and two came in the package. The second stick went to my daughter, who has eczema. She always gets &amp;#34;hot spots&amp;#34; in her elbows and behind her knees, and this helps considerably without getting her hands sticky, which she likes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one issue I have with this product is the smell. It&#x27;s VERY smoke-y smelling. I don&#x27;t know if anyone else notices it when I use this, but I notice it for a while after I apply it. If you are into smelling &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;, you probably might want to check out the fragranced versions of this product. Because while this is &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34;, it smells like smoke. Apparently this is a fairly typical thing (I guess it has to do with beekeepers using smoke to calm bees) but it&#x27;s pretty strong. The product works too well for me to be discouraged by that, but I thought I might mention it in case someone was particularly sensitive to that smell and wanted to know about it before deciding between the &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; version and other veraions they have available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough. I don&#x27;t know why it works so well, but it&#x27;s made my skin *so* much better.ma.

The product works too well for me to be discouraged by that, but I thought I might mention it in case someone was particularly sensitive to that smell and wanted to know about it before deciding between the &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; version and other veraions they have available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough. I don&#x27;t know why it works so well, but it&#x27;s made my skin *so* much better.</li>
