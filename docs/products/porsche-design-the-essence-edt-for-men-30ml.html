            <li>This smells great!</li>
            <li>and this is his favourite fragrance and on him it smells very good..</li>
            <li>but when I found this great price, I couldn&#x27;t resist.  </li>
            <li>This cologne smells great.  </li>
            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>While I think it&#x27;s a pleasant scent</li>
            <li>It smells as good as it used to.</li>
            <li>All kidding aside, we are both very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to get it (and at a good price) online.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line, I love it!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance!</li>
            <li>We both love it!</li>
            <li>The women love the smell!</li>
            <li>This fragrance is nice for the price.</li>
            <li>More importantly the scent is amazing and smells great on him.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light smell.</li>
            <li>If you love Porsche&#x27;s, you&#x27;ll automatically love this cologne.  </li>
            <li>As a Porsche family 1-911 2-914and a 944 what could have been better ???</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just about given up after traipsing through Neiman Marcus, Bloomingdales etc sampling the latest Bulgari&#x27;s, Guccis, Hugo Boss</li>
            <li>although I&#x27;m not crazy about my husband smelling so great when he&#x27;s heading out the door and into a world full of women who probably also love the way he smells.  </li>
            <li>Yes it was fun to give !!</li>
            <li>Kind of woodsy, fresh, like a brisk morning at a racetrack in the forest.</li>
            <li>and so I decided to take a chance on this one because the price was excellent and because it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than their other wares.    </li>
            <li>This is a fine manly scent to wear under your leather racing suit.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something different that not everyone has, this is a great option.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy Wings or NB you may want to sample this one.</li>
            <li>Used in moderation, it&#x27;s a clean and less obtrusive fragrance, very pleasant and distinctive without being overly musky.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed it very much and happened to look it up on Amazon when I got home.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not overly original, to some it may have no appeal at all.</li>
            <li>Good for daily use.</li>
            <li>Almost like standing in a freshly pruned pine forest with a cool mountain mist nipping the bite off the pine smell.</li>
            <li>Yes my husband really likes it !!</li>
            <li>Though its still a cheapy worth trying.</li>
            <li>For the price its worth it.</li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>Oh and also, this is a smell that the ladies love and can&#x27;t seem to get enough of!</li>
            <li>For the first time in our 35 years of marriage I purchased a bottle of cologne for my husband without smelling it first.</li>
            <li>Seriously, smells great and not over powering.</li>
            <li>Was surprised at the price for a nice big bottle.  </li>
            <li>I am not a frequent user of cologne, but I find this understated and pleasant enough to sport it on occasion.</li>
            <li>Its light blue.</li>
            <li>My first impression was a slight sophistication of strong citrus, that was semi-sweet, but not cloying or synthetic, with a crisp sillage.</li>
            <li>The original Kanon was a decent alternative to the Scott McClintock, but the generic replacements don&#x27;t come close.</li>
            <li>No negative comments from women too...</li>
            <li>Normally we go to the store together</li>
            <li>Furthermore this slightly resembles Wings or Nautica Blue, however it is more mature than NB, without feeling totally like another cheap citrus.</li>
            <li>I first encountered this in Germany, appropriately enough.  </li>
            <li>A masculine fragrance that&#x27;s easy to appreciate but difficult to describe accurately.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been very difficult for me to find a decent replacement for my old favorite - Scott McClintock for men (by Jessica McClintock) - which was discontinued about 5 years ago and is no longer available anywhere online.</li>
            <li>Like everything that Porsche makes, the packaging and bottle for the cologne are classy and well-designed.</li>
            <li>This one is not black as seen on the pictures.</li>
            <li>It has a very masculine smell that I just can&#x27;t get enough of!</li>
            <li>The Essence by Porsche Design does smell slightly on the sweet side at first, but that usually dissipates within 30 to 60 minutes.</li>
            <li>It is a subtle and clean smell.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> My husband has used this product for several years, although I can no longer find it in any of the stores.  I was thrilled to get it (and at a good price) online.  No more driving to neighboring towns (in defeat), to try and find this cologne!  It smells fantastic (ooo-la-la)......although I&#x27;m not crazy about my husband smelling so great when he&#x27;s heading out the door and into a world full of women who probably also love the way he smells.  All kidding aside, we are both very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The item was as it is described. It was well packaged. I didn&#x27;t begin to use it since i have a little in my old one. I recommend this essence to all men.</li>
            <li> I just received this fragrance from Amazon. Everything was sealed, opened the packaged and saw that serial number scratched off the bottle. Tried to get a replacement from Amazon but they said they cannot exchange. DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON</li>
            <li> I discovered this scent at a \\&quot;Men&#x27;s Journal\\&quot; event in Las Vegas last month.  Porsche was there promoting their designer lines.  I enjoyed it very much and happened to look it up on Amazon when I got home.  I was trying to decide between this and another but when I found this great price, I couldn&#x27;t resist.  It is a subtle and clean smell.  I have received several compliments when I have worn it and am often asked what it is.  If you are looking for something different that not everyone has, this is a great option.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is nice for the price. My first impression was a slight sophistication of strong citrus, that was semi-sweet, but not cloying or synthetic, with a crisp sillage. Furthermore this slightly resembles Wings or Nautica Blue, however it is more mature than NB, without feeling totally like another cheap citrus. If you enjoy Wings or NB you may want to sample this one. While I think it&#x27;s a pleasant scent it&#x27;s not overly original, to some it may have no appeal at all. Though its still a cheapy worth trying.</li>
            <li> For the price its worth it.It has a nice light smell. Good for daily use. I would recommend it but also consider the one with the black bottle. This one is not black as seen on the pictures. Its light blue.</li>
            <li> It is the only Porsche I can afford! Haha! Seriously, smells great and not over powering. No negative comments from women too... Unless they&#x27;re not telling me. Bottom line, I love it!</li>
            <li> This cologne smells great.  If you love Porsche&#x27;s, you&#x27;ll automatically love this cologne.  Was surprised at the price for a nice big bottle.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> This is a fine manly scent to wear under your leather racing suit. Kind of woodsy, fresh, like a brisk morning at a racetrack in the forest.</li>
            <li> Yes my husband really likes it !! And so do I!! As a Porsche family 1-911 2-914and a 944 what could have been better ??? Yes it was fun to give !!</li>
            <li> This review is for this Porsche Design men&#x27;s fragrance...[[ASIN:B002XQ1XJG Porsche The Essence By Porsche Design For Men Edt Spray 2.7 Oz]]    It&#x27;s been very difficult for me to find a decent replacement for my old favorite - Scott McClintock for men (by Jessica McClintock) - which was discontinued about 5 years ago and is no longer available anywhere online. My wife wasn&#x27;t crazy about Devin by Aramis and although she does like The One by Dolce &amp; Gabbana, it&#x27;s just a little too sweet smelling for me. The original Kanon was a decent alternative to the Scott McClintock, but the generic replacements don&#x27;t come close. I&#x27;ve just about given up after traipsing through Neiman Marcus, Bloomingdales etc sampling the latest Bulgari&#x27;s, Guccis, Hugo Boss etc and so I decided to take a chance on this one because the price was excellent and because it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than their other wares.    Like the Scott McClintock The Essence by Porsche Design does smell slightly on the sweet side at first, but that usually dissipates within 30 to 60 minutes. You&#x27;re left with a subtle but refreshingly masculine outdoorsy smell. Almost like standing in a freshly pruned pine forest with a cool mountain mist nipping the bite off the pine smell. A masculine fragrance that&#x27;s easy to appreciate but difficult to describe accurately.    If you&#x27;re looking for something that will get you noticed when you walk into a crowded room, then look elsewhere as this one isn&#x27;t for you. On the other hand if you&#x27;re looking for something completely different that every second guy isn&#x27;t wearing, then The Essence by Porsche Design might just be the one for you. Oh and also, this is a smell that the ladies love and can&#x27;t seem to get enough of!</li>
            <li> This smells great! I got it for my boyfriend and I was a bit skeptical because of the price being so low but I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance! He loves it! It has a very masculine smell that I just can&#x27;t get enough of!</li>
            <li> For the first time in our 35 years of marriage I purchased a bottle of cologne for my husband without smelling it first. Normally we go to the store together so we can see how the scent smells on his skin. But he loves everything Porsche, so I took a gamble and ordered it online. Like everything that Porsche makes, the packaging and bottle for the cologne are classy and well-designed. More importantly the scent is amazing and smells great on him. We both love it!</li>
            <li> I had this cologne a few years ago, and when I found it on here I knew I had to have it. It smells as good as it used to.</li>
            <li> The item is a gift for my son-in-law and this is his favourite fragrance and on him it smells very good..</li>
            <li> I first encountered this in Germany, appropriately enough.  Used in moderation, it&#x27;s a clean and less obtrusive fragrance, very pleasant and distinctive without being overly musky.  I am not a frequent user of cologne, but I find this understated and pleasant enough to sport it on occasion.</li>
            <li> The women love the smell!</li>
    </ol>
