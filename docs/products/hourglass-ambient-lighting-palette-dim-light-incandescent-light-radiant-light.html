            <li>, this is a superb value.</li>
            <li>than that, it&#x27;s a very good product!</li>
            <li>product, however, is just beautiful on any type of skin....</li>
            <li>looks great on any skin tone),</li>
            <li>3 powders in one palette is great for travel - I can change up what I&#x27;m wearing without having to cram a bunch of bulky cases in my makeup bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t mind spending that $$ because I&#x27;ve not found anything as good.  </li>
            <li>how the powder is good</li>
            <li>The palette absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products!  </li>
            <li>I love this palette!  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing highlighter pallet.</li>
            <li>I really loved the incandescent color in this palette better.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the most beautiful powder that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I have this palette and love it....</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Hourglass ambient lighting powder is like magic for my skin.</li>
            <li>I have learned many cosmetic sellers here on amazon</li>
            <li>&gt; LOVE this palette</li>
            <li>It provides a healthy, refreshing glow.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
            <li>Hourglass has top niche products..</li>
            <li>love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li>(even if it&#x27;s a bit much) they are THAT good.</li>
            <li>The light (highlighting color) listed is called incandescent light which is more shimmery and pearl-like.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t have a problem with it collecting in fine lines.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine if you want to mix them together, but I prefer each powder color to stay separate.</li>
            <li>and they can look chalky or &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34; and settle into fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>these really add a nice glow to my skin and make it look luminous.  </li>
            <li>IT gives me a great highlight under the eyes and above my cheek bones.</li>
            <li>the radiant light (adds warmth to the skin like a bronzer).</li>
            <li>primarily use it as a finishing powder, applying it once the rest of my makeup is on and then spraying with a setting spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a great venue simply for REVIEWS on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the powder over the primer from the same brand and it looks great.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the price tag!</li>
            <li>You can buy two out of three of the products individually at Sephora for $45 each (the dim light - awesome color - neutral peach beige color --</li>
            <li>n if this is going to b ur first one you will love it.</li>
            <li>Before getting this palette finishing powder was something I rarely had a strong opinion about.  </li>
            <li>Once you know how to use these powders I guarantee you won&#x27;t be able to live without them!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I couldn&#x27;t recommend this palette more highly.  </li>
            <li>palette contains 3 colors: Incandescent Light, Dim Light, and Radiant Light&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But if it&#x27;s worth all the hype and money</li>
            <li>think the one thing worth noting is that because contouring and highlighting is a big thing right now I&#x27;ve seen people asking if this is appropriate for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it straight from hourglass, since it is sold out at Sephora and EVERYWHERE!</li>
            <li>You would receive more product individually; however the trio is convenient.</li>
            <li>When they recently made the palettes available again - after what seemed like forever of being off the shelves, I was very excited.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel like using this in conjunction with foundation (I&#x27;m using Hourglass Illusion) and blush makes my skin look so much healthier and fresher.  </li>
            <li>The only one you can not buy is the incandescent light (the lighter color).</li>
            <li>The only color Sephora that is closer to this color is the ethereal light.</li>
            <li>The ambient lighting powders really blur your imperfections and your face</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;-The palette is the ONLY place you can get the incandescent light powder.</li>
            <li>Who ever get the chance buy it from sephora directly its much cheaper</li>
            <li>however it last and is worth every penny</li>
            <li>I also appreciate that as someone who has sensitive skin it doesn&#x27;t make my skin itch or feel</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very bugged people are selling the individual compacts on Amazon for $65 (vs. $45 at Sephora) and this trio for $199.</li>
            <li>but I can only guess they buy it at Sephora or  or work at Sephora and get it at a really reduced price</li>
            <li>young, old, you name it.  </li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t like powders because I have mature skin</li>
            <li>It is very light and subtle, which I like, especially for day wear.</li>
            <li>Personally, I find the pigment to be too subtle to use it for this purpose and like these more for applying all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your money, when you can get the two of the same items for $90 +</li>
            <li>I disagree, it&#x27;s a soft shimmer which is very different from a sparkle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nice but a lot expensive than sephora</li>
            <li>There are other powders which does the exact same as this one.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s bad enough the gas stations do it, I&#x27;ll be damn if I do it over some make-up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is absolutely the most beautiful powder that I have ever used. It gives a beautiful glow ! I get compliments on how I am &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; every time I wear it . It is definitely worth the price tag!</li>
            <li> Before getting this palette finishing powder was something I rarely had a strong opinion about.  I knew it was necessary to set my makeup, but it never felt as transformative to my makeup routine as other products in my arsenal.  This palette changed has changed that.  Where as finishing and setting powder can make my face look flat these really add a nice glow to my skin and make it look luminous.  I feel like using this in conjunction with foundation (I&#x27;m using Hourglass Illusion) and blush makes my skin look so much healthier and fresher.  I also don&#x27;t have a problem with it collecting in fine lines.  I also appreciate that as someone who has sensitive skin it doesn&#x27;t make my skin itch or feel irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the one thing worth noting is that because contouring and highlighting is a big thing right now I&#x27;ve seen people asking if this is appropriate for that purpose.  Personally, I find the pigment to be too subtle to use it for this purpose and like these more for applying all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I couldn&#x27;t recommend this palette more highly.  It&#x27;s a holygrail for me and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I have this palette and love it....This price is crazy...go to Sephora or the co website...it&#x27;s $58.00!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I ordered it straight from hourglass, since it is sold out at Sephora and EVERYWHERE! IT gives me a great highlight under the eyes and above my cheek bones. It also adds dimension on the edges of my face. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this palette at Sephora for $58. You can buy two out of three of the products individually at Sephora for $45 each (the dim light - awesome color - neutral peach beige color -- looks great on any skin tone), the radiant light (adds warmth to the skin like a bronzer). The only one you can not buy is the incandescent light (the lighter color). Not sure why that is the case. The light (highlighting color) listed is called incandescent light which is more shimmery and pearl-like. The only color Sephora that is closer to this color is the ethereal light. I really loved the incandescent color in this palette better. Three individual hourglass compacts at Sephora would cost you $135. You would receive more product individually; however the trio is convenient. It sold out at Sephora superfast and hourglass/Sephora did not expect that to happen. Selling this product at $199 is ridiculously expensive and overrated! Do NOT waste your money, when you can get the two of the same items for $90 + the similar product (ethereal) for $45 &#x3D; $135 total at Sephora. I&#x27;m very bugged people are selling the individual compacts on Amazon for $65 (vs. $45 at Sephora) and this trio for $199.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products!  It illuminates skin and works with any skin type!  Way over priced on Amazon $78 vs. $58 at Sephora.</li>
            <li> Whoever is selling this palette for $99 is highway robbery! Please purchase it at Sephora! It&#x27;s now a permanent product! I recently purchased it for $58 and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! The ambient lighting powders really blur your imperfections and your face looks look those oldie 1920-30 Hollywood movie stars!!! You glow! Which is a great look to have! Great for taking HD pictures! Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Hourglass ambient lighting powder is like magic for my skin. When they recently made the palettes available again - after what seemed like forever of being off the shelves, I was very excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powders are not too shimmery unlike other similar ones. They make it look like my skin is air brushed and clear with just a few swoops of my makeup brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I primarily use it as a finishing powder, applying it once the rest of my makeup is on and then spraying with a setting spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The palette contains 3 colors: Incandescent Light, Dim Light, and Radiant Light&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-At $58, this is a superb value. The individual powders (although a bit bigger than the ones in this palette) usually sell for $45 alone.&lt;br /&gt;-All 3 powders in one palette is great for travel - I can change up what I&#x27;m wearing without having to cram a bunch of bulky cases in my makeup bag.&lt;br /&gt;-The palette is the ONLY place you can get the incandescent light powder. It isn&#x27;t sold separately at all.&lt;br /&gt;-It is made without parabens and has no talc or gluten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Since it is 3 in 1,  have to be careful when putting the powder on your brush not to swoop a bunch of one color onto another color. That&#x27;s fine if you want to mix them together, but I prefer each powder color to stay separate.</li>
            <li> Once you know how to use these powders I guarantee you won&#x27;t be able to live without them! They give the skin that &#x27;lit from within&#x27; look. They are fool proof and you can&#x27;t do it wrong. I also like the palette because it has 3 shades for $54 (if ordered from Sephora) so you can try them before you spend $45 on a individual. Now I want every shade! (even if it&#x27;s a bit much) they are THAT good. Every woman should have this palette in there makeup collection!  However don&#x27;t order this palette here order at Sephora it&#x27;s $54. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s $75 here but I can only guess they buy it at Sephora or  or work at Sephora and get it at a really reduced price then mark the price up like crazy. I have learned many cosmetic sellers here on amazon do that and shame on them.</li>
            <li> I know this current pricing on Amazon is unrealistic, you just need to go to Sephora or see the other options out there - but it&#x27;s a great venue simply for REVIEWS on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this - purchased this autentic palette on eBay for $53, included shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; LOVE this palette - it appears that it will last a long, long time so I don&#x27;t mind spending that $$ because I&#x27;ve not found anything as good.  I generally don&#x27;t like powders because I have mature skin and they can look chalky or &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34; and settle into fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, however, is just beautiful on any type of skin....young, old, you name it.  It provides a healthy, refreshing glow.  Even in the sunlight I detect no &amp;#34;sparkles&amp;#34; (I&#x27;ve seen a couple of reviews on different sites referencing it being somewhat sparkly.  I disagree, it&#x27;s a soft shimmer which is very different from a sparkle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I have to agree with H.H. review; why is this item so over-priced? This type of business should be frowned upon! I will never purchase items from a vendor that price-gauges! It&#x27;s bad enough the gas stations do it, I&#x27;ll be damn if I do it over some make-up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s a very good product!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately i got a fake one not the real thing .paid 75 $ :(</li>
            <li> I was dying to get any of the ambient powders that everyone is raving about, and amazone is the only place can ship to my country but its far too expensive and the prices increases again while my powder was waiting in my cart!!! Any how the powder is good i like the way it applies to my skin it gives a flowless finish. Who ever get the chance buy it from sephora directly its much cheaper</li>
            <li> I love this palette!  I use the powder over the primer from the same brand and it looks great.  It is very light and subtle, which I like, especially for day wear.</li>
            <li> I have this palette but I bought it from the Hourglass website for $58.00. This way over priced why this is a rip off!</li>
            <li> The palette absolutely gorgeous. No doubt about it. But if it&#x27;s worth all the hype and money v r paying I&#x27;m not so sure. There are other powders which does the exact same as this one. So just not a must have. If u don&#x27;t have any other highlighters n if this is going to b ur first one you will love it.</li>
            <li> nice but a lot expensive than sephora</li>
            <li> This is an amazing highlighter pallet. Hourglass has top niche products..I watch tons of videos on makeup and their products rank high. its pricey however it last and is worth every penny</li>
            <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
