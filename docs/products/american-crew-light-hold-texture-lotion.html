            <li>Easy to work with, and a very nice scent, so those are pluses.</li>
            <li>Smells nice too.</li>
            <li>Best for people with thinner, straight, hair.</li>
            <li>The hold is nice, and the texture is nice, but it smells like urine.  </li>
            <li>I would prefer unscented or a bit milder, but the product provides a nice hold and is easier to apply than a pomade.</li>
            <li>Has a light aroma, which is good.</li>
            <li>The hair gets great texture consistently after applying it.</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered this it was great.  </li>
            <li>Very light hold for medium length hair</li>
            <li>Perfect for my short hair, takes out the frizz and adds texture.</li>
            <li>Glad I can still order this online since it seems to be out of production.  </li>
            <li>If you need more control, this is not for you.</li>
            <li>The magic product for all hair types.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>A pomade would give a more formal look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I can save my forming cream for my free nights!</li>
            <li>Gives a nice light control all day.</li>
            <li>I sometimes blowdry it to give it a more matte look.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s hooked:)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>Its pretty dang good.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome, light hold, provide a kind of textured wet look to your hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and need just a light hold to help keep it in place.  </li>
            <li>The scent is too strong and the consistency is slightly more runny.</li>
            <li>the price in this larger bottle is very good, too.</li>
            <li>I have tried other creams, but this works the best for me.</li>
            <li>Easy to wash out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Neutral smell and washes out easily.  </li>
            <li>Not going to hold up to high winds, but good for all day in the office.</li>
            <li>Perfect amount of light hold that combines well with additional layers of other products.</li>
            <li>I am a man with fine hair and need something that thickens....</li>
            <li>Light, easy to apply, easy to clean off your hands and as close to unscented as you can get.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that this is a \\&quot;light hold\\&quot; product - probably lighter than so-called light hold gels.</li>
            <li>This is a light lotion.  </li>
            <li>The only one my husband will useâ€¦ he has fly away here and this keeps it in place without stickiness.</li>
            <li>As the description states the lotion provides a light hold and goes in sort of like leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Light, clean smell.</li>
            <li>Clean , light scent and hold.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Specially great for medium to long hair lengths.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this is a great product for grey hair.  </li>
            <li>Great for dry/corse grey hair</li>
            <li>, men this is great, hair keeps moist look, is soft that you can touch it like nothing on it, but keeps your hairstyle for the whole day..</li>
            <li>In the interest of full disclosure, I&#x27;m well into my 40s</li>
            <li>Makes for a nice, natural look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all, mousse, gel, pomade, but this is the best product for styling my hair, which is thick and frizzy sometimes.</li>
            <li>I just put a penny sized amount into my hair after shampoo/conditioner and towel drying, and it makes my hair so much smoother, softer, shinier, and more ease to style.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I can buy it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I now use American Crew Fiber, and am most pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly, husband likes it for his beard though he has now changed to beard oil</li>
            <li>Cream for a light hold, smells great, and use less than a dime size amount each time!</li>
            <li>The odor, while not unpleasant, remains until you wash your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a large number of hair products to keep my usually long hair manageable and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Do ensure you are buying fresh stock.</li>
            <li>Texture lotion looks and feels much more natural than gel.  </li>
            <li>Its one of the rare non-gel ones out there.</li>
            <li>I have thin hair and this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I work in a very silica and glaze rich pottery environment:</li>
            <li>Came on time with right product.</li>
            <li>I purchased the light hold gel and would highly recommend it over this product.</li>
            <li>Really, it&#x27;s pretty smelly and the smell doesn&#x27;t wear off.</li>
            <li>My husband only uses Crew Light texture Lotion...perfect for any guy!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Found it on Amazon for almost the exact price we pay in store.  </li>
            <li>The second time I ordered the product was more liquid than lotion.  </li>
            <li>This product is the best I have found for casual medium length hair.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>Smells very good, and keeps my hair from feeling dry and dead.</li>
            <li>Product is fine but it arrived in a plastic bag partially open with product all over on the inside ......&lt;br</li>
            <li>My female barber recommended this to me years ago for light control of my hair.  </li>
            <li>This lotion lives up to the light hold name and it&#x27;s just enough.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t tell it is there at all, and it really keeps a neat look to your hair throughout the day.</li>
            <li>only have the light hold GEL which is too flaky.  </li>
            <li>It does not take much and it holds my hair in place.  </li>
            <li>I use Crew Light Hold Styling Gel regularly and like the product</li>
            <li>Firm enough hair with perfect styling to last all day</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying the light texture hold from a local supplier for years.</li>
            <li>works very well and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or really think like the Crew pastes do.  </li>
            <li>In these recessionary times it&#x27;s also nice to save a few $$ and the pricing on this was reasonable.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, just a small drop does the daily job on my hair.</li>
            <li>I am a balding senior with fine textured grey hair.  </li>
            <li>Unless your going for the slick back look this is a great product that works with the hair not against it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but it is definitely different in texture and scent from what I&#x27;ve gotten from years from local salons.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied, same formula despite the slight name change.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 20 year old guy with fairly long hair (it easily covers my eyes and ears).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product to all men.</li>
            <li>Amazing product styles and provides sufficient hold with out the hard caked on look of gel.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hard and leaves it soft and manageable, I can run my fingers through my hair and it will retain the style and still be soft, full, and full of body and bounce!</li>
            <li>He can&#x27;t live without this product.  </li>
            <li>I have been using American Crew Light Hold Texture cream for several years.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for style and a soft to the touch coif</li>
            <li>Works great and doesn&#x27;t give you that hard hair that eventually turns into flakes like some other brands.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s consistent with the American Crew brand.</li>
            <li>Wish the smell was not so strong or I would want to use it everyday.</li>
            <li>If I am buying 2 bottles to save on freight,I put the other bottle in the refrigerator or a cool spot.</li>
            <li>The only thing I need to do for a decent hair day (besides a decent cut).  </li>
            <li>Hair is still soft after application.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the hair care equivalent of sitting on an airplane next to someone wearing too much cologne.</li>
            <li>Has a soft hold</li>
            <li>It is not greasy, and it makes my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>My hair does &#x27;move&#x27;around some &amp; I like that...very &#x27;natural&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I like how it leaves my hair feeling natural but under control.  </li>
            <li>Keeps hair in place and does not smell like an old woman or a flower shop.</li>
            <li>This takes all the oil from the hair and Texture Cream is the only product that puts the correct amount back in, right away.</li>
            <li>The cream is lightly and  delicately scented like wheat or something; definitely not spicy or perfumed like so many other cloying brands out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not a large container, but it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Received fast, product as expected.</li>
            <li>It is not like regular inorganic hair grease type stuff and if you go more that 2 years out on this product you may start to notice it becomes slightly waxy and picks up a slightly pungent odour.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;ve tried others that weigh your hair down with too much junk.</li>
            <li>I normally use other Crew products and decided to try this lighter hold lotion.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, but lid not on tight, so it leaked.</li>

            <li> only have the light hold GEL which is too flaky.  </li>
            <li> It does not take much and it holds my hair in place.  </li>
            <li> I use Crew Light Hold Styling Gel regularly and like the product</li>
            <li> Firm enough hair with perfect styling to last all day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying the light texture hold from a local supplier for years.</li>
            <li> works very well and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or really think like the Crew pastes do.  </li>
            <li> In these recessionary times it&#x27;s also nice to save a few $$ and the pricing on this was reasonable.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, just a small drop does the daily job on my hair.</li>
            <li> I am a balding senior with fine textured grey hair.  </li>
            <li> Unless your going for the slick back look this is a great product that works with the hair not against it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but it is definitely different in texture and scent from what I&#x27;ve gotten from years from local salons.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, same formula despite the slight name change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 20 year old guy with fairly long hair (it easily covers my eyes and ears).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product to all men.</li>
            <li> Amazing product styles and provides sufficient hold with out the hard caked on look of gel.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hard and leaves it soft and manageable, I can run my fingers through my hair and it will retain the style and still be soft, full, and full of body and bounce!</li>
            <li> He can&#x27;t live without this product.  </li>
            <li> I have been using American Crew Light Hold Texture cream for several years.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for style and a soft to the touch coif</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t give you that hard hair that eventually turns into flakes like some other brands.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s consistent with the American Crew brand.</li>
            <li> Wish the smell was not so strong or I would want to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> If I am buying 2 bottles to save on freight,I put the other bottle in the refrigerator or a cool spot.</li>
            <li> The only thing I need to do for a decent hair day (besides a decent cut).  </li>
            <li> Hair is still soft after application.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the hair care equivalent of sitting on an airplane next to someone wearing too much cologne.</li>
            <li> Has a soft hold</li>
            <li> It is not greasy, and it makes my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> My hair does &#x27;move&#x27;around some &amp; I like that...very &#x27;natural&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I like how it leaves my hair feeling natural but under control.  </li>
            <li> Keeps hair in place and does not smell like an old woman or a flower shop.</li>
            <li> This takes all the oil from the hair and Texture Cream is the only product that puts the correct amount back in, right away.</li>
            <li> The cream is lightly and  delicately scented like wheat or something; definitely not spicy or perfumed like so many other cloying brands out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a large container, but it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Received fast, product as expected.</li>
            <li> It is not like regular inorganic hair grease type stuff and if you go more that 2 years out on this product you may start to notice it becomes slightly waxy and picks up a slightly pungent odour.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;ve tried others that weigh your hair down with too much junk.</li>
            <li> I normally use other Crew products and decided to try this lighter hold lotion.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, but lid not on tight, so it leaked.</li>
            <li> Only about a dime size is needed, and its going to last for a very long time...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, especially since the small amount needed means it will last such a long time.</li>
            <li> This particular variation of their product can sometimes be hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> He has been using this product for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Just enough hold without the wet look.  </li>
            <li> Soft but firm hold.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected, but that&#x27;s likely me, not the product.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a very long time.</li>
            <li> apply a dime to nickel size drop to dry or almost dry hair.</li>
            <li> The lotion is quite greasy and doesn&#x27;t dry or dissipate.  </li>
            <li> More expensive locally and hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry hair, this stuff acts as a lotion-conditioner for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have stark white quite dry hair by genetic propensity and am also well into my sixties so my body does not put out the oils like it used to</li>
            <li> I squeeze some on wet hands and disperse thru wet hair and blow dry into my style and it stays there.</li>
            <li> The good news is that they put the bottle in a sealed bag, the bad news it still leaked and was a little messy in the bag.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like the wet look even if it&#x27;s in.  </li>
            <li> Not sticky, doesn&#x27;t flake and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I usually like any of the other American Crew products, but the smell of this one keeps me from using it.</li>
            <li> The other reviewers here are reviewing the packaging or shipping issues...</li>
            <li> Not as described in other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Just what I expected!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference (other than fragrance), and am paying half the price.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in our local stores.  </li>
            <li> A minor gripe for the unbelievable job it does day after day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a few years (my hear has gotten harder to control as it has gotten grayer.  </li>
            <li> It controls my hair well and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or weighed down.</li>
            <li> ..keep it down.  </li>
            <li> Typically don&#x27;t wear hair products.</li>
            <li> Tried this as an alternative to the Jack Black stuff.  </li>
            <li> Does Not leave a crusty stiff residue like the typical others.  </li>
            <li> It takes just a little bit to provide control without being too heavy.  </li>
            <li> He has very thick, short hair</li>
            <li> It adds some volume &amp; isn&#x27;t harsh on my hair wearing it for 9-10 hours a day at work.  </li>
            <li> almost everyday</li>
            <li> works like gel to hold hair, yet does not have that firm or sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> But now I can purchase it for about 7 dollars less than what I paid at the salon!</li>
            <li> It never makes your hair stiff like gel, but it controls frizz and makes your hair smoother.  </li>
            <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t make hair stiff or shinny will buy again.</li>
            <li> After using it for the first time there was an odor in the bottle so bad I had to re wash my hair.</li>
            <li> usually stores  </li>
            <li> The thick paste or pomade works, but find it too thick and stiff for my needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my thin dark hair for lengths from 1.5&amp;#34; to 4&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Hard to find...great product.</li>
            <li> I work a very small amount in after showering, brush it in and ;</li>
            <li> A little expensive</li>
            <li> Was thinking I was going to have to shave head but false alarm.  </li>
            <li> I think they changed the scent, but it&#x27;s very subtle and others probably can&#x27;t smell it anyway.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t look so fake all day.</li>
            <li> It stinks.</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great service and value.</li>
            <li> Very light hold for medium length hair</li>
            <li> Perfect for my short hair, takes out the frizz and adds texture. Smells nice too. Not sticky, doesn&#x27;t flake and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using this for years!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, just a small drop does the daily job on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair, this stuff acts as a lotion-conditioner for my hair. Smells very good, and keeps my hair from feeling dry and dead. Only about a dime size is needed, and its going to last for a very long time... Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Glad I can still order this online since it seems to be out of production.  Best light hold lotion out there.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent for a light hold without the hardness of a gel or paste.  Hair is still soft after application.  Best for people with thinner, straight, hair.</li>
            <li> I am a balding senior with fine textured grey hair.  My female barber recommended this to me years ago for light control of my hair.  I like it because it is not greasy and does a great job.  I have tried other creams, but this works the best for me.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for ten years. I like it because it does not feel like there is anything in your hair. Keep in mind that this is a \\&quot;light hold\\&quot; product - probably lighter than so-called light hold gels. If you need more control, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> The hold is nice, and the texture is nice, but it smells like urine.  It smells like someone peed on my head.</li>
            <li> I usually like any of the other American Crew products, but the smell of this one keeps me from using it. It controls my hair well and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or weighed down. Wish the smell was not so strong or I would want to use it everyday. It&#x27;s not even a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Light, easy to apply, easy to clean off your hands and as close to unscented as you can get. I have tried a large number of hair products to keep my usually long hair manageable and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Good service ; good product</li>
            <li> Good product.  My husband has been using it for years.  Timely delivery.</li>
            <li> It stinks. Really, it&#x27;s pretty smelly and the smell doesn&#x27;t wear off. It&#x27;s the hair care equivalent of sitting on an airplane next to someone wearing too much cologne.</li>
            <li> Bought this product since my hair stylist didn&#x27;t have it on hand. Very satisfied, same formula despite the slight name change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a few years (my hear has gotten harder to control as it has gotten grayer.  It takes just a little bit to provide control without being too heavy.  Good product, and the price in this larger bottle is very good, too.</li>
            <li> I have been using American Crew Light Hold Texture cream for several years. It was recommended to me by my barber.</li>
            <li> Nothing else like this. The magic product for all hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specially great for medium to long hair lengths.</li>
            <li> The good news is that they put the bottle in a sealed bag, the bad news it still leaked and was a little messy in the bag.  Over all the product is good and I&#x27;ve used it for a number of years.  It does as advertised.</li>
            <li> I only use this brand for texture.  It gives texture to my hair without making it sticky.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it. The hair gets great texture consistently after applying it.</li>
            <li> He can&#x27;t live without this product.  Uses it all the time. Been using this product for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Came on time with right product.</li>
            <li> Good product - my husband loves it!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product. It holds his hair in place. Thank you. Great product. He has been using this product for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> keeps my hair from flying around here in south Florida.... love it</li>
            <li> This is my hair product if choice and has been for almost 15 years.  It never makes your hair stiff like gel, but it controls frizz and makes your hair smoother.  I just wish easier to find.  Luckily, I can buy it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Just enough hold without the wet look.  In the interest of full disclosure, I&#x27;m well into my 40s and I don&#x27;t like the wet look even if it&#x27;s in.  This lotion lives up to the light hold name and it&#x27;s just enough.  I think they changed the scent, but it&#x27;s very subtle and others probably can&#x27;t smell it anyway.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair gels, paste etc. and I think this is the best.</li>
            <li> This product is the best I have found for casual medium length hair. You can&#x27;t tell it is there at all, and it really keeps a neat look to your hair throughout the day. A pomade would give a more formal look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since gone to a shorter cut. I now use American Crew Fiber, and am most pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t see ever going back from purchasing American Crew.</li>
            <li> I normally use other Crew products and decided to try this lighter hold lotion. After using it for the first time there was an odor in the bottle so bad I had to re wash my hair. Had to throw it out.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my days at work.  I wanted to stop using my good Crew Forming Cream on work days, to keep from wasting it.  This was perfect.  It&#x27;s not as sturdy as my forming cream.  It adds some volume &amp; isn&#x27;t harsh on my hair wearing it for 9-10 hours a day at work.  Now I can save my forming cream for my free nights! WOOO!</li>
            <li> This stuff is rad.  I can never seem to find it now days.. usually stores  only have the light hold GEL which is too flaky.  This stuff gives you hold and shine without the stiffness and flakiness of gel.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Has a light aroma, which is good. Has a soft hold so it doesn&#x27;t look so fake all day.</li>
            <li> This is a light lotion.  It does not take much and it holds my hair in place.  It is not greasy, and it makes my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a hair Lotion that would &#x27;hold&#x27; w/o that &#x27;stiff-glue&#x27; factor.  For me, this is perfect...I can still run my hand thru my hair &amp; don&#x27;t have that &#x27;clunky&#x27;  feel etc..My hair does &#x27;move&#x27;around some &amp; I like that...very &#x27;natural&#x27;.</li>
            <li> My husband only uses Crew Light texture Lotion...perfect for any guy!</li>
            <li> Great product! My husband has been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, husband likes it for his beard though he has now changed to beard oil</li>
            <li> Just as promised. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I&#x27;ve used it on my thin dark hair for lengths from 1.5&amp;#34; to 4&amp;#34; (I don&#x27;t get my hair cut often for no reason). Gives a nice light control all day. Not going to hold up to high winds, but good for all day in the office. Easy to apply and smells great. Easy to wash out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply a dime to nickel size drop to dry or almost dry hair. I sometimes blowdry it to give it a more matte look.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff for school, work, dressy occasions, etc. almost everyday and I&#x27;m somehow only through 25% of the bottle. Perfect amount of light hold that combines well with additional layers of other products. Do not need a lot each time. Light, clean smell.</li>
            <li> Hard to find...great product.</li>
            <li> Great item and price.  More expensive locally and hard to find.  I would prefer unscented or a bit milder, but the product provides a nice hold and is easier to apply than a pomade.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and need just a light hold to help keep it in place.  I use just a drop, comb it through my hair with my fingers and it works wonderfully.  This is my second bottle...it lasts and lasts...</li>
            <li> I use Crew Light Hold Styling Gel regularly and like the product so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I am a man with fine hair and need something that thickens....this does the opposite. My hair lost any and all body and was totally unmanageable. Threw it away after one use...</li>
            <li> The other reviewers here are reviewing the packaging or shipping issues...this is for product review!  Anyway, this is a great product for grey hair.  Not as shiney as regular gels.  Great for dry/corse grey hair..keep it down.  Smells good too.</li>
            <li> I have stark white quite dry hair by genetic propensity and am also well into my sixties so my body does not put out the oils like it used to .Also I work in a very silica and glaze rich pottery environment:for safety I have to wash my scalp and hair thoroughly each day with a cleansing, non conditioner type shampoo.This takes all the oil from the hair and Texture Cream is the only product that puts the correct amount back in, right away. I work a very small amount in after showering, brush it in and ;voila,hair that would ordinarily become like steel wool,is instead transformed to actual soft non greasy-like normal hair.The cream is lightly and  delicately scented like wheat or something; definitely not spicy or perfumed like so many other cloying brands out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bottle lasts me almost a year.Do ensure you are buying fresh stock. If I am buying 2 bottles to save on freight,I put the other bottle in the refrigerator or a cool spot.It is not like regular inorganic hair grease type stuff and if you go more that 2 years out on this product you may start to notice it becomes slightly waxy and picks up a slightly pungent odour. A minor gripe for the unbelievable job it does day after day.</li>
            <li> Received fast, product as expected.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to try it out, men this is great, hair keeps moist look, is soft that you can touch it like nothing on it, but keeps your hairstyle for the whole day.. this is great</li>
            <li> I will never stop using this.</li>
            <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t make hair stiff or shinny will buy again.</li>
            <li> Texture lotion looks and feels much more natural than gel.  Purchasing online will save you a ton of $ vs. buying it at a hair salon as well.</li>
            <li> Works well - not greasy. Makes for a nice, natural look. Smells good. Highly recommend this product to all men.</li>
            <li> Product is fine but it arrived in a plastic bag partially open with product all over on the inside ......&lt;br /&gt;ðŸ˜«</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product every morning after he showers.  He has very thick, short hair and it helps keep the strays in place.  In these recessionary times it&#x27;s also nice to save a few $$ and the pricing on this was reasonable.</li>
            <li> Its pretty dang good.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, light hold, provide a kind of textured wet look to your hair. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years.</li>
            <li> Typically don&#x27;t wear hair products. But last time I went for a haircut, I was recommended this product and it works well. Been using it since.</li>
            <li> Our package was delivered on time and my husband loves the product.</li>
            <li> The only one my husband will useâ€¦ he has fly away here and this keeps it in place without stickiness.</li>
            <li> But now I can purchase it for about 7 dollars less than what I paid at the salon! Love it!!</li>
            <li> My husband has used this product for several years.  It is hard to find in our local stores.  Found it on Amazon for almost the exact price we pay in store.  He&#x27;s hooked:)</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t give you that hard hair that eventually turns into flakes like some other brands.</li>
            <li> This particular variation of their product can sometimes be hard to find locally. Shipped fast and exactly as promised. Great hair product if you&#x27;ve tried others that weigh your hair down with too much junk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, mousse, gel, pomade, but this is the best product for styling my hair, which is thick and frizzy sometimes. It doesn&#x27;t get hard and leaves it soft and manageable, I can run my fingers through my hair and it will retain the style and still be soft, full, and full of body and bounce!</li>
            <li> Amazing product styles and provides sufficient hold with out the hard caked on look of gel. Firm enough hair with perfect styling to last all day</li>
            <li> Not as described in other reviews.  The lotion is quite greasy and doesn&#x27;t dry or dissipate.  The odor, while not unpleasant, remains until you wash your hair.  I purchased the light hold gel and would highly recommend it over this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Soft but firm hold.  The only thing I need to do for a decent hair day (besides a decent cut).  I have used this for over 20 years and stock up on it when I buy it.  I thought once they had discontinued it (it use to be called Texture Creme) but they just changed the name.  Was thinking I was going to have to shave head but false alarm.  I highly recommend this for style and a soft to the touch coif</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying the light texture hold from a local supplier for years. I was in a pinch and needed to get some in a hurry, so I bought a bottle online. It&#x27;s just not the same. It&#x27;s okay, but it is definitely different in texture and scent from what I&#x27;ve gotten from years from local salons. it still works, but it&#x27;s not the same. The scent is too strong and the consistency is slightly more runny. Maybe I got a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; bottle. I shall be returning to a local salon for the product in the future.</li>
            <li> Good alternative to sticky gels</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered this it was great.  The second time I ordered the product was more liquid than lotion.  Very disappointed.  EA</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 20 year old guy with fairly long hair (it easily covers my eyes and ears). I just put a penny sized amount into my hair after shampoo/conditioner and towel drying, and it makes my hair so much smoother, softer, shinier, and more ease to style. It smells very nice without being overpowering. I highly recommend this, especially since the small amount needed means it will last such a long time.</li>
            <li> As the description states the lotion provides a light hold and goes in sort of like leave in conditioner.  Neutral smell and washes out easily.  A little expensive but that&#x27;s consistent with the American Crew brand.</li>
            <li> What I have been looking for! Cream for a light hold, smells great, and use less than a dime size amount each time!</li>
            <li> Not a large container, but it is exactly what I wanted. Doesn&#x27;t leave crusty residue and holds well.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Fast delivery, but lid not on tight, so it leaked.</li>
            <li> Tried this as an alternative to the Jack Black stuff.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference (other than fragrance), and am paying half the price.</li>
            <li> I wont buy anything else. Its one of the rare non-gel ones out there. I like how it leaves my hair feeling natural but under control.  Unless your going for the slick back look this is a great product that works with the hair not against it. Does Not leave a crusty stiff residue like the typical others.  The thick paste or pomade works, but find it too thick and stiff for my needs.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, but that&#x27;s likely me, not the product. It does say it&#x27;s a texture lotion, and I can&#x27;t fault it for that. Easy to work with, and a very nice scent, so those are pluses. Still, I&#x27;m not going to buy it again. Just not my product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all what was advertised. Totally disappointed. It&#x27;s not a cream or conditioner. It&#x27;s a gel. And doesn&#x27;t help with conditioning the hear at all.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair in place and does not smell like an old woman or a flower shop.</li>
            <li> works like gel to hold hair, yet does not have that firm or sticky feeling. doesn&#x27;t make me break out like gel either</li>
            <li> Clean , light scent and hold.</li>
            <li> works great on my hair</li>
            <li> works very well and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or really think like the Crew pastes do.  I have thin hair and this is perfect.  I squeeze some on wet hands and disperse thru wet hair and blow dry into my style and it stays there.</li>
