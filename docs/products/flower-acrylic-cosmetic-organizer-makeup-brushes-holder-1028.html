            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>but it fits most of my brushes</li>
            <li>I bought it to use as a desk top organizer.</li>
            <li>I love this thing uber cute</li>
            <li>My brushes are well organized in it, if I had more space I would buy it again.</li>

            <li>own alot of brushes and it would be nice to have the product redesigned but other than that it&#x27;s a good product .&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>It works fine for this.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even look like cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>This is a unique storage piece that fits well almost anywhere</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very durable, cute and holds some of my brushes.</li>
            <li>Would be really nice if it turned like a lazy susan, but good for the price</li>
            <li>I most likely will buy more of these for myself and as gifts.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really give a bad review because it was a gift and if the person is happy, then great!</li>
            <li>I like having super fresh herbs for cooking.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s made of acrylic, it is very sturdy and strong.</li>
            <li>the price, to get this item and realize it can fit in the palm of my hand was very</li>
            <li>great but only if you can get it for $10 and with free shippin as it is smaller than it looks</li>
            <li>my brushes fall right over and out.</li>
            <li>but the price was right.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful idea for cosmetic brushes, but the entire organizer is small and very short - if you have wide based brushes this may not be your ideal organizer...</li>
            <li>Its OK for concealer or eye shadow brushes..however it appear to be much bigger online than in person</li>
            <li>A larger more taller item the item I have</li>
            <li>But overall it was ok ..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to lots of fresh pesto from my new basil plants!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The sections of this makeup brush holder are perfect for holding each approximately 2\\&quot;-long stem in its own individual container of water.</li>
            <li>If your only looking for something to fit a few things then ok , but won&#x27;t fit all your brushes</li>
            <li>It allows me to see all my brushes, plus when I clean them they can air dry quickly with taking up a lot of space.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not obvious from the photo or description, but the holder is slightly taller on one side, which is perfect to accommodate stems of different lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A lot smaller than I thought it would be, my big make up brushes fit fine</li>
            <li>Really fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but the smaller ones just don&#x27;t fit all</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Size is very misleading</li>
            <li>This little holder is really cute, but I really wish it was taller.  </li>
            <li>It is thick acrylic with a nice look.</li>
            <li>In the picture it looks as though you can really fit quite a few items and it would really help to organize make up brushes and what have</li>
            <li>This organizer is a sharp clear acrylic that is very shiny and pretty.</li>
            <li>It looks nice and being small takes up minimal space.</li>
            <li>It is not too large, and it holds thin brushes and makeup tools within sight and for easy access.</li>
            <li>Does not fit most of my brushes small or large!  </li>
            <li>very cute its a little small</li>
            <li>but it is super small.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is probably not the type of review you were expecting, but maybe a useful surprise if you&#x27;re an amateur herb gardener like me.</li>
            <li>okay for big brushes, but not very suitable for eyeliner brush or some oner small ones</li>

            <li> Holds my brushes and liners perfectly! Really fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Its OK for concealer or eye shadow brushes..however it appear to be much bigger online than in person</li>
            <li> Holds lots of brushes, from eyes to face size.  Would be really nice if it turned like a lazy susan, but good for the price</li>
            <li> The picture does not do it justice. It doesn&#x27;t even look like cheap plastic. It&#x27;s thick and the plastic is very glossy. I love it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting. A larger more taller item the item I have&lt;br /&gt;I own alot of brushes and it would be nice to have the product redesigned but other than that it&#x27;s a good product .&lt;br /&gt;For small brushes in width and size it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> In the picture it looks as though you can really fit quite a few items and it would really help to organize make up brushes and what have you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, to get this item and realize it can fit in the palm of my hand was very dissapointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really give a bad review because it was a gift and if the person is happy, then great! However I would have bought something else had I known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for someone who has or does minimum make up.</li>
            <li> This organizer is a sharp clear acrylic that is very shiny and pretty. Much much smaller than it appears!</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I anticipated but thats partly my fault I guess.</li>
            <li> Guess i misread measurements. This is a really small jar. I will find a use for it but it is super small. Not what i expected. Fits in the palm of my hand and no bigger then ur fingers tip when curl. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It speaks for itself a big space saver.  Love it</li>
            <li> Even though this item is smaller than I thought it would be - it works. I even found a way to put my cuticle scissors in the small grooves - along with my make-up brushes.</li>
            <li> This little holder is really cute, but I really wish it was taller.  My make-up brushes just want to fall over.  I think this would be awesome if it were just a bit taller.</li>
            <li> Have not seen a brush holder like this.  In love!  I like that it holds my big handle brushes and the middle is spacious as well.. great buy!</li>
            <li> Good ! But too small! If your only looking for something to fit a few things then ok , but won&#x27;t fit all your brushes</li>
            <li> I loved this! It&#x27;s very durable, cute and holds some of my brushes. I most likely will buy more of these for myself and as gifts.</li>
            <li> Happy wife, happy life.</li>
            <li> It holds my brushes well without taking up a lot of space. They don&#x27;t fall out either. Would order again</li>
            <li> Are you kidding me with this brush holder? It is so small in size that the bottom quarter of my brush handles is all the thing holds... my brushes fall right over and out. It&#x27;s slightly larger in size then a softball.</li>
            <li> very cute its a little small but it fits most of my brushes</li>
            <li> Perfect in every way, my make up brushes look great in this, easy to choose a particular brush...awesome!!</li>
            <li> great but only if you can get it for $10 and with free shippin as it is smaller than it looks</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful idea for cosmetic brushes, but the entire organizer is small and very short - if you have wide based brushes this may not be your ideal organizer...however, I did find a use for it for all of the different mascaras, etc.</li>
            <li> They made it seem bigger than it was.&lt;br /&gt;It was tiny !!!!! But overall it was ok .. I guess</li>
            <li> Herb gardening is a newish interest of mine -- I like having super fresh herbs for cooking. I&#x27;ve been propagating basil using cuttings from my existing plants, but have had a problem keeping the short stems standing upright in a glass of water during the weeks required for them to develop roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sections of this makeup brush holder are perfect for holding each approximately 2\\&quot;-long stem in its own individual container of water. It&#x27;s not obvious from the photo or description, but the holder is slightly taller on one side, which is perfect to accommodate stems of different lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably not the type of review you were expecting, but maybe a useful surprise if you&#x27;re an amateur herb gardener like me. I&#x27;m looking forward to lots of fresh pesto from my new basil plants!</li>
            <li> Are much smaller than I had imagined. Keep that in mind when purchasing. None the less will put them to use at some point</li>
            <li> Product is smaller than it appears in picture.  I intended to use it for my nail tools, but the tools were bigger than the holder.  The nail tools were the same size as Make up brushes.</li>
            <li> Too small for makeup brushes</li>
            <li> Flower Acrylic Cosmetic Organizer Makeup Brushes Holder could be named Flower Acrylic Desk Organizer and Small Item Holder.  I bought it to use as a desk top organizer. Needing something other than a drawer in which things keep getting lost like pens, pencils, scissors ect. It works fine for this. The only problem is I didn&#x27;t check out the size of the organizer before buying it. I did not subtract any stars for this because it was my fault for not researching the organizer. Its small.  Its heavy so it dose not get knocked around the room but you can only get 3-4 standard pens/pencils in each larger circle. They are about 2/3 the size of a shot glass.  the small circles  would not hold any pens,  perhaps 3-4 Q tips. It looks nice and being small takes up minimal space.</li>
            <li> Useless didnt help in organising</li>
            <li> A lot smaller than I thought it would be, my big make up brushes fit fine but the smaller ones just don&#x27;t fit all that well but the price was right. I might figure out another use for it.</li>
            <li> This is a unique storage piece that fits well almost anywhere I need to use it. It is not too large, and it holds thin brushes and makeup tools within sight and for easy access.</li>
            <li> Not as big as I thought. Could not fit my brushes.</li>
            <li> Hold lots of brushes of all sizes. Only downfall is that the depth of opening should be deeper,so brushes don&#x27;t lean .</li>
            <li> too small doesn&#x27;t fit my small headed brushes. disappointed.....</li>
            <li> I love this thing uber cute</li>
            <li> Really small not good for anything it only fits about 5 brushes</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the size of this product.  It is very very small compared to what is shown in the picture.  Doesn&#x27;t hold the make up brushes well.</li>
            <li> My brushes are well organized in it, if I had more space I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. I probably could have bought this at the dollar store. It looked nifty on the picture. The holes are to small to hold certain makeup brushes. Will use anyway.</li>
            <li> okay for big brushes, but not very suitable for eyeliner brush or some oner small ones</li>
            <li> 2015 Year of Organization&lt;br /&gt;I love my makeup holder.  It allows me to see all my brushes, plus when I clean them they can air dry quickly with taking up a lot of space.</li>
            <li> Size is very misleading</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected..brushes fall out....</li>
            <li> This makeup organizer is very cute! Because it&#x27;s made of acrylic, it is very sturdy and strong. I wish it was bigger, but I do like it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my dressing table not knowing what I would get. It is thick acrylic with a nice look. Holds all of my Bare Mineral brushes with the exception of the thick handled kabuki. Makes them easy to access and looks great!  A good buy.</li>
            <li> smaller then expected.</li>
            <li> Too small. Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Pay attention to dimensions.  You do that even relieve how small. It would hold a pencil.</li>
            <li> MUCH smaller than what the picture looks like. The actual brush holders do not reach even half way up the brush. Very small. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> I thought this would be big enough to hold my makeup brushes. I placed my blush brush in the holder and it just fell over! This holder would honestly be good for maybe holding crayons for a toddler.</li>
            <li> too small! Does not fit most of my brushes small or large!  although the design is very cute!</li>
