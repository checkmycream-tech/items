            <li>A great find!</li>
            <li>LOVE this company!!!</li>
            <li>However with the addition of 2 or 3 drops of CoverFX Custom Cover Drops (I did find a very good match to my skin- shade N30)</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin</li>
            <li>Great cream that covers perfectly and is SPF 30.</li>
            <li>Also it smells soooo good!</li>
            <li>I find the rose scent perfect; it lingers throughout the day (perfect for when I don&#x27;t wear a scent).</li>
            <li>I do have some redness in my complexion, and this evened it out beautifully.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really happy to find this product.</li>
            <li>Smells great, too.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>and this works great for me.</li>
            <li>This is very nice product, but not for people with oily skin..</li>
            <li>It has a very nice smell that is not over powering.</li>
            <li>Really nice!</li>
            <li>Also, the fact that it uses Zinc Oxide but doesn&#x27;t leave a whiteish residue on my face, is surprising and great.</li>
            <li>Lovely scent and perfect color.  </li>
            <li>I think there is a good chance it will work for you.</li>
            <li>, Good apply with foundation</li>
            <li>if I continued to see good results with</li>
            <li>All the ingredients are good for skin.</li>
            <li>Wears well, provides a light coverage with SPF protection, non-irritating and SMELLS GREAT!!!</li>
            <li>It is a good product, with good protection against the sun.</li>
            <li>My skin is not looking it&#x27;s best right now, but it does FEEL good although I can feel the graininess of the zinc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keep it in a cool place, don&#x27;t let it get warm!!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>So glad I did!</li>
            <li>I have fallen in love!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t offer great blemish coverage, but it is light and smells nice.</li>
            <li>Support them, smell amazing (not perfume.....</li>
            <li>which is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice smell</li>
            <li>color is a nice peachy tan.</li>
            <li>It does offer a dewey look which is nice but considering the negatives</li>
            <li>Combo skin, and this stuff works nice for me.</li>
            <li>I was wearing foundation, so I liked this change with the Andalou Naturals CC spf 30.</li>
            <li>I have the Andalou Rose Stem Cell spray mist, which I use before I do any skincare or makeup application.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the tint for anyone with fair skin or who doesn&#x27;t plan on putting powder on top.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product has rose smell, but it fades soon after applied.&lt;br /&gt;Updated:</li>
            <li>This product smells wonderful without being overpowering,  I am very sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Love, love love Andalou products!  </li>
            <li>The smell of roses is incredible and it covers my skin very well.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely rose scent.</li>
            <li>far as organic and zinc go however, one of the BEST I&#x27;ve tried, I must admit.</li>
            <li>This sensitive formula never aggravates breakouts and the sun protection is excellent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a rose scent which I LOVE.</li>
            <li>I love the rose smell.</li>
            <li>I have not used many CC creams, but I have used the popular one by Dr. Jarts, and I have to say that Andalou Naturals CC cream looks better on my skin.  </li>
            <li>But what it does do is provide beautiful ingredients, good for my skin, and what this does in my opinion, is really provide more of a beautiful, natural, glow to the skin, and it acts like a primer.  </li>
            <li>It does have a somewhat greasy finish, but I have yet to find any non-chemical moisturizer with spf that doesn&#x27;t have some kind of sheen to it; I simply add primer and mattifying powder on top to absorb the shine and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>so I prefer very light coverage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light coverage</li>
            <li>I would reapply on my super fair daughter if she was out all day.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and rubs in easily.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>The 1000 Roses CC cream is a much better color match for my skin than either of Andalou Naturals tinted BB creams.</li>
            <li>I love that I can pronounce all of the ingredients in this product and that it does not contain silicones or parabens.</li>
            <li>Most tinted products or SPF products cause breakouts for me, so I&#x27;m glad to have found one that doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and is UVA/UVB with light coverage!.</li>
            <li>I love this CC cream</li>
            <li>The rose scent is lovely and the consistency is smooth and hydrating.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer... and it smells lovely</li>
            <li>I love this CC cream</li>
            <li>had more coverage.</li>
            <li>I am 60, not too many wrinkles for my age.</li>
            <li>Oh, and I love the smell of roses.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely okay</li>
            <li>I love the combo SPF and tint.</li>
            <li>Better suited for beigy skin tones.</li>
            <li>I love the way it evens my complexion...</li>
            <li>Best sheer cover I have ever used!</li>
            <li>so I was mixing it with a lighter color BB and that made it better</li>
            <li>I got this as a gift from my boyfriend and I love it</li>
            <li>It feels good and looks great, just caused me to have some red bump slightly-cystic break outs.</li>
            <li>and I already love it as well.</li>
            <li>The scent is also quite lovely too.</li>
            <li>You can add some sort of mineral powder on top if you want more coverage, but of course that is up to you.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s ok.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll add a mineral makeup on top and</li>
            <li>Love Andalou products and this CC cream is no exception.</li>
            <li>I do put powder on top for days</li>
            <li>I want a more matte look.</li>
            <li>Love the sunblock ingredients being nothing but zinc oxide.  </li>
            <li>I really really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the way it disappears ...</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizing face lotion.  </li>
            <li>My face skin health has improved with this lotion and find I have more breakouts if I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>This is a great sunscreen alternative with 20% zinc oxide, it blocks sun rays better than most high end, luxury brand name sunscreens.</li>
            <li>formula, as I&#x27;m pretty fair even with a bit of sun.</li>
            <li>I love how natural the product is and my skin is feeling great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it gives your skin really nice color and your skin can breath...but don&#x27;t expect it to cover all skin problems, this thing will only moisturize your skin and make its color/tone even, which is a great thing for every day life.</li>
            <li>and I loved it so much that I wanted to try more of their products.</li>
            <li>I was using foundation mostly for the spf factor, but by the end of the day the makeup settled into the fine lines on my face accentuating them.</li>
            <li>I have fair/light dry,sensitive skin and this new CC cream by Andalou naturals is amazing!</li>
            <li>Goes on well and easily, and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>Not a bad thing, but it requires me to tap on some rice powder over top to give it the matte effect I want.</li>
            <li>With a bit of finished powder it is just fine, but since the description says it&#x27;s mattifying</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t accentuate fine lines.</li>
            <li>I wish it worked for me, as the coverage was perfect (and heavier than I thought it would be based on previous reviews) and the sunscreen is mineral based.</li>
            <li>It is super moisturizing, although I&#x27;m sure some won&#x27;t like how you can still feel it on your face at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light coverage, and doesn&#x27;t look cakey like some creams do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a very noticeable rose scent.</li>
            <li>so I just cover up with some light powder.</li>
            <li>But I can always mix light bb creams or foundations with this cc cream</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>A bit light for the me, as I am olive-skinned.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>My skin glows and feels so light on.  </li>
            <li>I put up some pics comparing the BB brightening vs this cc in nude on my light skin.</li>
            <li>And it goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so light.</li>
            <li>This is why I like how light the coverage is...</li>
            <li>I LOVED this product and think it smells delightful, but unfortunately it caused me to break out.</li>
            <li>If I were going to go swimming in the sun I would use something more waterproof with a higher spf, but for everyday this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>That said, the coverage isn&#x27;t great - doesn&#x27;t cover up even minor redness.</li>
            <li>During the summer in particular, I have been on the prowl for a healthy, non-chemical/toxic free CC cream.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t bother me at all, I actually really liked it, but for those sensitive to fragrance it may be something to consider.</li>
            <li>and I would give the full 5 stars of it</li>
            <li>I was able to sample this on my hand at Whole Foods and that is what sold me on it.  </li>
            <li>(BTW this has the words mattifying on the bottle....that part isn&#x27;t true at all.)</li>
            <li>I do not use it as a CC cream, but as a sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;It does not have a lot of coverage, which is good as it can be apply enough to get the benefits of the sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin is clear, but dry, and this product is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>they are better for you, but I also deal with some skin issues (acne, dry skin, sensitivity, scaring) and they don&#x27;t always &amp;#34;lay&amp;#34; nicely on my skin.</li>
            <li>I did notice it right away, but a light powder takes care of it.)</li>
            <li>I love that I can wear it sheer or make it full coverage depending on how many drops I add of the custom cover.</li>
            <li>So overall I think this is best for someone with light, dry skin that doesn&#x27;t want a lot of coverage.</li>
            <li>so used to keeping my face super matte (or trying to)</li>
            <li>If you have normal eyes, I am sure it won;t be a problem.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a little bit on the thick side, but on my peachy fair skin I can pile it on and it will still blend in perfectly.</li>
            <li>real essential rose oil)</li>
            <li>I am fair to medium with slightly pink undertones.</li>
            <li>I might just be sensitive to sunflower or jojoba oil, as I&#x27;ve found that most oils do cause me to break out even if they&#x27;re supposedly non-comedogenic.</li>
            <li>my skin is sensitive to many of the products these days.</li>
            <li>I think this is great for those with a pale face that just needs &#x27;blurring&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I was pregnant in my first trimester when I started using it</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and is just lightly tinted so that you don&#x27;t have a white face from the 20% Zinc Dioxide.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;sheer nude&amp;#34; shade is perfect for my skin tone (I&#x27;m usually the second lightest shade on a basic skin spectrum) and it does a nice job of covering redness on my chin, cheeks, and forehead.</li>
            <li>This is a good product for someone looking for a natural look with a tiny enhancement.</li>
            <li>I will say I am not super fair...</li>
            <li>The sun protection is my main reason for trying and loving this product because I wear SPF 30 daily on my face.</li>
            <li>I think that it&#x27;s pretty misleading.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, color matches my fair-skinned skin tone well, but its just too sheer for my needs.</li>
            <li>I have light skin with some soft rosy color on my cheeks and nose areas.</li>
            <li>Not a whole lot of color correct, but that&#x27;s actually nice.</li>
            <li>The color is very sheer, will not hide any imperfections, and truthfully if they make this in a non color without chemical sunscreen I would buy that.  </li>
            <li>I have used other tinted moisturizers  (Laura Mercier) or CC creams (Dr. T&#x27;s Super Goop) that provide better coverage and can stand in for a foundation, but I don&#x27;t like their sunscreen contents.  </li>
            <li>The color is great for my light complexion and wears nicely, no touch-ups necessary.</li>
            <li>this is obviously a great deal, in comparison to the cost of other similar cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>This cream does not completely cover, to be sure.  </li>
            <li>For reference my skin is NC20 and runs a bit dry in most climates.</li>
            <li>I bought this not realizing it was for dry skin, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>It definitely does not give off a matte look, more of a slight glow to the skin which makes my fine lines look softer, which is a plus!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely adore this brand.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and gives a dewy look.</li>
            <li>I am usually very hesitant to buy a product that has no reviews</li>
            <li>it will just be too much...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is mattifying at all its very moisturizing and even says so</li>
            <li>It leaves a satin dewy finish, which I really like as it looks like skin.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to like this product.  </li>
            <li>I did not purchase this here at Amazon, but I purchased my tube at Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li>I was never a sheer fan but the light &#x27;glow&#x27;</li>
            <li>it gives me deflects light away from my wrinkles, making me look younger, plus it helps even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be quite too much moisture for me.</li>
            <li>really like the fact that this product has 20% zinc oxide and it is still very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>The initial rose scent is strong but doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>I waited for a while, my skin got back to normal and now I enjoy using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not someone who touches up my makeup throughout the day, so I don&#x27;t notice too much, but it does seem to last all day in a mild climate.</li>
            <li>if your skin is combo or dry it should be fine.</li>
            <li>color is okay, but I think a bit too dark for my pasty complexion.</li>
            <li>I have found some much better options both japanese and western brands.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you have Celiac or gluten sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>This is little oily but am glad that it gives shear foundation like coverage.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin normal</li>
            <li>Considering I have very sensitive skin-</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I really like this tinted SPF moisturizer, especially so because it&#x27;s more natural than the Neutrogena version I was using previously.  </li>
            <li>but Ive been wanting to try their new Sensitive CC cream</li>
            <li>The BB Brightening one smelled good but was a few shades too dark for me</li>
            <li>It also does not contain harsh chemicals and silicones which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any break outs (the most shocking part of all)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t break me out, it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin, it just leaves me glowing.</li>
            <li>I prefer natural products and don&#x27;t want to look like I am wearing a mask.</li>
            <li>Just looks natural.</li>
            <li>But the salesperson at Whole Foods insisted that this was different and that I should try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>FAR from even dewy...just OILY.</li>
            <li>It blurs everything and basically evens everything out, but doesn&#x27;t completely cover.  </li>
            <li>I have combo sensitive skin</li>
            <li>, just naturally brighter.</li>
            <li>Some all natural grocery stores have test bottles if you want to check.</li>
            <li>I applied it early one morning (and then used Alba Kids Natural Sunscreen on my body) and was out all day ...</li>
            <li>I was trying to find a natural, tinted moisturizer with SPF that wouldn&#x27;t take me to the bank, and</li>
            <li>This is flower based tints and gives my skin the natural glow I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It is a perfect base for mineral makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a weird earthy but not in a good way scent that has given me a headache each time I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a tinted moisturizer (although I have dry skin so I first apply a moisturizer, then this Andalou Naturals CC cream and then my foundation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a little heavy, so if you have dry skin, this will work great for you.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m not sure how well this will match on the fair ivory folks, as I have heard a few complaints on the coloring.</li>
            <li>I usually add translucent powder or a light dusting of Laura Mercier&#x27;s smoothing foundation powder over to of this.</li>
            <li>And you generally have to put a lot if you want to reach the SPF level you see on the labels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It claims to be mattifying, but it is not remotely so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this once so far</li>
            <li>I apply this product first after I shower, then apply a little powder concealer and finish by buffing a sheer face powder all over with a brush.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very dry and requires a nightly dose of facial oil and weekly exfoliation in addition to regular moisturizing to stay normal</li>
            <li>most people get little benefit out of the SPF make up because they can only put a little bit on before it starts to look caked, so all they leave is a super thin layer.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I can get flawless coverage that lasts with this combination.</li>
            <li> lol!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  </li>
            <li> End result is perfect skin that doesn&#x27;t look or feel like you have anything at all on.</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> This works perfectly!  </li>
            <li> Excellent price too!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is the best.</li>
            <li> A great find!</li>
            <li> LOVE this company!!!</li>
            <li> However with the addition of 2 or 3 drops of CoverFX Custom Cover Drops (I did find a very good match to my skin- shade N30)</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin</li>
            <li> Great cream that covers perfectly and is SPF 30.</li>
            <li> Also it smells soooo good!</li>
            <li> I find the rose scent perfect; it lingers throughout the day (perfect for when I don&#x27;t wear a scent).</li>
            <li> I do have some redness in my complexion, and this evened it out beautifully.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great price</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really happy to find this product.</li>
            <li> Smells great, too.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> and this works great for me.</li>
            <li> This is very nice product, but not for people with oily skin..</li>
            <li> It has a very nice smell that is not over powering.</li>
            <li> Really nice!</li>
            <li> Also, the fact that it uses Zinc Oxide but doesn&#x27;t leave a whiteish residue on my face, is surprising and great.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent and perfect color.  </li>
            <li> I think there is a good chance it will work for you.</li>
            <li> , Good apply with foundation</li>
            <li> if I continued to see good results with</li>
            <li> All the ingredients are good for skin.</li>
            <li> Wears well, provides a light coverage with SPF protection, non-irritating and SMELLS GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> It is a good product, with good protection against the sun.</li>
            <li> My skin is not looking it&#x27;s best right now, but it does FEEL good although I can feel the graininess of the zinc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keep it in a cool place, don&#x27;t let it get warm!!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> So glad I did!</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t offer great blemish coverage, but it is light and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Support them, smell amazing (not perfume.....</li>
            <li> which is amazing.</li>
            <li> Nice smell</li>
            <li> color is a nice peachy tan.</li>
            <li> It does offer a dewey look which is nice but considering the negatives</li>
            <li> Combo skin, and this stuff works nice for me.</li>
            <li> I was wearing foundation, so I liked this change with the Andalou Naturals CC spf 30.</li>
            <li> I have the Andalou Rose Stem Cell spray mist, which I use before I do any skincare or makeup application.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the tint for anyone with fair skin or who doesn&#x27;t plan on putting powder on top.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product has rose smell, but it fades soon after applied.&lt;br /&gt;Updated:</li>
            <li> This product smells wonderful without being overpowering,  I am very sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Love, love love Andalou products!  </li>
            <li> The smell of roses is incredible and it covers my skin very well.</li>
            <li> It has a lovely rose scent.</li>
            <li> far as organic and zinc go however, one of the BEST I&#x27;ve tried, I must admit.</li>
            <li> This sensitive formula never aggravates breakouts and the sun protection is excellent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a rose scent which I LOVE.</li>
            <li> I love the rose smell.</li>
            <li> I have not used many CC creams, but I have used the popular one by Dr. Jarts, and I have to say that Andalou Naturals CC cream looks better on my skin.  </li>
            <li> But what it does do is provide beautiful ingredients, good for my skin, and what this does in my opinion, is really provide more of a beautiful, natural, glow to the skin, and it acts like a primer.  </li>
            <li> It does have a somewhat greasy finish, but I have yet to find any non-chemical moisturizer with spf that doesn&#x27;t have some kind of sheen to it; I simply add primer and mattifying powder on top to absorb the shine and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> so I prefer very light coverage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very light coverage</li>
            <li> I would reapply on my super fair daughter if she was out all day.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and rubs in easily.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> The 1000 Roses CC cream is a much better color match for my skin than either of Andalou Naturals tinted BB creams.</li>
            <li> I love that I can pronounce all of the ingredients in this product and that it does not contain silicones or parabens.</li>
            <li> Most tinted products or SPF products cause breakouts for me, so I&#x27;m glad to have found one that doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and is UVA/UVB with light coverage!.</li>
            <li> I love this CC cream</li>
            <li> The rose scent is lovely and the consistency is smooth and hydrating.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer... and it smells lovely</li>
            <li> I love this CC cream</li>
            <li> had more coverage.</li>
            <li> I am 60, not too many wrinkles for my age.</li>
            <li> Oh, and I love the smell of roses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely okay</li>
            <li> I love the combo SPF and tint.</li>
            <li> Better suited for beigy skin tones.</li>
            <li> I love the way it evens my complexion...</li>
            <li> Best sheer cover I have ever used!</li>
            <li> so I was mixing it with a lighter color BB and that made it better</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift from my boyfriend and I love it</li>
            <li> It feels good and looks great, just caused me to have some red bump slightly-cystic break outs.</li>
            <li> and I already love it as well.</li>
            <li> The scent is also quite lovely too.</li>
            <li> You can add some sort of mineral powder on top if you want more coverage, but of course that is up to you.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s ok.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll add a mineral makeup on top and</li>
            <li> Love Andalou products and this CC cream is no exception.</li>
            <li> I do put powder on top for days</li>
            <li> I want a more matte look.</li>
            <li> Love the sunblock ingredients being nothing but zinc oxide.  </li>
            <li> I really really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the way it disappears ...</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizing face lotion.  </li>
            <li> My face skin health has improved with this lotion and find I have more breakouts if I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen alternative with 20% zinc oxide, it blocks sun rays better than most high end, luxury brand name sunscreens.</li>
            <li> formula, as I&#x27;m pretty fair even with a bit of sun.</li>
            <li> I love how natural the product is and my skin is feeling great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it gives your skin really nice color and your skin can breath...but don&#x27;t expect it to cover all skin problems, this thing will only moisturize your skin and make its color/tone even, which is a great thing for every day life.</li>
            <li> and I loved it so much that I wanted to try more of their products.</li>
            <li> I was using foundation mostly for the spf factor, but by the end of the day the makeup settled into the fine lines on my face accentuating them.</li>
            <li> I have fair/light dry,sensitive skin and this new CC cream by Andalou naturals is amazing!</li>
            <li> Goes on well and easily, and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> Not a bad thing, but it requires me to tap on some rice powder over top to give it the matte effect I want.</li>
            <li> With a bit of finished powder it is just fine, but since the description says it&#x27;s mattifying</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t accentuate fine lines.</li>
            <li> I wish it worked for me, as the coverage was perfect (and heavier than I thought it would be based on previous reviews) and the sunscreen is mineral based.</li>
            <li> It is super moisturizing, although I&#x27;m sure some won&#x27;t like how you can still feel it on your face at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light coverage, and doesn&#x27;t look cakey like some creams do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a very noticeable rose scent.</li>
            <li> so I just cover up with some light powder.</li>
            <li> But I can always mix light bb creams or foundations with this cc cream</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> A bit light for the me, as I am olive-skinned.</li>
            <li> It is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> My skin glows and feels so light on.  </li>
            <li> I put up some pics comparing the BB brightening vs this cc in nude on my light skin.</li>
            <li> And it goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s so light.</li>
            <li> This is why I like how light the coverage is...</li>
            <li> I LOVED this product and think it smells delightful, but unfortunately it caused me to break out.</li>
            <li> If I were going to go swimming in the sun I would use something more waterproof with a higher spf, but for everyday this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> That said, the coverage isn&#x27;t great - doesn&#x27;t cover up even minor redness.</li>
            <li> During the summer in particular, I have been on the prowl for a healthy, non-chemical/toxic free CC cream.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t bother me at all, I actually really liked it, but for those sensitive to fragrance it may be something to consider.</li>
            <li> and I would give the full 5 stars of it</li>
            <li> I was able to sample this on my hand at Whole Foods and that is what sold me on it.  </li>
            <li> (BTW this has the words mattifying on the bottle....that part isn&#x27;t true at all.)</li>
            <li> I do not use it as a CC cream, but as a sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;It does not have a lot of coverage, which is good as it can be apply enough to get the benefits of the sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin is clear, but dry, and this product is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> they are better for you, but I also deal with some skin issues (acne, dry skin, sensitivity, scaring) and they don&#x27;t always &amp;#34;lay&amp;#34; nicely on my skin.</li>
            <li> I did notice it right away, but a light powder takes care of it.)</li>
            <li> I love that I can wear it sheer or make it full coverage depending on how many drops I add of the custom cover.</li>
            <li> So overall I think this is best for someone with light, dry skin that doesn&#x27;t want a lot of coverage.</li>
            <li> so used to keeping my face super matte (or trying to)</li>
            <li> If you have normal eyes, I am sure it won;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a little bit on the thick side, but on my peachy fair skin I can pile it on and it will still blend in perfectly.</li>
            <li> real essential rose oil)</li>
            <li> I am fair to medium with slightly pink undertones.</li>
            <li> I might just be sensitive to sunflower or jojoba oil, as I&#x27;ve found that most oils do cause me to break out even if they&#x27;re supposedly non-comedogenic.</li>
            <li> my skin is sensitive to many of the products these days.</li>
            <li> I think this is great for those with a pale face that just needs &#x27;blurring&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I was pregnant in my first trimester when I started using it</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and is just lightly tinted so that you don&#x27;t have a white face from the 20% Zinc Dioxide.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;sheer nude&amp;#34; shade is perfect for my skin tone (I&#x27;m usually the second lightest shade on a basic skin spectrum) and it does a nice job of covering redness on my chin, cheeks, and forehead.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for someone looking for a natural look with a tiny enhancement.</li>
            <li> I will say I am not super fair...</li>
            <li> The sun protection is my main reason for trying and loving this product because I wear SPF 30 daily on my face.</li>
            <li> I think that it&#x27;s pretty misleading.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, color matches my fair-skinned skin tone well, but its just too sheer for my needs.</li>
            <li> I have light skin with some soft rosy color on my cheeks and nose areas.</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot of color correct, but that&#x27;s actually nice.</li>
            <li> The color is very sheer, will not hide any imperfections, and truthfully if they make this in a non color without chemical sunscreen I would buy that.  </li>
            <li> I have used other tinted moisturizers  (Laura Mercier) or CC creams (Dr. T&#x27;s Super Goop) that provide better coverage and can stand in for a foundation, but I don&#x27;t like their sunscreen contents.  </li>
            <li> The color is great for my light complexion and wears nicely, no touch-ups necessary.</li>
            <li> this is obviously a great deal, in comparison to the cost of other similar cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> This cream does not completely cover, to be sure.  </li>
            <li> For reference my skin is NC20 and runs a bit dry in most climates.</li>
            <li> I bought this not realizing it was for dry skin, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> It definitely does not give off a matte look, more of a slight glow to the skin which makes my fine lines look softer, which is a plus!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely adore this brand.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and gives a dewy look.</li>
            <li> I am usually very hesitant to buy a product that has no reviews</li>
            <li> it will just be too much...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is mattifying at all its very moisturizing and even says so</li>
            <li> It leaves a satin dewy finish, which I really like as it looks like skin.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to like this product.  </li>
            <li> I did not purchase this here at Amazon, but I purchased my tube at Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li> I was never a sheer fan but the light &#x27;glow&#x27;</li>
            <li> it gives me deflects light away from my wrinkles, making me look younger, plus it helps even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be quite too much moisture for me.</li>
            <li> really like the fact that this product has 20% zinc oxide and it is still very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> The initial rose scent is strong but doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> I waited for a while, my skin got back to normal and now I enjoy using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not someone who touches up my makeup throughout the day, so I don&#x27;t notice too much, but it does seem to last all day in a mild climate.</li>
            <li> if your skin is combo or dry it should be fine.</li>
            <li> color is okay, but I think a bit too dark for my pasty complexion.</li>
            <li> I have found some much better options both japanese and western brands.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you have Celiac or gluten sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> This is little oily but am glad that it gives shear foundation like coverage.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin normal</li>
            <li> Considering I have very sensitive skin-</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I really like this tinted SPF moisturizer, especially so because it&#x27;s more natural than the Neutrogena version I was using previously.  </li>
            <li> but Ive been wanting to try their new Sensitive CC cream</li>
            <li> The BB Brightening one smelled good but was a few shades too dark for me</li>
            <li> It also does not contain harsh chemicals and silicones which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any break outs (the most shocking part of all)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t break me out, it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin, it just leaves me glowing.</li>
            <li> I prefer natural products and don&#x27;t want to look like I am wearing a mask.</li>
            <li> Just looks natural.</li>
            <li> But the salesperson at Whole Foods insisted that this was different and that I should try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> FAR from even dewy...just OILY.</li>
            <li> It blurs everything and basically evens everything out, but doesn&#x27;t completely cover.  </li>
            <li> I have combo sensitive skin</li>
            <li> , just naturally brighter.</li>
            <li> Some all natural grocery stores have test bottles if you want to check.</li>
            <li> I applied it early one morning (and then used Alba Kids Natural Sunscreen on my body) and was out all day ...</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a natural, tinted moisturizer with SPF that wouldn&#x27;t take me to the bank, and</li>
            <li> This is flower based tints and gives my skin the natural glow I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It is a perfect base for mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a weird earthy but not in a good way scent that has given me a headache each time I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a tinted moisturizer (although I have dry skin so I first apply a moisturizer, then this Andalou Naturals CC cream and then my foundation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little heavy, so if you have dry skin, this will work great for you.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not sure how well this will match on the fair ivory folks, as I have heard a few complaints on the coloring.</li>
            <li> I usually add translucent powder or a light dusting of Laura Mercier&#x27;s smoothing foundation powder over to of this.</li>
            <li> And you generally have to put a lot if you want to reach the SPF level you see on the labels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It claims to be mattifying, but it is not remotely so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far</li>
            <li> I apply this product first after I shower, then apply a little powder concealer and finish by buffing a sheer face powder all over with a brush.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very dry and requires a nightly dose of facial oil and weekly exfoliation in addition to regular moisturizing to stay normal</li>
            <li> most people get little benefit out of the SPF make up because they can only put a little bit on before it starts to look caked, so all they leave is a super thin layer.</li>
            <li> due to the natural sunscreen ingredients I would image).  </li>
            <li> I little sticky and needs to dry really well before any final touches, like blush.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this CC cream for people who want to moisturize, protect, and even out their skin tone without tons of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> My skin is notoriously dry and sensitive, and I have several other Andalou 1000 Roses products.</li>
            <li> A *little* tanner than expected but blended very well.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I absolutely love this. The smell of roses is incredible and it covers my skin very well. It has 30 SPF and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I feel it actually improves my skin.Considering I have very sensitive skin- I think there is a good chance it will work for you. I can&#x27;t say enough about this.</li>
            <li> I really like this tinted SPF moisturizer, especially so because it&#x27;s more natural than the Neutrogena version I was using previously.  When applied, it&#x27;s a slight tint, so doesn&#x27;t come on too heavy, but offers enough of a boost to my face.</li>
            <li> I adore Andalou Naturals, and I loooove this CC cream. My skin is clear, but dry, and this product is perfect for me. It doesn&#x27;t break me out, it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin, it just leaves me glowing. The 1000 Roses CC cream is a much better color match for my skin than either of Andalou Naturals tinted BB creams. I love that I can pronounce all of the ingredients in this product and that it does not contain silicones or parabens. My only issue with this CC cream is that it says that it&#x27;s matte and it is not matte. I personally don&#x27;t care for matte because my skin is already so dry, but this is something to keep in mind if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> Nice smell , Good apply with foundation</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s light coverage, and doesn&#x27;t look cakey like some creams do. I bought it because I was looking for a product with SPF so that I didn&#x27;t have to apply a lot of products. The downfall is that it definitely is not a matte product. I have to wear a powder over this or it looks just like when you apply regular sunscreen- it&#x27;s shiny and has a bit of an oily look. With a bit of finished powder it is just fine, but since the description says it&#x27;s mattifying I think that it&#x27;s pretty misleading. That&#x27;s why I gave it 3 stars. If it didn&#x27;t, I would&#x27;ve given it four, possibly five if I continued to see good results with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is a nice peachy tan. I got the &amp;#34;Sheer Nude&amp;#34; formula, as I&#x27;m pretty fair even with a bit of sun. I have a lot of freckles and moles, and without plastering my face they always show through so I prefer very light coverage. I do have some redness in my complexion, and this evened it out beautifully. I didn&#x27;t have any breakouts after using this either, which was a relief. Most tinted products or SPF products cause breakouts for me, so I&#x27;m glad to have found one that doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a very noticeable rose scent. It didn&#x27;t bother me at all, I actually really liked it, but for those sensitive to fragrance it may be something to consider.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t offer great blemish coverage, but it is light and smells nice.</li>
            <li> LOVE this company!!! Support them, smell amazing (not perfume..... real essential rose oil) and is UVA/UVB with light coverage!. I think this is great for those with a pale face that just needs &#x27;blurring&#x27;. I am pale with freckles and moles and they show through well witch I WANT, and also blurs my skin enough to look put together, refreshed and pert without having that  scary Ulta/MAC overdone look.....</li>
            <li> I love this CC cream but I was expecting it to be a bit lighter and less greasy on the face based on other reviewers. It definitely leaves a little bit of shine so I just cover up with some light powder. It&#x27;s a great price and I absolutely adore this brand. I love how natural the product is and my skin is feeling great. It&#x27;s hard to find products for my oily, acne-prone but sensitive skin but this definitely does the job.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen alternative with 20% zinc oxide, it blocks sun rays better than most high end, luxury brand name sunscreens. The rose scent is lovely and the consistency is smooth and hydrating. However, It doesn&#x27;t offer a coverage like a bb cream, and the color(nude) made my skin look a little darker than my natural skin tone( I have sensitive, pale skin). But I can always mix light bb creams or foundations with this cc cream and I&#x27;m really happy to find this product. It also does not contain harsh chemicals and silicones which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, color matches my fair-skinned skin tone well, but its just too sheer for my needs.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Goes on well and easily, and lasts for hours. Smells great, too. A bit light for the me, as I am olive-skinned. I gave it away to a fairer complexioned friend, and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Keep it in a cool place, don&#x27;t let it get warm!! It will separate somewhat. I love this moisturizer... and it smells lovely</li>
            <li> I love this CC cream and I would give the full 5 stars of it had more coverage. However with the addition of 2 or 3 drops of CoverFX Custom Cover Drops (I did find a very good match to my skin- shade N30) this is holy grail bb/cc cream. Seriously. It&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been searching for since moving out west to a desert climate. I love that I can wear it sheer or make it full coverage depending on how many drops I add of the custom cover. I usually add translucent powder or a light dusting of Laura Mercier&#x27;s smoothing foundation powder over to of this. I can get flawless coverage that lasts with this combination. Mind you, I just have a bit of redness in the t-zone and dark circles under my eyes to cover. Not sure how this would work over acne or acne scarring, however with the drops you could probably just add another drop or two...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so difficult to find a quality, inexpensive, physical, natural, sunblock that doesn&#x27;t suck or dry out my naturally dry skin. The sun protection is my main reason for trying and loving this product because I wear SPF 30 daily on my face. For reference my skin is NC20 and runs a bit dry in most climates. Since moving to a desert climate it&#x27;s very dry and requires a nightly dose of facial oil and weekly exfoliation in addition to regular moisturizing to stay normal lol! So I need all the moisture and protection I can get throughout the day. This fits the bill and with the drops and powder it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> I am 60, not too many wrinkles for my age. I was using foundation mostly for the spf factor, but by the end of the day the makeup settled into the fine lines on my face accentuating them. I prefer natural products and don&#x27;t want to look like I am wearing a mask. I am fair to medium with slightly pink undertones. This product is perfect for my skin. It is very moisturizing and gives a dewy look. It is a perfect base for mineral makeup. Just looks natural. It does not itch by the end of the day.  It doesn&#x27;t accentuate fine lines.All the ingredients are good for skin. If I were going to go swimming in the sun I would use something more waterproof with a higher spf, but for everyday this is perfect for me. Oh, and I love the smell of roses. The smell goes away after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This is very nice product, but not for people with oily skin.. I was pregnant in my first trimester when I started using it and I felt like my nose was covered with butter.. I waited for a while, my skin got back to normal and now I enjoy using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it gives your skin really nice color and your skin can breath...but don&#x27;t expect it to cover all skin problems, this thing will only moisturize your skin and make its color/tone even, which is a great thing for every day life.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin but I have not experienced the &amp;#34;yellow hue&amp;#34; that others have. People have asked if I got a little sun, which being summer time I&#x27;m completely okay with. I&#x27;ll have to see how silly it looks in winter. I bought this because I like the company and I wanted to eliminate the step of powder/foundation in the morning. I love the combo SPF and tint. It definitely does not give off a matte look, more of a slight glow to the skin which makes my fine lines look softer, which is a plus!</li>
            <li> Great cream that covers perfectly and is SPF 30. Love it!</li>
            <li> It irritates my eyes after several hours but I have Roseaca so everything does. If you have normal eyes, I am sure it won;t be a problem. I still us it, I just have to be very careful not to get any in my eyes.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Wears well, provides a light coverage with SPF protection, non-irritating and SMELLS GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> I am usually very hesitant to buy a product that has no reviews but I decided to take a chance on this one. So glad I did! It has a lovely rose scent. Zinc oxide is the only sunscreen I will use and it has a lot of it, and has major staying power...even through an hour of heavy sweating in the gym and then an hour+ of swimming with the kids afterward. I had hoped for this to be a one-step product for this non-makeup wearing gal to help even out some minor aging imperfections while providing some sun protection this summer. Close...but not quite. It claims to be mattifying, but it is not remotely so. (Hence the one-star reduction.) It gives a dewy/luminescent finish on my skin. Not a bad thing, but it requires me to tap on some rice powder over top to give it the matte effect I want. End result is perfect skin that doesn&#x27;t look or feel like you have anything at all on. Really nice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally not a fan of physical blockers...I know....they are better for you, but I also deal with some skin issues (acne, dry skin, sensitivity, scaring) and they don&#x27;t always &amp;#34;lay&amp;#34; nicely on my skin. But the salesperson at Whole Foods insisted that this was different and that I should try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I adore the smell, the ingredients (and the lack thereof), and that fact that it doesn&#x27;t appear nearly as drying as other zinc-based sunscreens I&#x27;ve used, it&#x27;s almost the extreme OPPOSITE. It appears greasy...FAR from even dewy...just OILY. My skin is not looking it&#x27;s best right now, but it does FEEL good although I can feel the graininess of the zinc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It FEELS &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; as you apply it if that makes sense. It was hard to spread at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is okay, but I think a bit too dark for my pasty complexion. Better suited for beigy skin tones. I&#x27;m a definite ivory and it&#x27;s a bit &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; looking on me and I worry about oxidization (is that a word??) during the day and turning orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now, meh......on the fence. I&#x27;m afraid if I put my makeup OVER it it will just be too much...I know, defeats the purpose of a CC cream anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as organic and zinc go however, one of the BEST I&#x27;ve tried, I must admit. I think I would be happier if they just made this a cream and removed the tint.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product! I have fallen in love! I use this every morning after I moisturize my face. I love the way it evens my complexion...it doesn&#x27;t hide every flaw but could if you use a concealer. I always have this stocked on my shelf......it moisturizes and leaves a glowing complexion.</li>
            <li> I been using this product for 2 weeks now.  It is fantastic.  I have very sensitive skin normal/dry.  My skin glows and feels so light on.  It has a very nice smell that is not over powering.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Love, love love Andalou products!  Highly recommend if you have Celiac or gluten sensitivity.  Best sheer cover I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I have fair/light dry,sensitive skin and this new CC cream by Andalou naturals is amazing! The BB Brightening one smelled good but was a few shades too dark for me so I was mixing it with a lighter color BB and that made it better but Ive been wanting to try their new Sensitive CC cream, I was afraid the nude would still be too dark for me but it wasn&#x27;t!! I don&#x27;t think this is mattifying at all its very moisturizing and even says so on front of tube, goes on easier than the BB cream,is sheer hardly any coverage. So overall I think this is best for someone with light, dry skin that doesn&#x27;t want a lot of coverage.Also it smells soooo good! I put up some pics comparing the BB brightening vs this cc in nude on my light skin.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift from my boyfriend and I love it it smells just roses!</li>
            <li> I LOVED this product and think it smells delightful, but unfortunately it caused me to break out. I wish it worked for me, as the coverage was perfect (and heavier than I thought it would be based on previous reviews) and the sunscreen is mineral based. It leaves a satin dewy finish, which I really like as it looks like skin. It feels good and looks great, just caused me to have some red bump slightly-cystic break outs. I might just be sensitive to sunflower or jojoba oil, as I&#x27;ve found that most oils do cause me to break out even if they&#x27;re supposedly non-comedogenic. Bummer.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to like this product.  The initial rose scent is strong but doesn&#x27;t last very long.  The scent that develops after about 30-40 minutes of wearing it is what I can&#x27;t stand.  It&#x27;s a weird earthy but not in a good way scent that has given me a headache each time I&#x27;ve used it.  I&#x27;ve been in a hurry to wash it off my face each time I&#x27;ve applied it.  That said, the coverage isn&#x27;t great - doesn&#x27;t cover up even minor redness. It does offer a dewey look which is nice but considering the negatives, I won&#x27;t continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I just got my bottle of this stuff and I like it a lot. I have light skin with some soft rosy color on my cheeks and nose areas. Combo skin, and this stuff works nice for me. It&#x27;s a very light coverage so I get a small coverage while still looking natural. It gives me a bit of a glow too but not too shiny for me. I was using the Badger sunscreen that left a white film on my face. I also used the Alba CC+ but it had rapeseed oil in it which is Not good for you and it was too obvious I was wearing foundation, so I liked this change with the Andalou Naturals CC spf 30. I&#x27;m glad I tried it! Yes it will give you a bit of a glow or some will say shine but if your skin is combo or dry it should be fine. This is a good product for someone looking for a natural look with a tiny enhancement.</li>
            <li> I have been using a different Andalou moisturizer that didn&#x27;t have any tint and I loved it so much that I wanted to try more of their products. I&#x27;ve only used this once so far and I already love it as well. The &amp;#34;sheer nude&amp;#34; shade is perfect for my skin tone (I&#x27;m usually the second lightest shade on a basic skin spectrum) and it does a nice job of covering redness on my chin, cheeks, and forehead. It does have a somewhat greasy finish, but I have yet to find any non-chemical moisturizer with spf that doesn&#x27;t have some kind of sheen to it; I simply add primer and mattifying powder on top to absorb the shine and it works perfectly. The scent is also quite lovely too. I highly recommend this CC cream for people who want to moisturize, protect, and even out their skin tone without tons of harsh chemicals. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have not used many CC creams, but I have used the popular one by Dr. Jarts, and I have to say that Andalou Naturals CC cream looks better on my skin.  It works very well especially now in the cold dry Midwestern wind; I understand why someone could have an &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; effect but on me my face looks shiny in a moisturized dewy way.  I usually don&#x27;t prefer to wear any makeup, but when I want to look especially woken-up and &amp;#34;airbrushed&amp;#34; I now turn to this.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention:  this is obviously a great deal, in comparison to the cost of other similar cosmetics.  Also, the fact that it uses Zinc Oxide but doesn&#x27;t leave a whiteish residue on my face, is surprising and great.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this here at Amazon, but I purchased my tube at Whole Foods.  I have the Andalou Rose Stem Cell spray mist, which I use before I do any skincare or makeup application.  During the summer in particular, I have been on the prowl for a healthy, non-chemical/toxic free CC cream.  I do have problem skin....oily and acne prone.  I have things to cover....redness to cover.  This cream does not completely cover, to be sure.  But what it does do is provide beautiful ingredients, good for my skin, and what this does in my opinion, is really provide more of a beautiful, natural, glow to the skin, and it acts like a primer.  You can add some sort of mineral powder on top if you want more coverage, but of course that is up to you.  I was able to sample this on my hand at Whole Foods and that is what sold me on it.  It blurs everything and basically evens everything out, but doesn&#x27;t completely cover.  That&#x27;s ok.....I&#x27;ll add a mineral makeup on top and then a dab of powder to set it.  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Love Andalou products and this CC cream is no exception. I find the rose scent perfect; it lingers throughout the day (perfect for when I don&#x27;t wear a scent). The color is great for my light complexion and wears nicely, no touch-ups necessary. This sensitive formula never aggravates breakouts and the sun protection is excellent. I do put powder on top for days I want a more matte look. Great product!</li>
            <li> Love the sunblock ingredients being nothing but zinc oxide.  And it goes on smoothly.  Unfortunately, it remains shiny and oranges on my somewhat dry and pale skin after several hours of first time wear. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the tint for anyone with fair skin or who doesn&#x27;t plan on putting powder on top.</li>
            <li> I bought this not realizing it was for dry skin, but I&#x27;m so glad I did. I have combo sensitive skin and this helps prevent prevent those dry patchy flake areas I could never get rid of around my nose. It is super moisturizing, although I&#x27;m sure some won&#x27;t like how you can still feel it on your face at the end of the day. It does change the texture but I feel it is smoother. I was never a sheer fan but the light &#x27;glow&#x27; it gives me deflects light away from my wrinkles, making me look younger, plus it helps even out my skin tone. I haven&#x27;t experienced any break outs (the most shocking part of all) and I don&#x27;t think I look oilier, just naturally brighter. In fact I think it is helping my skin to not overproduce oil. I use it as a base under my normal BB cream on blotchy skin days because this coverage really isn&#x27;t coverage, it&#x27;s so light. Every tiny freckle still shines through, so I would consider this an enhancer, as I have received compliments on my skin since I&#x27;ve started to use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a rose scent which I LOVE. It&#x27;s also a little bit on the thick side, but on my peachy fair skin I can pile it on and it will still blend in perfectly. This is why I like how light the coverage is...most people get little benefit out of the SPF make up because they can only put a little bit on before it starts to look caked, so all they leave is a super thin layer. And you generally have to put a lot if you want to reach the SPF level you see on the labels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so used to keeping my face super matte (or trying to) but I think I was going about it wrong. (BTW this has the words mattifying on the bottle....that part isn&#x27;t true at all.) And I&#x27;m not sure how well this will match on the fair ivory folks, as I have heard a few complaints on the coloring. Some all natural grocery stores have test bottles if you want to check. That&#x27;s how I found this product.</li>
            <li> This product smells wonderful without being overpowering,  I am very sensitive to smells. My face never gets burned, even at the beach. Nice product.</li>
            <li> I adore this line of skincare products. My skin is notoriously dry and sensitive, and I have several other Andalou 1000 Roses products. I was skeptical of buying a tinted moisturizer, because I find that the color never quite matches my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, this applies to this moisturizer as well. It&#x27;s thick, creamy, moisturizing, and doesn&#x27;t upset my skin, but is too dark for my ghastly pale complexion.</li>
            <li> I really really love this stuff. I start my application with a touch of moisturizer and then immediately apply the Roses Color so that it blends easier (its a touch thick... due to the natural sunscreen ingredients I would image).  I love the way it disappears ... but my skin looks softer and glows! I applied it early one morning (and then used Alba Kids Natural Sunscreen on my body) and was out all day ... I didn&#x27;t get any sunburn! And I didn&#x27;t feel like I had sunscreen on my face ... which is amazing. I will say I am not super fair... and I have a base tan... I would reapply on my super fair daughter if she was out all day. She burns and then turns white again :/</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to use as a daily sunscreen that I could apply under my foundation. This works perfectly!  It goes on easily and is just lightly tinted so that you don&#x27;t have a white face from the 20% Zinc Dioxide.  It smells nice and rubs in easily.  It&#x27;s like a tinted moisturizer (although I have dry skin so I first apply a moisturizer, then this Andalou Naturals CC cream and then my foundation.  I have used other tinted moisturizers  (Laura Mercier) or CC creams (Dr. T&#x27;s Super Goop) that provide better coverage and can stand in for a foundation, but I don&#x27;t like their sunscreen contents.  I am planning to use this all summer for daily wear.  Excellent price too!</li>
            <li> Great product. I was trying to find a natural, tinted moisturizer with SPF that wouldn&#x27;t take me to the bank, and here it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little heavy, so if you have dry skin, this will work great for you. I have combination skin and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be quite too much moisture for me. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for oily skin. Not a whole lot of color correct, but that&#x27;s actually nice. I apply this product first after I shower, then apply a little powder concealer and finish by buffing a sheer face powder all over with a brush. (The sheer powder eliminates that shine that other reviewers have mentioned. I did notice it right away, but a light powder takes care of it.) I&#x27;m not someone who touches up my makeup throughout the day, so I don&#x27;t notice too much, but it does seem to last all day in a mild climate.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this works great for me. I am really pale, and it is just slightly darker that my natural color. I love the rose smell.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing product.  Had a floral smell, and was not gentle on my face.  Left it red even before I got in the sun.  Irritating.</li>
            <li> I little sticky and needs to dry really well before any final touches, like blush.</li>
            <li> A *little* tanner than expected but blended very well. Me likey.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is the best. I used to use origins and was worried about the chemicals in it. This is flower based tints and gives my skin the natural glow I was looking for. Already have bought a second bottle!</li>
            <li> Lovely scent and perfect color.  A great find!</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizing face lotion.  The color is very sheer, will not hide any imperfections, and truthfully if they make this in a non color without chemical sunscreen I would buy that.  My face skin health has improved with this lotion and find I have more breakouts if I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This is little oily but am glad that it gives shear foundation like coverage. But if I use it daily it kinds of itch may be because I m using Retinol treatment products.....n my skin is sensitive to many of the products these days.</li>
            <li> It is a good product, with good protection against the sun.</li>
            <li> I do not use it as a CC cream, but as a sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;It does not have a lot of coverage, which is good as it can be apply enough to get the benefits of the sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the fact that this product has 20% zinc oxide and it is still very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;All the ingredients seems safe.&lt;br /&gt;The product has rose smell, but it fades soon after applied.&lt;br /&gt;Updated: I have found some much better options both japanese and western brands. The odor and greasy feel of this sunscreen made me stop using it.</li>
