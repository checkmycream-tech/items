            <li>I liked the feel of it.  </li>
            <li>It smells like some kind of lemon confection.  </li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t greasy at all but is effective.</li>
            <li>Good product, and healthy to use.  </li>
            <li>I can watch carefully as the lil buggers fly up to my delicious ankles and just hover about an inch away.</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t buy again, but for someone who just needs a light, non-greasy lotion, this one is a good price for that.</li>
            <li>This lotion is very smooth and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li>The coconut scent is much better suited for women</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find a bottle to purchase.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s about 5-6, still better than DEET.  </li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t ask for more.  </li>
            <li>as a body/hand lotion, i love it.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s available after washing hands!</li>
            <li>I love the citrus smell.</li>
            <li>This has become one of my favorite lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells good and is pretty creamy and moisturizing for arms, legs and hands.</li>
            <li>Just started my &amp;#34;quest&amp;#34; for more natural items in my life &amp; this was the 1st one I received, nice smell, quite lightweight but works fairly well.  </li>
            <li>I tend to have sensitive skin and this brand is great.</li>
            <li>I bought this primarily for the scent, and the scent stays on you for about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>I read the ingredients, saw that it was also GMO free verified &amp; knew I had to have it.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I found this product and would definitely recommend it to everyone!!</li>
            <li>The lotion glides smoothly and hydrates well.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, not oily or greasy.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is nice but smells mostly like ginger actually.</li>
            <li>The scent ends up being kind of masculine though.</li>
            <li>lotion is cool because it&#x27;s for hands, body and face.</li>
            <li>It would be much better if it did not have a sweet component, and smelled like or reasonably close to real lemons.</li>
            <li>THis lotion has such an amazing scent.</li>
            <li>Really nice packaging design too, though green highlighting (rather than orange) would have better served to indicate that the citrus was going to be &#x27;lime-ish&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>fresh and not invasive</li>
            <li>5 hours later I noticed my hands were still EXTREMELY soft, moisturized &amp; smelling great.</li>
            <li>Anyway, they made it very easy to return, though the bottle is heavy and shipping cost more than the lotion.</li>
            <li>If I need something for more dry skin, like around the heels, I don&#x27;t think this works real well, almost need something heavier/thicker, but overall, a great product.</li>
            <li>It soaks right in.</li>
            <li>Because most of the ingredients are essential oils, I find I get relief of the nerve pain I have in my legs and arms.</li>
            <li>I will be a lifetime buyer of this product because of the natural ingredients and the fantastic quality of the product itself.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin super soft and for the price, you get sooo much!</li>
            <li>Easy to open and close.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive/dry skin</li>
            <li>I was referred this lotion by my Aunt who found out that when she used it the Mosquitos didn&#x27;t bite her as much.  </li>
            <li>Ad makes it appear that you are buying 2 bottles of lotion for 15.00, not unreasonable since 1 bottle retails even at Whole Foods for 9.99.&lt;br /&gt;Ridiculously over priced at 1 bottle for 15.00 and the purchase is non refundable.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really get an orange or mint smell, just giner.</li>
            <li>Whole family can use and bottle lasts forever.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>clean smell, that it doesn&#x27;t linger too long.</li>
            <li>Consistency good, not very thick, but too thin for overnight hand cream</li>
            <li>For general moisturizing, this lotion certainly fits the bill.  </li>
            <li>the description encourages its use as a face lotion too, which im giving a try with limited success.</li>
            <li>Everyone I let use it says how this lotion makes their skin soft without being oily.  </li>
            <li>I put a little bit of this lotion on the toilet paper before wiping my butt for that couldn&#x27;t be cleaner clean!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or thick, it doesn&#x27;t have scary chemicals in it, and this particular fragrance is nice and light, not too perfumed.</li>
            <li>once every hour or so to my ankles mostly and was averaging 6-7 bites a night, with this lotion if I apply every half hours can average 3-4 a night, if I apply every hour</li>
            <li>the Citrus &amp; Mint does not really smell much like citrus or mint.  </li>
            <li>I used to order 100% DEET from Canada where it&#x27;s still legal despite its gross feeling and questionable safety because I figured it was better than tons of bites and West Nile virus.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have the slightest hope that something all natural would repel those little devils, but definitely noticed a decrease in bites right away.  </li>
            <li>I had bought it for the scent as much as for the other features.  </li>
            <li>At least the scent does not linger long, and it is not as strong as the soap scent.</li>
            <li>my face feels moisturized to the touch but feels a little dry when i smile etc.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this primarily for the scent, and the scent stays on you for about 3 minutes. Then it dissipates and you can&#x27;t discern it at all. That sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the lotion isn&#x27;t at all greasy. It soaks right in. On the other hand, it doesn&#x27;t seem to keep my skin supple or soft for long. It&#x27;s not as moisturizing as a lot of other lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy again, but for someone who just needs a light, non-greasy lotion, this one is a good price for that. My hands are just way too dry for this. I need the heavy duty stuff.</li>
            <li> I got the citrus mint which had a pleasant scent. A little goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Great on my skin. The scent ends up being kind of masculine though. The coconut scent is much better suited for women</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It it&#x27;s lite on the skin and the mint scent is so refreshing!</li>
            <li> This lotion is very smooth and absorbs well.  Because most of the ingredients are essential oils, I find I get relief of the nerve pain I have in my legs and arms.</li>
            <li> There was a bottle of this in a vacation home we rented and I fell in love with it. It smells awesome without being overwhelming. It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. I have very sensitive/dry skin and this worked so well for me. Thank goodness Amazon sells it. I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find a bottle to purchase.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle, which is great for the price and for liberal all body application.  Easy to open and close. Really nice packaging design too, though green highlighting (rather than orange) would have better served to indicate that the citrus was going to be &#x27;lime-ish&#x27;.  Lotion itself is quite creamy and pleasant.  I liked the feel of it.  However, and this was the deciding point...the Citrus &amp; Mint does not really smell much like citrus or mint.  I was expecting lemon or orange + mint.  There is a vague &#x27;lime&#x27; aroma which reminded me of 7UP Cola and that quickly died down and I was left with an &#x27;off&#x27; &#x27;lotiony&#x27; scent.  I had bought it for the scent as much as for the other features.  Anyway, they made it very easy to return, though the bottle is heavy and shipping cost more than the lotion.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great and moisturizes well.  However, when it arrived, about 1/4 of it had leaked out of the container.</li>
            <li> I bought the coconut/lemon and the citrus/mint and citrus mint smells wayyyyy better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is cool because it&#x27;s for hands, body and face. Not many brands make it for all 3 parts. It&#x27;s thin enough for the face yet just enough to moisturize your body.</li>
            <li> fresh and not invasive</li>
            <li> does not smell good.  The pump was broken when I got it, and the lotion was all over the box.</li>
            <li> For general moisturizing, this lotion certainly fits the bill.  I would not use it on my face, but I do slather it on my hands after every washing.  I do not think it would serve for dry patches.  The one thig I dislike is the scent.  It smells like some kind of lemon confection.  At least the scent does not linger long, and it is not as strong as the soap scent. It would be much better if it did not have a sweet component, and smelled like or reasonably close to real lemons.</li>
            <li> Hand lotion works well and has a very pleasant scent. I will definitely purchases this again in the future. Very smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li> Great value.  Smells wonderful.  Consistency good, not very thick, but too thin for overnight hand cream</li>
            <li> Unlike the body soap, I like the lotion. It smells good and is pretty creamy and moisturizing for arms, legs and hands.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really good! It&#x27;s not heavy or thick, it doesn&#x27;t have scary chemicals in it, and this particular fragrance is nice and light, not too perfumed.</li>
            <li> My local organic grocer has lotion and hand sanitizer at every check out. I mindlessly pumped some lotion into my hands &amp; walked out. 5 hours later I noticed my hands were still EXTREMELY soft, moisturized &amp; smelling great. I recalled the lotion that I put on &amp; drove back to the grocery store to check out the brand. It was Everyone Lotion!! I had to have a bottle for myself and was expecting to pay at least $15-20 for it. Wrong! It was $10 for a 32 ounce bottle! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I read the ingredients, saw that it was also GMO free verified &amp; knew I had to have it. I will be a lifetime buyer of this product because of the natural ingredients and the fantastic quality of the product itself. I passed it onto my father and he instantly loved it too! I am so happy I found this product and would definitely recommend it to everyone!!</li>
            <li> I was referred this lotion by my Aunt who found out that when she used it the Mosquitos didn&#x27;t bite her as much.  I work outside in a shop and our mosquito problem is horrendous. I used to order 100% DEET from Canada where it&#x27;s still legal despite its gross feeling and questionable safety because I figured it was better than tons of bites and West Nile virus.  I didn&#x27;t have the slightest hope that something all natural would repel those little devils, but definitely noticed a decrease in bites right away.  I have waited almost 3 months to write this review because I wanted to see the long term effects as I&#x27;ve noticed that lemon products or eucalyptus oils only work for a short time before the Mosquitos don&#x27;t care anymore.  I was applying 100% DEET once every hour or so to my ankles mostly and was averaging 6-7 bites a night, with this lotion if I apply every half hours can average 3-4 a night, if I apply every hour it&#x27;s about 5-6, still better than DEET.  I have given this as gifts to 6 different family members who have complained of Mosquitos and every single one noticed a decrease in bites.  I can watch carefully as the lil buggers fly up to my delicious ankles and just hover about an inch away. I&#x27;ve began stock piling this as I&#x27;m terrified it will stop being produced</li>
            <li> Great scent, not sticky, great for hands, face, arms.  Everything!  highly recommend.  have purchased twice!  couldn&#x27;t ask for more.  period.</li>
            <li> This is a thinner lotion. I tend to have sensitive skin and this brand is great. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I can use it on my face and body and even after shaving without any irritation. I don&#x27;t like this smell myself so I gave it to my mom who loves it.</li>
            <li> the description encourages its use as a face lotion too, which im giving a try with limited success. my face feels moisturized to the touch but feels a little dry when i smile etc. as a body/hand lotion, i love it. it isn&#x27;t greasy at all but is effective. the scent is unisex and not overbearing.</li>
            <li> Good price, but not a product for me.  It clogs my pores, causing pimples.  Maybe it is just my skin type, otherwise it may serve someone else well.</li>
            <li> Ad makes it appear that you are buying 2 bottles of lotion for 15.00, not unreasonable since 1 bottle retails even at Whole Foods for 9.99.&lt;br /&gt;Ridiculously over priced at 1 bottle for 15.00 and the purchase is non refundable.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Fast delivery.  Everyone I let use it says how this lotion makes their skin soft without being oily.  I also recommend the lavender scent.</li>
            <li> THis lotion has such an amazing scent. Just like the description says it is a body and face lotion. It makes my skin super soft and for the price, you get sooo much! Definitely recommend. I keep mine in the bathroom on the counter by the sink so it&#x27;s available after washing hands!</li>
            <li> Just started my &amp;#34;quest&amp;#34; for more natural items in my life &amp; this was the 1st one I received, nice smell, quite lightweight but works fairly well.  If I need something for more dry skin, like around the heels, I don&#x27;t think this works real well, almost need something heavier/thicker, but overall, a great product.</li>
            <li> The lotion glides smoothly and hydrates well. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily or wet feel afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice but smells mostly like ginger actually. I don&#x27;t really get an orange or mint smell, just giner.</li>
            <li> The best. Smells great, not greesy, hydrates well, great value, awesome for sensitive skin. Whole family can use and bottle lasts forever. Love !</li>
            <li> After an exercise Everyone Lotion cools and refreshes my sore feet. It also prevent callous build-up. I love the citrus smell.</li>
            <li> Good product, and healthy to use.  Goes on smooth, not oily or greasy.  Would recommend if you are looking for healthier products.</li>
            <li> This has become one of my favorite lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it every day. Have purchased it as gifts for family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice clean smell, that it doesn&#x27;t linger too long.</li>
            <li> Great lotion. I put a little bit of this lotion on the toilet paper before wiping my butt for that couldn&#x27;t be cleaner clean! Then I apply some to my hands after washing them. Then I wipe my hands over my face to remove any lotion left on my hands and to moisturize my face. Like the package says &amp;#34;hands, body, face&amp;#34;</li>
