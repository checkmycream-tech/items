            <li>I love this spray!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE THIS STUFF!  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products to make my hair shiny and healthy looking--all products have made my hair greasy-looking at best, but the Kendi Oil is super!  </li>
            <li>but i do like the light weight and great smell.</li>
            <li>but all I think it does is smooth hair out and prevent fly always.</li>
            <li>and I think it smells amazing and works well with my hair.</li>
            <li>I received a deluxe sample of this product and I was hooked after one use.  </li>
            <li>Adds nice texture and moisture</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make hair oily though and does have a nice smell.</li>
            <li>This product helps make my hair feel softer and smoother and gives it a nice shine.</li>
            <li>Loving this product for a couple of weeks now.  </li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li>I am absolutely loving this product.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice</li>
            <li>too fast lol!</li>
            <li>Works great for taming my poufy hair a bit, and keeping my style fresh even in humidity!</li>
            <li>I have used this oil mist three times since I received it and am more than satisfied!</li>
            <li>Glad I was able to find it on here!</li>
            <li>good on fine  hair.</li>
            <li>It tames my frizzies and it smells wonderful, and makes my hair really soft after using it.</li>
            <li>However, it is not the best product to be used on/anywhere near your scalp; made mine a tad itchy.</li>
            <li>light and shiny spray, works well on frizz control, good product</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>Love love love this spray!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t require much, and does a good job (I think) of protecting my hair!</li>
            <li>Wow this was one of my best hair purchases really works great on my hair</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that does the &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34; thing - this smooths all that out and makes my hair literally feel like silk!</li>
            <li>product is very light.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very smooth and non-oily.</li>
            <li>It really does produce shiny, healthy hair that moves freely in a beautiful way...</li>
            <li>and so glad I did - have bought 3 times now.</li>
            <li>I love this hair product.</li>
            <li>use about eight sprays before I blowdry and then straighten, focusing mostly on the ends with two or three sprays on my roots</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Better price for the amount of product you get than the Ojon was &amp; better prices are found on Amazon.</li>
            <li>love it :)</li>
            <li>When I applied it to my hair, it made my hair feel so smooth and polished!</li>
            <li>Carol&#x27;s daughter anti-breakage spray is much better.</li>
            <li>I originally got a sample size of this product and fell in LOVE!</li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stuff.  </li>

            <li>That being said, I&#x27;m so glad my hairstylist started using this on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Love this product more than any hair product i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>and I love to put it on</li>
            <li>I got a sample with my alterna shampoo and love it.</li>
            <li>The larger size I bought here was cheaper than buying in a salon and the best part-</li>
            <li>Alright, maybe not literally but it makes my hair SO much more manageable.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The Kendi Oil will NOT leave your hair feeling greasy, just smooth with a shine and protects from heat!</li>

            <li>during the day (cuz I love the fragrance and love the healthy shine).  </li>

            <li>Definitely one of the best hair products I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>this product and glad</li>
            <li>This is a very inexpensive to great looking hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product - takes care of all my frizz and flyaways after I wash my hair .  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Whatever it is, it smells like a great clean, fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>I received some last Christmas and had to buy more when I ran out!!!</li>
            <li>First time using this product .had read so many good reviews that I decided to order it.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good, esp.</li>
            <li>this is the best dry hair oil EVER.</li>
            <li>It smells great and completely fights frizz on those humid days!</li>
            <li>Love it love it love it - light weight and helps nourish curly hair ends - smooth - no build up</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, it does not help with static, just fyi.</li>
            <li>I have fine oily hair, and in the winter it can practically stand horizontal with static electricity.  </li>
            <li>This works better every time, with an item already handily available.</li>
            <li>I use it every time I shampoo my hair, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy just smooth and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>product is light and gives my hair shine without making it look greasy, though there is a limit a pump or two too many can make it look that way</li>
            <li>helps keeps my hair moisturized, and static and frizz free without making my hair oily.</li>
            <li>It just creates a healthy, light feeling to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the way this oil works on my hair and how smooth my hair becomes.</li>
            <li>However, I decided to give this a try and so far am happy.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome and not too oily like some other products.</li>
            <li>It easily cleans off eye makeup and moisturizes lashes.  </li>
            <li>Oh the regret of purchasing this at full price from Sephora so many times.</li>
            <li>And even though I have fine hair I can use a lot of this product with out my hair looking like I haven&#x27;t showered in days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it works perfect on black hair types.</li>
            <li>My hair seems to be stronger and has grown more quickly since I started using this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The accurate ingredient listing is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not a too greasywhich is great and last forever and a day.</li>
            <li>I used for years was no longer available.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair smooth but not greasy.</li>
            <li>Use lightly or you will have to re-wash.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and shiny after using it.  </li>
            <li>This is light and makes my hair shiny.</li>
            <li>So I decided to lightly spritz my hair with water</li>
            <li>Just make sure this is right for you.</li>
            <li>I love this spray and use mostly every day to keep my flyaways tame and my hair smooth - smells nice too!</li>
            <li>The scent is so clean and light...</li>
            <li>This product is light and great for dry, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Originally bought this mist because it came in first place by a magazine for controlling static created from blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li>LOVE it so much already!</li>
            <li>The sprayer dispenses a very fine mist which does not coat your hair too much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy and you won&#x27;t feel it in your hair, you&#x27;ll only see the great effects!</li>
            <li>use it before blowdrying or after, great results either way, though I prefer to use it on dry hair</li>
            <li>It is super light and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.  </li>
            <li>, my scalp is clean and the days I don&#x27;t apply Kendi oil its flakeless.</li>
            <li>I loved this for a while, but found it to be kind of heavy.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent, and the results last all day.  </li>
            <li>The best dry or wet hair moisturizer and i love it!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so soft and healthy, and I swear its helping it grow faster!</li>
            <li>Alterna Bamboo Smooth absolutely did one of the BEST jobs of making my hair look healthy, shiny and no more &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it will get rid of all static electricity, but it certainly helps.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that gets very greasy very quickly.</li>
            <li>I use it two full heads of hair.</li>
            <li>Using this, I don&#x27;t really need to use conditioner any more.</li>
            <li>I loved the shampoo and conditioner and hoped this mist would give me extra taming for my frizz, but all it does is make my hair oily.  </li>
            <li>is the step , wash my hair, apply morrocan oil, spray this Kendi Oil ( not too much ) , blow drying it. :)))))</li>
            <li>Completely non greasy, but detangles nicely.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and this product actually seemed to increase the static.</li>
            <li>For something thats paraben, chemical etc etc free it doesn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li>(Still go easy, you can spray too much and end up with greasy looking hair!)  </li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to the other products I use.</li>
            <li>Had to purchase this due to great reviews.  </li>
            <li>I spray once more in to hand and apply more to the ends of my hair and what even is left over on my hands</li>
            <li>I was excited to try the Bamboo line and bought this product, as I am a fan of using different kind of oils in my regimen.</li>
            <li>The dry oil mist smells amazing and absorbs very quickly into the hair.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>It provides shine and it provides a weightless, very soft, healthy feel to the hair.  </li>
            <li>I live in the desert and travel back east often, and it does great in both climates.  </li>
            <li>Please try it, if you&#x27;re looking for a good dry oil for your hair!</li>
            <li>it sprays fine oil mist,smells so great.i use it on wet hair,makes my hair more smooth</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair healthy, shiny, and soft - never oily.</li>
            <li>The best solution was a secret found in another magazine for &amp;#34;on the fly&amp;#34; cures when traveling with a lack of essentials.</li>
            <li>This product effectively tames and smooths hir that tends to be frizzy and to grow big in humid conditions.</li>
            <li>I love how lightweight this oil is and how it offers shine and control without any stickiness.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair really soft, but adds NO WEIGHT at all, nor do you get the &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look that many products like this can give.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, it is cheap and does everything that I needed.</li>
            <li>The best result for me is applying on half dry hair + warm low drying mode.</li>
            <li>I put one little &amp;#34;spritz&amp;#34; on top of head, and more mist throughout rest of hair.  </li>
            <li>Sprayed on dry it adds shine nicely.</li>
            <li>A nice dry oil that moisturizes, shines, and keeps the frizzy hair under control.</li>
            <li>I tried the shine stuff (green bottle) and this one is way better, more shine.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and lustrous, easy to use, smells divine.  </li>
            <li>I have fine and dry hair, this makes it really easy for my to manage my hair after each wash and it prevents hair from falling out.</li>
            <li>Still had to purchase one, but I still use this and like it very much.</li>
            <li>Seems like a very strong, not natural scent.  </li>
            <li>Hairdresser asked me what I was doing different because my hair now feels healthy on the ends</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not big on hair products and most of the time I don&#x27;t use anything besides a heat protective spray.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my daughters hair so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>you spray it and the first time you use it</li>
            <li>Let me preface this review by saying how much I love Alterna products, especially the Caviar line.</li>
            <li>I have very porous ends and need all the moisture I can get!</li>
            <li>Tried it first time via a sample pack at Sephora, and am now a committed fan.</li>
            <li>It control the frizz in my hair and leaves it smooth, soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Leaves it soft and smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>The Alterna products have brought back a more youthful look to my hair</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I use a lot of hot tools on my hair</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m almost out of my first bottle.</li>
            <li>DEFENSE AGAINST HOT NYC APARTMENTS IN THE WINTER</li>
            <li>Keeps hair silky smoothe, but spray in hands first then smoothe out so your hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy</li>
            <li>but with this oil it makes my hair so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>I love this product and will definitley buy the bigger bottle once this one runs out.</li>
            <li>I was ready to chop off my hair and this product saved it!</li>
            <li>is not heavy and does not leave my hair greasy like others I have used and really is smooth ,shinny and no frizz .love</li>
            <li>I love this product - i use it after I shower, and sometimes in the morning prior to using the curling iron.</li>
            <li>It also sprays in a fine, easy to disperse mist, vs other hair oil products I have tried, which spray in a goopy stream.</li>
            <li>The Bamboo Smooth is a Dry Oil, takes less and my hair looks great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The very fine mist makes it so easy to use without going overboard.  </li>
            <li>i got a little over zealous and sprayed it all over my dry hair, and honestly, my hair still looks amazing.</li>
            <li>If you use it about 3-4 inches down and below, you&#x27;ll love the results!</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair super soft!  </li>
            <li>I love the Kendi dry oil mist so much that I buy two bottles at a time!</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly, arrived early and attention to wrapping much appreciated!</li>
            <li>I am very label saavy, so seeing the first ingredients being silicones had be a bit worried.</li>
            <li>maybe it would be better with long hair</li>
            <li>This is light and does not weigh down my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I spray this on the highlighted areas of my hair to give that area a little more hydration, but it also add the shine !</li>
            <li>I have very long hair and was hoping for a product that would help with wintertime static.  </li>
            <li>It makes my dry over processed hair look shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>It smells divine, and works great on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>Only downside is that I run out quickly!</li>
            <li>But since I&#x27;ve started using Alterna&#x27;s Kendi Oil my hair and even my scalp have been so much healthier.</li>
            <li>Have to watch how much you use, can look greasy.</li>
            <li>my hair smells, looks and feels so much better!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>Works very well in humid climates.</li>
            <li>so I can tell how much I sprayed</li>
            <li>the whole alterna line</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed in quality.</li>
            <li>Greasy and doesn&#x27;t do much for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>For me it wasn&#x27;t really because I find it to be a one dimensional product...</li>
            <li>do still use the product when I want straight hair and it works really well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>Not too much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spray it on, generously, through towel-dried hair before I gently comb (or brush) it out.  </li>
            <li>it makes your hair so much shinier than any drug store brand serum/antifrizz spray.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!  </li>
            <li>I use &amp; love Alterna Cavier Moisture Shampoo &amp; Conditioner &amp; Overnight Repair Serum but needed something when I flat iron my naturally curly hair straight.</li>
            <li>Better than any other product I have used.</li>
            <li>hair does seem a bit more static with this, but it&#x27;s not enough to make me not love the stuff.</li>
            <li>but I still use a flat iron to smooth my hair out.</li>
            <li>More than any other product, and I&#x27;ve tried a ton of them.</li>
            <li>I have also used it on dry hair with good results, but prefer how my hair looks when sprayed on wet, then styled.  </li>
            <li>Most shine sprays weigh my hair down and make it feel greasy and gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives my hair a healthy shine that it was lacking, without weighing it down or looking greasy.</li>
            <li>I learned of this product through The New York Times of all places!  </li>
            <li>Plus it makes my hair feel like new hair!</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li>Does not seem to moisturize my hair particularly well.</li>
            <li>I have the kendi oil serum too and love it, but the spray is a lot easier to use, especially since I cut my hair short.</li>
            <li>Though I did purchase several hairdryers in search of one that did a better job, this particular mist did not totally cure the problem.</li>
            <li>My hair is thin and it makes it look great and soft.</li>
            <li>this product is very helpful - my hair finally doesnt look frizzed and blown out - the product keeps it calm and in line all day</li>
            <li>and I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Then a little more on the ends before I straighten it.</li>
            <li>Anti-freeze and softens your hair specially after a long winter.</li>
            <li>Very frizzy hair could use a serum and this as a finishing touch but for soft, finer hair that tends to frizz, it works well.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few Argan oils and like Bamboo&#x27;s kendi oil products much better.</li>
            <li>I find that I love my hair blow dried but don&#x27;t want to add heat to it.</li>
            <li>I could tell my that my hair dried straighter and smoother with less fly aways.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is dry like mine and gets dominated by static (especially during the winter)</li>
            <li>My hair was frizzy, dry, damaged and when I use the kendi oil mist it becomes smooth, soft, healthy-looking.  </li>
            <li>hair is very coarse, thick (I&#x27;m of Sicilian decent to give an idea of texture) and has never had a &#x27;shine&#x27; that, thanks to Pantene&#x27;s Pro-V commericals, one associates with healthy pretty hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kendi Oil dry oil mist has made my hair softer, shinier and tames the mild frizziness.</li>
            <li>It leaves a very soft feel but when used in excess, can create an almost oily effect.</li>
            <li>Wish it was a little less expensive and more convenient in stores, but what an awesome find!</li>
            <li>A small dose of lotion (pea sized) blended in the lengths of the hair will resolve any static created from blow drying.</li>
            <li>the box was stuffed with free samples of other beauty products!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>Helps to protect my hair and keep it soft and shiny after blow drying.</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked this shiny and soft in my life.  </li>
            <li>i spray this product directly to my scalp, and now my scalp is burning, i don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s suppose to happen.  </li>
            <li>It provided immediate shine, tamed the frizz, and makes my hair feel soft without any greasy residue.</li>
            <li>Not a heavy scent.</li>
            <li>It made my hair really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>hair - NOT luxuriously soft &amp; silky.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been natural for 2 yrs &amp; counting.</li>
            <li>Kukui Nut) Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil (Olive), Persea Gratissima Oil (Avocado), Passiflora Edulis Seed Oil, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E), Glycerin, Superoxide Dismutase, Saccharomyces Zinc Ferment, Saccharomyces Copper Ferment Extract, Lactoferrin, Phospholipids, Phytosphingosine, Corn Oligosaccharides, Ganoderma Lucidum Tyrosinase (Mushroom), Lentinus Edodes Tyrosinase, Retinyl Acetate (Vitamin A), Copper Lysl Oxidase, Acetyl Methionone, Acetyl Serine,</li>
            <li>This product has helped my hair stay soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>So far, I am liking this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Alterna Caviar shampoo/conditioner, but didn&#x27;t really like the Bamboo shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have very straight, fine, yet thick blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>use 3 to 4 spritzes of this spray after toweling off excess water, and my hair easily combs out and magically is not at all oily.  </li>
            <li>I love this...a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li>I have long straight hair and somehow when I add this after the shower it makes it shiny and smooth without being greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty much a bottle of silicone with a few dabs of oil.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this doesnt weigh down my long hair.  </li>
            <li>It is light weight but does seem to help smooth my crazy hair.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping this would really help my dry damaged hair</li>
            <li>It really helps if you&#x27;ve had a perm or your hair is dry.</li>
            <li>I use it on dry hair as well, and if it&#x27;s really humid out, I&#x27;ll have to use it a number of times.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what I expected -- and for a cheaper price than I would&#x27;ve paid at a store!</li>
            <li>First, I concentrated on my dry ends only, then on the rest of my hair, then I worked the product into my scalp.  </li>
            <li>makes the hair nice and shiny not overly shiny but just enough without making it heavy or weighed down</li>
            <li>Works well to keep my flat ironed hair smooth in a moisture heavy situation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, but I thought maybe it would be worth it.</li>
            <li>Got to be careful not to use too much though, as it will look greasy if you overdo</li>
            <li>I have to put it on when the hair is wet to really work.  </li>
            <li>and apparently they do not.  </li>
            <li>The next morning my hair was light &amp; fluffy &amp; had such a bounce &amp; shine.</li>
            <li>It somehow leaves these white flakes and initially I thought that I have a new problem w dandruff now.</li>
            <li>I have really dry, coarse hair and this product helps so much.</li>
            <li>My hair is normally on the dry side and it helped a lot.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need to use the flat iron nearly as often or carry it with me on damp days.</li>
            <li>My hair gets really frizzy, and I mean REALLY frizzy.</li>
            <li>It does things that other oils/protectants don&#x27;t do (at least with my experiences with soooo many products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>spray a little bit more before I use flat iron, and sometimes spray a little throughout,  </li>
            <li>i sprayed it on my dry hair just to see what it would do, because i had just gotten ome from work and was excited and anxious to try it out.</li>
            <li>To me it seems as though it&#x27;s full of chemicals due to its odd smell and burning sensation upon skin contact.</li>
            <li>It was so dry and frizzy and now it&#x27;s soft and managable.</li>
            <li>I was in need of a product that would help my very dry hair survive the dry and freezing weather in Utah this winter and after doing a lot of research (thanks to Google)</li>
            <li>I tend to use more of it then some other products, but I can spray it on wet or dry, and my hair never looks greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li>I like the feel after I spray on my wet or dry hair, not to heavy of a feeling, smooth, I will buy again.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine, colored hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair had a dye job go wrong that took quite a bit to fix and left it looking dry and dull, and this Kendi Oil shined it right back up and made it look sooo healthy!</li>

            <li> but i do like the light weight and great smell.</li>
            <li> but all I think it does is smooth hair out and prevent fly always.</li>
            <li> and I think it smells amazing and works well with my hair.</li>
            <li> I received a deluxe sample of this product and I was hooked after one use.  </li>
            <li> Adds nice texture and moisture</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make hair oily though and does have a nice smell.</li>
            <li> This product helps make my hair feel softer and smoother and gives it a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Loving this product for a couple of weeks now.  </li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li> I am absolutely loving this product.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice</li>
            <li> too fast lol!</li>
            <li> Works great for taming my poufy hair a bit, and keeping my style fresh even in humidity!</li>
            <li> I have used this oil mist three times since I received it and am more than satisfied!</li>
            <li> Glad I was able to find it on here!</li>
            <li> good on fine  hair.</li>
            <li> It tames my frizzies and it smells wonderful, and makes my hair really soft after using it.</li>
            <li> However, it is not the best product to be used on/anywhere near your scalp; made mine a tad itchy.</li>
            <li> light and shiny spray, works well on frizz control, good product</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> Love love love this spray!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t require much, and does a good job (I think) of protecting my hair!</li>
            <li> Wow this was one of my best hair purchases really works great on my hair</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that does the &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34; thing - this smooths all that out and makes my hair literally feel like silk!</li>
            <li> product is very light.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very smooth and non-oily.</li>
            <li> It really does produce shiny, healthy hair that moves freely in a beautiful way...</li>
            <li> and so glad I did - have bought 3 times now.</li>
            <li> I love this hair product.</li>
            <li> use about eight sprays before I blowdry and then straighten, focusing mostly on the ends with two or three sprays on my roots</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Better price for the amount of product you get than the Ojon was &amp; better prices are found on Amazon.</li>
            <li> love it :)</li>
            <li> When I applied it to my hair, it made my hair feel so smooth and polished!</li>
            <li> Carol&#x27;s daughter anti-breakage spray is much better.</li>
            <li> I originally got a sample size of this product and fell in LOVE!</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny and more manageable, but doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> Lovely smell as well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product.  </li>

            <li> Did nothing for static.  </li>
            <li> This product did nothing to control static.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I&#x27;m so glad my hairstylist started using this on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lovely.  </li>

            <li> Since I started using it, I get lots more compliments on how shiny and healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li> Love this product more than any hair product i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> and I love to put it on</li>
            <li> I got a sample with my alterna shampoo and love it.</li>
            <li> The larger size I bought here was cheaper than buying in a salon and the best part-</li>
            <li> Alright, maybe not literally but it makes my hair SO much more manageable.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The Kendi Oil will NOT leave your hair feeling greasy, just smooth with a shine and protects from heat!</li>

            <li> Love it.</li>

            <li> I have received compliments on my hair being healthy looking when using this product.</li>
            <li> Love this Bamboo Kendi oil mist.</li>
            <li> during the day (cuz I love the fragrance and love the healthy shine).  </li>
            <li> just made my hair greasy but didn&#x27;t really stop the fly- aways.</li>

            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been used it more than 2 years,</li>
            <li> Definitely one of the best hair products I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> this product and glad</li>
            <li> This is a very inexpensive to great looking hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product - takes care of all my frizz and flyaways after I wash my hair .  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Whatever it is, it smells like a great clean, fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> I received some last Christmas and had to buy more when I ran out!!!</li>
            <li> First time using this product .had read so many good reviews that I decided to order it.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, esp.</li>
            <li> this is the best dry hair oil EVER.</li>
            <li> It smells great and completely fights frizz on those humid days!</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it - light weight and helps nourish curly hair ends - smooth - no build up</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair, it does not help with static, just fyi.</li>
            <li> I have fine oily hair, and in the winter it can practically stand horizontal with static electricity.  </li>
            <li> This works better every time, with an item already handily available.</li>
            <li> I use it every time I shampoo my hair, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy just smooth and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> product is light and gives my hair shine without making it look greasy, though there is a limit a pump or two too many can make it look that way</li>
            <li> helps keeps my hair moisturized, and static and frizz free without making my hair oily.</li>
            <li> It just creates a healthy, light feeling to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the way this oil works on my hair and how smooth my hair becomes.</li>
            <li> However, I decided to give this a try and so far am happy.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome and not too oily like some other products.</li>
            <li> It easily cleans off eye makeup and moisturizes lashes.  </li>
            <li> Oh the regret of purchasing this at full price from Sephora so many times.</li>
            <li> And even though I have fine hair I can use a lot of this product with out my hair looking like I haven&#x27;t showered in days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it works perfect on black hair types.</li>
            <li> My hair seems to be stronger and has grown more quickly since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The accurate ingredient listing is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not a too greasywhich is great and last forever and a day.</li>
            <li> I used for years was no longer available.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair smooth but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Use lightly or you will have to re-wash.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and shiny after using it.  </li>
            <li> This is light and makes my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> So I decided to lightly spritz my hair with water</li>
            <li> Just make sure this is right for you.</li>
            <li> I love this spray and use mostly every day to keep my flyaways tame and my hair smooth - smells nice too!</li>
            <li> The scent is so clean and light...</li>
            <li> This product is light and great for dry, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Originally bought this mist because it came in first place by a magazine for controlling static created from blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li> LOVE it so much already!</li>
            <li> The sprayer dispenses a very fine mist which does not coat your hair too much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy and you won&#x27;t feel it in your hair, you&#x27;ll only see the great effects!</li>
            <li> use it before blowdrying or after, great results either way, though I prefer to use it on dry hair</li>
            <li> It is super light and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.  </li>
            <li> , my scalp is clean and the days I don&#x27;t apply Kendi oil its flakeless.</li>
            <li> I loved this for a while, but found it to be kind of heavy.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent, and the results last all day.  </li>
            <li> The best dry or wet hair moisturizer and i love it!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so soft and healthy, and I swear its helping it grow faster!</li>
            <li> Alterna Bamboo Smooth absolutely did one of the BEST jobs of making my hair look healthy, shiny and no more &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it will get rid of all static electricity, but it certainly helps.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair that gets very greasy very quickly.</li>
            <li> I use it two full heads of hair.</li>
            <li> Using this, I don&#x27;t really need to use conditioner any more.</li>
            <li> I loved the shampoo and conditioner and hoped this mist would give me extra taming for my frizz, but all it does is make my hair oily.  </li>
            <li> is the step , wash my hair, apply morrocan oil, spray this Kendi Oil ( not too much ) , blow drying it. :)))))</li>
            <li> Completely non greasy, but detangles nicely.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and this product actually seemed to increase the static.</li>
            <li> For something thats paraben, chemical etc etc free it doesn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li> (Still go easy, you can spray too much and end up with greasy looking hair!)  </li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to the other products I use.</li>
            <li> Had to purchase this due to great reviews.  </li>
            <li> I spray once more in to hand and apply more to the ends of my hair and what even is left over on my hands</li>
            <li> I was excited to try the Bamboo line and bought this product, as I am a fan of using different kind of oils in my regimen.</li>
            <li> The dry oil mist smells amazing and absorbs very quickly into the hair.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> It provides shine and it provides a weightless, very soft, healthy feel to the hair.  </li>
            <li> I live in the desert and travel back east often, and it does great in both climates.  </li>
            <li> Please try it, if you&#x27;re looking for a good dry oil for your hair!</li>
            <li> it sprays fine oil mist,smells so great.i use it on wet hair,makes my hair more smooth</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair healthy, shiny, and soft - never oily.</li>
            <li> The best solution was a secret found in another magazine for &amp;#34;on the fly&amp;#34; cures when traveling with a lack of essentials.</li>
            <li> This product effectively tames and smooths hir that tends to be frizzy and to grow big in humid conditions.</li>
            <li> I love how lightweight this oil is and how it offers shine and control without any stickiness.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair really soft, but adds NO WEIGHT at all, nor do you get the &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look that many products like this can give.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, it is cheap and does everything that I needed.</li>
            <li> The best result for me is applying on half dry hair + warm low drying mode.</li>
            <li> I put one little &amp;#34;spritz&amp;#34; on top of head, and more mist throughout rest of hair.  </li>
            <li> Sprayed on dry it adds shine nicely.</li>
            <li> A nice dry oil that moisturizes, shines, and keeps the frizzy hair under control.</li>
            <li> I tried the shine stuff (green bottle) and this one is way better, more shine.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and lustrous, easy to use, smells divine.  </li>
            <li> I have fine and dry hair, this makes it really easy for my to manage my hair after each wash and it prevents hair from falling out.</li>
            <li> Still had to purchase one, but I still use this and like it very much.</li>
            <li> Seems like a very strong, not natural scent.  </li>
            <li> Hairdresser asked me what I was doing different because my hair now feels healthy on the ends</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big on hair products and most of the time I don&#x27;t use anything besides a heat protective spray.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my daughters hair so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> you spray it and the first time you use it</li>
            <li> Let me preface this review by saying how much I love Alterna products, especially the Caviar line.</li>
            <li> I have very porous ends and need all the moisture I can get!</li>
            <li> Tried it first time via a sample pack at Sephora, and am now a committed fan.</li>
            <li> It control the frizz in my hair and leaves it smooth, soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Leaves it soft and smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> The Alterna products have brought back a more youthful look to my hair</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I use a lot of hot tools on my hair</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m almost out of my first bottle.</li>
            <li> DEFENSE AGAINST HOT NYC APARTMENTS IN THE WINTER</li>
            <li> Keeps hair silky smoothe, but spray in hands first then smoothe out so your hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy</li>
            <li> but with this oil it makes my hair so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I love this product and will definitley buy the bigger bottle once this one runs out.</li>
            <li> I was ready to chop off my hair and this product saved it!</li>
            <li> is not heavy and does not leave my hair greasy like others I have used and really is smooth ,shinny and no frizz .love</li>
            <li> I love this product - i use it after I shower, and sometimes in the morning prior to using the curling iron.</li>
            <li> It also sprays in a fine, easy to disperse mist, vs other hair oil products I have tried, which spray in a goopy stream.</li>
            <li> The Bamboo Smooth is a Dry Oil, takes less and my hair looks great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The very fine mist makes it so easy to use without going overboard.  </li>
            <li> i got a little over zealous and sprayed it all over my dry hair, and honestly, my hair still looks amazing.</li>
            <li> If you use it about 3-4 inches down and below, you&#x27;ll love the results!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair super soft!  </li>
            <li> I love the Kendi dry oil mist so much that I buy two bottles at a time!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, arrived early and attention to wrapping much appreciated!</li>
            <li> I am very label saavy, so seeing the first ingredients being silicones had be a bit worried.</li>
            <li> maybe it would be better with long hair</li>
            <li> This is light and does not weigh down my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I spray this on the highlighted areas of my hair to give that area a little more hydration, but it also add the shine !</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and was hoping for a product that would help with wintertime static.  </li>
            <li> It makes my dry over processed hair look shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li> It smells divine, and works great on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> Only downside is that I run out quickly!</li>
            <li> But since I&#x27;ve started using Alterna&#x27;s Kendi Oil my hair and even my scalp have been so much healthier.</li>
            <li> Have to watch how much you use, can look greasy.</li>
            <li> my hair smells, looks and feels so much better!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight.  </li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> Works very well in humid climates.</li>
            <li> so I can tell how much I sprayed</li>
            <li> the whole alterna line</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed in quality.</li>
            <li> Greasy and doesn&#x27;t do much for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> For me it wasn&#x27;t really because I find it to be a one dimensional product...</li>
            <li> do still use the product when I want straight hair and it works really well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Not too much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spray it on, generously, through towel-dried hair before I gently comb (or brush) it out.  </li>
            <li> it makes your hair so much shinier than any drug store brand serum/antifrizz spray.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!  </li>
            <li> I use &amp; love Alterna Cavier Moisture Shampoo &amp; Conditioner &amp; Overnight Repair Serum but needed something when I flat iron my naturally curly hair straight.</li>
            <li> Better than any other product I have used.</li>
            <li> hair does seem a bit more static with this, but it&#x27;s not enough to make me not love the stuff.</li>
            <li> but I still use a flat iron to smooth my hair out.</li>
            <li> More than any other product, and I&#x27;ve tried a ton of them.</li>
            <li> I have also used it on dry hair with good results, but prefer how my hair looks when sprayed on wet, then styled.  </li>
            <li> Most shine sprays weigh my hair down and make it feel greasy and gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives my hair a healthy shine that it was lacking, without weighing it down or looking greasy.</li>
            <li> I learned of this product through The New York Times of all places!  </li>
            <li> Plus it makes my hair feel like new hair!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li> Does not seem to moisturize my hair particularly well.</li>
            <li> I have the kendi oil serum too and love it, but the spray is a lot easier to use, especially since I cut my hair short.</li>
            <li> Though I did purchase several hairdryers in search of one that did a better job, this particular mist did not totally cure the problem.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and it makes it look great and soft.</li>
            <li> this product is very helpful - my hair finally doesnt look frizzed and blown out - the product keeps it calm and in line all day</li>
            <li> and I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Then a little more on the ends before I straighten it.</li>
            <li> Anti-freeze and softens your hair specially after a long winter.</li>
            <li> Very frizzy hair could use a serum and this as a finishing touch but for soft, finer hair that tends to frizz, it works well.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few Argan oils and like Bamboo&#x27;s kendi oil products much better.</li>
            <li> I find that I love my hair blow dried but don&#x27;t want to add heat to it.</li>
            <li> I could tell my that my hair dried straighter and smoother with less fly aways.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is dry like mine and gets dominated by static (especially during the winter)</li>
            <li> My hair was frizzy, dry, damaged and when I use the kendi oil mist it becomes smooth, soft, healthy-looking.  </li>
            <li> hair is very coarse, thick (I&#x27;m of Sicilian decent to give an idea of texture) and has never had a &#x27;shine&#x27; that, thanks to Pantene&#x27;s Pro-V commericals, one associates with healthy pretty hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Kendi Oil dry oil mist has made my hair softer, shinier and tames the mild frizziness.</li>
            <li> It leaves a very soft feel but when used in excess, can create an almost oily effect.</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little less expensive and more convenient in stores, but what an awesome find!</li>
            <li> A small dose of lotion (pea sized) blended in the lengths of the hair will resolve any static created from blow drying.</li>
            <li> the box was stuffed with free samples of other beauty products!</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Helps to protect my hair and keep it soft and shiny after blow drying.</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked this shiny and soft in my life.  </li>
            <li> i spray this product directly to my scalp, and now my scalp is burning, i don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s suppose to happen.  </li>
            <li> It provided immediate shine, tamed the frizz, and makes my hair feel soft without any greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Not a heavy scent.</li>
            <li> It made my hair really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> hair - NOT luxuriously soft &amp; silky.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been natural for 2 yrs &amp; counting.</li>

            <li> This product has helped my hair stay soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> So far, I am liking this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Alterna Caviar shampoo/conditioner, but didn&#x27;t really like the Bamboo shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have very straight, fine, yet thick blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> use 3 to 4 spritzes of this spray after toweling off excess water, and my hair easily combs out and magically is not at all oily.  </li>
            <li> I love this...a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair and somehow when I add this after the shower it makes it shiny and smooth without being greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty much a bottle of silicone with a few dabs of oil.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this doesnt weigh down my long hair.  </li>
            <li> It is light weight but does seem to help smooth my crazy hair.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this would really help my dry damaged hair</li>
            <li> It really helps if you&#x27;ve had a perm or your hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I use it on dry hair as well, and if it&#x27;s really humid out, I&#x27;ll have to use it a number of times.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I expected -- and for a cheaper price than I would&#x27;ve paid at a store!</li>
            <li> First, I concentrated on my dry ends only, then on the rest of my hair, then I worked the product into my scalp.  </li>
            <li> makes the hair nice and shiny not overly shiny but just enough without making it heavy or weighed down</li>
            <li> Works well to keep my flat ironed hair smooth in a moisture heavy situation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but I thought maybe it would be worth it.</li>
            <li> Got to be careful not to use too much though, as it will look greasy if you overdo</li>
            <li> I have to put it on when the hair is wet to really work.  </li>
            <li> and apparently they do not.  </li>
            <li> The next morning my hair was light &amp; fluffy &amp; had such a bounce &amp; shine.</li>
            <li> It somehow leaves these white flakes and initially I thought that I have a new problem w dandruff now.</li>
            <li> I have really dry, coarse hair and this product helps so much.</li>
            <li> My hair is normally on the dry side and it helped a lot.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to use the flat iron nearly as often or carry it with me on damp days.</li>
            <li> My hair gets really frizzy, and I mean REALLY frizzy.</li>
            <li> It does things that other oils/protectants don&#x27;t do (at least with my experiences with soooo many products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> spray a little bit more before I use flat iron, and sometimes spray a little throughout,  </li>
            <li> i sprayed it on my dry hair just to see what it would do, because i had just gotten ome from work and was excited and anxious to try it out.</li>
            <li> To me it seems as though it&#x27;s full of chemicals due to its odd smell and burning sensation upon skin contact.</li>
            <li> It was so dry and frizzy and now it&#x27;s soft and managable.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a product that would help my very dry hair survive the dry and freezing weather in Utah this winter and after doing a lot of research (thanks to Google)</li>
            <li> I tend to use more of it then some other products, but I can spray it on wet or dry, and my hair never looks greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li> I like the feel after I spray on my wet or dry hair, not to heavy of a feeling, smooth, I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine, colored hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair had a dye job go wrong that took quite a bit to fix and left it looking dry and dull, and this Kendi Oil shined it right back up and made it look sooo healthy!</li>
            <li> I do use a flat iron, and I do blow-dry my hair after about 10 minutes to let it dry a little bit first.  </li>
            <li> So because of the smell &amp; the need to use the flat iron &amp; product again the next day I only give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Mind you, I did a mid sized flat twists all over my head &amp; at the ends I put bantu knots aka Chini Bumps at the ends of the twist &amp; covered it (after trimming my ends too).</li>
            <li> It gives my long, coarse hair just the right amount of extra moisture and sheen after washing, without weighing it down like heavy silicone serums.</li>
            <li> Only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I have slick straight Asian hair that is oily at the roots but can get dry at the ends, especially with blow drying and swimming in chlorinated pools.  </li>
            <li> and I was flat ironing.</li>
            <li> One of the products I purchased to try and avoid buying a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it helps if the damage is already there; but for me it helped prevent flat iron damage.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, and a little goes a long way - one of these bottles lasts me about 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and shiny, without being greasy or weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I am black and have natural hair also</li>
            <li> Careful they are not the same formular and the labels are different.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only blow dried my hair about 5 times in these 2 yrs.</li>
            <li> The next morning I kid you not, my hair is shiny, soft, manageable, looks blow dried, &amp; no frizzies!</li>
            <li> Just be careful about adding too much, or starting from the roots, as it can cause the oily affect as well.</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder long and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Want long hair?</li>
            <li> and i will be using it as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> This is so different than other oils.  </li>
            <li> saw reviews not only on amazon, but other beauty sites as well.</li>
            <li> I have tried monoi oil, argan oil, macademia oil, and every conditioner I could find (drug store brands and much more expensive brands!  </li>
            <li> Unlike other &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; products, this does NOT make my hair oily or greasy looking - and definitely NOT a tacky feel at all!  </li>
            <li> and I have very long hair.</li>
            <li> I use it on my dry hair after I blow dry before I curl.  </li>
            <li> Silicones can cause buildup on the hair, creating a barrier that keeps moisture out (which is the point of a frizz control product), but an unintended consequence is that wanted moisture from products can also be kept out, causing the strand to become brittle and dry.</li>
            <li> I use it in place of Moroccan Oil after I have blown my hair dry</li>
            <li> It helps a lot to detangle your hair when is dry.</li>
            <li> I sometimes spritz it on dry hair too in the winter time.  </li>
            <li> It works well on dry hair, too.  </li>
            <li> Dry hair?</li>
            <li> I spray it on my hair before I blow it dry and again after</li>
            <li> and I noticed my hair getting dry...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Alterna Bamboo Shine products, so decided to try their Dry Oil Mist.  </li>
            <li> Going to dry argan oil for my dry damaged hair</li>
            <li> What I like about this dry oil mist is that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily, but does provide moisture.  </li>
            <li> Never recommend to any person dry my hair</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used it on me and said it would help my hair dry faster, and it does.</li>
            <li> I never blowdry until it&#x27;s completely dry - too damaging to do</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never have to blow dry my hair again</li>
            <li> I like a lot of bounce, volume, and shine...and Alterna Bamboo Dry Oil</li>
            <li> You can spray it on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used it on damp and dry hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and dry, resulting in all sorts of other hair problems.  </li>
            <li> (but I don&#x27;t think the fragrance lasts very long - I wish it would tho)!  </li>
            <li> THAT DRY EVERYTHING OUT!</li>
            <li> I wish I had pictures of my hair before and after using this kendi oil dry oil mist!  </li>
            <li> I work outside constantly in the summer and by midday, my hair is usually a ball of frizz.</li>
            <li> I spray a little on my hair, mid shaft and to the ends before I blow dry.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair looks very dry after a while.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and straight but can get frizzy.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, so the bottle lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it on dry, half dry and wet hair.</li>
            <li> I went to moisturize a few days later</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s on the bottle is a mish-mash of chemicals with a few smatterings of different types of oil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve aged and my hair has gotten thinner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried similar products but they were heavy and made my hair oily.</li>
            <li> I also use it on wet hair as a detangler.</li>
            <li> when you put it directly on wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally wavy, color treated hair that is prone to frizziness.</li>
            <li> I have medium type hair - not super thin, and it&#x27;s pretty course</li>
            <li> Really needed after a summer of sun &amp; pool that left my hair dry and unhappy.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read the other reviews about the silicones and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it yet</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave hair oily like other oil products</li>
            <li> have used other oils and none compare to this</li>
            <li> So my conclusion was it definitely dries up , not sure if its the winter/cold weather causing it.</li>
            <li> i have thick curly frizzy hair and this really helps reduce the frizz without making my hair dull or oily.</li>
            <li> , I applied RAW Shea Butter to my hair, combed it with a wide tooth comb then sprayed this dry oil on it &amp; used my paddle brush to get it all over my hair (4 sprays on each section).</li>
            <li> i use a few sprays before i blow dry</li>
            <li> (spray a little in my hair when it&#x27;s wet before I dry it and a little after)</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I went through it</li>
            <li> I have wavy/straight thick Asian hair prone to frizziness/unruliness</li>
            <li> I use it almost every day, just a few spritzes on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> w/out weighing down your hair.</li>
            <li> One tip---don&#x27;t use it too close to the scalp as it may make your hair look weighed down and oily.</li>
            <li> It keeps my waves from being frizzy or weighed down.  </li>
            <li> It does not weigh your hair down.  </li>
            <li> Less frizz and flyways.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit on the pricy side, but it&#x27;s still less to buy this product from Amazon and pay for shipping (it&#x27;s not Prime eligible).</li>
            <li> the Amazon price is much less than my hairdresser charges.</li>
            <li> My hair has less breakage now with it.</li>
            <li> It has an odd smell and BURNS when it hits my scalp.</li>
            <li> nothing on my scalp or it would become an oily mess.  </li>
            <li> I spray it on my hair when wet, then style as usual.  </li>
            <li> Helps tame frizz and adds shine without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> my hair is extremely fine and boring and since i&#x27;ve been highlighting it since the dawn of time, it can definitely use a boost.</li>
            <li> I applied this to my towel dried hair just like directed</li>
            <li> I smell like bamboo, the scent is not light for me at all.</li>
            <li> then i spray once in my hand and run it over my dried hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> It tames my split ends, nourishes my dried out hair and makes it look silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Waste of Money.</li>
            <li> I have always had fly-aways and the ends were never smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> The product I was using started to look heavy and oily on my thinner hair.  </li>
            <li> My ends start getting dried out after a couple days of not washing it and</li>
            <li> Way cheaper than the $23 some odd dollars from Sephora!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but see a dramatic difference in my hair already.</li>
            <li> hair is really thin and dry at the ends.  </li>
            <li> This might be okay for thicker hair and while it helped get rid of frizz, it made my hair look so greasy and disgusting with just one small spray.</li>
            <li> It is not too heavy for my medium thick, yet thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> The liquid doesnt even look like what I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> I used the Alterna products in the past and for some reason my hairdresser changed products and so did I.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it should shine the hair.</li>
            <li> I usually spray it into my hands and pass them over my hair.  </li>
            <li> If you have thin, dull, dry hair - this product is a must.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an oil without a very heavy weight and scent, I would recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Not nice at all.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and use this product for pre-flat iron or as a finishing touch to my style.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one!!</li>
            <li> so my hair is in horrible shape right now,</li>
            <li> maybe 6-8 at least!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when the product I received did not contain the same ingredients that are listed in the description.</li>
            <li> Not very impressive.  </li>
            <li> I have thin, over processed hair.</li>
            <li> I tend to have an oily scalp, so I was skeptical of putting oil in my hair.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do anything for me, was not impressed.</li>
            <li> My hair is lights and I tend to get random strays frizzing up, this spray helps eliminate the frizz.</li>
            <li> i was not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I admit, I straigthen my hair daily and the ends were looking terrible.</li>
            <li> It protects against the evil flat iron and blow-dryer, and makes it shine.  </li>
            <li> I AM AFRAID I AM RETURNING IT</li>
            <li> Tmes frizzies and makes it shine like crazy.  </li>
            <li> Obsessed with this!</li>
            <li> I am obsessed!</li>
            <li> I just hater bad product</li>
            <li> My hair is terribly dry-looking at the ends and does the fly-away thing.  </li>
            <li> I hate the smell, wish it didn&#x27;t have one at all!</li>
            <li> and I hated my twist out!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Seems like a very strong, not natural scent.  Bottle leaks when spraying product.  Does not seem to moisturize my hair particularly well.</li>
            <li> Love it ! makes the hair nice and shiny not overly shiny but just enough without making it heavy or weighed down</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I looking for and need! Great!</li>
            <li> it sprays fine oil mist,smells so great.i use it on wet hair,makes my hair more smooth an shiny,&lt;br /&gt;i recommend it to my friend.</li>
            <li> Helps to protect my hair and keep it soft and shiny after blow drying.</li>
            <li> It does not seem to do the job as claimed.</li>
            <li> Hairdresser asked me what I was doing different because my hair now feels healthy on the ends and I have very long hair. Amazing smell!! Got a sample of this and so glad I did - have bought 3 times now. One bottle lasts about 3+ months and I use it after every shower. Less frizz and flyways. Obsessed with this!</li>
            <li> This might be okay for thicker hair and while it helped get rid of frizz, it made my hair look so greasy and disgusting with just one small spray. Almost just like a bottle of olive oil.</li>
            <li> This works great - I use it on my dry hair after I blow dry before I curl.  Just like 5 pumps and it holds curl and gives lots of shine!</li>
            <li> Oh the regret of purchasing this at full price from Sephora so many times.</li>
            <li> I love this hair product. It tames my frizzies and it smells wonderful, and makes my hair really soft after using it. Only downside is that I run out quickly! I have wavy/straight thick Asian hair prone to frizziness/unruliness and I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell and works to keep my hair looking and feeling shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I AM AFRAID I AM RETURNING IT AS IT HAS DONE NOTHING FOR MY HAIR</li>
            <li> I received a deluxe sample of this product and I was hooked after one use.  I have very straight, fine, yet thick blonde hair.  I&#x27;m not big on hair products and most of the time I don&#x27;t use anything besides a heat protective spray.  I applied this to my towel dried hair just like directed and I loved it.  I could tell my that my hair dried straighter and smoother with less fly aways.  I tend to have an oily scalp, so I was skeptical of putting oil in my hair.  This is so different than other oils.  It&#x27;s not heavy and you won&#x27;t feel it in your hair, you&#x27;ll only see the great effects! I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that gets very greasy very quickly. But since I&#x27;ve started using Alterna&#x27;s Kendi Oil my hair and even my scalp have been so much healthier. And even though I have fine hair I can use a lot of this product with out my hair looking like I haven&#x27;t showered in days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use about eight sprays before I blowdry and then straighten, focusing mostly on the ends with two or three sprays on my roots then I massage  the oil in my hair. And after I am done straightening my hair I spray once more in to hand and apply more to the ends of my hair and what even is left over on my hands I massage in to my roots. I get great shine and my hair looks so healthy.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about a month and can definitely tell the difference in how my hair feels! Adds nice texture and moisture w/out weighing down your hair. Really needed after a summer of sun &amp; pool that left my hair dry and unhappy.</li>
            <li> My hair is terribly dry-looking at the ends and does the fly-away thing.  Alterna Bamboo Smooth absolutely did one of the BEST jobs of making my hair look healthy, shiny and no more &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34;!  I use it only at the ends of my hair…nothing on my scalp or it would become an oily mess.  The scent is wonderful, too.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this doesnt weigh down my long hair.  My hair has never looked this shiny and soft in my life.  I&#x27;m simply amazed!</li>
            <li> Love this. Protects against frizz and the greatest thing is it detangles! It is not a too greasywhich is great and last forever and a day. I use it two full heads of hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and this product actually seemed to increase the static.</li>
            <li> The dry oil mist smells amazing and absorbs very quickly into the hair. It works best when I brush it through with a boar hair brush. However, it is not the best product to be used on/anywhere near your scalp; made mine a tad itchy. So, I apply it from the mid-strand to the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have bought several bottles of this but I&#x27;m still looking for something else. I use &amp; love Alterna Cavier Moisture Shampoo &amp; Conditioner &amp; Overnight Repair Serum but needed something when I flat iron my naturally curly hair straight. I found this after my Ojon Shine &amp; Protect Mist I used for years was no longer available. It does straighten my hair but some frizz does come back the next day &amp; if it rains or there&#x27;s humidity, forget it ... frizz it back. Have to watch how much you use, can look greasy. I hate the smell, wish it didn&#x27;t have one at all! I smell like bamboo, the scent is not light for me at all. So because of the smell &amp; the need to use the flat iron &amp; product again the next day I only give it 3 stars. Better price for the amount of product you get than the Ojon was &amp; better prices are found on Amazon. I shop at the \\&quot;Haircare Outlet\\&quot; for the best prices on these products!</li>
            <li> Love it!! It leaves my daughters hair so soft and smooth. Better than any other product I have used. I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I actually bought the Alterna Bamboo oil to try on my dogs but now I use it on my hair as well. Adds shine and anti-frizz without feeling oily. Best hair product I&#x27;ve found in years.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Does the job.</li>
            <li> this stuff is liquid gold! you spray it and the first time you use it you see a difference! i highly recommend it. i use a few sprays before i blow dry then i spray once in my hand and run it over my dried hair.  love it :)</li>
            <li> Just awesome and great price!</li>
            <li> Let me preface this review by saying how much I love Alterna products, especially the Caviar line. I was excited to try the Bamboo line and bought this product, as I am a fan of using different kind of oils in my regimen. I am very label saavy, so seeing the first ingredients being silicones had be a bit worried. Silicones can cause buildup on the hair, creating a barrier that keeps moisture out (which is the point of a frizz control product), but an unintended consequence is that wanted moisture from products can also be kept out, causing the strand to become brittle and dry. I have very porous ends and need all the moisture I can get! Anyhoo, I thought, \\&quot;Hey ... it&#x27;s Alterna ... it will be fine!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it was! When I applied it to my hair, it made my hair feel so smooth and polished! I went to moisturize a few days later and my hair had started to break and I instantly knew it was from the silicones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My verdict is this: if your hair can tolerate silicone products, then by all means, get this product! I liked how my hair felt for a day or two! If your hair cannot tolerate silicones and it causes breakage, I would definitely avoid this product.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Keeps hair smooth but not greasy. I have tried a few Argan oils and like Bamboo&#x27;s kendi oil products much better. I have the kendi oil serum too and love it, but the spray is a lot easier to use, especially since I cut my hair short.</li>
            <li> Best oil ever! I use it for everything. I may need to re-order soon!</li>
            <li> I loved this for a while, but found it to be kind of heavy.  Carol&#x27;s daughter anti-breakage spray is much better.</li>
            <li> best thing ever! my hair smells, looks and feels so much better!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a must have</li>
            <li> I originally got a sample size of this product and fell in LOVE! The scent is so clean and light...so refreshing! I have thick hair and use this product for pre-flat iron or as a finishing touch to my style. Wish it was a little less expensive and more convenient in stores, but what an awesome find!</li>
            <li> I used this when I was transitioning and I was flat ironing. I absolutely  loved it. Gave my hair great sheen and bounce. It smells so good too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome and not too oily like some other products. I received some last Christmas and had to buy more when I ran out!!!</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING! I was in need of a product that would help my very dry hair survive the dry and freezing weather in Utah this winter and after doing a lot of research (thanks to Google) I stumbled upon an article that identified this product as the most effective for winter hair! If your hair is dry like mine and gets dominated by static (especially during the winter) I recommend purchasing this product! I am obsessed! It&#x27;s incredible!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this oil several times. It keeps my hair healthy, shiny, and soft - never oily. Lightweight, and helps with detangling hair.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews before buying. ..... good on fine  hair. It&#x27;s way too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin, over processed hair. I have used this oil mist three times since I received it and am more than satisfied! My hair is softer, more manageable with fuller body! I plan to purchase the Alterna Bamboo Volume Shampoo and Conditioner next. If you have thin, dull, dry hair - this product is a must. And it is a GREAT deal for the price - I can tell already that this $20 bottle is going to last me several months... maybe 6-8 at least!</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stuff.  I have used everything on my hair from Kerestase, Alterna, Moroccan Oil, and this stuff is the BEST.  It is not too heavy for my medium thick, yet thinning hair.  It tames my split ends, nourishes my dried out hair and makes it look silky and shiny.  I have gotten lots of complements on my hair since I began using it a month ago.  GREAT STUFF!!  I use it in place of Moroccan Oil after I have blown my hair dry and before I heat style.  I finish my style with a final spray and I&#x27;m good to go.  Love the smell too!</li>
            <li> I like that this does not leave my hair oily. It makes my hair shiny and more manageable, but doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.  It is very lightweight.  Using this, I don&#x27;t really need to use conditioner any more.</li>
            <li> Anti-freeze and softens your hair specially after a long winter. It helps a lot to detangle your hair when is dry.</li>
            <li> I am hooked on this stuff. Tried it first time via a sample pack at Sephora, and am now a committed fan. It gives my long, coarse hair just the right amount of extra moisture and sheen after washing, without weighing it down like heavy silicone serums. Lovely smell as well. It also sprays in a fine, easy to disperse mist, vs other hair oil products I have tried, which spray in a goopy stream. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I loved the shampoo and conditioner and hoped this mist would give me extra taming for my frizz, but all it does is make my hair oily.  I won&#x27;t purchase again, and probably won&#x27;t use what I have.</li>
            <li> I use this between shampoos, too. Helps keep the hair moisturized and the frizzies and fly-a-ways under control. One of the products I purchased to try and avoid buying a flat iron. Still had to purchase one, but I still use this and like it very much.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product.  Leaves my hair super soft!  Glad I was able to find it on here!</li>
            <li> Purchased this product based on another review. If you have fine hair, it does not help with static, just fyi. It doesn&#x27;t make hair oily though and does have a nice smell.</li>
            <li> i spray this product directly to my scalp, and now my scalp is burning, i don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s suppose to happen.  but i do like the light weight and great smell.</li>
            <li> I love it !!!! A +++++&lt;br /&gt;Super RECOMMEND !</li>
            <li> I have coarse hair, and lots of it. It has a tendency to be frizzy. I&#x27;ve tried many hair oils and products, and this has honestly been the best for me. I tend to use more of it then some other products, but I can spray it on wet or dry, and my hair never looks greasy or weighed down. Sprayed on dry it adds shine nicely. A standby product for me.</li>
            <li> They sent me the oil treatment (has a dropper) not the MIST! Careful they are not the same formular and the labels are different. I returned mine.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do anything for me, was not impressed. neither was my hair.</li>
            <li> Originally bought this mist because it came in first place by a magazine for controlling static created from blow drying my hair. Though I did purchase several hairdryers in search of one that did a better job, this particular mist did not totally cure the problem. It leaves a very soft feel but when used in excess, can create an almost oily effect. The best solution was a secret found in another magazine for &amp;#34;on the fly&amp;#34; cures when traveling with a lack of essentials. A small dose of lotion (pea sized) blended in the lengths of the hair will resolve any static created from blow drying. This works better every time, with an item already handily available. Just be careful about adding too much, or starting from the roots, as it can cause the oily affect as well.</li>
            <li> Really like this product. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy or oily. Helps tame frizz and adds shine without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair looks very dry after a while.  Didn&#x27;t realized that it has alcohol in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and smells even better!  Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair or shin oily...absorbs instantly. i have thick curly frizzy hair and this really helps reduce the frizz without making my hair dull or oily.</li>
            <li> Was didn&#x27;t see how good this product . Purchased because of the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Recently just realized , if you use it before blow drying, the result is really amazing. My hair is shoulder long and frizzy. Using this, make my hair looks healthy and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the step , wash my hair, apply morrocan oil, spray this Kendi Oil ( not too much ) , blow drying it. :)))))</li>
            <li> Love this oil mist.  I use it every time I shampoo my hair, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy just smooth and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Good product for damaged hair. Use lightly or you will have to re-wash. Does have a lot of dimethicone but works well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one!!</li>
            <li> I learned of this product through The New York Times of all places!  I have fine oily hair, and in the winter it can practically stand horizontal with static electricity.  I also have a problem using conditioner because of oiliness, but I need it because my hair tangles so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use 3 to 4 spritzes of this spray after toweling off excess water, and my hair easily combs out and magically is not at all oily.  I can&#x27;t say it will get rid of all static electricity, but it certainly helps.  I sometimes spritz it on dry hair too in the winter time.  It adds a bit of oil, but not to excess.  I am really happy with it.</li>
            <li> It control the frizz in my hair and leaves it smooth, soft, and shiny. Works very well in humid climates.</li>
            <li> i love this quality product. i am a faithful user. also, i especially loved the super-competitive price that amazon.com offered it at. i say amazon.com always has the best deals!! purchase with confidence and enjoy!!</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it - light weight and helps nourish curly hair ends - smooth - no build up</li>
            <li> got a 1oz bottle in a sampler pack from qvc.  light and shiny spray, works well on frizz control, good product</li>
            <li> This is wonderful on your hair.  It protects against the evil flat iron and blow-dryer, and makes it shine.  It also has a wonderful scent- reminds me of either the Saks or Neiman Marcus hair salon.</li>
            <li> Not very impressive.  Did nothing for static.  I have very long hair and was hoping for a product that would help with wintertime static.  This product did nothing to control static.  Also, the ingredients listed on amazon&#x27;s website are NOT the same of what&#x27;s listed on the bottle.  What&#x27;s on the bottle is a mish-mash of chemicals with a few smatterings of different types of oil.  Waste of Money.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a couple of years. A nice dry oil that moisturizes, shines, and keeps the frizzy hair under control. It was recommended by my hair stylist. It&#x27;s a bit on the pricy side, but it&#x27;s still less to buy this product from Amazon and pay for shipping (it&#x27;s not Prime eligible).</li>
            <li> I really love this product! The smell is fantastic and it makes my hair feel wonderful!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when the product I received did not contain the same ingredients that are listed in the description.</li>
            <li> I probably would have never bought a product that had &#x27;oil&#x27; in it&#x27;s name out of fear of making my hair look greasy.  That being said, I&#x27;m so glad my hairstylist started using this on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very coarse, thick (I&#x27;m of Sicilian decent to give an idea of texture) and has never had a &#x27;shine&#x27; that, thanks to Pantene&#x27;s Pro-V commericals, one associates with healthy pretty hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is light and gives my hair shine without making it look greasy, though there is a limit a pump or two too many can make it look that way so find your balance.  My hair is much softer, I&#x27;ve just gotten in the habit of always spraying a few pumps on after every shower and brushing it through.  I use it as a pre-styling tool, comb it through and then add a product since this doesn&#x27;t hold.</li>
            <li> This product effectively tames and smooths hir that tends to be frizzy and to grow big in humid conditions. I love it!</li>
            <li> Lovely.  Weightless. Not a permanent fix, however.</li>
            <li> I spray this on the highlighted areas of my hair to give that area a little more hydration, but it also add the shine !</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It makes my hair feel so soft and healthy, and I swear its helping it grow faster!</li>
            <li> I love how lightweight this oil is and how it offers shine and control without any stickiness. This is a great alternative to the other products I use.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is really thin and dry at the ends.  I have always had fly-aways and the ends were never smooth and silky.  Most shine sprays weigh my hair down and make it feel greasy and gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very light. The sprayer dispenses a very fine mist which does not coat your hair too much.  My hair is smooth and shiny after using it.  It has a pleasant scent, and the results last all day.  (Still go easy, you can spray too much and end up with greasy looking hair!)  A little bit goes a long way, so the bottle lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it before blowdrying or after, great results either way, though I prefer to use it on dry hair so I can tell how much I sprayed on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair does seem a bit more static with this, but it&#x27;s not enough to make me not love the stuff.</li>
            <li> great product. helps keeps my hair moisturized, and static and frizz free without making my hair oily. also smells great.</li>
            <li> love this!! doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily.</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally wavy, color treated hair that is prone to frizziness. My stylist has used this on me and thought I&#x27;d try it. It provided immediate shine, tamed the frizz, and makes my hair feel soft without any greasy residue. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Great product-luv the whole alterna line</li>
            <li> I have purchased Kendi in concentrated drops and in mist form. After washing my hair I could mist or apply by hand and my comb would go thru my hair like silk. With this formula, it has a sticky feeling and leaves the hair feeling tacky. The liquid doesnt even look like what I have had in the past. Very dissapointed in quality.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! My hair had a dye job go wrong that took quite a bit to fix and left it looking dry and dull, and this Kendi Oil shined it right back up and made it look sooo healthy! Got to be careful not to use too much though, as it will look greasy if you overdo it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves it soft and smooth and shiny. Will buy again!!!</li>
            <li> I used the Alterna products in the past and for some reason my hairdresser changed products and so did I.  I decided to go back to Alterna and very impressed.  I&#x27;ve aged and my hair has gotten thinner but I still use a flat iron to smooth my hair out. The product I was using started to look heavy and oily on my thinner hair.  The Bamboo Smooth is a Dry Oil, takes less and my hair looks great.  The Alterna products have brought back a more youthful look to my hair and I don&#x27;t need to use the flat iron nearly as often or carry it with me on damp days.</li>
            <li> Kendi Oil dry oil mist has made my hair softer, shinier and tames the mild frizziness. Since I started using it, I get lots more compliments on how shiny and healthy my hair looks. One tip---don&#x27;t use it too close to the scalp as it may make your hair look weighed down and oily. If you use it about 3-4 inches down and below, you&#x27;ll love the results!</li>
            <li> Absolutely great product.  Makes your hair really soft, but adds NO WEIGHT at all, nor do you get the &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look that many products like this can give.  I use it almost every day, just a few spritzes on wet hair.  It works well on dry hair, too.  It&#x27;s especially good on gray / graying hair, to keep it from becoming flyaway and nasty-looking.  Highly recommended, and a little goes a long way - one of these bottles lasts me about 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> Greasy and doesn&#x27;t do much for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> Love! Love! Love! Will re-order!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It makes my hair so soft and shiny, without being greasy or weighing it down. It smells divine, and works great on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> This product tames the frizz, smells great and adds the perfect amount of shine. My hair is lights and I tend to get random strays frizzing up, this spray helps eliminate the frizz.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I have fine hair that does the &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34; thing - this smooths all that out and makes my hair literally feel like silk!</li>
            <li> I like the feel after I spray on my wet or dry hair, not to heavy of a feeling, smooth, I will buy again. Not a heavy scent.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product I have ever used! I have fine and dry hair, this makes it really easy for my to manage my hair after each wash and it prevents hair from falling out. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Dry hair? Want long hair? Buy this! I love the Kendi dry oil mist so much that I buy two bottles at a time! I spray it on my hair before I blow it dry and again after and I get so many compliments on my shiny wavy hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I use a lot of hot tools on my hair and I noticed my hair getting dry...&lt;br /&gt;I saw reviews not only on amazon, but other beauty sites as well. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but I thought maybe it would be worth it. For me it wasn&#x27;t really because I find it to be a one dimensional product...as in I can only use this as a heat protectant when I&#x27;m using a hair straightener or blow dryer. When I try to use my curling iron with this product....it&#x27;s a disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do still use the product when I want straight hair and it works really well. Leaves it&#x27;s smelling great, smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It keeps my waves from being frizzy or weighed down.  It isn&#x27;t greasy.  I live in the desert and travel back east often, and it does great in both climates.  My hair is thin and it makes it look great and soft.</li>
            <li> the Kendi Oil makes my all gray hair shine.  I have to put it on when the hair is wet to really work.  the Amazon price is much less than my hairdresser charges.</li>
            <li> Good product.. Fast delivery</li>
            <li> My hair is long and dry, resulting in all sorts of other hair problems.  I&#x27;ve been using the Alterna Bamboo Shine products, so decided to try their Dry Oil Mist.  First, I concentrated on my dry ends only, then on the rest of my hair, then I worked the product into my scalp.  What at difference!  My hair is easier to comb, looks healthier, has a bounce to it and mostly, it feels healthier! This is a keeper and definitely a repeat purchase.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent oil and it smells really good. It does not weigh your hair down.  Hair is shiny once it is applied.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would really help my dry damaged hair but all I think it does is smooth hair out and prevent fly always. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again. Going to dry argan oil for my dry damaged hair</li>
            <li> I like this line&#x27;s fragrance. Whatever it is, it smells like a great clean, fresh fragrance. Not too much. I wish it were a body spray! Works well on my hair. I tried the shine stuff (green bottle) and this one is way better, more shine. I would continue to use this. It made my hair really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> What I like about this dry oil mist is that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily, but does provide moisture.  Leaves my hair more manageable and with great shine.</li>
            <li> Love this product more than any hair product i&#x27;ve ever used. Use it morning and night to keep the flyaways tamed. Doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing! My ends start getting dried out after a couple days of not washing it and my hair just soaks this up and I love to put it on whenever I can!</li>
            <li> I got a sample with my alterna shampoo and love it. The larger size I bought here was cheaper than buying in a salon and the best part- the box was stuffed with free samples of other beauty products! Reminded me of getting a box from saphora</li>
            <li> This made my hair look like straw.  The oil is wonderful!  Going back to that.  Should not have tried this instead.  Get the oil!!!</li>
            <li> This is literally a life saver. Alright, maybe not literally but it makes my hair SO much more manageable. My hair gets really frizzy, and I mean REALLY frizzy. I work outside constantly in the summer and by midday, my hair is usually a ball of frizz. After I started using this (spray a little in my hair when it&#x27;s wet before I dry it and a little after), my hair did a 180. The women at worked noticed and started asking what I did differently to it. It was a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read the other reviews about the silicones and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it yet and I&#x27;m almost out of my first bottle. Just make sure this is right for you.</li>
            <li> I saw this spray recommended on a food blog and decided to try.  My hair is very thick and straight but can get frizzy.  I love this spray and use mostly every day to keep my flyaways tame and my hair smooth - smells nice too!</li>
            <li> I love it. I&#x27;ve tried similar products but they were heavy and made my hair oily. This is light and makes my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I expected -- and for a cheaper price than I would&#x27;ve paid at a store!</li>
            <li> It smells good and smooths the hair. Not sure if it should shine the hair. If so it doesn&#x27;t happen on my hair.  I use it on dry, half dry and wet hair. The best result for me is applying on half dry hair + warm low drying mode.</li>
            <li> this is the best dry hair oil EVER. I spray it on after I&#x27;ve styled my hair and it adds a great shine without looking oily. I recommend for all hair types</li>
            <li> I love this...a little bit goes a long way and I think it smells good too.  I don&#x27;t think it helps if the damage is already there; but for me it helped prevent flat iron damage.</li>
            <li> The best dry or wet hair moisturizer and i love it!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used this on me once and Inwas hooked. It doesn&#x27;t require much, and does a good job (I think) of protecting my hair!</li>
            <li> This goes great with the Bamboo Alterna Shampoo and Conditioner! My favorite is the Volume Shampoo because i have found it smells the best! The Kendi Oil will NOT leave your hair feeling greasy, just smooth with a shine and protects from heat!</li>
            <li> this product is very helpful - my hair finally doesnt look frizzed and blown out - the product keeps it calm and in line all day</li>
            <li> Never recommend to any person dry my hair I feud report I just hater bad product I want my money back never recommend</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT~MY 3RD REORDER~GREAT PRICE TOO!&lt;br /&gt;~BEST DEFENSE AGAINST HOT NYC APARTMENTS IN THE WINTER THAT DRY EVERYTHING OUT!</li>
            <li> Keeps hair silky smoothe, but spray in hands first then smoothe out so your hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy</li>
            <li> Completely non greasy, but detangles nicely.</li>
            <li> I love this for my hair.  Tmes frizzies and makes it shine like crazy.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this spray! Works great for taming my poufy hair a bit, and keeping my style fresh even in humidity! I also use it on wet hair as a detangler. Love love love!</li>
            <li> This product helps make my hair feel softer and smoother and gives it a nice shine.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an oil without a very heavy weight and scent, I would recommend this product.  I am now on my fourth bottle.  A little goes a long way.  I usually spray it into my hands and pass them over my hair.  Works well to keep my flat ironed hair smooth in a moisture heavy situation. My hair has less breakage now with it.</li>
            <li> Love it &amp; the smell is great.</li>
            <li> Loving this product for a couple of weeks now.  It gives my hair a healthy shine that it was lacking, without weighing it down or looking greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer argan oil or the loreal shine mist over this. It has an odd smell and BURNS when it hits my scalp. Not nice at all. It makes hair shiny but doesn&#x27;t feel any better. For something thats paraben, chemical etc etc free it doesn&#x27;t seem right. To me it seems as though it&#x27;s full of chemicals due to its odd smell and burning sensation upon skin contact. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever buy this again.</li>
            <li> I wish I had pictures of my hair before and after using this kendi oil dry oil mist!  My hair was frizzy, dry, damaged and when I use the kendi oil mist it becomes smooth, soft, healthy-looking.  I know, how could one product do ALL that?  I honestly don&#x27;t know.  I have tried monoi oil, argan oil, macademia oil, and every conditioner I could find (drug store brands and much more expensive brands!  I have a hypothyroid so my hair is in horrible shape right now, but with this oil it makes my hair so soft and smooth.  This is light and does not weigh down my fine hair.  I was also looking for something that does not animal test--and apparently they do not.  This is a MUST HAVE for me for now on!</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair and somehow when I add this after the shower it makes it shiny and smooth without being greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> i love this product and use it every day. My hairdresser used it on me and said it would help my hair dry faster, and it does. It is so lightweight that you don&#x27;t know there is any sort of product on your hair. It helps with smoothness and adds shine too. When I finish a bottle, I promptly buy another.</li>
            <li> Exceptional shine and frizz control!  Not greasy... I have received compliments on my hair being healthy looking when using this product.</li>
            <li> Love this Bamboo Kendi oil mist. I use it every morning to give a  finishing touch to my hair. Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I have really dry, coarse hair and this product helps so much. It smells amazing and a little goes a long way! My hair seems to be stronger and has grown more quickly since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave hair oily like other oil products</li>
            <li> Had to purchase this due to great reviews.  I am absolutely loving this product.  I have purchased oh-so-many hair products.  This one I WILL re-order.  It does things that other oils/protectants don&#x27;t do (at least with my experiences with soooo many products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very fine mist makes it so easy to use without going overboard.  It smells nice (but I don&#x27;t think the fragrance lasts very long - I wish it would tho)!  It provides shine and it provides a weightless, very soft, healthy feel to the hair.  I have medium type hair - not super thin, and it&#x27;s pretty course hair - NOT luxuriously soft &amp; silky.  So I definitely need something to help with sheen, softness and &amp;#34;movement&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does everything I need.  I&#x27;ve not found a product like this before... It really does produce shiny, healthy hair that moves freely in a beautiful way...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spray it on, generously, through towel-dried hair before I gently comb (or brush) it out.  I put one little &amp;#34;spritz&amp;#34; on top of head, and more mist throughout rest of hair.  Then comb it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I do use a flat iron, and I do blow-dry my hair after about 10 minutes to let it dry a little bit first.  I never blowdry until it&#x27;s completely dry - too damaging to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spray a little bit more before I use flat iron, and sometimes spray a little throughout,  during the day (cuz I love the fragrance and love the healthy shine).  Unlike other &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; products, this does NOT make my hair oily or greasy looking - and definitely NOT a tacky feel at all!  It just creates a healthy, light feeling to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.  More than any other product, and I&#x27;ve tried a ton of them.</li>
            <li> i was not impressed with this product. just made my hair greasy but didn&#x27;t really stop the fly- aways. i have short hair. maybe it would be better with long hair</li>
            <li> A bit of a learning curve so hair doesn&#x27;t seem greasy or so shiny it looks unnatural. Very frizzy hair could use a serum and this as a finishing touch but for soft, finer hair that tends to frizz, it works well.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been natural for 2 yrs &amp; counting. So far I&#x27;ve only blow dried my hair about 5 times in these 2 yrs. I find that I love my hair blow dried but don&#x27;t want to add heat to it. I washed my hair 3 days ago &amp; had a leave in conditioner &amp; styled it. The next day, MY HAIR WAS SOOOO DRYYY and I hated my twist out! So I decided to lightly spritz my hair with water, I applied RAW Shea Butter to my hair, combed it with a wide tooth comb then sprayed this dry oil on it &amp; used my paddle brush to get it all over my hair (4 sprays on each section). The next morning I kid you not, my hair is shiny, soft, manageable, looks blow dried, &amp; no frizzies! I&#x27;ll never have to blow dry my hair again &amp; that&#x27;s an added plus fr me! I LOVE the results of this product. Mind you, I did a mid sized flat twists all over my head &amp; at the ends I put bantu knots aka Chini Bumps at the ends of the twist &amp; covered it (after trimming my ends too). The next morning my hair was light &amp; fluffy &amp; had such a bounce &amp; shine. NO kidding. This is a must-buy!</li>
            <li> This product is light and great for dry, curly hair.  I actually use it as an eye makeup remover.  It easily cleans off eye makeup and moisturizes lashes.  It is super light and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.  This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for removing mascara, eyeliner, etc.</li>
            <li> Been using Wen hair products but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be nourishing my gray hair to my satisfaction. I started using this; after shampooing, before styling or drying, and it does seem to be improving the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> this spray is incredible. i sprayed it on my dry hair just to see what it would do, because i had just gotten ome from work and was excited and anxious to try it out. it makes your hair so much shinier than any drug store brand serum/antifrizz spray. i got a little over zealous and sprayed it all over my dry hair, and honestly, my hair still looks amazing. it separated my layers and defined them. my hair is extremely fine and boring and since i&#x27;ve been highlighting it since the dawn of time, it can definitely use a boost. i am really happy that i bought this spray and i will be using it as long as they make it. and yes, it smells divine!! go for it!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use Phyto and Philip B shampoos and conditioners, and this product is great to use after blow drying and setting a wavy style. I like a lot of bounce, volume, and shine...and Alterna Bamboo Dry Oil gives me that extra bit of shine...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Shipped quickly, arrived early and attention to wrapping much appreciated!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE THIS STUFF!  I can&#x27;t recommend it enough!  Please try it, if you&#x27;re looking for a good dry oil for your hair!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It makes my dry over processed hair look shiny and healthy.  Also, I don&#x27;t worry about it looking greasy with this product.  Only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Ive been buying this for a while, I have ethnic curly hispanic hair and this seems to do the trick. It leaves my hair very smooth and non-oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been used it more than 2 years,</li>
            <li> great product.  Smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy and gets rid of that flyaway,  split end look in your hair.  I highly recommend this!  I could not believe the fact that this stuff didn&#x27;t look oily or greasy either!  Amazing!</li>
            <li> It really helps if you&#x27;ve had a perm or your hair is dry.</li>
            <li> Helped me control hair without feeling or looking oily. I highly recommend this product, it is cheap and does everything that I needed.</li>
            <li> Just purchased this and I think it smells amazing and works well with my hair. My hair is normally on the dry side and it helped a lot. I love this product and will definitley buy the bigger bottle once this one runs out.</li>
            <li> Love love love this spray! It smells great and completely fights frizz on those humid days!</li>
            <li> I have tried many products to make my hair shiny and healthy looking--all products have made my hair greasy-looking at best, but the Kendi Oil is super!  Makes my hair soft and lustrous, easy to use, smells divine.  I spray it on my hair when wet, then style as usual.  I have also used it on dry hair with good results, but prefer how my hair looks when sprayed on wet, then styled.  I sometimes use it in place of conditioner--my hair looks great used this way, too.  Definitely one of the best hair products I have ever used!  Will definitely be using it regularly from now on.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the ingredients listed, but they are incorrect.  This product is pretty much a bottle of silicone with a few dabs of oil.  If you don&#x27;t use silicones, stay away from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The accurate ingredient listing is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Dimethiconol, Bambusa Vulgaris (Bamboo) Extract (Bamboo), Bambusa Vulgaris (Bamboo) Water, Fennel (Foeniculum Vulgare) Seed Extract (Fennel), Saccharomyces Lysate Extract, Algae (Seaweed) Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract (Carrot), Wasabia Japonica (Wasabi) Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (Jojoba), Mauritia Flexuosa Fruit Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat Germ) Oil (Wheat), Aleurites Moluccana (Kukui Nut) Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil (Olive), Persea Gratissima Oil (Avocado), Passiflora Edulis Seed Oil, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E), Glycerin, Superoxide Dismutase, Saccharomyces Zinc Ferment, Saccharomyces Copper Ferment Extract, Lactoferrin, Phospholipids, Phytosphingosine, Corn Oligosaccharides, Ganoderma Lucidum Tyrosinase (Mushroom), Lentinus Edodes Tyrosinase, Retinyl Acetate (Vitamin A), Copper Lysl Oxidase, Acetyl Methionone, Acetyl Serine, Amino Acyl tRNA Synthetase, Glycine Soja Seed Peroxidase (Soybean), Silanetriol Melaninate, Polyquaternium 10, Bromelain, Papain, Water (Aqua), Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance (Parfum), Citronellol, Butylphenyl Methlyproprional, Limonene, Linalool</li>
            <li> I was ready to chop off my hair and this product saved it! I admit, I straigthen my hair daily and the ends were looking terrible. I spray a little on my hair, mid shaft and to the ends before I blow dry. Then a little more on the ends before I straighten it. Looks amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but see a dramatic difference in my hair already. It was so dry and frizzy and now it&#x27;s soft and managable. LOVE it so much already!</li>
            <li> This is now a staple in my hair care routine. It detangles as well as works as a heat protectant. Smells great and does not leave your hair looking oily.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, esp. when you put it directly on wet hair. I use it on dry hair as well, and if it&#x27;s really humid out, I&#x27;ll have to use it a number of times.</li>
            <li> Way cheaper than the $23 some odd dollars from Sephora!  Love this product.  You can spray it on dry hair.  Pleasant scent.  Organix Coconut spray...doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to this Kendi Oil!</li>
            <li> I have slick straight Asian hair that is oily at the roots but can get dry at the ends, especially with blow drying and swimming in chlorinated pools.  This oil so lightweight that I can go a couple of days without washing my hair and it doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy.  My hair is softer and silkier than ever!  This is my new favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> First time using this product .had read so many good reviews that I decided to order it. Wow this was one of my best hair purchases really works great on my hair have used other oils and none compare to this is not heavy and does not leave my hair greasy like others I have used and really is smooth ,shinny and no frizz .love this product and glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is a very inexpensive to great looking hair. It requires no time and it fixes all summer and treated hair issues.</li>
            <li> Love this product - takes care of all my frizz and flyaways after I wash my hair .  The customer service was so prompt at getting out the product  and so congenial when contacted.</li>
            <li> I love this product - i use it after I shower, and sometimes in the morning prior to using the curling iron. I have thin, fine, colored hair.  This product has helped my hair stay soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Love the way this oil works on my hair and how smooth my hair becomes. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> smells wonderful!  Plus it makes my hair feel like new hair!</li>
            <li> I bought it since my friend uses it before straightening her hair and I loved the fragrance. It somehow leaves these white flakes and initially I thought that I have a new problem w dandruff now. but thats not the case, my scalp is clean and the days I don&#x27;t apply Kendi oil its flakeless. So my conclusion was it definitely dries up , not sure if its the winter/cold weather causing it. Anyhow I  seldom use this oil now. Won&#x27;t discourage anyone to buy and try it since you may not necessarily encounter the same problem.</li>
            <li> I have curly and frizzy hair and this is the best thing I&#x27;ve found to smooth the frizz after drying without making my hair look oily.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel like silk! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again. My only complaint is I went through it too fast lol!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li> So far, I am liking this product.  I&#x27;m a big fan of Alterna Caviar shampoo/conditioner, but didn&#x27;t really like the Bamboo shampoo/conditioner.  However, I decided to give this a try and so far am happy.  I have used it on damp and dry hair.  It is light weight but does seem to help smooth my crazy hair.  I think if you used too much it could become heavy.</li>
            <li> Great product! Love it. My hair feels and looks great. The price is great as well! Will buy this again!</li>
            <li> Love it, its a great conditioning spray for the hair and don&#x27;t leave the hair oily. My hair stylist recommended it and I love it. I am black and have natural hair also so it works perfect on black hair types.</li>
