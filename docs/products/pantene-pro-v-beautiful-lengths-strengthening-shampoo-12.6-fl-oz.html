            <li>hope this doesn&#x27;t sound like a review from the company selling it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always use this shampoo and conditioner; it costs a bit more but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>as expected, weight, delivery time, price&lt;br /&gt;also quality  is perfect, unfortunately not for my hair because of my mistake it doesn&#x27;t fit for me</li>
            <li>This shampoo has been working great for my extremely long hair.</li>
            <li>I use to use this when it originally came out and couldn&#x27;t remember why I stopped using it.....</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t even buy it on Amazon, but was so excited about it that I came on Amazon and am writing this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lathers well, rinses clean, and leaves no residue on your hair.</li>
            <li>Suprisingly my hair did not dry out but still did not have good moisture.</li>
            <li>hair looks fresh, clean, healthy, and just the right shine.</li>
            <li>I really want to love it and was excited to use it when it arrived.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair so soft and shiny and really smells amazing!  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and makes my hair soft</li>
            <li>I prefer the clear kind.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much !!!!</li>
            <li>I will be happy to make this shampoo a regular in my routine if the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Nice subtle scent, nice lather, cleans pretty well but is more moisturizing than cleansing</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel silky smooth, and very shiny.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s one of the rare shampoos in which I don&#x27;t need a conditioner after shampooing -</li>
            <li>Keeps our hair silky smooth and so far has kept the split ends away.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair with the shampoo first and then massage the conditioner onto my hair evenly.</li>
            <li>Co-worker w very long beautiful hair recommended it highly &amp; I have been using several months now.</li>
            <li>I love how it now has a formula for long hair.</li>
            <li>But it made my hair so greasy at the top and dry at the ends.</li>
            <li>This was thrown unwrapped in a box with another heavy product on top of it!  </li>
            <li>Traditionally,  I only use sulfate free shampoo</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li>and I really think this has strengthened my hair and reduced the amount of hair falling out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much money</li>
            <li>and it smells really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like how my hair feels and smells.</li>
            <li>Am going to be letting her know how much I appreciate her telling me about it.</li>
            <li>It smells great and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>Luckily I had a different shampoo on hand to re-wash my hair, and it got rid of the residue.  </li>
            <li>Then wash it off with cold water sometime, but most of the time I use warm water.</li>
            <li>I normally use salon brands for all drugstore dries me out.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works better on dry hair, I have normal to oily hair so definitely not for me.</li>
            <li>My daughter has super long hair and loves it.</li>
            <li>This product surprised me how well it worked!  </li>
            <li>Works well, it&#x27;s a bit heavy on my fine hair</li>
            <li>If you are on a budget then this will do but If you really want repaired soft hair use matrix total results repair or redken diamond oil</li>
            <li>hair is SO SOFT</li>
            <li>I normally get pantene classic but thought I&#x27;d try this because I have long hair.</li>
            <li>so I would recommend this more for thick or curly hair than thin fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine thin some what dry wavy hair.</li>

            <li> If you are on a budget then this will do but If you really want repaired soft hair use matrix total results repair or redken diamond oil</li>
            <li> hair is SO SOFT</li>
            <li> I normally get pantene classic but thought I&#x27;d try this because I have long hair.</li>
            <li> so I would recommend this more for thick or curly hair than thin fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin some what dry wavy hair.</li>
            <li> the last few years, I&#x27;ve sworn by Tresemme, and just bought this kind randomly &#x27;cause it was on sale.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter has long unmanageable hair at times, with the price I use this shampoo sparingly,only a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> I definitely do not recommend this line of Pantene, although I&#x27;ve used their other lines with no problems.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair &amp; it seemed like the longer</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> This is what my wife uses an her hair almost touches the ground an it works very well for her long thick hair!</li>
            <li> My hair is thick shiny and very soft.</li>
            <li> I have straight un-treated hair that is hardly ever styled or blow dried, so I&#x27;m not particularly picky about what type of shampoo or conditioner I use.  </li>
            <li> and I tend to loose hair this shampoo helps with that too!</li>
            <li> I &#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about 4 months now and prior to that I would have trouble growing my hair.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not, my hair does not look clean afterwards and it feels dirty too.</li>
            <li> I feel cheated of the money to buy this, plus the time I had to spend rinsing off my other items.  </li>
            <li> Once again Pantene has not let me down</li>
            <li> Half the bottle spilled all over the other items I purchased--and now I have a half a bottle of shampoo!  </li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair</li>
            <li> Works well on my lifeless, limp hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use this everyday</li>
            <li> For my hair type this product is too heavy and bulky.</li>
            <li> However, like some other reviewers have stated, this stuff leaves a heavy residue in my hair that I&#x27;ve never experienced with any other shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Very poor packed when I received it was open and half way finished</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and call me crazy-</li>
            <li> So disappointing and now I have to find something to help my hair grow back.</li>
            <li> NOT GOOD!</li>
            <li> And my hair feels completely dirty all the time.  </li>
            <li> Bad formula - it makes my hair greasy.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great shampoo. Love Pantene.</li>
            <li> works great, smells good, everything what Id expect from Pantene.</li>
            <li> Does a great job at a great price.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has been working great for my extremely long hair. It keeps my hair looking health and having a nice shine to it without looking greasy. It&#x27;s a clear shampoo and smells delightful! Works well on my lifeless, limp hair.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo!! Love the way my hair feels!</li>
            <li> Once again Pantene has not let me down I feel cleaner, fresher and leaves my hair feeling just as good :) #1 Brand in my eyes !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Pantene products because of the way they make my hair feel; however I&#x27;ve heard that you should not use this on a continuing basis because of something in the ingredients causes buildup in your hair.  I just keep it in my rotation because it really is a great shampoo.</li>
            <li> Pantene Pro-V Beautiful Lengths shampoo is very high quality, as are all Pantene products I&#x27;ve ever used. It has a nice fragrance, lathers well, and rinses out easily. It makes my hair feel silky smooth, and very shiny. I will be happy to make this shampoo a regular in my routine if the price is reasonable. I received this bottle at a discount, to make a review, this did not affect my review. My opinions are my own, and I really like this&lt;br /&gt;Pantene Pro-V Beautiful Lengths shampoo. It is on my shopping list, along with the matching conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great price. Excellent product. I personally think it works to grow my hair but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair shiny. I still recommend</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft and it smells wonderful.  Hubby is always commenting about my hair smelling so good.</li>
            <li> smells great and leaves my hair feeling amazing!</li>
            <li> I totally love Pantene!  I have very long hair &amp; it seemed like the longer it got the weaker &amp; more split ends I had.  I have been using this for a few weeks now &amp; I have noticed great improvement in my hair!  It looks healthy!</li>
            <li> After thyroid cancer surgery and radiation my hair became brittle and a lot fell out. Bought the shampoo &amp; conditioner which noticeably helped!</li>
            <li> We always like keeping this on hand so we never run out.  Keeps our hair silky smooth and so far has kept the split ends away.</li>
            <li> its so cheap that I cant image. good stuff. but the effect to my hair is just so so,perhaps it is not the best one for asia people.</li>
            <li> Bad formula - it makes my hair greasy. I normally get pantene classic but thought I&#x27;d try this because I have long hair. I guess I&#x27;m switching back.</li>
            <li> the product was ok, my wife don&#x27;t use a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I have straight un-treated hair that is hardly ever styled or blow dried, so I&#x27;m not particularly picky about what type of shampoo or conditioner I use.  However, like some other reviewers have stated, this stuff leaves a heavy residue in my hair that I&#x27;ve never experienced with any other shampoo.  Luckily I had a different shampoo on hand to re-wash my hair, and it got rid of the residue.  I definitely do not recommend this line of Pantene, although I&#x27;ve used their other lines with no problems.  I give the shampoo 2 stars because I really love the scent of this particular line, and I like that they support the Beautiful Lengths program.</li>
            <li> Great brand and great shampoo</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so soft and smooth. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love pantene shampoo it smells so good and leaves my hair smelling good for over a day</li>
            <li> Pantene is an amazing brand, this shampoo is the best and does exactly what it says, &amp; it smells amazing! I have an anxiety issue, making me so thankful for AMAZON and sellers that ship must-haves to my home!</li>
            <li> I been using Pantene since I was a teenager. But I absolutely love this shampoo &amp; conditioner! They make my hair look shiny and healthy and feel silky!! Also, it smells great!  I wash my hair with the shampoo first and then massage the conditioner onto my hair evenly. Then I leave it soak about 3-5 minutes. Then wash it off with cold water sometime, but most of the time I use warm water. I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> One of the better shampoos I have used, it is not for fighting dandruff, but it will leave your hair feeling smooth after use.</li>
            <li> This was thrown unwrapped in a box with another heavy product on top of it!  Half the bottle spilled all over the other items I purchased--and now I have a half a bottle of shampoo!  I feel cheated of the money to buy this, plus the time I had to spend rinsing off my other items.  NOT GOOD!</li>
            <li> Traditionally,  I only use sulfate free shampoo but I needed some in a pinch. There was a coupon that made it under a dollar so I broke the rules! I am impressed at how soft my hair was and the smell. I didn&#x27;t even have to condition it.</li>
            <li> Great product and price !!</li>
            <li> I &#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about 4 months now and prior to that I would have trouble growing my hair. I am really happy with the results</li>
            <li> Hair is so much better</li>
            <li> Recommend! And good price!</li>
            <li> Great smell, works well.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo, nothing to dislike about it.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for am honest and unbiased review</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite shampoo since i was a child. I love how it now has a formula for long hair. It smells great doesnt leave your hair oily. My hair is thick shiny and very soft.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and great price.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite shampoo!!! It makes my hair feel so fresh and clean!! Love love love it! Highly recommend it to everyone! I have long and thick hair and I tend to loose hair this shampoo helps with that too! If your considering buying you should!</li>
            <li> This is a nice inexpensive way to clean my hair. It smells nice and makes my hair soft</li>
            <li> Love the smell, leaves my hair clean and light</li>
            <li> I use to use this when it originally came out and couldn&#x27;t remember why I stopped using it.....WELL, no I remember.  It makes my hair FALL OUT!!!!!!!  And my hair feels completely dirty all the time.  So disappointing and now I have to find something to help my hair grow back.</li>
            <li> I really want to love it and was excited to use it when it arrived. But it made my hair so greasy at the top and dry at the ends. Initially I thought maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not used to it or something but it&#x27;s not, my hair does not look clean afterwards and it feels dirty too. Maybe it works better on dry hair, I have normal to oily hair so definitely not for me.</li>
            <li> Works well, it&#x27;s a bit heavy on my fine hair but overall I like it.</li>
            <li> Really great shampoo! Hair has felt healthier since starting use.</li>
            <li> This product surprised me how well it worked!  I have been constantly losing my hair and I really think this has strengthened my hair and reduced the amount of hair falling out. Plus it&#x27;s one of the rare shampoos in which I don&#x27;t need a conditioner after shampooing - it leaves my hair smooth and silky as is. I received this at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo! It makes your hair so soft and shiny and really smells amazing!  It lathers well, rinses clean, and leaves no residue on your hair. But the nice thing is I also don&#x27;t have flyaways. It smooths your hair and makes it behave. I have oily, stick straight color-treated hair and it works great for me!</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great and really does help straighten my wavy hair. It smells great and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> my hair is a bit thicker stronger and the shampoo is soothing to my scalp but I don&#x27;t use this everyday and I also use tresemme shampoo and conditioner once a week</li>
            <li> Pantene is hands down the best shampoo for the price. Love this stuff. Nice subtle scent, nice lather, cleans pretty well but is more moisturizing than cleansing so I would recommend this more for thick or curly hair than thin fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is what my wife uses an her hair almost touches the ground an it works very well for her long thick hair!</li>
            <li> Personally didn&#x27;t help me, but smells great.</li>
            <li> Wow awesome shipping! Works and smells great. Will be buying again when I see another coupon! I don&#x27;t have much money so the coupons help a ton! Thanks so much !!!!</li>
            <li> If you have the money to purchase, it doesn&#x27;t hurt to give this shampoo a try.  My daughter has long unmanageable hair at times, with the price I use this shampoo sparingly,only a couple times a week. A little goes a long way, and call me crazy- but it&#x27;s quality is better than original Pantene :-) hair looks fresh, clean, healthy, and just the right shine.</li>
            <li> Works well and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> excellent product. my hair used to be breaking alot but since using this product it have shown a vast inprovement.</li>
            <li> Prefect exactly what I needed great shipping timing excellent.</li>
            <li> size is good, price was perfect,&lt;br /&gt;all as expected, weight, delivery time, price&lt;br /&gt;also quality  is perfect, unfortunately not for my hair because of my mistake it doesn&#x27;t fit for me but for my mother is OK :)</li>
            <li> I do love Pantene products but myself personally I can&#x27;t use this shampoo every day...it makes my hair more oily if that makes since but other wise great shampoo.</li>
            <li> smells nice..cleans well</li>
            <li> Holy crap, this is great shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even buy it on Amazon, but was so excited about it that I came on Amazon and am writing this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last few years, I&#x27;ve sworn by Tresemme, and just bought this kind randomly &#x27;cause it was on sale.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is SO SOFT and it smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this doesn&#x27;t sound like a review from the company selling it.&lt;br /&gt;Serioulsy, though, this is awesome stuff.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this product!</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and tons of it. For my hair type this product is too heavy and bulky. I&#x27;m not a fan of &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; shampoos. I prefer the clear kind. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Under $4. Good value good product</li>
            <li> I normally use salon brands for all drugstore dries me out. This was an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; shampoo but it is noticeably of lesser quality then Redken...etc..  Suprisingly my hair did not dry out but still did not have good moisture. If you are on a budget then this will do but If you really want repaired soft hair use matrix total results repair or redken diamond oil</li>
            <li> biggest fan of pantene love it</li>
            <li> love this shampoo gota get the conditinor to go with it</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin some what dry wavy hair. I really like how my hair feels and smells. My husband can&#x27;t stop hugging me to smell my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this brand works great in my hair and smells amazing after!</li>
            <li> Love pantene great scent fast shipping</li>
            <li> I always use this shampoo and conditioner; it costs a bit more but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Love it. Made my hair feel great.</li>
            <li> This works and smells wonderful. I would definately reccomend this purchase.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great. My daughter has super long hair and loves it.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Co-worker w very long beautiful hair recommended it highly &amp; I have been using several months now. Am going to be letting her know how much I appreciate her telling me about it. I also use organic tamanu oil from an amazon seller for my face &amp; skin &amp; hair...</li>
            <li> Very poor packed when I received it was open and half way finished</li>
