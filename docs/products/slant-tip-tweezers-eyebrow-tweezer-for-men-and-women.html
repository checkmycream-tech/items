            <li>Really plucks nicely!</li>
            <li>They look dainty but are the same length and grip eyebrow hair tighter than the Revlon, Trim &amp; LaCross pair I&#x27;ve used and found wanting.</li>
            <li>Very light weight for full size tweezers.</li>
            <li>They grab hair easily and don&#x27;t break follicles.  </li>
            <li>Easy to grasp and manipulate.</li>
            <li>They are easy to hold and grasp even the smallest hairs.</li>

            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to grip and hold hairs</li>
            <li>The Lezele tweezers pulled out a couple strong guys and did not break them.  </li>
            <li>Light weight easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am loving these tweezers the precision is amazing for getting those teeny tiny unwanted hairs with a minimum of pain.</li>
            <li>Meh ...... they are light weight</li>
            <li>The shape makes them really comfortable to grip for extended plucking sessions.</li>
            <li>- so tip really is important.</li>
            <li>They were precise.</li>
            <li>Precise tip.  </li>
            <li>it has a very good perfect edge and small enough to pinch the exact hair you wanted to.</li>
            <li>The quality seemed nice and high.</li>
            <li>This one is a good price, very sharp and effective.  </li>
            <li>They offer a unique design and are lightweight.</li>
            <li>making a perfect shape in eyebrow, I usually used eyebrow shaver not tweezers.</li>
            <li>Got this on a cheap cost and well worth it.</li>
            <li>These have THE perfect tip for tweezing small hairs off the brow!</li>
            <li>Seriously the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li>The service was quick.</li>
            <li>They looked very pretty.</li>
            <li>Great price, very sharp.</li>
            <li>Really like the grip on these and how easy they are to use</li>
            <li>this one first!</li>
            <li>This is my first tweezer in life, recommend!</li>
            <li>Very nice stuff, can be really precisely to grab any small hair.</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp and easily handleable.</li>
            <li>But, comparing side by side, this product not just sleek looking, it works even better than my old tweezer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally thrilled and definitely will recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I was amazed to be able to pluck a dozen errant hairs from my &#x27;old man eyebrows&#x27; in a minute or so.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about &amp;#34;the first time, every time&amp;#34; like the description says but they&#x27;re certainly not bad.</li>
            <li>High quality tweezer that does not warp easily.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to hold with no slipping like the metal tweezers and are precise.  </li>
            <li>The tweezers do have a good grip, however, they are so sharp they have pinched and cut me a couple of times.  </li>
            <li>These do work when you can get a hold of the hair just right, but it also breaks the hair off so you can&#x27;t get it removed.  </li>
            <li>Some of them just don&#x27;t work right</li>
            <li>These tweezers are just the right size.</li>
            <li>These are pretty amazing for something as simple as tweezers.  </li>
            <li>They work,  however they are uncomfortable to use as the slant works best on the right side with the right hand.</li>
            <li>A great, inexpensive pair of tweezers is hard to find.</li>
            <li>It was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t feel that it worked any better than my Tweezerman or even Revlon.</li>
            <li>First time, every time.</li>
            <li>Now this tweezers can do it really well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had may tweezers in my day, but I&#x27;ve never had a pair that could pull out the very finest hairs!  </li>
            <li>My eyebrows look great, and I won&#x27;t have to go for a waxing for at least another two weeks.  </li>
            <li>It is very helpful, although I use it to remove splinters and not eyebrows!</li>
            <li>This tip is pointed and really does what you tell it to do!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Go easy at first until you get used to how sharp and precise they are.</li>
            <li>Pretty decent tweezers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a good tweezer.</li>
            <li>the slanted tip - easily took care of the small, fine, hard-to-get hairs.</li>
            <li>It really is a &amp;#34;works every try&amp;#34</li>
            <li>but they didn&#x27;t seem to work very well.  </li>
            <li>These tweezers work very well.</li>
            <li>And they are packaged very well to ship</li>
            <li>very well</li>
            <li>I really recommend these.</li>
            <li>I like the sharpness of the tweezer and the quality that is very convenience to use and pu in my bag.</li>
            <li>These did not pluck anything straight out of the box.</li>
            <li>It is precise enough to even take splinters out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with cheap tweezers way too long .  </li>
            <li>Better than an average pair of tweezers, but they&#x27;re tweezers</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some darned expensive tweezers that were great, but no need to spend that much any longer.</li>
            <li>I am a wax specialist/licensed cosmetologist and when I actually used them I noticed they broke more hairs than they actually pulled.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these tweezers.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the extra 8 bucks.</li>
            <li>Work really well, I&#x27;ve been looking for good tweezers for a while, and these are the first ones that can grip very small hairs that are just starting to grow back.</li>
            <li>Very professional look.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>THANK YOU FOR NO MORE TEARS:)</li>
            <li>These really grip a hair, wider straight flat tip, you can apply pressure up handle</li>
            <li>However, for the price ($7.95 at time of purchase), it&#x27;s hard to find a better pair.</li>
            <li>It does, feel like you are nearly squeezing the sides together</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m getting old),</li>
            <li>so of course I went directly to Amazon and found these.  </li>
            <li>Barely pulls out hair anymore...don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li>They definitely stack up to some of the higher, more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>The only problem I find is that they are very sharp and you have to be careful not to pinch your eyelid/skin. :)</li>
            <li>It has a firm grip on hair and performs better that any other tweezers I have.</li>
            <li>Got these a few weeks ago after finally giving up on our cheap pairs from CVS that couldn&#x27;t get short eyebrow hairs.  </li>
            <li>Overall no real complaint.</li>
            <li>Nice angle to get difficult hairs.  </li>
            <li>I was so hopeful they are OK but not great</li>
            <li>I have been able to get at a hair that I was not able to grasp at with my other tweezers (grocery store), in about 1 or 2 goes.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty heavy (compare to the one i currently use) and it can&#x27;t catch hair on my face.</li>

            <li> It is sturdy, well-beveled, and fits nicely in the hand.</li>
            <li> Nice tweezers.</li>
            <li> Nice pair of tweezers</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s been perfect and very reliable.  </li>

            <li> These tweezers are very light weight and flexible.  </li>
            <li> but they are very light weight</li>
            <li> They find the fine hairs much better than my &amp;#34;fairly good&amp;#34; drugstore-brand tweezers, and they look nice too.  </li>
            <li> With these tweezers, I am able to get even the most stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> Love it~</li>
            <li> Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this.</li>
            <li> Much better than any pair you&#x27;d find at the dollar store or somewhere.</li>
            <li> This is the quickest and most efficient tweezer that I have ever purchased, and am pleased to recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Pleased with it.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Really plucks nicely!</li>
            <li> They look dainty but are the same length and grip eyebrow hair tighter than the Revlon, Trim &amp; LaCross pair I&#x27;ve used and found wanting.</li>
            <li> Very light weight for full size tweezers.</li>
            <li> They grab hair easily and don&#x27;t break follicles.  </li>
            <li> Easy to grasp and manipulate.</li>
            <li> They are easy to hold and grasp even the smallest hairs.</li>
            <li> The curve design makes the tweezers easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to grip and hold hairs</li>
            <li> The Lezele tweezers pulled out a couple strong guys and did not break them.  </li>
            <li> Light weight easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am loving these tweezers the precision is amazing for getting those teeny tiny unwanted hairs with a minimum of pain.</li>
            <li> Meh ...... they are light weight</li>
            <li> The shape makes them really comfortable to grip for extended plucking sessions.</li>
            <li> - so tip really is important.</li>
            <li> They were precise.</li>
            <li> Precise tip.  </li>
            <li> it has a very good perfect edge and small enough to pinch the exact hair you wanted to.</li>
            <li> The quality seemed nice and high.</li>
            <li> This one is a good price, very sharp and effective.  </li>
            <li> They offer a unique design and are lightweight.</li>
            <li> making a perfect shape in eyebrow, I usually used eyebrow shaver not tweezers.</li>
            <li> Got this on a cheap cost and well worth it.</li>
            <li> These have THE perfect tip for tweezing small hairs off the brow!</li>
            <li> Seriously the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> The service was quick.</li>
            <li> They looked very pretty.</li>
            <li> Great price, very sharp.</li>
            <li> Really like the grip on these and how easy they are to use</li>
            <li> this one first!</li>
            <li> This is my first tweezer in life, recommend!</li>
            <li> Very nice stuff, can be really precisely to grab any small hair.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp and easily handleable.</li>
            <li> But, comparing side by side, this product not just sleek looking, it works even better than my old tweezer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally thrilled and definitely will recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was amazed to be able to pluck a dozen errant hairs from my &#x27;old man eyebrows&#x27; in a minute or so.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about &amp;#34;the first time, every time&amp;#34; like the description says but they&#x27;re certainly not bad.</li>
            <li> High quality tweezer that does not warp easily.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to hold with no slipping like the metal tweezers and are precise.  </li>
            <li> The tweezers do have a good grip, however, they are so sharp they have pinched and cut me a couple of times.  </li>
            <li> These do work when you can get a hold of the hair just right, but it also breaks the hair off so you can&#x27;t get it removed.  </li>
            <li> Some of them just don&#x27;t work right</li>
            <li> These tweezers are just the right size.</li>
            <li> These are pretty amazing for something as simple as tweezers.  </li>
            <li> They work,  however they are uncomfortable to use as the slant works best on the right side with the right hand.</li>
            <li> A great, inexpensive pair of tweezers is hard to find.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t feel that it worked any better than my Tweezerman or even Revlon.</li>
            <li> First time, every time.</li>
            <li> Now this tweezers can do it really well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had may tweezers in my day, but I&#x27;ve never had a pair that could pull out the very finest hairs!  </li>
            <li> My eyebrows look great, and I won&#x27;t have to go for a waxing for at least another two weeks.  </li>
            <li> It is very helpful, although I use it to remove splinters and not eyebrows!</li>
            <li> This tip is pointed and really does what you tell it to do!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Go easy at first until you get used to how sharp and precise they are.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent tweezers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a good tweezer.</li>
            <li> the slanted tip - easily took care of the small, fine, hard-to-get hairs.</li>
            <li> It really is a &amp;#34;works every try&amp;#34</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t seem to work very well.  </li>
            <li> These tweezers work very well.</li>
            <li> And they are packaged very well to ship</li>
            <li> very well</li>
            <li> I really recommend these.</li>
            <li> I like the sharpness of the tweezer and the quality that is very convenience to use and pu in my bag.</li>
            <li> These did not pluck anything straight out of the box.</li>
            <li> It is precise enough to even take splinters out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with cheap tweezers way too long .  </li>
            <li> Better than an average pair of tweezers, but they&#x27;re tweezers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some darned expensive tweezers that were great, but no need to spend that much any longer.</li>
            <li> I am a wax specialist/licensed cosmetologist and when I actually used them I noticed they broke more hairs than they actually pulled.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these tweezers.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the extra 8 bucks.</li>
            <li> Work really well, I&#x27;ve been looking for good tweezers for a while, and these are the first ones that can grip very small hairs that are just starting to grow back.</li>
            <li> Very professional look.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> THANK YOU FOR NO MORE TEARS:)</li>
            <li> These really grip a hair, wider straight flat tip, you can apply pressure up handle</li>
            <li> However, for the price ($7.95 at time of purchase), it&#x27;s hard to find a better pair.</li>
            <li> It does, feel like you are nearly squeezing the sides together</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m getting old),</li>
            <li> so of course I went directly to Amazon and found these.  </li>
            <li> Barely pulls out hair anymore...don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> They definitely stack up to some of the higher, more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> The only problem I find is that they are very sharp and you have to be careful not to pinch your eyelid/skin. :)</li>
            <li> It has a firm grip on hair and performs better that any other tweezers I have.</li>
            <li> Got these a few weeks ago after finally giving up on our cheap pairs from CVS that couldn&#x27;t get short eyebrow hairs.  </li>
            <li> Overall no real complaint.</li>
            <li> Nice angle to get difficult hairs.  </li>
            <li> I was so hopeful they are OK but not great</li>
            <li> I have been able to get at a hair that I was not able to grasp at with my other tweezers (grocery store), in about 1 or 2 goes.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty heavy (compare to the one i currently use) and it can&#x27;t catch hair on my face.</li>
            <li> get the fine hard to grab hairs, as well as the dark embeded hairs !</li>
            <li> I hope they last a long time.</li>
            <li> (Even though I already spent more on all my fails).</li>
            <li> Needed something for plucking hair, ear, eyebrow, grey in the mustache</li>
            <li> They feel a bit strange for me</li>
            <li> I usually need to try a few times to get hold of tiny eyebrow hairs, but these tweezers pick up every hair on the first try.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t have believed there would be a big difference from one set to the other</li>
            <li> I wish they picked up a little better on difficult hairs, but they did their job for my brows and are my travel pair.</li>
            <li> and I have only had them a few days .....</li>
            <li> I have baby fine eyebrows, that have proven difficult to pluck since the hairs usually slip through the pincers.</li>
            <li> Have to be careful though as the edges can be sharp against the skin when feeling around places like your ear</li>
            <li> Works as well as promised by other customers.</li>
            <li> This is sooooo sharp.</li>
            <li> The last set I had just didn&#x27;t pluck well due to having a dull tip.</li>
            <li> I like the little plastic loop that keeps the tweezers closed when in my cosmetic bag, too.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> As stated by other reviewers, they are lightweight and can tweeze out those little stubbles that refuse to budge.  </li>
            <li> I have tried about a half a dozen &#x27;precision&amp;#34; tweezers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just for the odd hair that grow out of some of my moles</li>
            <li> I may well have to start going around in undershirts and learn to smoke a cigar, just to keep up with these little metal miracles in my hands.</li>
            <li> I was hoping they would grab those little hairs</li>
            <li> I keep mine in the little package they came in.</li>
            <li> Waxing is messy and still doesn&#x27;t get the stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t ever touch even under firm pressure.</li>
            <li> and then I have trouble with some hairs</li>
            <li> I will follow up after I have used them a few times.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE MONEY ON THEM</li>
            <li> With these if you get even a slight grasp onto a hair it is coming out!  </li>
            <li> I have a few thick stubbles grow in sometimes and usually they break before being pulled out.  </li>
            <li> and I am not sure I like them .....</li>
            <li> Small but meets the bill.</li>
            <li> Since i had 2-3 eyelash which grows like trichiasis, i always need small scissors to cut them shorter in case of irritates my eyeball.</li>
            <li> The left side seems awkward.</li>
            <li> Not loving these tweezers</li>
            <li> much less expensive than tweezer man</li>
            <li> These tweezers have a different tweeze end shape than I&#x27;ve ever used and they aren&#x27;t that bad.  </li>
            <li> But I could NOT get a grip on these suckers!</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> I have reached the unfortunate phase in my life where unwanted facial/chin hair seems to grow in overnight.  </li>
            <li> The tiniest, bristliest hairs, just barely above the skin line, get called &amp;#34;Bub&amp;#34; as they&#x27;re taken out with ruthless efficiency.</li>
            <li> I find the minis too difficult to work with.  </li>
            <li> (sorry if TMI).  </li>
            <li> ;  Well, I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I just got frustrated and figured that I was going to have to pay some ridiculous $30 for something that would work.</li>
            <li> BUT I REMOVE VERY THIN HAIR 2-3</li>
            <li> IT IS CRAZY</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s very disappointing as I&#x27;ve bought about 6-7 of them!  </li>
            <li> The ones I got in the mail are horrible.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

            <li> The tweezers do have a good grip, however, they are so sharp they have pinched and cut me a couple of times.  I finally had to get something else and that&#x27;s very disappointing as I&#x27;ve bought about 6-7 of them!  Still in search for the perfect one!</li>
            <li> These are by far the best tweezers I have ever used!  I have reached the unfortunate phase in my life where unwanted facial/chin hair seems to grow in overnight.  Waxing is messy and still doesn&#x27;t get the stubborn hairs. With these tweezers, I am able to get even the most stubborn hairs. They are easy to hold with no slipping like the metal tweezers and are precise.  I highly recommend these tweezers.</li>
            <li> i am always looking for a pair of great tweezers and these are it!</li>
            <li> Package was damaged when I received my, but the tweezer itself is sturdy and nice quality~</li>
            <li> Wife bought this.  High quality tweezer that does not warp easily.  Would recommend.  Although a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Because I never used a slant tip before, I cannot vouch for this product vis-a-vis others of its type except to say that, by its own rights, it does the job well. It is sturdy, well-beveled, and fits nicely in the hand.</li>
            <li> Very slim and easy to use....love it!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t catch the hair in my face. Not worth the money. Try something else</li>
            <li> Nice tweezers. Works well.</li>
            <li> Finally! I have tried about a half a dozen &#x27;precision&amp;#34; tweezers. I just got frustrated and figured that I was going to have to pay some ridiculous $30 for something that would work. (Even though I already spent more on all my fails). I ordered this one and wow! It really is a &amp;#34;works every try&amp;#34; pair!&lt;br /&gt;Try this one first!</li>
            <li> These have THE perfect tip for tweezing small hairs off the brow! Love them!</li>
            <li> Three kids in the house, I can always use a good pair of tweezers. Love how it slants!</li>
            <li> Got this on a cheap cost and well worth it. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Prior to this purchase, I have a tweezer at home.  But, comparing side by side, this product not just sleek looking, it works even better than my old tweezer.  I&#x27;m totally thrilled and definitely will recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> These rock! Great price, very sharp. Love them!</li>
            <li> The title say&#x27;s it all.  It does, feel like you are nearly squeezing the sides together but they don&#x27;t ever touch even under firm pressure.</li>
            <li> Amazing pair of tweezers for eyebrows! Great tips, comfortable handle.</li>
            <li> Awesome set of tweezers!  Will order again!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Use it everytime before shower.  Love it~</li>
            <li> Nice pair of tweezers</li>
            <li> These do work when you can get a hold of the hair just right, but it also breaks the hair off so you can&#x27;t get it removed.  Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d always just bought the cheapest ones they put on the impulse-buy rack by the checkout in the grocery store, and got along fine...but pay eight bucks for one, and suddenly you&#x27;re the Wolverine of plucking hairs, just kickin&#x27; ass and takin&#x27; names. The tiniest, bristliest hairs, just barely above the skin line, get called &amp;#34;Bub&amp;#34; as they&#x27;re taken out with ruthless efficiency. I may well have to start going around in undershirts and learn to smoke a cigar, just to keep up with these little metal miracles in my hands.</li>
            <li> Very light weight for full size tweezers. I find the minis too difficult to work with.  This is the perfect size. Nice angle to get difficult hairs.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> Barely pulls out hair anymore...don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> These tweezers work well. They are a bit pricey though. Overall no real complaint.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are very light weight and flexible.  They grab hair easily and don&#x27;t break follicles.  I have a few thick stubbles grow in sometimes and usually they break before being pulled out.  The Lezele tweezers pulled out a couple strong guys and did not break them.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for the price. Every now and then I have trouble with some hairs but eventually it can get it out.</li>
            <li> This is just what I have been looking for great tweezers do I very good job</li>
            <li> The best Tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> These tweezers have a different tweeze end shape than I&#x27;ve ever used and they aren&#x27;t that bad.  I have been able to get at a hair that I was not able to grasp at with my other tweezers (grocery store), in about 1 or 2 goes.  I don&#x27;t pluck eyebrows or anything like that.  It&#x27;s just for the odd hair that grow out of some of my moles (sorry if TMI).  But it&#x27;s been perfect and very reliable.  So glad I found this.</li>
            <li> Just one word: Amazing!</li>
            <li> Pretty good product. Not a game-changer or anything but hey. Much better than any pair you&#x27;d find at the dollar store or somewhere. I don&#x27;t know about &amp;#34;the first time, every time&amp;#34; like the description says but they&#x27;re certainly not bad.</li>
            <li> Meh ...... they are light weight and I have only had them a few days ..... much less expensive than tweezer man but they are very light weight and I am not sure I like them ..... yet.  They grip good ---- I will follow up after I have used them a few times.</li>
            <li> These are pretty amazing for something as simple as tweezers.  Needed something for plucking hair, ear, eyebrow, grey in the mustache (I&#x27;m getting old), etc.  Had tried moving up to some more expensive selections at the local drugstore but they didn&#x27;t seem to work very well.  With these if you get even a slight grasp onto a hair it is coming out!  Have to be careful though as the edges can be sharp against the skin when feeling around places like your ear but I have never owned a pair of tweezers work this well.  Wouldn&#x27;t have believed there would be a big difference from one set to the other but there is.</li>
            <li> These things are great..</li>
            <li> These tweezers work very well. I&#x27;ve noticed some difficulty when attempting to remove very fine hair.  However, for the price ($7.95 at time of purchase), it&#x27;s hard to find a better pair.</li>
            <li> The best tweezers I&#x27;ve used in years. The shape makes them really comfortable to grip for extended plucking sessions.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE VERY CHEAP!! DON&#x27;T WASTE MONEY ON THEM</li>
            <li> These do not work, totally ripped off. They don&#x27;t even close to pull hair.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine eyebrows, that have proven difficult to pluck since the hairs usually slip through the pincers. Not with this tool! This is the quickest and most efficient tweezer that I have ever purchased, and am pleased to recommend to others.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as described. The service was quick. Pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers.  I hope they last a long time.</li>
            <li> Works as well as promised by other customers.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers. Picks up even the finest hair. My last tweezer was a La Crosse but they don&#x27;t sell them anymore. I finally found THE tweezer for me.</li>
            <li> These look good and perform perfectly. Easy to grasp and manipulate. No complaints!</li>
            <li> Poor quality. The edges are not filed properly and don&#x27;t meet to catch and pluck any hair.</li>
            <li> A great, inexpensive pair of tweezers is hard to find. These do the trick.  They find the fine hairs much better than my &amp;#34;fairly good&amp;#34; drugstore-brand tweezers, and they look nice too.  Just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Finally, a good pair of tweezers!  They work great for plucking!</li>
            <li> They work,  however they are uncomfortable to use as the slant works best on the right side with the right hand. The left side seems awkward.</li>
            <li> I doubted any brand great but these ARE. And they are packaged very well to ship - so tip really is important.</li>
            <li> From the picture shown....those are not the tweezers I received.  The ones I got in the mail are horrible.  When pinched together they do not grab any hairs.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t too impressed with this tweezer. I personally don&#x27;t feel that it worked any better than my Tweezerman or even Revlon.</li>
            <li> Subpar by all measure.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had! I&#x27;ve had some darned expensive tweezers that were great, but no need to spend that much any longer. Love the shape of these, its a great angle that makes tweezing more comfortable. Love!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t *pluck* very well</li>
            <li> very nice and precise tweezers</li>
            <li> Small but meets the bill. Nice and sharp and easily handleable.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve had in years!!!!</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Better than an average pair of tweezers, but they&#x27;re tweezers it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re going to do the work for you.</li>
            <li> Good product. I like the little plastic loop that keeps the tweezers closed when in my cosmetic bag, too.</li>
            <li> Very fine control.  Grabs even the thinnest of hairs.</li>
            <li> love these. very strong and very accurate. eyebrows on FLEEK now</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like and returned</li>
            <li> Work really well, I&#x27;ve been looking for good tweezers for a while, and these are the first ones that can grip very small hairs that are just starting to grow back.</li>
            <li> These are great tweezers.  As stated by other reviewers, they are lightweight and can tweeze out those little stubbles that refuse to budge.  I really recommend these.</li>
            <li> This is sooooo sharp. It gets the smallest hairs for my brows.</li>
            <li> The only problem I find is that they are very sharp and you have to be careful not to pinch your eyelid/skin. :)</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good tweezer for quite a while.  I&#x27;ve bought more expensive ones that I did not like.  This one is a good price, very sharp and effective.  I use it for my eyebrows and it works great.</li>
            <li> When upon arrival I kind of liked the look of them. They feel a bit strange for me tonl use though. I am a wax specialist/licensed cosmetologist and when I actually used them I noticed they broke more hairs than they actually pulled. I couldn&#x27;t not break hairs. I wound up having to switch tweezers because they just weren&#x27;t getting the job done. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
            <li> Love them!  They are easy to hold and grasp even the smallest hairs.</li>
            <li> Not loving these tweezers I was so hopeful they are OK but not great I was hoping they would grab those little hairs but they don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty heavy (compare to the one i currently use) and it can&#x27;t catch hair on my face. These tweezers aren&#x27;t close well, you basically scratch yourself.</li>
            <li> feels like tweezerman</li>
            <li> l loved thease tweezers .&lt;br /&gt;They get the fine hard to grab hairs, as well as the dark embeded hairs !</li>
            <li> They look dainty but are the same length and grip eyebrow hair tighter than the Revlon, Trim &amp; LaCross pair I&#x27;ve used and found wanting. I was amazed to be able to pluck a dozen errant hairs from my &#x27;old man eyebrows&#x27; in a minute or so. First time, every time.</li>
            <li> These are great. Good value. Prompt delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with cheap tweezers way too long .  At 8 dollars for an EXCELLENT tweezer this is great tweezers and a great value. It has a very solid feel , the tension is perfect and the slant tip is ground perfectly .  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase .   The slant tip will probably work well for surface splinters but I also bought a  needle-tip tweezers for beneath the surface splinters .</li>
            <li> These are really great tweezers. They offer a unique design and are lightweight. They latch onto hairs, splinters, etc. without any problems and they are much better than the tweezers I&#x27;ve purchased at the drug store.</li>
            <li> I am loving these tweezers the precision is amazing for getting those teeny tiny unwanted hairs with a minimum of pain.</li>
            <li> They worked better than my go-to brand and I loved the slanted tip - easily took care of the small, fine, hard-to-get hairs. Would definitely reccommend!</li>
            <li> Very nice stuff, can be really precisely to grab any small hair. Since i had 2-3 eyelash which grows like trichiasis, i always need small scissors to cut them shorter in case of irritates my eyeball. Now this tweezers can do it really well! The only problem is after removing hair, there is a wound (or pores) there. Still have no idea how to handle the wound and worry it might cause infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For making a perfect shape in eyebrow, I usually used eyebrow shaver not tweezers. This is my first tweezer in life, recommend!</li>
            <li> Handy tweezers, and the come packaged nicely</li>
            <li> I did NOT like these. The quality seemed nice and high. They looked very pretty. But I could NOT get a grip on these suckers! I couldn&#x27;t get my fingers balanced on the itty bitty press &#x27;arms&#x27;. My fingers kept sliding off the &#x27;neck&#x27; area, so I couldn&#x27;t use them. Sent back (thank you amazon!)</li>
            <li> Great product, quick shipping. Works great!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are wonderful! They are beautiful, very lightweight, and precise. I usually need to try a few times to get hold of tiny eyebrow hairs, but these tweezers pick up every hair on the first try. I keep mine in the little package they came in. It makes them easier to find in my make up bag. I would recommend Le Zele tweezers to anyone. I love mine.</li>
            <li> Very nice tweezers, makes it easy to get those stray hairs. Very beautiful design and good quality too.</li>
            <li> Easy to grip and works a treat on those stray hairs!</li>
            <li> The curve design makes the tweezers easy to use. Love them!</li>
            <li> I initially thought, &amp;#34;What can you write about some tweezers?  Either they work, or they don&#x27;t work.  Period.&amp;#34;  Well, I was wrong.  I&#x27;m in between waxings and needed a good tweezer (I lost mine) so of course I went directly to Amazon and found these.  I&#x27;ve had may tweezers in my day, but I&#x27;ve never had a pair that could pull out the very finest hairs!  These tweezers pull out hairs that you didn&#x27;t know were there, and they do so beautifully.  My eyebrows look great, and I won&#x27;t have to go for a waxing for at least another two weeks.  I don&#x27;t know what this company that manufactures these tweezers does that&#x27;s different, but they deliver.  It may not be a great gift idea, but this is something you&#x27;ll want to &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; to yourself.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really like the grip on these and how easy they are to use</li>
            <li> I was given these tweezers at no cost. They definitely stack up to some of the higher, more expensive brands. They were precise.</li>
            <li> I like the sharpness of the tweezer and the quality that is very convenience to use and pu in my bag.</li>
            <li> Got these a few weeks ago after finally giving up on our cheap pairs from CVS that couldn&#x27;t get short eyebrow hairs.  When she saw how well they worked, my wife stole my pair so I had to buy her one too.  Definitely worth the extra 8 bucks.</li>
            <li> this eyebrow tweezers is great. it has a very good perfect edge and small enough to pinch the exact hair you wanted to.</li>
            <li> Very professional look. I like it.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers. Completely satisfied</li>
            <li> I love this tweezer. It&#x27;s easy to grab and it works perfectly. The price is acceptable. I would definitely recommend this tweezer to my friends. Happy Holiday Season!</li>
            <li> The product is just as advertised.  It is very helpful, although I use it to remove splinters and not eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I like this item.  It has a firm grip on hair and performs better that any other tweezers I have.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t get the tiny eyebrow</li>
            <li> Nice hold. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> LOST!! I MISS PLACED THESE TWEZZERS AND I  FOUND THEM THEY ARE WONDERFUL TAKES THE HAIR OUT WITH EASE IT IS CRAZY BUT I REMOVE VERY THIN HAIR 2-3 AT A TIME NO PAIN SO AWSOME!! I WILL REORDER MANY MORE!! THANK YOU FOR NO MORE TEARS:)</li>
            <li> Go easy at first until you get used to how sharp and precise they are.</li>
            <li> As advertised.  Precise tip.  Lightweight.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent tweezers. I like them. I wish they picked up a little better on difficult hairs, but they did their job for my brows and are my travel pair. Definitely pleased!</li>
            <li> Very nice tweezers, makes it easy to get those stray hairs.  I would imagine it will be great for splinters too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a good tweezer. Some of them just don&#x27;t work right but this one is great!</li>
            <li> Light weight easy to use. Really plucks nicely! Very happy with the buy! Sleek design! My eyebrows are thankful I purchased this product. The last set I had just didn&#x27;t pluck well due to having a dull tip. This tip is pointed and really does what you tell it to do! Really great buy! I see these lasting for awhile! Thanks!</li>
            <li> These did not pluck anything straight out of the box. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are just the right size. Fit in my hand great and pull out all unwanted hairs easily. Great product.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers. Easy to grip and hold hairs</li>
            <li> Good quality and fine tip!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I am using it for my eye brows.  It is precise enough to even take splinters out.  I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Wish I had found these 45 yrs ago! These really grip a hair, wider straight flat tip, you can apply pressure up handle and you can see he. Metal move and do some good gripping</li>
