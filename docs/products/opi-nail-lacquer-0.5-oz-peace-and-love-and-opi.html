            <li>This is definitely one of my all time favorite polishes!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fun color -</li>
            <li>By far my favorite polish.</li>
            <li>it is so unique and changes colors from a sage green to a bright purple/pink.</li>
            <li>However, it chips pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>so pretty I would highly recommend this every girl needs this color in her life!!!</li>
            <li>Different polish use  it for special occaslons!!</li>
            <li>In any light or shade this nail color appeared light to medium blue.  </li>
            <li>This color is such a huge his this year!  </li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>Its great for late fall to winter.  </li>
            <li>So pretty.</li>
            <li>I even tried painting different nail polish on my nail first then painting the OPI on top of it...  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much prettier on!  </li>
            <li>I love this entire collection.</li>
            <li>and this was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This specific color did go on a little more sheer than I would have preferred but it still looked great.</li>
            <li>Very Pretty, stylish, and different at the same time!!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even see much of a shine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dangerous and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>and I think it really represents San Fran.</li>
            <li>It is much prettier in the bottle than on your nails.</li>
            <li>like it is that it tends to chip more than my other OPI colors.</li>
            <li>color changes in the sun, its my new signature color!</li>
            <li>So, highly recommend</li>
            <li>I got this color from a salon a few weeks ago, and fell in love.</li>
            <li>This looks gray at first but depending on the light, it has purple, green and bronze in it.</li>
            <li>In the sun Peace, Love on my nails is a plum or a green gray, indoors the colors are darker.</li>
            <li>I think I will get another one I love the green and purple together.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t exactly work with my hands, but I type a lot, and usually I only get about 5 days or so from OPI or Sally Hansen polishes.  </li>
            <li>Its such a pretty opaque color with lots of three dimensional shine.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it looks purple, sometimes green and sometimes kind of a gunmetal grey.  </li>
            <li>Color is green and purple and changes in the light.</li>
            <li>The sales woman said this was very iridescent especially in the sun.</li>
            <li>I took it with me to get a manicure and had it applied by a professional.</li>
            <li>It has that holographic look to it, and it&#x27;s dark but still cool.</li>
            <li>It is blue in one light, green in another purple in another.</li>
            <li>This color is like no other.</li>
            <li>I ran to get a quick pedi a few weeks back &amp; this color caught my eye @ the salon.</li>

            <li> This color is like no other.</li>
            <li> I ran to get a quick pedi a few weeks back &amp; this color caught my eye @ the salon.</li>
            <li> The overall effect makes the glitter look like sequins that lay perfectly flat on the nail.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in some lights it is grey thengreen then purple</li>
            <li> ive had long nails for over 50 yrs.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still professional-looking enough for me to wear at my job, where anything other than square-fashion stands out.</li>
            <li> I tried it and it looked very green in the sun and not a pretty green more like a dark green.</li>
            <li> green blue and purple</li>
            <li> OPI brushes are known for wide brushes.</li>
            <li> The other color is a darker plum color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a complimentary color.</li>
            <li> Pink to purple to green to slate</li>
            <li> I tried it on at home and it looks like a grayish black with out any other shades of green or other colors at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a color that you would typically find.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not just purple; it&#x27;s not just black; and it deserves a funkier title</li>
            <li> I turned to Amazon and found it for less than the purchase price with shipping included.</li>
            <li> There is a number etched into the bottle,OPI stamps the bottle with black ink, they do not etch into the bottle.</li>
            <li> a black pearl color</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t any sun indoors so this is a big, big disappointment.</li>
            <li> It changes from purple to green depending on the angle of your nail.  </li>
            <li> The color looks like a green tinted gray, then will shimmer a darker green and purple as your finger moves.</li>
            <li> Hard to see any other colors under indoor lights.  </li>
            <li> so thats what I usually purchase.</li>
            <li> We both agreed it was not a good look!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this Brand.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI!</li>
            <li> I did put on a base coat</li>
            <li> I tried it myself and hated it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not please with this at all, very disappointed in this one.</li>

            <li> This polish is beautiful, and by far my favorite OPI polish ever!  I get many compliments on it.  Sometimes it looks purple, sometimes green and sometimes kind of a gunmetal grey.  It goes with everything!</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish. It is different colors..... green blue and purple</li>
            <li> Looks steel gray.  Hard to see any other colors under indoor lights.  Took three coats to cover without streaks.</li>
            <li> I got this color from a salon a few weeks ago, and fell in love. HAD to HAVE it kinda love. SO i snooped online, and tada! I dont think I am ever taking it off. it is so unique and changes colors from a sage green to a bright purple/pink. I have gotten so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Different polish use  it for special occaslons!!</li>
            <li> Iredescence plus! Great silver/grey shade with shimmer of colors like a black pearl. Great for evening looks and for winters suits.</li>
            <li> A++++++. Super fast shipping and a great deal!  Thank you!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Color is green and purple and changes in the light. Very unique and beautiful! Have never seen one that had this feature.</li>
            <li> I thought this opi was going to show more colors like in the bottle. It kind of looks like a chrome rainbow color in the bottle. I tried it and it looked very green in the sun and not a pretty green more like a dark green. Not a fan of this one at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this in a beauty shop. The sales woman said this was very iridescent especially in the sun. I tried it on at home and it looks like a grayish black with out any other shades of green or other colors at all. I don&#x27;t even see much of a shine. After reading some of the reviews they all say how wonderful it looks in the sun. The summer is ending and I got this as a winter shade. There isn&#x27;t any sun indoors so this is a big, big disappointment. I put  OPI&#x27;S I Snow You Love Me (It is from the Mariah Carey Collection)  over it to give it some sparkle. That has big chunky crystal silver pieces which is gorgeous over any color. To quote an article \\&quot;It&#x27;s silver holographic circle glitter, with overlapping circles on the glitter! The overall effect makes the glitter look like sequins that lay perfectly flat on the nail.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt; It is truly iridescent and the most sparkly, glowing top coat ever.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a multi color polish, Peace &amp; Love isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Love this color.....it is rather chameleon like, as it can appear gray or brown or blueish.  As always OPI nail polish in quality never disappoints me.</li>
            <li> best quality and best color, I am in love with this nail lacquer &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Pretty color and of course OPI is a wonderful brand of polish. This color seems to change depending on how the light hits it. I really like it!</li>
            <li> This looks gray at first but depending on the light, it has purple, green and bronze in it. Such a great color. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this polish!  Its great for late fall to winter.  It&#x27;s not a color that you would typically find.  It changes from purple to green depending on the angle of your nail.  I think it&#x27;s beautiful and have received a lot of comments.  Durability is ok to good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it on for a week now, and no chips yet.  I don&#x27;t exactly work with my hands, but I type a lot, and usually I only get about 5 days or so from OPI or Sally Hansen polishes.  It&#x27;s a fun color - it&#x27;s gunmetal gray! it&#x27;s grape lollipop purple! now 90&#x27;s prom dress teal! - but it&#x27;s still professional-looking enough for me to wear at my job, where anything other than square-fashion stands out.</li>
            <li> I purchased the mini collection. Two colors are multi color. The other color is a darker plum color. In the sun Peace, Love on my nails is a plum or a green gray, indoors the colors are darker. This color works with my skin tone. I love it. Try the color in the mini collection or at a salon. It is a love it or leave it polish.</li>
            <li> This color is like no other. It&#x27;s not just purple; it&#x27;s not just black; and it deserves a funkier title that Peace and Love. It&#x27;s dangerous and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This color is such a huge his this year!  I glad I was able to order a bottle!  I love it.</li>
            <li> I love love love this color and I think it really represents San Fran. Its such a pretty opaque color with lots of three dimensional shine. Its a really great fall color that could go into winter easily and even early spring.</li>
            <li> So pretty. The color reminds me of a peacock feather. It is blue in one light, green in another purple in another. Get this color.</li>
            <li> This color of the polish in no way reflected the actual color it produces on your nails.  In any light or shade this nail color appeared light to medium blue.  I even tried painting different nail polish on my nail first then painting the OPI on top of it...  And guess what, still BLUE.  I&#x27;m not please with this at all, very disappointed in this one.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this color and i get a lot of compliments when i wear it. The only thing i dont like it is that it tends to chip more than my other OPI colors.</li>
            <li> I really love the color. It has that holographic look to it, and it&#x27;s dark but still cool. However, it chips pretty quickly. I did put on a base coat, I don&#x27;t remember if I used a top coat or not, but it started coming off the day after I put it on. I&#x27;m still going to use it all the time, though, I&#x27;ll just have to reapply!</li>
            <li> I love this color. It is iridescent so it appears to be different colors depending on the lighting. I would recommend if your looking for something different.</li>
            <li> Product came on time and was as promised. I loved this color and had to have it. The closest Ulta was sold out and I couldn&#x27;t find it any where else locally.  Purchasing online from Ulta would have cost me nearly double by the time I paid shipping. I turned to Amazon and found it for less than the purchase price with shipping included. This specific color did go on a little more sheer than I would have preferred but it still looked great.</li>
            <li> I thought this looked pretty interesting.  It&#x27;s much prettier on!  If you are looking for something a little unusual than this is a great choice!</li>
            <li> I love this color. I think I will get another one I love the green and purple together. and was delivered quickly</li>
            <li> Buyer beware! This is a knockoff bottle of OPI brand nail polish. There is a number etched into the bottle,OPI stamps the bottle with black ink, they do not etch into the bottle. Another way of telling it&#x27;s a knockoff is the width/thickness of the brush.OPI brushes are known for wide brushes.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite polish! Definitely not something you can find when you walk in a store. Its so unique just love it!</li>
            <li> Cool color.  I get compliments everytime I wear it.</li>
            <li> This color was described as the colors of a peacock feather, I just see purple and silver. I certainly don&#x27;t see the beautiful colors of a peacock feather. It&#x27;s not a complimentary color.</li>
            <li> Looks just like picture. Went on great</li>
            <li> Love the many colors that get reflected in this polish. Use it for pedicures all year long but especially love it for summer.  It goes with everything.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous, iridescent.</li>
            <li> The color was almost black--not like the picture.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and flows on perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love this color! opi polish lasts the longest so thats what I usually purchase. Get lots of complements because it changes colors in the  light.</li>
            <li> I love love love this color!</li>
            <li> Unique color...Very Pretty, stylish, and different at the same time!!! LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> My mom originally bought this nail lacquer for me for Christmas and I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it. Then I tried it on and OH.EM.GEE. I fell in love. It appears to change colors depending on how you turn your head or hand and how the light hits it. Pink to purple to green to slate - it&#x27;s so cool! I LOVE this polish! It is just so cool! This is definitely one of my all time favorite polishes!</li>
            <li> OPI nail polish is always great!  This color in particular looks very nice, and is a great classy color to wear in the winter!  Love it!</li>
            <li> This color is so amazingggg. My new favorite nail polish. in some lights it is grey thengreen then purple so pretty I would highly recommend this every girl needs this color in her life!!!</li>
            <li> This polish is gorgeous! I ran to get a quick pedi a few weeks back &amp; this color caught my eye @ the salon. I searched every store locally that carried OPI &amp; it was no longer in stores. Got on Amazon &amp; of course there it was. I compared it to authentic OPI polishes &amp; was pleased I did not receive a knock off. Amazing color &amp; I am in love!</li>
            <li> Love this color and I can get away with wearing one coat.</li>
            <li> Great color and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Great color. The way the color changes as the light hits it is beautiful. Can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI! I love this entire collection. Perfect for the fall!</li>
            <li> superb product! great color! I get so many compliments!! color changes in the sun, its my new signature color! OPI knows color!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color an year round wear. Texture and appearance are a must, and OPI provides both. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this Brand. So, highly recommend</li>
            <li> I was looking to make my nails a black pearl color and this was exactly what I was looking for. I have recieved a lot of compliments and really love this color.</li>
            <li> Just not what i like. Nothing really different about it. Cant see Holo at all. And i know polish ive had long nails for over 50 yrs. Nothing amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing color. Lasts on my nails without chipping until I take it off. By far my favorite polish.</li>
            <li> I have not come across an OPI color that I haven&#x27;t liked until now. It is much prettier in the bottle than on your nails. The color looks like a green tinted gray, then will shimmer a darker green and purple as your finger moves. I tried it myself and hated it. Thinking that is was just me I took it with me to get a manicure and had it applied by a professional. We both agreed it was not a good look! What a shame...</li>
            <li> Well wrapped for shipping.  Wearing it now -- made for pretty toes -- Love it!</li>
            <li> Timely shipping. Love the color. Many compliments.</li>
