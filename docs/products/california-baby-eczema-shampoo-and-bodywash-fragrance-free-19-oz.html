            <li>Perfect!!</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully at keeping their eczema under wraps, even on their scalps.</li>
            <li>Great!!</li>
            <li>It made my scalp feel great and</li>
            <li>It has been a great help in dealing with his eczema.</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how happy I am to have discovered this product.    </li>
            <li>However, once I used it I loved the way my baby smelled.</li>
            <li>We have been using it for months and are very pleased.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe how amazing it feels.</li>
            <li>It has a nice neutral smell.  </li>
            <li>one of the most amazing shampoo for baby and toddler having and Eczema</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this and loved it.</li>
            <li>It was ok for my sons except</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this wash.</li>
            <li>Lathers well, ok smell.</li>
            <li>I love the California baby hair conditioner, but when I used this body wash, my daughter broke out in a rash all over.</li>
            <li>Significantly helped my daughter&#x27;s eczema!</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves his skin soft.</li>
            <li>are just as good but don&#x27;t cost as much.</li>
            <li>It is very mild.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this for a baby-I use it for myself :) It&#x27;s been great for my eczema and my back-where most of mine is-has really cleared up, and my skin is softer overall.</li>
            <li>Gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy, like lotion or oils</li>
            <li>I stumbled on this at Target and noticed the colloidal oatmeal, which my doctors had told me was soothing (aveeno actually has some great products with this, but the soap was still a no-go for me).</li>
            <li>This will probably work even better and looks more gentle.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY product that with continued use, keeps my skin calm and happy.</li>
            <li>Smells great and gentle on my sensitive baby girls skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels moisturized when I leave the shower, and it&#x27;s not a bad scent.  </li>
            <li>definitely recommend it to those who are worried about their children&#x27;s eczema (or even your own if you</li>
            <li>did not purchased it for the 2nd time, to costly and dosent smell good enough to enjoy.</li>
            <li>If you want a cure for your babies eczema, then try Aquaphor baby healing ointment and the Aquaphor gentle wash!</li>
            <li>It is ok, I can&#x27;t really justify the expense anymore since this new formula doesn&#x27;t work any better than any other eczema wash I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that I have found that works incredibly well on my daughter&#x27;s heavy eczema.</li>
            <li>My baby&#x27;s skin was so creamy soft afterwards, it really moisturizes well and leaves baby clean.</li>
            <li>star for the fact it shouldn&#x27;t be used as shampoo if you&#x27;re an adult; I have curly hair and it made it super tangled.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference between this soap and the unscented/gentle variety that they sell.  </li>
            <li>This product it does not burn her eyes, use it on my grandbaby whole whole body&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It has really helped his exzema.</li>
            <li>When his skin is flared up he typically is much improved after taking a bath using this soap.</li>
            <li>This soap is gentle and therefore might not get you as \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling as others.</li>
            <li>my hair super soft, so I didn&#x27;t mind paying the high price.</li>
            <li>This is intentional as most soaps are actually over-doing it, particularly if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>That being said, their products are still leaps and bounds ahead of most other companies.  </li>
            <li>I picked up two bottles of what I thought were the original California Baby shampoo and body wash from a local retailer.</li>
            <li>For over a year I tried everything (at least 20+ products - even one made by my derm), including cetaphil and cerave (which I still use for moisturizers) and nothing seemed to keep my skin happy for long.</li>
            <li>I normally use the California Babies Tea Tree Oil shampoo on my kids.</li>
            <li>since I moved to Southern California I have battled the dry, desert climate--frankly, I have not been winning.</li>
            <li>He has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>think it has definitely helped more than other cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult with frequent eczema and this helps to keep it at bay.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my kids skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>My son is 8 and his eczema has really flared up in the last year.  </li>
            <li>purchased it for my 3 years old son.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my Grandson who is two years old.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how much this cleanser helps with the soothing, but it&#x27;s definitely gentle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>; version doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well at controlling itch as the old version did.  </li>
            <li>I use the soap in the morning and throughout the day my face feels soft and doesn&#x27;t itch or flake.</li>
            <li>I had been living in much milder, temperate climates and my skin seemed to be having a constant melt-down.</li>
            <li>My baby has occasional eczema flare ups mainly on her forearms.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m stuck with a big size bottle of shampoo and I&#x27;m out the money to buy more shampoo and the CB products are not cheap!</li>
            <li>do&#x27;s not make enough bobbles foam, leave hair dry , but once the hair is dry it feels normal clean.</li>
            <li>Hey...I have an idea...let&#x27;s create a $30 soap to treat eczema, the most common symptom of gluten intolerance, and then fill it with gluten, no one will mind!  </li>
            <li>the commercial products in restrooms reek havoc on my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Eczema isn&#x27;t a fun battle but for our little guy this product has been a hlep.</li>
            <li>I use this soap almost daily for bathing my 9 month old and have been using it for about 4 months.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how well this works for children with eczema, but as an adult this is literally the only soap I can use on my skin daily, regardless of season, without irritation.</li>
            <li>The price is kind of ridiculous, but it usually lasts me a couple of months.  </li>

            <li> Made my son&#x27;s skin very dry.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure of the smell, in the bottle in was kinda bad.</li>
            <li> Received as advertised and when expected.</li>
            <li> This made my wet hair like a gob of wet cotton.</li>
            <li> It was a rough week clearing up the rash.</li>
            <li> But reading the bottle made me curious, so I tried it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been out camping for a few days, or work outside etc.</li>
            <li> but I feel there are other products to that</li>
            <li> She has eczema and other allergies</li>
            <li> Quality is nothing like other CB products.  </li>
            <li> The few times I tried switching, my little boy broke back out.</li>
            <li> Little one can not live without!</li>
            <li> My husband and kids asked me not to buy it again, though, because they think it has an odd smell to it.</li>
            <li> I do use some locally made tea tree oil soap (goat milk) for bad eczema flair ups in conjunction with Cerave cream (you need to constantly moisturize with eczema!), but even the tea tree (and really any other soap) can be irritating.</li>
            <li> But what i received was nothing like the sample I had, this stuff actually made my skin worse, and gave me dandruff.</li>
            <li> smells stale and old.</li>
            <li> My son has pretty bad eczema in the winter and while this is what we use in conjunction with coconut oil and aquafor after bath.</li>
            <li> i carry some in a small bottle in my purse during cold and flu season for frequent hand washing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it negative stars if it were an option...</li>
            <li> Other than the weird smell, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> It was not fun, and just looks a little awkward, carrying a bottle of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Poor little guy!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive, but a little goes</li>
            <li> When I realized I had bought the wrong thing I contemplated returning it, as our daughter doesn&#x27;t have any serious skin issues.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so expensive and does nothing to relieve eczema.</li>
            <li> In fact, it makes my sons eczema worse!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive, I will have to continue my search for another alternative for my infant.</li>
            <li> does nothing for my son&#x27;s eczema and I am just using it up because I hate to waste it.  </li>
            <li> I also hate the smell.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m an adult with frequent eczema and this helps to keep it at bay.  My skin feels moisturized when I leave the shower, and it&#x27;s not a bad scent.  One bottle lasts me about a month when I use it as a body wash.</li>
            <li> I used to swear by Cal Baby but they&#x27;ve changed formulation on a lot of products and several of them contain preservatives that I&#x27;m not a fan of.

            <li> My son is 8 and his eczema has really flared up in the last year.  He can not have anything with scent or manmade perfumes.  California Baby is the best stuff!!</li>

            <li> This soap seems to keep my child&#x27;s eczema in check.  It has a nice neutral smell.  Recommend for any child with really dry skin.</li>
            <li> Made my son&#x27;s skin very dry. He has very sensitive skin and this was recommended to me by a friend but just didnt work out.</li>
            <li> Way overrated. This stuff is so expensive and does nothing to relieve eczema. In fact, it makes my sons eczema worse! I also hate the smell. If you want a cure for your babies eczema, then try Aquaphor baby healing ointment and the Aquaphor gentle wash! that stuff works wonders and cleared up my sons issues in days!</li>

It also doesn&#x27;t seem to keep my daughter&#x27;s eczema as under control.  It is ok, I can&#x27;t really justify the expense anymore since this new formula doesn&#x27;t work any better than any other eczema wash I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Helps with eczema instantly. Lathers well, ok smell. Helps with itching and irritations. Little one can not live without! Perfect!!</li>
            <li> Hey...I have an idea...let&#x27;s create a $30 soap to treat eczema, the most common symptom of gluten intolerance, and then fill it with gluten, no one will mind!  I&#x27;d give it negative stars if it were an option...</li>
            <li> I use this soap almost daily for bathing my 9 month old and have been using it for about 4 months. It has been a great help in dealing with his eczema. It is very mild. When his skin is flared up he typically is much improved after taking a bath using this soap. Eczema isn&#x27;t a fun battle but for our little guy this product has been a hlep.</li>
            <li> I love the California baby hair conditioner, but when I used this body wash, my daughter broke out in a rash all over. She has eczema and other allergies so I wanted to give this a try. It was a rough week clearing up the rash.</li>
            <li> I picked up two bottles of what I thought were the original California Baby shampoo and body wash from a local retailer. When I realized I had bought the wrong thing I contemplated returning it, as our daughter doesn&#x27;t have any serious skin issues. But reading the bottle made me curious, so I tried it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I moved to Southern California I have battled the dry, desert climate--frankly, I have not been winning. The skin on my face has gone from oily to flakey to itchy to everything in between. For a while I used softer soaps and a lotion from a company called Melaleuca. If they weren&#x27;t run like pyramid scheme it might soften my opinion, but so it goes. Nonetheless, the lotion worked, to a degree, as I would have to carry a bottle in the car in case I was outside all day. It was not fun, and just looks a little awkward, carrying a bottle of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But since the &amp;#34;great mistake&amp;#34; I have been using the eczema soap on my face and I can&#x27;t believe how amazing it feels. It actually makes my face feel like it did years ago, before the move west. I use the soap in the morning and throughout the day my face feels soft and doesn&#x27;t itch or flake. The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy, like lotion or oils do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great soap.</li>
            <li> i carry some in a small bottle in my purse during cold and flu season for frequent hand washing.  the commercial products in restrooms reek havoc on my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> smells stale and old. does nothing for my son&#x27;s eczema and I am just using it up because I hate to waste it.  Quality is nothing like other CB products.  I would not ever buy this again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well this works for children with eczema, but as an adult this is literally the only soap I can use on my skin daily, regardless of season, without irritation. When I moved to Chicago about five years ago, my skin was constantly irritated with bouts of eczema in the winter. I had been living in much milder, temperate climates and my skin seemed to be having a constant melt-down. For over a year I tried everything (at least 20+ products - even one made by my derm), including cetaphil and cerave (which I still use for moisturizers) and nothing seemed to keep my skin happy for long. I stumbled on this at Target and noticed the colloidal oatmeal, which my doctors had told me was soothing (aveeno actually has some great products with this, but the soap was still a no-go for me). I gave it a try and am so relieved I did. This is the ONLY product that with continued use, keeps my skin calm and happy. I do use some locally made tea tree oil soap (goat milk) for bad eczema flair ups in conjunction with Cerave cream (you need to constantly moisturize with eczema!), but even the tea tree (and really any other soap) can be irritating. I cannot tell you how happy I am to have discovered this product.    Some caveats:  The price is kind of ridiculous, but it usually lasts me a couple of months.  This soap is gentle and therefore might not get you as \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling as others. This is intentional as most soaps are actually over-doing it, particularly if you have sensitive skin. If you&#x27;ve been out camping for a few days, or work outside etc. I recommend using a loofah or some castile soap for those areas that you might feel need extra cleaning.</li>
            <li> This is all that we use! The few times I tried switching, my little boy broke back out. A must for eczema!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure of the smell, in the bottle in was kinda bad. However, once I used it I loved the way my baby smelled. My baby&#x27;s skin was so creamy soft afterwards, it really moisturizes well and leaves baby clean. I like this product and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Smells great and gentle on my sensitive baby girls skin. Her eczema has chilled out quite a bit since using this soap.</li>
            <li> I normally use the California Babies Tea Tree Oil shampoo on my kids. It works wonderfully at keeping their eczema under wraps, even on their scalps. When I saw the eczema formula I thought- Great!! This will probably work even better and looks more gentle. Since making the switch, my son now has eczema all over his scalp and has scabs where he has been scratching. Poor little guy! Needless to say I had to go back out and buy more of the Tea Tree Oil shampoo. Now I&#x27;m stuck with a big size bottle of shampoo and I&#x27;m out the money to buy more shampoo and the CB products are not cheap!</li>
