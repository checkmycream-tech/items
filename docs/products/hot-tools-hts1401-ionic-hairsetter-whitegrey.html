            <li>So, I came across this one and it works just as great!  </li>
            <li>Loved it!  </li>
            <li>The curlers worked great, but while heating up they almost smell like they are burning up or something.</li>

            <li>I love these rollers!</li>
            <li>I love this hairsetter!  </li>
            <li>I have used these rollers for over a year now and have been completely satisfied!  </li>
            <li>Very fairly priced and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Nice curler clamps.</li>
            <li>It lights up and the sides get warm but the rods stay cool!  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat that!:)</li>
            <li>(I dropped it and the top broke, so I had to replace it).  </li>
            <li>I thought it might be better today.  </li>
            <li>I love the  on off switch ln the front.</li>
            <li>For the price they should do retractable cord...makes more sense for bathroom</li>
            <li>This set is my favorite tool for curling my hair.  </li>
            <li>Not terrible</li>
            <li>Great curl and heated up fast and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The heating time is good, as it is fast at heating the rollers.</li>
            <li>Clips are easy to work with.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and easy on your hair.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to use, curl evenly, and have performed well.  </li>
            <li>The surface of the roller itself is smooth and velvety -- I am able to get nice smooth results and the clip design (designed to fit any one of the three roller sizes) is simple, easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;ready&amp;#34; light to let you know when maximum temperature has been achieved.  </li>
            <li>I have not used hot rollers in many years, but I decided to give these a try.  </li>
            <li>I have owned many sets of hot rollers in my lifetime.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used hot rollers for many years off and on and these just don&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li>I wish it had more  large r rollers with the set.</li>
            <li>leave dents in my hair, but these clips are like combs and go right through my hair, so no dents!  </li>
            <li>Overall a good product but pay attention to number and size of rollers.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to everyone!!!</li>
            <li>Most of them smell for a few minutes, kind of like something that is warm, then the smell goes away and never comes back.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with this set of hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>That worried me a little, but overall the curlers worked great!!</li>
            <li>As soon as I opened the package I knew that I had a higher expectation of the product.</li>
            <li>My hair comes out really curly at first then tames to bouncy/ shiny curls.  </li>
            <li>I plugged these in yesterday, waited for them to heat, opened the lid and this large puff of smoke came out and the smell knocked me out.  </li>
            <li>I have been using my set for several years and they do not burn my fine hair.</li>
            <li>item is really junk.</li>
            <li>I bought the travel rollers from Conair for almost 50% as much and use them at home</li>
            <li>Looks good...outside gets hot...rollers not so much...</li>
            <li>The set heats up quite quickly and I find the curls last longer than if I&#x27;ve used a curling iron, or velcro rollers.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I don&#x27;t give this five stars is an attribute nearly all hot roller sets have - they don&#x27;t have enough rollers -- or more accurately, there needs to be either only two sizes, and the same number of rollers as are in this set, or three sizes</li>
            <li>As a mom of a 2 year old I was looking for an easy/ fast way to do my hair.  </li>
            <li>but there need to be a few more rollers of each size.</li>
            <li>Compared to other brands,  Hot Tools hot rollers seem to help my hair hold a curl longer.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my hair,</li>
            <li>I had one that is very similar which I purchased a few years back, and I loved it, but I could not find it for sale anywhere online</li>
            <li>On my first time trying them, my curls came out as a really compressed curl and not a wavy, volumness which is what I expected as a result.</li>
            <li>and the cover cannot stay closed because it doesn;t rewally fit properly in the case.</li>
            <li>Everything came in it and the small container makes it easy to place it just about anywhere.</li>
            <li>Pretty pricey to only last a month.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend, especially at this price!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t keep them on my hair too long to avoid to much of a curl.</li>
            <li>You need pretty long hair to use all the larger rollers.&lt;br /&gt;The clips work well.</li>
            <li>(Mind you, I had tried about four other types of hot rollers from different stores and ended up taking them all back because I didn&#x27;t like the quality)...</li>
            <li>Also, the plastic ends are way too hot to handle, especially the black end.  </li>
            <li>Really, I understand they are &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; rollers, but the ends are usually a little cooler than this.  </li>

            <li> But being on my third use and still be able to smell the same weird burning smell that was on the first try that comes from the rollers when they&#x27;re heating is not a good thing.</li>
            <li> Seems to take a long time for these to heat up.</li>
            <li> Not enough smaller rollers for short hair, plus my hair was hard to cling to the roller ( hard to roll) it will probably set and collect dust</li>
            <li> the velour covering on the roller make it almost impossible to slide the hair onto the roller for a smooth roll.  </li>
            <li> and if this was the only complaint, I&#x27;d keep them but</li>
            <li> Perhaps the customer who rated this nitem 5 stars got it a few years ago and they&#x27;ve resourced.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sad state of affairs when the quality of a new item , not cheaply priced, is so poorly made that the rollers hardly make contact with the stem - making them only lookwarm aftyer heating for a half an hour</li>
            <li> I like the face that this is small, and I like how it works.</li>
            <li> I have no use for the small rollers or the medium ones.</li>
            <li> After just under 2 months of daily use during my morning routine the sides fail to illuminate and it will no longer even start to heat up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve left these plugged in while I showered, applied make-up and still so-so hot.&lt;br /&gt;The rollers are also a bit difficult to get out of the holder.  </li>
            <li> I have medium lenght hair and a bit thick.</li>
            <li> I never take the time to reveiw items - good or bad but these are just awful...</li>
            <li> Sorry, but anything that smells that bad is not going to be used.  </li>
            <li> I worry about what it is that is causing this horrible odor.  </li>
            <li> terrible customer service.-4 stars.</li>

I bought the travel rollers from Conair for almost 50% as much and use them at home too becuase they work faster, lighter,better.  I never take the time to reveiw items - good or bad but these are just awful...</li>
            <li> I purchased this six months ago and used it about once or twice a week.  It has totally stopped heating.</li>
            <li> Excellent...love these rollers!</li>
            <li> I have not used hot rollers in many years, but I decided to give these a try.  As a mom of a 2 year old I was looking for an easy/ fast way to do my hair.  I found it!! My hair comes out really curly at first then tames to bouncy/ shiny curls.  I get so many compliments on my hair! Some people even ask me if I have extensions!!!</li>
            <li> Compared to other brands,  Hot Tools hot rollers seem to help my hair hold a curl longer.  I like the variety of roller sizes,  so I can have different types of curls.  Love these rollers!  Plus, this was the best pricing compared to beauty supply stores, I saved over $30. Can&#x27;t beat that!:)</li>
            <li> The curlers worked great, but while heating up they almost smell like they are burning up or something. That worried me a little, but overall the curlers worked great!!</li>
            <li> Seems to take a long time for these to heat up. Clips are easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I love these rollers! This is the second set I have purchased -- one set for myself and a set for my daugther. I have been using my set for several years and they do not burn my fine hair. I highly recommend to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> These are excellent curlers.  They are easy to use and easy on your hair. Nice curler clamps. The curlers are a good size and there are plenty for all length hair.  Very fairly priced and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this hairsetter!  I had one that is very similar which I purchased a few years back, and I loved it, but I could not find it for sale anywhere online (I dropped it and the top broke, so I had to replace it).  So, I came across this one and it works just as great!  (Mind you, I had tried about four other types of hot rollers from different stores and ended up taking them all back because I didn&#x27;t like the quality)...also, I have very thin hair, and most clips that come with hairsetters leave dents in my hair, but these clips are like combs and go right through my hair, so no dents!  Woo Hoo!</li>
            <li> I have owned many sets of hot rollers in my lifetime.  Most of them smell for a few minutes, kind of like something that is warm, then the smell goes away and never comes back.  I plugged these in yesterday, waited for them to heat, opened the lid and this large puff of smoke came out and the smell knocked me out.  This was around 5:00 p.m.  I could still smell the odor in my nostrils at 10:30 when I went to bed. I thought it might be better today.  Nope, same thing.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting the smoke and now I have that same odor in my nostrils and a headache to go with it.  I am going to return this product to Ulta today.  Sorry, but anything that smells that bad is not going to be used.  I worry about what it is that is causing this horrible odor.  Also, the plastic ends are way too hot to handle, especially the black end.  If you can roll your hair with one hand, great.  If not, buy something else.  Really, I understand they are &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; rollers, but the ends are usually a little cooler than this.  Also, on this set, the dot never changed color.  Maybe I got a defective unit?  Who knows, but it is going back.</li>
            <li> Got this hair setter as a gift for Xmas. Loved it!  Great curl and heated up fast and easy to use.  Well one month later is does not heat.  It lights up and the sides get warm but the rods stay cool!  Pretty pricey to only last a month.  If you want rollers keep looking!</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with this set of hot rollers.  The surface of the roller itself is smooth and velvety -- I am able to get nice smooth results and the clip design (designed to fit any one of the three roller sizes) is simple, easy to use and effective.

The heating time is good, as it is fast at heating the rollers. I have medium lenght hair and a bit thick. On my first time trying them, my curls came out as a really compressed curl and not a wavy, volumness which is what I expected as a result. I have no use for the small rollers or the medium ones. I only use the six larger ones and alternate when using. I don&#x27;t keep them on my hair too long to avoid to much of a curl. This is a great product for those that have thing hair and like a thight curl. I&#x27;m now looking for bigger rollers.</li>
            <li> After just under 2 months of daily use during my morning routine the sides fail to illuminate and it will no longer even start to heat up.</li>
            <li> This machine has an insufficient number of medium size rollers. You need pretty long hair to use all the larger rollers.&lt;br /&gt;The clips work well. Overall a good product but pay attention to number and size of rollers.</li>
            <li> The rollers work great. I love the  on off switch ln the front.I wish it had more  large r rollers with the set.</li>
            <li> Looks good...outside gets hot...rollers not so much...terrible customer service.-4 stars.For the price they should do retractable cord...makes more sense for bathroom Quit working at all inside 3 months. Recomend you do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> I have used these rollers for over a year now and have been completely satisfied!  They&#x27;re easy to use, curl evenly, and have performed well.  This set is my favorite tool for curling my hair.  Would highly recommend, especially at this price!</li>
            <li> The heating element broke after only 1 year of infrequent use!</li>
            <li> There are several reasons why these rollers are being returned. They don&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my hair, the velour covering on the roller make it almost impossible to slide the hair onto the roller for a smooth roll.  There isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;ready&amp;#34; light to let you know when maximum temperature has been achieved.  I&#x27;ve left these plugged in while I showered, applied make-up and still so-so hot.&lt;br /&gt;The rollers are also a bit difficult to get out of the holder.  Not terrible and if this was the only complaint, I&#x27;d keep them but its not.  I&#x27;ve used hot rollers for many years off and on and these just don&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> Not enough smaller rollers for short hair, plus my hair was hard to cling to the roller ( hard to roll) it will probably set and collect dust</li>
