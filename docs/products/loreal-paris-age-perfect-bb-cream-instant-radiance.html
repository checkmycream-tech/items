    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I like the Loreal BB cream that&#x27;s not the age perfect formula.</li>
            <li>While the light/medium shade blended perfectly -- which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one -- this product is NOT for anybody with oily skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect BB Cream for 2 years, won&#x27;t buy anything else.  </li>
            <li>color is a perfect match for my light-medium skin that has reddish undertones.</li>
            <li>At it&#x27;s  best, it is a HIT for my olive complexion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Missha Perfect Cover BB Cream from Korea, as well as some drugstore brands made by Maybelline and CoverGirl.</li>
            <li>I had been purchasing Pond&#x27;s BB cream and was very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Perfect one, except the Youth Code one did not disappear, it just never appeared, period.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for aging skin, looks radiant</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels great, and it has a builti-in sunscreen!  </li>
            <li>In case it helps for comparison, I use Lancome&#x27;s Teint Idole Ultra 24H in 110 Ivory (C), and Elizabeth Arden Flawless Finish Mousse Foundation in \\&quot;Shell\\&quot; color.  </li>
            <li>&quot; looked like it would be perfect for ivory or very fair skin tones.  </li>
            <li>and I am always getting compliments on my beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>The texture is great, and the coverage would have been perfect for me if the color had been a good match.  </li>
            <li>It contains SPF, which is great.  </li>
            <li>The sunscreen is a great feature as well.</li>
            <li>I have heard great things about B&amp;B creams,and I trust Loreal for quality products.  </li>
            <li>If it were newer, I think it would have worked great and not have been as oily.</li>
            <li>A very nice under coat before putting on finishing powder.  </li>
            <li>After that, it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li>Age Perfect BB Cream does a very fine job of moisturizing my skin.  </li>
            <li>I was even more impressed with this cream after working a 10 hour shift.</li>
            <li>I tried this product after I noticed my neighbors skin looked so nice!  </li>
            <li>It had a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>very pleased with this product and have experienced no allergic effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is the perfect blend of moisturizer, color enhancer, good coverage and light application.</li>
            <li>She has a fair complexion and found out immediately that the product was not working as intended.  </li>
            <li>Ladies with fair complexions, this isn&#x27;t the BB cream you want.</li>
            <li>But one good plus?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 57, fair, and wrinkly from sun damage as a kid.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-makes skin look naturally gorgeous</li>
            <li>/&gt;-makes skin look naturally gorgeous</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>and I got it here for a good price.  </li>
            <li>I am 45 with fair skin and hazel eyes.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this cream.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;oreal Age Perfect BB has me feeling pretty good at having made it to 43, considering, and looking forward to 53, 63, 73, 83...  Def.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;oreal Age Perfect BB has me feeling pretty good at having made it to 43, considering, and looking forward to 53, 63, 73, 83...  Def.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>My skin looks so healthy and radiant!</li>
            <li>I love this unexpensive BB clream ant it also gives sun protection!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I use it with a light mineral powder and it lasts great all day and keeps my face moist.  </li>
            <li>It gives a nice glow.  </li>
            <li>The skin is not dulled, but not shiny either -- kind of a nice glow.</li>
            <li>Unless they have olive type or warm complextions.  </li>
            <li>I am really loving this BB Cream</li>
            <li>/&gt;It made my face look like it would if I had perfect genes and gorgeous, clear skin.</li>
            <li>&quot; that nicely handles the addition of  foundation and powder on dressier days without feeling SMOTHERED.</li>
            <li>It also works really well if you combine it with the Age Perfect SPF skin cream, which I also received.</li>
            <li>Then I tried Garnier lotion (liked a lot)</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s wonderful if I&#x27;m eating it, but who wants to put ascorbic acid on their skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Titanium dioxide is the cherry on top, for my fair face.</li>
            <li>This is a nice creamy face lotion that provides SPF coverage.  </li>
            <li>All I can say that&#x27;s nice,  is that it kind of smelled</li>
            <li>There is nothing I liked about this product.</li>
            <li>Nice consistency, but it made me a tad orange</li>
            <li>I have a cool pallete  for my coloring and it works great on my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>-- This was the best use I found for it so far.</li>
            <li>I liked this BB cream much better than the Ponds.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find the best product for my 70 year old ex-smoker (23 years) wrinkled skin for some time now.  </li>
            <li>Perfect B&amp;B Cream for Mature Skin should be used sparingly, or else it will look like a mask.</li>
            <li>The color of the light-medium shade does seem to adjust to your own skin tone, but to a lighter shade, especially when used with the Age Perfect moisturizer.</li>
            <li>true BB cream will give you \\&quot;glow\\&quot;, minimize skin imperfections, and if good, can even take the place of your foundation.</li>
            <li>It does have a very light coverage.</li>
            <li>It came out of the tube very light white/pink but adjusted to my skin tone.</li>
            <li>(and I have very light skin).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s greasy, streaky, very light orangy coverage and it smells.</li>
            <li>Goes on very smooth, very light feel.</li>
            <li>This cream has a VERY light tint to it, quite a bit of sunscreen protection, and more fragrance than my perfume.  </li>
            <li>truly it gives the skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>but she&#x27;s sure she had a reaction to this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put it on over my sunscreen and it smooth out imperfections and gives a nice glow.  </li>
            <li>and I like it much better.</li>
            <li>I was sure the L&#x27;Oreal version could be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li>Age Perfect BB Cream Instant</li>
            <li>Radiance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. to be lightly and nicely scented&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The light tint (I have the light/medium) is a nice feature too, I can use this alone or under my foundation.</li>
            <li>I just smeared a bit on my cheek to test the color,and my gosh, the smell is overwhelming, and is still making me almost gag.  </li>
            <li>More proof that L&#x27;Oreal is taking the supermarket brands into the big-boy territory.</li>
            <li>Five years ago you&#x27;d be paying top dollar for this at Neiman Marcus.</li>
            <li>If it was meant to provide light coverage, I didn&#x27;t notice any kind of color tone.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love it.  </li>
            <li>I signed up for the automatic refill on this product, as I can no longer find it in retail stores and I have grown to love it.  </li>
            <li>Now that I have found this product, I make sure I never run out.</li>
            <li>My skin was not only NOT greasy or shiny, but it still looked flawless.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better coverage).</li>
            <li>BUT my skin couldn&#x27;t handle a foundation or powder on top of it without feeling SMOTHERED.</li>
            <li>Instead it gave my skin a nice smooth coverage, and it helped with the undereye circles.</li>
            <li>, it makes your skin feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I looked more closely at the ingredients and noticed that it contained Vitamin C.  </li>
            <li>I love this L&#x27;Oreal BB cream.</li>
            <li>you are experimenting with BB Creams and not looking to fork out a wad of cash for a premium one, I&#x27;d suggest trying the L&#x27;Oreal Magic Skin Beautifier BB Cream.</li>
            <li>You might even try the Maybelline (which was ok but too shiny for my taste).</li>
            <li>Up front, I&#x27;ll say that I LOVE L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s antecedent face brightener:</li>
            <li>Also it \\&quot;transform[s] upon touch to illuminate skin with a healthy glow.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;healthy glow\\&quot; and \\&quot;radiance\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Just have to be sure to spread it evenly.</li>
            <li>You look so healthy.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite BB cream on the market.  </li>
            <li>Age Perfect Instant Radiance BB Cream.  </li>
            <li>Paris Age Perfect BB Cream Instant Radiance, Light/Medium\\</li>
            <li>Paris Age Perfect BB Cream Instant Radiance, Light/Medium\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Love the spf20.</li>
            <li>it makes my reddish complexion more so.</li>
            <li>I have had more than one person comment on my complexion wondering if I am ill/depressed or</li>
            <li>The cream is light, both in color and texture and goes on very smoothly, very easily.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance of \\&quot;L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect BB Cream Instant Radiance, Light/Medium\\&quot; is quite strong.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty fair, I&#x27;ll give the product that.  </li>
            <li>It is best for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has SPF 20, the tube is easy to use and just wish that it worked for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>while somewhat emollient, a light touch of my regular foundation and dusting of a miineral based powder gave me a flawless look</li>
            <li>Perfect Pro-Calcium Radiance Perfector Sheer Tint Moisturizer, Light - 1.7 Oz]]</li>
            <li>Seems to be a good moisturizer and certainly helps with te the sunblock, as if I put it one before a summer outing, I do not put on sunscreen and do not burn.  </li>
            <li>best friend - who first introduced me to the scentless BB cream and still uses it - is not odor sensitive, so she tried it for me.  </li>
            <li>I did put a light dusting of powder on top to take care of a bit of shine.  </li>
            <li>More importantly, it causes rosacea flare ups each time I use it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product that seems to be comparable to department store products that cost 2-3 times as much.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product, but from all the over the counter BB Creams, the Aveeno for Fair to Light skins worked best on my pale skin.</li>
            <li>Still wish it contained the radiance factor that made the original so outstanding.</li>
            <li>found this cream easy to apply and spread evenly over my face.</li>
            <li>cream provides sheer coverage, some nice color (but not for fair skin).  </li>
            <li>The cream has a strong fragrance, which some may not like.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;radiance&amp;#34; part of this is rather strong.  </li>
            <li>An excellent one is NARS Pure Radiant Tinted Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30.</li>
            <li>The owner of a local skin and hair salon stopped what she was doing and commented, \\&quot;You are really a beautiful woman.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t let this Age Perfect Instant Radiance product be your only try of BB creams because there&#x27;s better stuff out there, honest.</li>
            <li>I have a fine rash from using this</li>
            <li>It does have a fairly strong perfume to it so if you want something odor free, this is NOT for you.  </li>
            <li>So I have very dry, but very fair skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While it wasn&#x27;t a huge loss, I wish I hadn&#x27;t bothered.</li>
            <li>This face cream is light and smooth&#x27;s out evenly giving me an even tone.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Its \\&quot;tinted\\&quot; for light to medium skin?</li>
            <li>I used it as a light foundation on a day I was going to be in the sun, and it performed well.  </li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance and absorbs well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried a BB Cream before and was hoping I could use it as a light foundation</li>
            <li>light coverage</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I definitely say this BB Cream is a win.</li>
            <li>light coverage</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I definitely say this BB Cream is a win.</li>
            <li>/&gt;--It spreads smoothly and evenly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This glides on smoothly, covers up a lot of the flaws, and as I said before, helps with the undereye circles.</li>
            <li>I thought it was too light in color</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth a try.ss like torture and more like reifying treasure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, non-greasy, gives no greasy appearance, provides some light coverage and looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks really light when you apply it but within a minute (when it dries) it turns tan/darker.</li>
            <li>This particular one is a nice consistency for a moisturizing, SPF20 sunscreen with a hint of color.</li>
            <li>is my first time to try a BB cream and so far I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li>This BB Cream feels great going on, blends effortlessly, makes last-minute rushes to presentability, on the way to yet another battery of diagnostic tests and therapies seem less like torture and more like reifying treasure.</li>
            <li>I have tried a couple of different CC and BB creams and this one is the BEST buy far!  </li>
            <li>I had found all these assets in a different L&#x27;Oreal&#x27; product, their Skin Beautifier BB Cream, and thought perhaps their Age Perfect BB Cream Instant Radiance version would be even better.</li>
            <li>The coverage is so light it did nothing to hide mild redness.</li>
            <li>The main problem with it is that it has a very strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>Great on my very fair skin, only need a small amount for a lot of radiance.</li>
            <li>and here I am, pretty happy at last.  </li>
            <li>My face instantly looks brighter, even though the cream goes on fairly translucent, it brings a bit of color to the face.</li>
            <li>Studio Secrets Magic B.B. Cream, Light, 1 Fluid Ounce]] and love it,</li>
            <li>/&gt;2. did not turn color and just absorbed into my medium light skin tone</li>
            <li>At 2-1/2 ounces, this is a good-sized tube, so I think it will last a while and is a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This &#x27;cream&#x27; feels quite greasy and it stays oily so that I can&#x27;t really put anything on top.</li>
            <li>However even with the lightest color it makes my fair skin seem a bit yellow.  </li>
            <li>For the cheap price it is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>For the cheap price it is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be looking for another Day Cream with SPF + hydroxy-acids to effectively treat my \\&quot;mature skin issues\\</li>
            <li>This cream goes on clear and adjusts to your skins own color.</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice glow and makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>This is what true BB creams are meant to do.</li>
            <li>This BB cream turns my fair to medium skin a shiny orangish (now reading the purpose on the back of the tube - sunscreen.)</li>
            <li>She thought it would be a real time-saver to be able to use a tinted moisturizer for those days when she doesn&#x27;t want to put on \\&quot;full</li>
            <li>I like that aspect of it, and having a quick out the door option to doing a full blown makeup application.    </li>
            <li>Fragrance is pretty strong, but it didn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li>Secrets\\&quot;) leaves my skin tone even with a subtle pearly finish, minimizes pores,and makes my face look flawless.</li>
            <li>It made my face super greasy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, overall I am satisfied with this product, as it does moisturize well, and coupled with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Beauty Magic Perfecting BB Cream</li>
            <li>For one thing, it is more than twice the normal 1oz size.</li>
            <li>Light tint and coverage-slight shine when first applied-</li>
            <li>The cream has a stronger scent than others I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant or overpowering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting to try one of the new \\&quot;B&amp;B\\&quot; creams and found this product by L&#x27;Oreal easy to apply with no noticeable fragrance and a smooth texture.</li>
            <li>so much so it was almost as shiny as the special makeup products I buy to deliberately create shine (like Watts Up!, etc.).</li>
            <li>Do NOT buy this if you are sensitive to eye-wateringly strong old-lady perfume smells!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you have mature skin, want a good coverage without a product that is sticky.</li>
            <li>The light color is just too orange and dark for my fair skin.</li>
            <li>I dislike strongly scented products and this one is very perfumey.</li>
            <li>post-violence social support is all retail and kind strangers.</li>
            <li>I was in search of a good BB cream for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Blurs my large pores and plumps out fine lines, softens wrinkles.</li>
            <li>tone: not pale but light, tan easily</li>
            <li>Interesting stuff - it starts out looking very light pink but then turns into a suntan color as it soaks in.  </li>
            <li>, if you happen to have more yellow undertones than I do, this might look fine on you, and you might rate it five stars.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s disappointing because overall this has a very nice consistency - kind of a gel/cream, and I did not find the fragrance overpowering but instead quite pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Light to fair skin comes out very dark and tinted orange.  </li>
            <li>So for me, the BB cream concept is great, and I&#x27;ve tried a few.  </li>
            <li>It works really well and not only goes on nice and smooth</li>
            <li>Not as much coverage or SPF as the Missha has, but I like the way this makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>However, when I layer on my Pur Mineral powder foundation, the orange color is muted and the look is more of a soft glow.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s rarely allergic to anything</li>
            <li>Instead of doing one thing really well, most BB creams do multiple things sort of OK.</li>
            <li>It does make my 46 year old skin look better, but that might be the tint and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>However, like others have commented, this L&#x27;Oreal BB Cream for Light/Medium complexions is most definitely NOT for the cool/fair/very light complected.  </li>
            <li>wish more BB creams (and even foundations for that matter) made truly neutral BEIGE shades ranging from light to deep.</li>
            <li>The texture is light, and made my skin look and feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth a try.</li>
            <li>If I had known that this is not uncommon with the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect BB, I would never have ordered it.</li>
            <li>When I applied the new one, my first thought was \\&quot;Well, no one is going to say that I look healthy or glow with this stuff!\\&quot; Indeed . . .</li>
            <li>These reasons, plus the sunscreen, are what I love about the original Sheer Tint Moisturizer, so I decided to try this</li>
            <li>I always apply any kind of cosmetic in natural light (before a window), and so the artificiality was quite apparent.  </li>
            <li>Looked at the other brands and decided that LÓreal Paris would be a good brand to try.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The other, superior Skin Beautifier BB Cream (now also being called \\&quot;Studio</li>
            <li>Instead of waiting, and thinking about it, I decided to write the review right off the cuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But this BB Cream has all the right oils, in just the right proportions in finely-milled-pigment emulsions to make my pores glisten with age-perfected glee.  </li>
            <li>right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the coverage is just right for my now less-than-perfect skin.</li>
            <li>price is definitely right</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a few years and hope it stays around for many more years.</li>
            <li>Light, delicate, moisturizing, and good coverage all in one.</li>
            <li>It offers me a higher SPF, it evens out my skin tone, and I can wear it over any good facial</li>
            <li>to the product itself, yes it&#x27;s a little smelly but evocative of the old-fashioned make-up I loved to smell on my mom and</li>
            <li>First, the cream is tinted.</li>
            <li>I have allergies to most fragrances, so I use only unscented products.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with a BB cream.  </li>
            <li>My 82-year-old mother started wearing this when it first came out</li>
            <li>My first tube just arrived.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it since it first came out.</li>
            <li>However, an hour later my skin looked WAY better than it would have without this BB Cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is now my 2nd favorite BB Cream ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Too many of them have this yellow thing going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, it is now officially hot in Nevada...</li>
            <li>I really like this product and will continue to order!</li>
            <li>(When I wrote them about the problem, they sent coupons for more of the same</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are some things to be aware of if you are looking for a product like this.  </li>
            <li>you want a matte look you will need a finishing powder because this goes on pretty shiny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m docking it a star because the first hour or two my face is too shiny.</li>
            <li>I tried applying a second coat in case more was required for results or staying power, but still nada.</li>
            <li>A glorified colored sunscreen calling itself a BB cream because BB creams are hot</li>
            <li>It gives me more confidence and makes me feel younger.</li>
            <li>As an Asian woman with a fair complexion, I don&#x27;t like to wear heavy makeup and want a more natural, light tone.  </li>
            <li>;).</li>
            <li>This is a light coverage and natural looking cream.</li>
            <li>This BB cream is different from most I have ordered.</li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars only because some sunscreen is better than none.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal discontinued the superb original product (currently rated an average of 4.3 out of 5 stars by 50 Amazon reviewers), and seems to have replaced it with this BB cream (which has a very similar description and ingredients).</li>
            <li>If I put it on after letting my Loreal Age Perfect moisturizer soak in a little, it worked well enough, but again it just didn&#x27;t provide enough coverage for me to feel fully comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty nice alternative to foundation but only for people who have totally clear skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair, and while the cream is sheer (probably too sheer for anyone who needs any kind of serious coverage), it made me look orangey.</li>
            <li>It does not come in a wide variety of shades, so you may have trouble finding a perfect match.</li>
            <li>I was able to apply the cream easily with very little blending.</li>
            <li>For reference, I use Olay Regenerist products, have medium warm skin, dark brown hair and eyes.</li>
            <li>have to agree with others who note that this is probably not best for those with very cool, fair skin color.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t feel this L&#x27;Oreal BB cream is for oily skin types, more for those of us with dry skin.</li>
            <li>It was so easy to apply and blended in instantly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing it less abundantly on store shelves and hope it is not being fazed out.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would mention it is does have quite a strong scent (perfumed).  </li>
            <li>certainly under eye concealer and blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>certainly under eye concealer and blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>People differ, and apparently the original isn&#x27;t for everyone.</li>
            <li>I put it on before being outside a couple of hours instead of using any makeup, and it lasted just fine, even after sweating.</li>
            <li>Much closer to a facial moisturizer  than any type of light foundation.</li>
            <li>No one wants to smell like that throughout the day unless they are at the beach.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the texture and the coverage it provides.  </li>
            <li>Why do all these manufactures put so much fragrance in things?</li>
            <li>I really did.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Add carbomer, an assortment of benz-type things, lin- and cinn- alools to keep errant irritants at bay, and this allergic-to-everything skin of mine is ready for anything.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>the possibility of it leaving that pink/brown color on your face if you apply too much is my reason for deducting a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It bears no resemblance whatsofreaking ever to real BB creams.</li>
            <li>and it is very fragrant.  </li>
            <li>The SPF 20 seems to be enough for me in the Fall, but probably not in the summer when the sun is more direct.</li>
            <li>gave it four stars though because the light skin formula was actually light enough to use on my fair skin without looking unnatural, and it doesn&#x27;t have a yellow tinge like some of the other similar creams.</li>
            <li>B0079HNKLI Smashbox Camera Ready BB Cream SPF 35 Light/Medium]] is still my favorite due to</li>
            <li>/&gt;--SPF of 20 is stronger than many other BB creams out</li>
            <li>7/31/13: As this didn&#x27;t color my skin when used sparingly (which technique worked well with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s original Sheer Tint Moisturizer)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ironically, the day before buying this product, I was wearing the original L&#x27;Oreal Sheer Tint Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Had high hopes for this one, and cheerfully threw some on my face, neck, and chest before a recent morning walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Coupled with the fact that it just pretty much laid on the surface of my face and never absorbed in, I could easily wipe it with a tissue.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was from L&#x27;Oreal, a decent brand, which has other products I have used and been satisfied with.</li>
            <li>It took a long while for the ordering system to get this one right, but boy is this product worth the wait!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lighter than a foundation, which makes it good for every day, when you want a little bit of polish, but aren&#x27;t doing full makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the promises of this product are appealing--boosting skin&#x27;s radiance, diminishing dark spots over time, nourishing the complexion, and strengthening skin along with built-in SPF 20 sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It did go on smoothly, made my skin look nice, and a little goes a long way, but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to put this smelly stuff on my face near my nose and eyes.</li>
            <li>I snuck a little onto the back of my hand and it looked good, plus</li>
            <li>but we still love the regular L&#x27;Oreal cream in the link above.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been seeing a big commotion made over the effects of various BB creams, and I love using L&#x27;Oreal makeup and hair products, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin during the two weeks that I&#x27;ve been using this</li>
            <li>I did not like this particular formula.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I would use this more as a night moisturizer and use something different for daytime.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now getting decent color, so maybe that&#x27;s the trick.</li>
            <li>No one said it was highly perfumed.  </li>
            <li>But 80% of Amazon reviewers praised it highly.</li>
            <li>On me, it&#x27;s good for quick natural, casual no-makeup look with just mascara and lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is not necessarily a bad thing, as long as you know that it is not going to do any one thing particularly well....</li>
            <li>Really gives a youthful look to mature skin and sun protection is a plus.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally wear them all over my face during the daytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After being on your skin for a few minutes it turns into a more foundation-like color with some shimmer.  </li>
            <li>This is more of an everyday BB Cream.</li>
            <li>worth the moderate price.</li>
            <li>worth the moderate price.</li>
            <li>However I can&#x27;t be the only fair person who wants to use this product, so I would recommend the company making a lighter, less yellow shade.  </li>
            <li>Under normal circumstances I would never put this product on my face - the minute I opened it and smelled it, it would go right back to the store.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I tested this in winter, when my skin is more pale.</li>
            <li>Going right back because I know I&#x27;ll never use it again!</li>
            <li>The LÓreal cream was so sheer that it went right into my skin</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t break me out, smells fresh/ mildly floral, long term benefits.</li>
            <li>and, upon application of this actually very nice BB cream, my face turned to a weirdly orange tone or unnatural flesh color.  </li>
            <li>Pond&#x27;s cream evened my skin tone, possibly due to the light tint and the zinc oxide.  </li>
            <li>And sometimes that&#x27;s bolstered by products that live up to their names.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer for mature skin comes out of the tube a light pink but blends in to your skin.</li>
            <li>Reasserting one&#x27;s place in the world with that there as your roster of recent accomplishments, all the components of a once fierce and accomplished self kind of shattered and scattered somewhere back there beyond the injuries that left the massive blood clots that once mobilized took this toll...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several days and like it very much.</li>
            <li>I could also call this Nars tinted moisturizer a BB cream, because it does the exact same thing that this L&#x27;Oreal product does</li>
            <li>Overall I like the moisturizing aspect of it, but can&#x27;t use it anymore because it makes me look funny.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t near as oily or shiny as it normally is.</li>
            <li>I am calling them next week to get a refund...and they were 50% higher in price than the Pond&#x27;s too.</li>
            <li>When I first put it on, it was alarming - very orangy and greasy-looking (though it was not greasy, just shiny).</li>
            <li>Age Perfect BB Cream Instant Radiance, Light/Medium\\&quot; was a major disappointment.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t notice it - perhaps it&#x27;s covering a little, and that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also lazy about cosmetics since I&#x27;m cute enough but want to look reasonably polished.  </li>
            <li>This helps with uneven coloring, spots and fine lines.</li>
            <li>then I use a brush over my face and cheeks for a natural look.  </li>
            <li>This give me the natural look I want without the look of being &amp;#34;made up.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I had to scrub my hand for quite some time before the smell wasn&#x27;t an issue when I got it near my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face felt moisturized and soft, not greasy or oily.</li>
            <li>(its got that &#x27;old lady&#x27; smell)...</li>
            <li>I accidentally got a dot near my eye, and it watered for HOURS.</li>
            <li>I like bb creams a lot and this is my least favorite of about 10 that ive tried.</li>
            <li>Finally this is a bb cream that has a very shiny dewy finish</li>
            <li>I am in my early 50&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I have highly sensitive skin and had no issues with redness or irritation.</li>
            <li>I wanted something to smooth out uneven tone and provide a stabilizing layer for my foundation.</li>
            <li>This BB cream goes on well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin or eyes.  </li>
            <li>Believe me that is quite a testimonial being 67 years old.  </li>
            <li>and I will be using it for when I want a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want to look like a natural, ageless beauty then this is your BB</li>
            <li>This cream is targeted toward mature women and is supposed to even out your complexion and fade spots over time.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft like a moisturizer&#x27;s been used</li>
            <li>I think the reason for this may be because I have mature skin, and so I have all kinds of imperfections that need to be covered.</li>
            <li>it was marked way</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cover nor did it really even things out, unless you call my face being orange while my neck was white, &#x27;even&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not great at accepting flattery, in the wake of [domestic violence], but I can reflect it around where it might be more useful.  </li>
            <li>It kind of just made me angry with the whole experience.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really provide much coverage - my dark under-eye circles and rosacea are still fairly obvious, but it does kind of even my skin tone and make the blotches less obvious.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, requires very little product to get results, but remained \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; feeling throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited by the transformation from pale to more glow-y as I spread it over my skin, but the magic went away when the greasy color that bloomed on my eagerly waiting face turned out to look like bad bronzer from the &#x27;80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin extremely moisturized and fresh.</li>
            <li>It is the right texture, color, and coverage (not much) that she needs and loves, so I&#x27;m buying up!</li>
            <li>because it is kind of thick and on the oily parts of my face, it&#x27;s a little too much.</li>
            <li>The soft, pale petal pink color disappeared nicely when applied as a test to my inner wrist.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had that problem with the original, but I use very little and massage it in well.</li>
            <li>Once I opened the tube, I knew enough not to even attempt putting it on my face because I&#x27;m very sensitive to odors.</li>
            <li>one smells, like major sunscreen.</li>
            <li>BB stands for &amp;#34;Beauty Balm&amp;#34; and it most usually contains multiple ingredients to achieve multiple results.</li>
            <li>Basically, I&#x27;ll toss this in the drawer with my other sunscreen, and use this for days when I need to be in the sun for yard work or home repairs, because it&#x27;s decent enough coverage for an emergency run to the hardware store, not so much for going out to eat.</li>
            <li>I use several different L&#x27;Oreal moisturizing products and have come to expect a high end product with a drugstore price tag.</li>
            <li>Havent really used it long enough to tell if the &amp;#34;age-preventing&amp;#34; claims prove out, but I do like using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Except.....the L&#x27;Oreal product is touted for mature skin and has ingredients such as Soy Seed and Vitamin C.</li>
            <li>so I could stop using my Bare Minerals, but no go.</li>
            <li>This item seemed old and not fully mixed well.</li>
            <li>Even if you are careful about not getting any on your lips, this product has an aftertaste which i think shows it is really soaking into one&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li>Each time (and there will be no further tries) - each time developed bumps and skin got much</li>
            <li>put it on in the early evening, no big deal, it was orange-ish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible, but just not great either.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal rarely disappoints, but this one was a misfire for both of us.</li>
            <li>Usually she will try these types of products for at least a week to give it a fair shot.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-looks slightly shinny when you first apply it</li>
            <li>/&gt;-looks slightly shinny when you first apply it</li>
            <li>The finish is just much nicer than what I received with the other cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m now considerably less cheerful:  One of my favorite grey t-shirts is now permanently stained as if I had carelessly smeared self-tanning cream on it.  </li>
            <li>The color is subtle, but does smooth out my complexion some.</li>
            <li>Me: Late 40&#x27;s and dry sensitive skin--cool light skin tone.</li>
            <li>everytime a good product comes out someone tries to improve it and fails...</li>
            <li>It is not as covering as foundation, and it is a little sticky at first.  </li>
            <li>Works well as a quick touch of glow on otherwise dull skin.</li>
            <li>Generally, a BB cream is a facial moisturizer that contains sun screen and a foundation-like tint so that instead of wearing three products, you only need one.</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s a decent product for the price range, but people should not expect miracles from it or any other age related products, regardless of price.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to judge the diminishment of dark spots, but I am willing to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Age</li>
            <li>It is on the thick side as it comes out of the tube and smooths on face easily, but the tint doesn&#x27;t show as she applied it, so no matter how careful she was to put it on evenly</li>
            <li>it goes on nice but its fragrance is way too strong, when it adjust the color, its terrible and blotchy.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I missed two very important details.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The daily use of sunscreen prevents dark spots from darkening further so using this for it&#x27;s SPF20 on casual days IS a good thing.</li>
            <li>It is better than other BB and CC creams I have tried, but not nearly as good as Pond&#x27;s Radiance BB+ cream.</li>
            <li>but I certainly smelled it, and in a few minutes, a perfume-headache was starting to blossom.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I like the Loreal BB cream that&#x27;s not the age perfect formula.</li>
            <li> While the light/medium shade blended perfectly -- which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one -- this product is NOT for anybody with oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect BB Cream for 2 years, won&#x27;t buy anything else.  </li>
            <li> color is a perfect match for my light-medium skin that has reddish undertones.</li>
            <li> At it&#x27;s  best, it is a HIT for my olive complexion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Missha Perfect Cover BB Cream from Korea, as well as some drugstore brands made by Maybelline and CoverGirl.</li>
            <li> I had been purchasing Pond&#x27;s BB cream and was very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Perfect one, except the Youth Code one did not disappear, it just never appeared, period.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for aging skin, looks radiant</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels great, and it has a builti-in sunscreen!  </li>
            <li> In case it helps for comparison, I use Lancome&#x27;s Teint Idole Ultra 24H in 110 Ivory (C), and Elizabeth Arden Flawless Finish Mousse Foundation in \\&quot;Shell\\&quot; color.  </li>
            <li> &quot; looked like it would be perfect for ivory or very fair skin tones.  </li>
            <li> and I am always getting compliments on my beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> The texture is great, and the coverage would have been perfect for me if the color had been a good match.  </li>
            <li> It contains SPF, which is great.  </li>
            <li> The sunscreen is a great feature as well.</li>
            <li> I have heard great things about B&amp;B creams,and I trust Loreal for quality products.  </li>
            <li> If it were newer, I think it would have worked great and not have been as oily.</li>
            <li> A very nice under coat before putting on finishing powder.  </li>
            <li> After that, it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li> Age Perfect BB Cream does a very fine job of moisturizing my skin.  </li>
            <li> I was even more impressed with this cream after working a 10 hour shift.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after I noticed my neighbors skin looked so nice!  </li>
            <li> It had a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> very pleased with this product and have experienced no allergic effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is the perfect blend of moisturizer, color enhancer, good coverage and light application.</li>
            <li> She has a fair complexion and found out immediately that the product was not working as intended.  </li>
            <li> Ladies with fair complexions, this isn&#x27;t the BB cream you want.</li>
            <li> But one good plus?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 57, fair, and wrinkly from sun damage as a kid.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-makes skin look naturally gorgeous</li>
            <li> /&gt;-makes skin look naturally gorgeous</li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> and I got it here for a good price.  </li>
            <li> I am 45 with fair skin and hazel eyes.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with this cream.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;oreal Age Perfect BB has me feeling pretty good at having made it to 43, considering, and looking forward to 53, 63, 73, 83...  Def.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;oreal Age Perfect BB has me feeling pretty good at having made it to 43, considering, and looking forward to 53, 63, 73, 83...  Def.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> My skin looks so healthy and radiant!</li>
            <li> I love this unexpensive BB clream ant it also gives sun protection!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I use it with a light mineral powder and it lasts great all day and keeps my face moist.  </li>
            <li> It gives a nice glow.  </li>
            <li> The skin is not dulled, but not shiny either -- kind of a nice glow.</li>
            <li> Unless they have olive type or warm complextions.  </li>
            <li> I am really loving this BB Cream</li>
            <li> /&gt;It made my face look like it would if I had perfect genes and gorgeous, clear skin.</li>
            <li> &quot; that nicely handles the addition of  foundation and powder on dressier days without feeling SMOTHERED.</li>
            <li> It also works really well if you combine it with the Age Perfect SPF skin cream, which I also received.</li>
            <li> Then I tried Garnier lotion (liked a lot)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s wonderful if I&#x27;m eating it, but who wants to put ascorbic acid on their skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Titanium dioxide is the cherry on top, for my fair face.</li>
            <li> This is a nice creamy face lotion that provides SPF coverage.  </li>
            <li> All I can say that&#x27;s nice,  is that it kind of smelled</li>
            <li> There is nothing I liked about this product.</li>
            <li> Nice consistency, but it made me a tad orange</li>
            <li> I have a cool pallete  for my coloring and it works great on my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> -- This was the best use I found for it so far.</li>
            <li> I liked this BB cream much better than the Ponds.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find the best product for my 70 year old ex-smoker (23 years) wrinkled skin for some time now.  </li>
            <li> Perfect B&amp;B Cream for Mature Skin should be used sparingly, or else it will look like a mask.</li>
            <li> The color of the light-medium shade does seem to adjust to your own skin tone, but to a lighter shade, especially when used with the Age Perfect moisturizer.</li>
            <li> true BB cream will give you \\&quot;glow\\&quot;, minimize skin imperfections, and if good, can even take the place of your foundation.</li>
            <li> It does have a very light coverage.</li>
            <li> It came out of the tube very light white/pink but adjusted to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> (and I have very light skin).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s greasy, streaky, very light orangy coverage and it smells.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smooth, very light feel.</li>
            <li> This cream has a VERY light tint to it, quite a bit of sunscreen protection, and more fragrance than my perfume.  </li>
            <li> truly it gives the skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> but she&#x27;s sure she had a reaction to this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put it on over my sunscreen and it smooth out imperfections and gives a nice glow.  </li>
            <li> and I like it much better.</li>
            <li> I was sure the L&#x27;Oreal version could be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> Age Perfect BB Cream Instant</li>
            <li> Radiance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. to be lightly and nicely scented&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The light tint (I have the light/medium) is a nice feature too, I can use this alone or under my foundation.</li>
            <li> I just smeared a bit on my cheek to test the color,and my gosh, the smell is overwhelming, and is still making me almost gag.  </li>
            <li> More proof that L&#x27;Oreal is taking the supermarket brands into the big-boy territory.</li>
            <li> Five years ago you&#x27;d be paying top dollar for this at Neiman Marcus.</li>
            <li> If it was meant to provide light coverage, I didn&#x27;t notice any kind of color tone.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it.  </li>
            <li> I signed up for the automatic refill on this product, as I can no longer find it in retail stores and I have grown to love it.  </li>
            <li> Now that I have found this product, I make sure I never run out.</li>
            <li> My skin was not only NOT greasy or shiny, but it still looked flawless.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better coverage).</li>
            <li> BUT my skin couldn&#x27;t handle a foundation or powder on top of it without feeling SMOTHERED.</li>
            <li> Instead it gave my skin a nice smooth coverage, and it helped with the undereye circles.</li>
            <li> , it makes your skin feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I looked more closely at the ingredients and noticed that it contained Vitamin C.  </li>
            <li> I love this L&#x27;Oreal BB cream.</li>
            <li> you are experimenting with BB Creams and not looking to fork out a wad of cash for a premium one, I&#x27;d suggest trying the L&#x27;Oreal Magic Skin Beautifier BB Cream.</li>
            <li> You might even try the Maybelline (which was ok but too shiny for my taste).</li>
            <li> Up front, I&#x27;ll say that I LOVE L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s antecedent face brightener:</li>
            <li> Also it \\&quot;transform[s] upon touch to illuminate skin with a healthy glow.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;healthy glow\\&quot; and \\&quot;radiance\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Just have to be sure to spread it evenly.</li>
            <li> You look so healthy.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite BB cream on the market.  </li>
            <li> Age Perfect Instant Radiance BB Cream.  </li>
            <li> Paris Age Perfect BB Cream Instant Radiance, Light/Medium\\</li>
            <li> Paris Age Perfect BB Cream Instant Radiance, Light/Medium\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Love the spf20.</li>
            <li> it makes my reddish complexion more so.</li>
            <li> I have had more than one person comment on my complexion wondering if I am ill/depressed or</li>
            <li> The cream is light, both in color and texture and goes on very smoothly, very easily.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance of \\&quot;L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect BB Cream Instant Radiance, Light/Medium\\&quot; is quite strong.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty fair, I&#x27;ll give the product that.  </li>
            <li> It is best for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I love that it has SPF 20, the tube is easy to use and just wish that it worked for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> while somewhat emollient, a light touch of my regular foundation and dusting of a miineral based powder gave me a flawless look</li>
            <li> Perfect Pro-Calcium Radiance Perfector Sheer Tint Moisturizer, Light - 1.7 Oz]]</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good moisturizer and certainly helps with te the sunblock, as if I put it one before a summer outing, I do not put on sunscreen and do not burn.  </li>
            <li> best friend - who first introduced me to the scentless BB cream and still uses it - is not odor sensitive, so she tried it for me.  </li>
            <li> I did put a light dusting of powder on top to take care of a bit of shine.  </li>
            <li> More importantly, it causes rosacea flare ups each time I use it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product that seems to be comparable to department store products that cost 2-3 times as much.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, but from all the over the counter BB Creams, the Aveeno for Fair to Light skins worked best on my pale skin.</li>
            <li> Still wish it contained the radiance factor that made the original so outstanding.</li>
            <li> found this cream easy to apply and spread evenly over my face.</li>
            <li> cream provides sheer coverage, some nice color (but not for fair skin).  </li>
            <li> The cream has a strong fragrance, which some may not like.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;radiance&amp;#34; part of this is rather strong.  </li>
            <li> An excellent one is NARS Pure Radiant Tinted Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30.</li>
            <li> The owner of a local skin and hair salon stopped what she was doing and commented, \\&quot;You are really a beautiful woman.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t let this Age Perfect Instant Radiance product be your only try of BB creams because there&#x27;s better stuff out there, honest.</li>
            <li> I have a fine rash from using this</li>
            <li> It does have a fairly strong perfume to it so if you want something odor free, this is NOT for you.  </li>
            <li> So I have very dry, but very fair skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While it wasn&#x27;t a huge loss, I wish I hadn&#x27;t bothered.</li>
            <li> This face cream is light and smooth&#x27;s out evenly giving me an even tone.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Its \\&quot;tinted\\&quot; for light to medium skin?</li>
            <li> I used it as a light foundation on a day I was going to be in the sun, and it performed well.  </li>
            <li> It has a light fragrance and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a BB Cream before and was hoping I could use it as a light foundation</li>
            <li> light coverage</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I definitely say this BB Cream is a win.</li>
            <li> light coverage</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I definitely say this BB Cream is a win.</li>
            <li> /&gt;--It spreads smoothly and evenly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This glides on smoothly, covers up a lot of the flaws, and as I said before, helps with the undereye circles.</li>
            <li> I thought it was too light in color</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth a try.ss like torture and more like reifying treasure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, non-greasy, gives no greasy appearance, provides some light coverage and looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks really light when you apply it but within a minute (when it dries) it turns tan/darker.</li>
            <li> This particular one is a nice consistency for a moisturizing, SPF20 sunscreen with a hint of color.</li>
            <li> is my first time to try a BB cream and so far I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This BB Cream feels great going on, blends effortlessly, makes last-minute rushes to presentability, on the way to yet another battery of diagnostic tests and therapies seem less like torture and more like reifying treasure.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of different CC and BB creams and this one is the BEST buy far!  </li>
            <li> I had found all these assets in a different L&#x27;Oreal&#x27; product, their Skin Beautifier BB Cream, and thought perhaps their Age Perfect BB Cream Instant Radiance version would be even better.</li>
            <li> The coverage is so light it did nothing to hide mild redness.</li>
            <li> The main problem with it is that it has a very strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great on my very fair skin, only need a small amount for a lot of radiance.</li>
            <li> and here I am, pretty happy at last.  </li>
            <li> My face instantly looks brighter, even though the cream goes on fairly translucent, it brings a bit of color to the face.</li>
            <li> Studio Secrets Magic B.B. Cream, Light, 1 Fluid Ounce]] and love it,</li>
            <li> /&gt;2. did not turn color and just absorbed into my medium light skin tone</li>
            <li> At 2-1/2 ounces, this is a good-sized tube, so I think it will last a while and is a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This &#x27;cream&#x27; feels quite greasy and it stays oily so that I can&#x27;t really put anything on top.</li>
            <li> However even with the lightest color it makes my fair skin seem a bit yellow.  </li>
            <li> For the cheap price it is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> For the cheap price it is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be looking for another Day Cream with SPF + hydroxy-acids to effectively treat my \\&quot;mature skin issues\\</li>
            <li> This cream goes on clear and adjusts to your skins own color.</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice glow and makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> This is what true BB creams are meant to do.</li>
            <li> This BB cream turns my fair to medium skin a shiny orangish (now reading the purpose on the back of the tube - sunscreen.)</li>
            <li> She thought it would be a real time-saver to be able to use a tinted moisturizer for those days when she doesn&#x27;t want to put on \\&quot;full</li>
            <li> I like that aspect of it, and having a quick out the door option to doing a full blown makeup application.    </li>
            <li> Fragrance is pretty strong, but it didn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> Secrets\\&quot;) leaves my skin tone even with a subtle pearly finish, minimizes pores,and makes my face look flawless.</li>
            <li> It made my face super greasy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, overall I am satisfied with this product, as it does moisturize well, and coupled with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Beauty Magic Perfecting BB Cream</li>
            <li> For one thing, it is more than twice the normal 1oz size.</li>
            <li> Light tint and coverage-slight shine when first applied-</li>
            <li> The cream has a stronger scent than others I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant or overpowering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try one of the new \\&quot;B&amp;B\\&quot; creams and found this product by L&#x27;Oreal easy to apply with no noticeable fragrance and a smooth texture.</li>
            <li> so much so it was almost as shiny as the special makeup products I buy to deliberately create shine (like Watts Up!, etc.).</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy this if you are sensitive to eye-wateringly strong old-lady perfume smells!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you have mature skin, want a good coverage without a product that is sticky.</li>
            <li> The light color is just too orange and dark for my fair skin.</li>
            <li> I dislike strongly scented products and this one is very perfumey.</li>
            <li> post-violence social support is all retail and kind strangers.</li>
            <li> I was in search of a good BB cream for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Blurs my large pores and plumps out fine lines, softens wrinkles.</li>
            <li> tone: not pale but light, tan easily</li>
            <li> Interesting stuff - it starts out looking very light pink but then turns into a suntan color as it soaks in.  </li>
            <li> , if you happen to have more yellow undertones than I do, this might look fine on you, and you might rate it five stars.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s disappointing because overall this has a very nice consistency - kind of a gel/cream, and I did not find the fragrance overpowering but instead quite pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Light to fair skin comes out very dark and tinted orange.  </li>
            <li> So for me, the BB cream concept is great, and I&#x27;ve tried a few.  </li>
            <li> It works really well and not only goes on nice and smooth</li>
            <li> Not as much coverage or SPF as the Missha has, but I like the way this makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> However, when I layer on my Pur Mineral powder foundation, the orange color is muted and the look is more of a soft glow.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s rarely allergic to anything</li>
            <li> Instead of doing one thing really well, most BB creams do multiple things sort of OK.</li>
            <li> It does make my 46 year old skin look better, but that might be the tint and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> However, like others have commented, this L&#x27;Oreal BB Cream for Light/Medium complexions is most definitely NOT for the cool/fair/very light complected.  </li>
            <li> wish more BB creams (and even foundations for that matter) made truly neutral BEIGE shades ranging from light to deep.</li>
            <li> The texture is light, and made my skin look and feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth a try.</li>
            <li> If I had known that this is not uncommon with the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect BB, I would never have ordered it.</li>
            <li> When I applied the new one, my first thought was \\&quot;Well, no one is going to say that I look healthy or glow with this stuff!\\&quot; Indeed . . .</li>
            <li> These reasons, plus the sunscreen, are what I love about the original Sheer Tint Moisturizer, so I decided to try this</li>
            <li> I always apply any kind of cosmetic in natural light (before a window), and so the artificiality was quite apparent.  </li>
            <li> Looked at the other brands and decided that LÓreal Paris would be a good brand to try.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The other, superior Skin Beautifier BB Cream (now also being called \\&quot;Studio</li>
            <li> Instead of waiting, and thinking about it, I decided to write the review right off the cuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this BB Cream has all the right oils, in just the right proportions in finely-milled-pigment emulsions to make my pores glisten with age-perfected glee.  </li>
            <li> right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the coverage is just right for my now less-than-perfect skin.</li>
            <li> price is definitely right</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years and hope it stays around for many more years.</li>
            <li> Light, delicate, moisturizing, and good coverage all in one.</li>
            <li> It offers me a higher SPF, it evens out my skin tone, and I can wear it over any good facial</li>
            <li> to the product itself, yes it&#x27;s a little smelly but evocative of the old-fashioned make-up I loved to smell on my mom and</li>
            <li> First, the cream is tinted.</li>
            <li> I have allergies to most fragrances, so I use only unscented products.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a BB cream.  </li>
            <li> My 82-year-old mother started wearing this when it first came out</li>
            <li> My first tube just arrived.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it since it first came out.</li>
            <li> However, an hour later my skin looked WAY better than it would have without this BB Cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is now my 2nd favorite BB Cream ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Too many of them have this yellow thing going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, it is now officially hot in Nevada...</li>
            <li> I really like this product and will continue to order!</li>
            <li> (When I wrote them about the problem, they sent coupons for more of the same</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are some things to be aware of if you are looking for a product like this.  </li>
            <li> you want a matte look you will need a finishing powder because this goes on pretty shiny.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m docking it a star because the first hour or two my face is too shiny.</li>
            <li> I tried applying a second coat in case more was required for results or staying power, but still nada.</li>
            <li> A glorified colored sunscreen calling itself a BB cream because BB creams are hot</li>
            <li> It gives me more confidence and makes me feel younger.</li>
            <li> As an Asian woman with a fair complexion, I don&#x27;t like to wear heavy makeup and want a more natural, light tone.  </li>
            <li> ;).</li>
            <li> This is a light coverage and natural looking cream.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is different from most I have ordered.</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars only because some sunscreen is better than none.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal discontinued the superb original product (currently rated an average of 4.3 out of 5 stars by 50 Amazon reviewers), and seems to have replaced it with this BB cream (which has a very similar description and ingredients).</li>
            <li> If I put it on after letting my Loreal Age Perfect moisturizer soak in a little, it worked well enough, but again it just didn&#x27;t provide enough coverage for me to feel fully comfortable.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty nice alternative to foundation but only for people who have totally clear skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair, and while the cream is sheer (probably too sheer for anyone who needs any kind of serious coverage), it made me look orangey.</li>
            <li> It does not come in a wide variety of shades, so you may have trouble finding a perfect match.</li>
            <li> I was able to apply the cream easily with very little blending.</li>
            <li> For reference, I use Olay Regenerist products, have medium warm skin, dark brown hair and eyes.</li>
            <li> have to agree with others who note that this is probably not best for those with very cool, fair skin color.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t feel this L&#x27;Oreal BB cream is for oily skin types, more for those of us with dry skin.</li>
            <li> It was so easy to apply and blended in instantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing it less abundantly on store shelves and hope it is not being fazed out.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would mention it is does have quite a strong scent (perfumed).  </li>
            <li> certainly under eye concealer and blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> certainly under eye concealer and blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> People differ, and apparently the original isn&#x27;t for everyone.</li>
            <li> I put it on before being outside a couple of hours instead of using any makeup, and it lasted just fine, even after sweating.</li>
            <li> Much closer to a facial moisturizer  than any type of light foundation.</li>
            <li> No one wants to smell like that throughout the day unless they are at the beach.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the texture and the coverage it provides.  </li>
            <li> Why do all these manufactures put so much fragrance in things?</li>
            <li> I really did.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Add carbomer, an assortment of benz-type things, lin- and cinn- alools to keep errant irritants at bay, and this allergic-to-everything skin of mine is ready for anything.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> the possibility of it leaving that pink/brown color on your face if you apply too much is my reason for deducting a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It bears no resemblance whatsofreaking ever to real BB creams.</li>
            <li> and it is very fragrant.  </li>
            <li> The SPF 20 seems to be enough for me in the Fall, but probably not in the summer when the sun is more direct.</li>
            <li> gave it four stars though because the light skin formula was actually light enough to use on my fair skin without looking unnatural, and it doesn&#x27;t have a yellow tinge like some of the other similar creams.</li>
            <li> B0079HNKLI Smashbox Camera Ready BB Cream SPF 35 Light/Medium]] is still my favorite due to</li>
            <li> /&gt;--SPF of 20 is stronger than many other BB creams out</li>
            <li> 7/31/13: As this didn&#x27;t color my skin when used sparingly (which technique worked well with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s original Sheer Tint Moisturizer)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ironically, the day before buying this product, I was wearing the original L&#x27;Oreal Sheer Tint Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this one, and cheerfully threw some on my face, neck, and chest before a recent morning walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Coupled with the fact that it just pretty much laid on the surface of my face and never absorbed in, I could easily wipe it with a tissue.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was from L&#x27;Oreal, a decent brand, which has other products I have used and been satisfied with.</li>
            <li> It took a long while for the ordering system to get this one right, but boy is this product worth the wait!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter than a foundation, which makes it good for every day, when you want a little bit of polish, but aren&#x27;t doing full makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the promises of this product are appealing--boosting skin&#x27;s radiance, diminishing dark spots over time, nourishing the complexion, and strengthening skin along with built-in SPF 20 sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It did go on smoothly, made my skin look nice, and a little goes a long way, but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to put this smelly stuff on my face near my nose and eyes.</li>
            <li> I snuck a little onto the back of my hand and it looked good, plus</li>
            <li> but we still love the regular L&#x27;Oreal cream in the link above.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been seeing a big commotion made over the effects of various BB creams, and I love using L&#x27;Oreal makeup and hair products, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin during the two weeks that I&#x27;ve been using this</li>
            <li> I did not like this particular formula.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I would use this more as a night moisturizer and use something different for daytime.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now getting decent color, so maybe that&#x27;s the trick.</li>
            <li> No one said it was highly perfumed.  </li>
            <li> But 80% of Amazon reviewers praised it highly.</li>
            <li> On me, it&#x27;s good for quick natural, casual no-makeup look with just mascara and lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not necessarily a bad thing, as long as you know that it is not going to do any one thing particularly well....</li>
            <li> Really gives a youthful look to mature skin and sun protection is a plus.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally wear them all over my face during the daytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After being on your skin for a few minutes it turns into a more foundation-like color with some shimmer.  </li>
            <li> This is more of an everyday BB Cream.</li>
            <li> worth the moderate price.</li>
            <li> worth the moderate price.</li>
            <li> However I can&#x27;t be the only fair person who wants to use this product, so I would recommend the company making a lighter, less yellow shade.  </li>
            <li> Under normal circumstances I would never put this product on my face - the minute I opened it and smelled it, it would go right back to the store.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I tested this in winter, when my skin is more pale.</li>
            <li> Going right back because I know I&#x27;ll never use it again!</li>
            <li> The LÓreal cream was so sheer that it went right into my skin</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t break me out, smells fresh/ mildly floral, long term benefits.</li>
            <li> and, upon application of this actually very nice BB cream, my face turned to a weirdly orange tone or unnatural flesh color.  </li>
            <li> Pond&#x27;s cream evened my skin tone, possibly due to the light tint and the zinc oxide.  </li>
            <li> And sometimes that&#x27;s bolstered by products that live up to their names.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer for mature skin comes out of the tube a light pink but blends in to your skin.</li>
            <li> Reasserting one&#x27;s place in the world with that there as your roster of recent accomplishments, all the components of a once fierce and accomplished self kind of shattered and scattered somewhere back there beyond the injuries that left the massive blood clots that once mobilized took this toll...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several days and like it very much.</li>
            <li> I could also call this Nars tinted moisturizer a BB cream, because it does the exact same thing that this L&#x27;Oreal product does</li>
            <li> Overall I like the moisturizing aspect of it, but can&#x27;t use it anymore because it makes me look funny.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t near as oily or shiny as it normally is.</li>
            <li> I am calling them next week to get a refund...and they were 50% higher in price than the Pond&#x27;s too.</li>
            <li> When I first put it on, it was alarming - very orangy and greasy-looking (though it was not greasy, just shiny).</li>
            <li> Age Perfect BB Cream Instant Radiance, Light/Medium\\&quot; was a major disappointment.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t notice it - perhaps it&#x27;s covering a little, and that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also lazy about cosmetics since I&#x27;m cute enough but want to look reasonably polished.  </li>
            <li> This helps with uneven coloring, spots and fine lines.</li>
            <li> then I use a brush over my face and cheeks for a natural look.  </li>
            <li> This give me the natural look I want without the look of being &amp;#34;made up.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I had to scrub my hand for quite some time before the smell wasn&#x27;t an issue when I got it near my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face felt moisturized and soft, not greasy or oily.</li>
            <li> (its got that &#x27;old lady&#x27; smell)...</li>
            <li> I accidentally got a dot near my eye, and it watered for HOURS.</li>
            <li> I like bb creams a lot and this is my least favorite of about 10 that ive tried.</li>
            <li> Finally this is a bb cream that has a very shiny dewy finish</li>
            <li> I am in my early 50&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I have highly sensitive skin and had no issues with redness or irritation.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to smooth out uneven tone and provide a stabilizing layer for my foundation.</li>
            <li> This BB cream goes on well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin or eyes.  </li>
            <li> Believe me that is quite a testimonial being 67 years old.  </li>
            <li> and I will be using it for when I want a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want to look like a natural, ageless beauty then this is your BB</li>
            <li> This cream is targeted toward mature women and is supposed to even out your complexion and fade spots over time.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft like a moisturizer&#x27;s been used</li>
            <li> I think the reason for this may be because I have mature skin, and so I have all kinds of imperfections that need to be covered.</li>
            <li> it was marked way</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cover nor did it really even things out, unless you call my face being orange while my neck was white, &#x27;even&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not great at accepting flattery, in the wake of [domestic violence], but I can reflect it around where it might be more useful.  </li>
            <li> It kind of just made me angry with the whole experience.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really provide much coverage - my dark under-eye circles and rosacea are still fairly obvious, but it does kind of even my skin tone and make the blotches less obvious.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, requires very little product to get results, but remained \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; feeling throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited by the transformation from pale to more glow-y as I spread it over my skin, but the magic went away when the greasy color that bloomed on my eagerly waiting face turned out to look like bad bronzer from the &#x27;80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin extremely moisturized and fresh.</li>
            <li> It is the right texture, color, and coverage (not much) that she needs and loves, so I&#x27;m buying up!</li>
            <li> because it is kind of thick and on the oily parts of my face, it&#x27;s a little too much.</li>
            <li> The soft, pale petal pink color disappeared nicely when applied as a test to my inner wrist.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had that problem with the original, but I use very little and massage it in well.</li>
            <li> Once I opened the tube, I knew enough not to even attempt putting it on my face because I&#x27;m very sensitive to odors.</li>
            <li> one smells, like major sunscreen.</li>
            <li> BB stands for &amp;#34;Beauty Balm&amp;#34; and it most usually contains multiple ingredients to achieve multiple results.</li>
            <li> Basically, I&#x27;ll toss this in the drawer with my other sunscreen, and use this for days when I need to be in the sun for yard work or home repairs, because it&#x27;s decent enough coverage for an emergency run to the hardware store, not so much for going out to eat.</li>
            <li> I use several different L&#x27;Oreal moisturizing products and have come to expect a high end product with a drugstore price tag.</li>
            <li> Havent really used it long enough to tell if the &amp;#34;age-preventing&amp;#34; claims prove out, but I do like using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Except.....the L&#x27;Oreal product is touted for mature skin and has ingredients such as Soy Seed and Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> so I could stop using my Bare Minerals, but no go.</li>
            <li> This item seemed old and not fully mixed well.</li>
            <li> Even if you are careful about not getting any on your lips, this product has an aftertaste which i think shows it is really soaking into one&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li> Each time (and there will be no further tries) - each time developed bumps and skin got much</li>
            <li> put it on in the early evening, no big deal, it was orange-ish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horrible, but just not great either.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal rarely disappoints, but this one was a misfire for both of us.</li>
            <li> Usually she will try these types of products for at least a week to give it a fair shot.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-looks slightly shinny when you first apply it</li>
            <li> /&gt;-looks slightly shinny when you first apply it</li>
            <li> The finish is just much nicer than what I received with the other cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m now considerably less cheerful:  One of my favorite grey t-shirts is now permanently stained as if I had carelessly smeared self-tanning cream on it.  </li>
            <li> The color is subtle, but does smooth out my complexion some.</li>
            <li> Me: Late 40&#x27;s and dry sensitive skin--cool light skin tone.</li>
            <li> everytime a good product comes out someone tries to improve it and fails...</li>
            <li> It is not as covering as foundation, and it is a little sticky at first.  </li>
            <li> Works well as a quick touch of glow on otherwise dull skin.</li>
            <li> Generally, a BB cream is a facial moisturizer that contains sun screen and a foundation-like tint so that instead of wearing three products, you only need one.</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s a decent product for the price range, but people should not expect miracles from it or any other age related products, regardless of price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to judge the diminishment of dark spots, but I am willing to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Age</li>
            <li> It is on the thick side as it comes out of the tube and smooths on face easily, but the tint doesn&#x27;t show as she applied it, so no matter how careful she was to put it on evenly</li>
            <li> it goes on nice but its fragrance is way too strong, when it adjust the color, its terrible and blotchy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I missed two very important details.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The daily use of sunscreen prevents dark spots from darkening further so using this for it&#x27;s SPF20 on casual days IS a good thing.</li>
            <li> It is better than other BB and CC creams I have tried, but not nearly as good as Pond&#x27;s Radiance BB+ cream.</li>
            <li> but I certainly smelled it, and in a few minutes, a perfume-headache was starting to blossom.  </li>
            <li> This made my normal skin a greasy shiny mess.  </li>
            <li> Beyond that, using this as a treatment and waiting 8 weeks for other mature skin improvements is a MISS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That was the third such comment I had received in the past few weeks when wearing the original product.</li>
            <li> I will have to wash it off without  leaving it on long enough to find out if it makes my skin break out.  </li>
            <li> It did make my oily skin feel slightly greasy and look slightly shinny when I first applied it.</li>
            <li> - lawd, I learned my lesson after my errant youth in the sun)&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: slightly sensitive with slight rosacea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have the usual blotchy red spots and shiny t-zone that it normally does after work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 41 years old, white with very pale skin, somewhat splotchy from dry spots and aging, a couple of scars from surgery and injury, but a decent complexion even if I only use a concealer, tinted moisturizer and a little powder.</li>
            <li> and I was left with a red, blotchy complexion due to the burning.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is totally sheer so unlike other BB creams (Avon, Mabeline etc) it does not cover even the smallest blemish or red mark.</li>
            <li> Also, the sensitive skin under her eyes reddened a little.</li>
            <li> but it looked for like &#x27;light fake tan&#x27; on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that shine a light on the path you knew was there, obscured by creepy shadow.  </li>
            <li> As far as the sunblock component it isn&#x27;t heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> Long term usage and results might earn this product a fifth star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a long time</li>
            <li> in all, if you normally don&#x27;t wear a facial moisturizer, or sun screen and think you should start, but slowly and inexpensively, and you like a glow-y, shiny look without any added color, you might like this product.</li>
            <li> in all, if you normally don&#x27;t wear a facial moisturizer, or sun screen and think you should start, but slowly and inexpensively, and you like a glow-y, shiny look without any added color, you might like this product.</li>
            <li> This one (for me!) ranks right behind the Missha.</li>
            <li> After ten minutes, I wiped off the smelly mess with a napkin (paper, I&#x27;m no dummy), observed the same telltale smear of indelible orangey-ness that ruined my t-shirt, sniffed my still over-fragrant hand and gave up the fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can totally tell when you do one side of your face versus the other.</li>
            <li> I only wear the other one when I am dressing up for events and want to look special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> with other BB creams, I like that this has multiple benefits, so</li>
            <li> I went back to the other L&#x27;Oreal product.</li>
            <li> The Ponds BB cream made my skin look somewhat dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn it with dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to give this product a bad review because it does have some positive effects on normal skin, though compared to other BB creams the coverage is nearly non-existent.</li>
            <li> I use it every single day.</li>
            <li> (Much less so that the Youth Code medium shade, but still, too yellow is too yellow.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The long and short is it is a disappointing expensive sunscreen that isn&#x27;t even a good one</li>
            <li> I want a product that will moisturize and give a little spf at the same time.  </li>
            <li> so next time will go a little lighter.</li>
            <li> The trick is to use only a small amount as it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have since researched this and found this as a complaint multiple times on multiple sites.  </li>
            <li> not really, yes when you squeeze it out there is somewhat some tint to it</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it on my face after my current moisturizer for a few days, I broke out,</li>
            <li> The product is what I ordered, but the product itself was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> But what she really disliked was the way it wouldn&#x27;t cover flaws like the version above, yet remained visible on her face even though she massaged it in thoroughly.</li>
            <li> If you would be using multiple products on your face in a given day, this could replace a few of them to speed a morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not what I expected of a BB cream.</li>
            <li> It hid my red spots, uneven skin tone and rosacea.</li>
            <li> Maybe 15 minutes later it had settled down with less shine, but a few hours later (maybe 3) it was just gone.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, the smell is rather strong and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Having experience with other L&#x27;Oreal products, I like the feel of it.</li>
            <li> Just to be sure I wasn&#x27;t insane, I spread some on the back of my hand one last time today.  </li>
            <li> Extremely greasy and sticky feel...</li>
            <li> small amount covers the entire face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In reading some other reviews this is a problem for some and not for others, so if you don&#x27;t mind buying a product that may or may not work out, this would be the one to try.</li>
            <li> The first was an expensive, department store brand</li>
            <li> I usually dab some to the back of my hand and use that to apply to my face, so I haven&#x27;t noticed any problems with the cream not matching my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Also beware of the active ingredients.</li>
            <li> I know not to expect major coverage from a BB cream, but this was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> For some of the reviewers mentioning the yellow effect it had on their skin was hard for me to understand.  </li>
            <li> There has been an enormous rush to BB creams lately.</li>
            <li> version (there is a version for dark complexions) is a pink-ish iridescent cream that is basically transparent.</li>
            <li> I think I ordered a tint too dark</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t give me enough coverage, and was so thick that the powder clumped when I dusted my face.</li>
            <li> It also was thick enough to remove the concealer I had put on before using the BB cream (as recommended by a couple of how-to videos I had watched).</li>
            <li> It starts out a pale pink, and \\&quot;transforms\\&quot; into a light/medium shade.</li>
            <li> and I prefer less</li>
            <li> Odd claim.</li>
            <li> I feel slightly shiny with this product</li>
            <li> but it darkens slightly after exposure to the air.  </li>
            <li> Although it was not too heavy and applied smoothly, the resulting color was atrocious.  </li>
            <li> The jaundiced look is less than desirable.  </li>
            <li> people I don&#x27;t know literally just staring at my face oddly</li>
            <li> so I use a little pressed powder to tone it down a bit.</li>
            <li> A little less coverage than I was hoping for as well as a slightly shinier finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Two washes (one cold, one hot) have not removed the stain.  </li>
            <li> When you apply it, it has little to no color.  </li>
            <li> and I find I have to use a little powder on my nose, chin and forehead.    </li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s the little things, their sweetening twist of perspective,</li>
            <li> The suntan color fades after 5 minutes, so give it a little time before you rush to a conclusion.  </li>
            <li> It goes on rather heavy and greasy and does have an orange-y look.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone, let alone someone with sensitive or troubled skin.</li>
            <li> Also, there is not much color to this, and the texture felt oily and thick.</li>
            <li> This did not cover the uneven skin tones and felt too</li>
            <li> The decision makers at L&#x27;Oreal apparently did not learn the awkward lesson suffered by Coca-Cola leaders when they tried to fix what wasn&#x27;t broken and rolled out \\&quot;new</li>
            <li> Almost immediately the color changed to a sickly, yellow-orange that was similar to the color produced by self-tanning products in the early 1970&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;L&#x27;Oreal</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m already quite pale, it made me look almost like I was trying for a Goth</li>
            <li> you are pale</li>
            <li> its too blotchy, too smelly, too strange  of a color for fair skin and way too expensive for the quality of the product..come on loreal, this is awful!</li>
            <li> Leaving a slight pinkish glow, much like  an afternoon roll in the sack might leave, if you know what I mean????!!!!  </li>
            <li> I need to use very little foundation after using this BB cream.  </li>
            <li> and it is way too much like a bad perfume to have linger forever.  </li>
            <li> For the price, you can afford to wear this one everyday!</li>
            <li> I usually purchase fair/light for BB creams, and ivory for foundations.  </li>
            <li> not sure if this product should not be pulled.</li>
            <li> I had not done my homework on this product thinking it was the infamous BB Asian cream</li>
            <li> on my face - fortunately only slightly itchy, but very disturbing.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost impossible to even out, plus it turns a sort of orange color instead of a natural color.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t, at least not for me.</li>
            <li> Some of the negative reviewers of the \\&quot;good\\&quot; moisturizer complain that it made their skin look orange</li>
            <li> Always wonder about the verrrry negative reports about some products - but I have to leave one for this product.  </li>
            <li> It seems this complaint is out there a lot, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair-medium skin-toned woman in my late 50&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> , it was so thick</li>
            <li> but it was really thick and seemed  too cakey.  </li>
            <li> I like the \\&quot;instant radiance\\&quot; that this cream provides - it adds a subtle luminosity to my skin that doesn&#x27;t look artificial.</li>
            <li> I mean, it glows!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for awhile now and agree that it makes a subtle difference, but it&#x27;s not magic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is not a good product.</li>
            <li> Works well as SPF, BB, primer for liquid or powder foundation, lazy days, rushed days and day cream!!</li>
            <li> I can see where some might not welcome it.</li>
            <li> a summer spent in ICU, recovering from a wasp sting with swelling so severe I ended up with pulmonary and cranial embolisms, and piles of nasty drugs which all share creepy side effects like weight gain, hair loss, etc compounded by the void where daily skincare regimen once lived, my skin has been so very confused.</li>
            <li> It might protect with SPF 20, but this cream DRIED OUT MY SKIN so badly, and it did not even any skin tone out at all.</li>
            <li> The smell didn&#x27;t make her feel ill</li>
            <li> I find it collects along my eyebrows and leaves weird glittery brown streaks along my eyebrows that I have to remember to blend with a sponge.  </li>
            <li> The color is also questionable.  </li>
            <li> skin tends to revolt at the mere hint of oil-containing face products.</li>
            <li> have also tried the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code BB Cream Illuminator (Medium) and it was as useless as this Age</li>
            <li> My friends know that I have been sick lately.</li>
            <li> and this looks like a bad fake tan.  </li>
            <li> This product was a bit of a disappointment.</li>
            <li> (look in the mirror 20 mins after you apply) i found this product so disappointing that i will not buy loreal anything again.</li>
            <li> COLOR is what I wasn&#x27;t crazy about.</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s almost impossible to find it in the store.</li>
            <li> It was so bad that I went into the bathroom and tried to blot my face with a tissue.</li>
            <li> Came home, and hubs says in a shocked voice, what happened to your face?  </li>
            <li> That might have been tolerable, if the product had not resulted in a sickly appearance.  </li>
            <li> I am SO disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Holey moley, what a disappointment!</li>
            <li> A real disappointment.</li>
            <li> And hated it.  </li>
            <li> and I *hated* it.</li>
            <li> Hated this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in L&#x27;Oreal.  </li>
            <li> But the color is awful.  </li>
            <li> I rushed to the mirror and almost fell over, it made my face shockingly orange!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When I wear this it just makes my skin feel like satin- truly it gives the skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years and hope it stays around for many more years. This face cream is light and smooth&#x27;s out evenly giving me an even tone.  After using the cream I use a blush on my checks and  then I use a brush over my face and cheeks for a natural look.  This give me the natural look I want without the look of being &amp;#34;made up.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have seen BB creams advertised and recommended in magazines, so I was eager to try this product. I use several different L&#x27;Oreal moisturizing products and have come to expect a high end product with a drugstore price tag. This product was a bit of a disappointment. As other reviewers have noted, the smell is rather strong and unpleasant. It goes on rather heavy and greasy and does have an orange-y look. However, when I layer on my Pur Mineral powder foundation, the orange color is muted and the look is more of a soft glow. It&#x27;s not horrible, but just not great either. I&#x27;ll probably wear this product now and then, but I won&#x27;t purchase it in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for awhile now and agree that it makes a subtle difference, but it&#x27;s not magic.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a decent product for the price range, but people should not expect miracles from it or any other age related products, regardless of price.</li>
            <li> My face instantly looks brighter, even though the cream goes on fairly translucent, it brings a bit of color to the face. You can totally tell when you do one side of your face versus the other. Havent really used it long enough to tell if the &amp;#34;age-preventing&amp;#34; claims prove out, but I do like using it.</li>
            <li> I dont get all the buzz about BB creams. This is my second experience with them and I am not a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one smells, like major sunscreen. No one wants to smell like that throughout the day unless they are at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its \\&quot;tinted\\&quot; for light to medium skin? not really, yes when you squeeze it out there is somewhat some tint to it but on your skin? not a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protects, nourishes and redensifies skin? It might protect with SPF 20, but this cream DRIED OUT MY SKIN so badly, and it did not even any skin tone out at all. It did not illuminate my skin either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anti-Aging? I dont see anything to back that up.</li>
            <li> I thought I read the description thoroughly. Unfortunately, I missed two very important details. First, the cream is tinted. Second, the cream has a fragrance. I have allergies to most fragrances, so I use only unscented products. I also prefer nontinted creams. I cannot comment on the claims for the cream, because I will not be using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try a BB cream, and this arrived as an accidental \\&quot;free\\&quot; item through the Amazon Vine program, so I thought I&#x27;d try it. I&#x27;m 41 years old, white with very pale skin, somewhat splotchy from dry spots and aging, a couple of scars from surgery and injury, but a decent complexion even if I only use a concealer, tinted moisturizer and a little powder. I got this thinking it would replace my tinted moisturizer but it didn&#x27;t. I admit, I&#x27;m baffled by this product, so I looked up the use of BB cream in some cosmetics videos, and tried it in several different ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. As makeup, i.e. replacing my tinted moisturizer -- It was luminous, so much so it was almost as shiny as the special makeup products I buy to deliberately create shine (like Watts Up!, etc.). But it didn&#x27;t give me enough coverage, and was so thick that the powder clumped when I dusted my face. It also was thick enough to remove the concealer I had put on before using the BB cream (as recommended by a couple of how-to videos I had watched). I used it before putting on concealer and foundation once and that was just a joke, it was so thick I felt like my face was going to crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Tinted sunscreen -- This was the best use I found for it so far. I put it on before being outside a couple of hours instead of using any makeup, and it lasted just fine, even after sweating. Again, though, no coverage to speak of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Moisturizer -- It didn&#x27;t moisturize enough to replace my current moisturizer. If I put it on after letting my Loreal Age Perfect moisturizer soak in a little, it worked well enough, but again it just didn&#x27;t provide enough coverage for me to feel fully comfortable. The color of the light-medium shade does seem to adjust to your own skin tone, but to a lighter shade, especially when used with the Age Perfect moisturizer. Since I&#x27;m already quite pale, it made me look almost like I was trying for a Goth look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it on my face after my current moisturizer for a few days, I broke out, because it is kind of thick and on the oily parts of my face, it&#x27;s a little too much. Basically, I&#x27;ll toss this in the drawer with my other sunscreen, and use this for days when I need to be in the sun for yard work or home repairs, because it&#x27;s decent enough coverage for an emergency run to the hardware store, not so much for going out to eat.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a BB cream.  I really like the texture and the coverage it provides.  It gives a nice glow.  The only thing I would mention it is does have quite a strong scent (perfumed).  It doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it.  I can see where some might not welcome it.</li>
            <li> The product is what I ordered, but the product itself was not what I expected.  I gave it to my mother who is using it.</li>
            <li> I use a different L&#x27;Oreal BB cream[[ASIN:B0084A5PVM L&#x27;Oreal Paris Studio Secrets Magic B.B. Cream, Light, 1 Fluid Ounce]] and love it, but I detest this version, which contains a sunscreen and an obnoxious fragrance. Once I opened the tube, I knew enough not to even attempt putting it on my face because I&#x27;m very sensitive to odors. Instead, I rubbed it into the back of my hand. I couldn&#x27;t see it but I certainly smelled it, and in a few minutes, a perfume-headache was starting to blossom.  I had to scrub my hand for quite some time before the smell wasn&#x27;t an issue when I got it near my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best friend - who first introduced me to the scentless BB cream and still uses it - is not odor sensitive, so she tried it for me.  And hated it.  The smell didn&#x27;t make her feel ill but she found it intrusive.  But what she really disliked was the way it wouldn&#x27;t cover flaws like the version above, yet remained visible on her face even though she massaged it in thoroughly. Also, the sensitive skin under her eyes reddened a little. She&#x27;s rarely allergic to anything but she&#x27;s sure she had a reaction to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube went in the trash but we still love the regular L&#x27;Oreal cream in the link above. L&#x27;Oreal rarely disappoints, but this one was a misfire for both of us.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of different CC and BB creams and this one is the BEST buy far!  I put it on over my sunscreen and it smooth out imperfections and gives a nice glow.  I need to use very little foundation after using this BB cream.  I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I received this for my wife, who reported the following details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream provides sheer coverage, some nice color (but not for fair skin).  It contains SPF, which is great.  It is best for dry skin.  The cream has a strong fragrance, which some may not like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been seeing a big commotion made over the effects of various BB creams, and I love using L&#x27;Oreal makeup and hair products, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin during the two weeks that I&#x27;ve been using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars though because the light skin formula was actually light enough to use on my fair skin without looking unnatural, and it doesn&#x27;t have a yellow tinge like some of the other similar creams.</li>
            <li> There has been an enormous rush to BB creams lately. BB stands for &amp;#34;Beauty Balm&amp;#34; and it most usually contains multiple ingredients to achieve multiple results. Generally, a BB cream is a facial moisturizer that contains sun screen and a foundation-like tint so that instead of wearing three products, you only need one. Instead of doing one thing really well, most BB creams do multiple things sort of OK. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as long as you know that it is not going to do any one thing particularly well....a jack of all trades, a master of none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to wear tinted moisturizer during the warmer months. This is a facial moisturizer with sunscreen that has been combined with a semi-sheer tint that matches my skin tone. An excellent one is NARS Pure Radiant Tinted Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30. I could also call this Nars tinted moisturizer a BB cream, because it does the exact same thing that this L&#x27;Oreal product does and I like it much better. It offers me a higher SPF, it evens out my skin tone, and I can wear it over any good facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except.....the L&#x27;Oreal product is touted for mature skin and has ingredients such as Soy Seed and Vitamin C. It also contains mica to illuminate the skin and make it glow. I like facial illuminators, but I wear them at night or to highlight areas of my face. I don&#x27;t normally wear them all over my face during the daytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this L&#x27;Oreal product doesn&#x27;t have is any tint, the &amp;#34;Light to Medium&amp;#34; version (there is a version for dark complexions) is a pink-ish iridescent cream that is basically transparent. If you want to even out your skin tone, you will need to wear some sort of foundation over this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this cream easy to apply and spread evenly over my face. My face felt moisturized and soft, not greasy or oily. The pink cream imparted a soft luster to my face which I felt needed something applied over it, like foundation or tinted powder.....certainly under eye concealer and blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you normally don&#x27;t wear a facial moisturizer, or sun screen and think you should start, but slowly and inexpensively, and you like a glow-y, shiny look without any added color, you might like this product. Otherwise, I&#x27;d skip it.er.....certainly under eye concealer and blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you normally don&#x27;t wear a facial moisturizer, or sun screen and think you should start, but slowly and inexpensively, and you like a glow-y, shiny look without any added color, you might like this product. Otherwise, I&#x27;d skip it.</li>
            <li> This product was given to my wife to use.  Usually she will try these types of products for at least a week to give it a fair shot.  She has a fair complexion and found out immediately that the product was not working as intended.  After just two days she told me she had enough and said she would never use such a product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally a big fan of L&#x27;Oreal products. BB creams seem to be the &#x27;in&#x27; thing of the moment with cosmetic companies, and I&#x27;ve tried several with varying results. I was sure the L&#x27;Oreal version could be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t, at least not for me. I&#x27;m very fair, and while the cream is sheer (probably too sheer for anyone who needs any kind of serious coverage), it made me look orangey. I guess that&#x27;s supposed to be &#x27;tan,&#x27; but it looked for like &#x27;light fake tan&#x27; on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A definite no go. Ladies with fair complexions, this isn&#x27;t the BB cream you want.</li>
            <li> it goes on nice but its fragrance is way too strong, when it adjust the color, its terrible and blotchy. (look in the mirror 20 mins after you apply) i found this product so disappointing that i will not buy loreal anything again. Why do all these manufactures put so much fragrance in things? i dont want them to choose what i prefer to smell like..(its got that &#x27;old lady&#x27; smell)...its too blotchy, too smelly, too strange  of a color for fair skin and way too expensive for the quality of the product..come on loreal, this is awful!</li>
            <li> This is basically sunblock with tint. The color is subtle, but does smooth out my complexion some. You just need to remember it can rub off onto white clothing or towels. As far as the sunblock component it isn&#x27;t heavy feeling. The glow it talks about is the shine from the sunblock so I use a little pressed powder to tone it down a bit. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with break outs from it. I don&#x27;t know about making my skin look firmer. It does make my 46 year old skin look better, but that might be the tint and moisturizer. I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> My 82-year-old mother started wearing this when it first came out and now it&#x27;s almost impossible to find it in the store. It is the right texture, color, and coverage (not much) that she needs and loves, so I&#x27;m buying up!</li>
            <li> This cream has a VERY light tint to it, quite a bit of sunscreen protection, and more fragrance than my perfume.  It did provide some smoothing, and I didn&#x27;t experience the orange effect that some users have.  It is not as covering as foundation, and it is a little sticky at first.  I used it as a light foundation on a day I was going to be in the sun, and it performed well.  I did put a light dusting of powder on top to take care of a bit of shine.  If you would be using multiple products on your face in a given day, this could replace a few of them to speed a morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit of warning:  it does say to keep it out of your eyes, and you should.  I accidentally got a dot near my eye, and it watered for HOURS.</li>
            <li> Long term usage and results might earn this product a fifth star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect BB Cream Instant Radiance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. to be lightly and nicely scented&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. did not turn color and just absorbed into my medium light skin tone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. while somewhat emollient, a light touch of my regular foundation and dusting of a miineral based powder gave me a flawless look&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. applying as above, lines appeared diminished&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am very pleased with this product and have experienced no allergic effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether or not it will provide any anti aging benefits, time will tell.</li>
            <li> . A real disappointment. I like bb creams a lot and this is my least favorite of about 10 that ive tried. The light color is just too orange and dark for my fair skin. The coverage is so light it did nothing to hide mild redness. I dislike strongly scented products and this one is very perfumey. Finally this is a bb cream that has a very shiny dewy finish and I prefer less shine.&lt;br /&gt;If you are pale I recommend the Ponds bb cream instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to give this product a bad review because it does have some positive effects on normal skin, though compared to other BB creams the coverage is nearly non-existent. The main problem with it is that it has a very strong fragrance. Under normal circumstances I would never put this product on my face - the minute I opened it and smelled it, it would go right back to the store. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone, let alone someone with sensitive or troubled skin.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer for mature skin comes out of the tube a light pink but blends in to your skin. It has a light fragrance and absorbs well. Having experience with other L&#x27;Oreal products, I like the feel of it. It leaves my skin feeling plumped and moist, without feeling heavy, and I really like having the sun protection. The skin is not dulled, but not shiny either -- kind of a nice glow. I&#x27;ve been using this for several days and like it very much. At 2-1/2 ounces, this is a good-sized tube, so I think it will last a while and is a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package claims that after 8 weeks age spots will be reduced by 29%. Odd claim. I&#x27;ll update this review in 8 weeks. Anything for science!!</li>
            <li> I did not like this particular formula.  It made my face super greasy.  I like the Loreal BB cream that&#x27;s not the age perfect formula.</li>
            <li> I like the \\&quot;instant radiance\\&quot; that this cream provides - it adds a subtle luminosity to my skin that doesn&#x27;t look artificial. The light tint (I have the light/medium) is a nice feature too, I can use this alone or under my foundation. The cream has a stronger scent than others I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant or overpowering. The sunscreen is a great feature as well. I am in my early 50&#x27;s and I appreciate a product designed to nourish and improve the look of my skin.</li>
            <li> This product left my skin greasy. While the light/medium shade blended perfectly -- which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one -- this product is NOT for anybody with oily skin. I&#x27;ve never tried a BB Cream before and was hoping I could use it as a light foundation so I could stop using my Bare Minerals, but no go. But one good plus? I have highly sensitive skin and had no issues with redness or irritation.</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy this if you are sensitive to eye-wateringly strong old-lady perfume smells! Also, there is not much color to this, and the texture felt oily and thick.</li>
            <li> I have heard great things about B&amp;B creams,and I trust Loreal for quality products.  My first tube just arrived.  No one said it was highly perfumed.  I just smeared a bit on my cheek to test the color,and my gosh, the smell is overwhelming, and is still making me almost gag.  I will have to wash it off without  leaving it on long enough to find out if it makes my skin break out.  I am SO disappointed.</li>
            <li> More proof that L&#x27;Oreal is taking the supermarket brands into the big-boy territory. Five years ago you&#x27;d be paying top dollar for this at Neiman Marcus. This helps with uneven coloring, spots and fine lines. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This is not what I expected of a BB cream. I wanted something to smooth out uneven tone and provide a stabilizing layer for my foundation. This &#x27;cream&#x27; feels quite greasy and it stays oily so that I can&#x27;t really put anything on top. It didn&#x27;t absorb well. If it was meant to provide light coverage, I didn&#x27;t notice any kind of color tone.</li>
            <li> I really did.  I wanted to love it.  However even with the lightest color it makes my fair skin seem a bit yellow.  I am pretty fair, I&#x27;ll give the product that.  However I can&#x27;t be the only fair person who wants to use this product, so I would recommend the company making a lighter, less yellow shade.  Overall I like the moisturizing aspect of it, but can&#x27;t use it anymore because it makes me look funny.</li>
            <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect BB Cream for 2 years, won&#x27;t buy anything else.  Thank you for offering&lt;br /&gt;this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 57, fair, and wrinkly from sun damage as a kid.  I&#x27;m also lazy about cosmetics since I&#x27;m cute enough but want to look reasonably polished.  So for me, the BB cream concept is great, and I&#x27;ve tried a few.  Had high hopes for this one, and cheerfully threw some on my face, neck, and chest before a recent morning walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now considerably less cheerful:  One of my favorite grey t-shirts is now permanently stained as if I had carelessly smeared self-tanning cream on it.  Two washes (one cold, one hot) have not removed the stain.  So, L&#x27;Oreal, how about a warning, please?  What if I&#x27;d put this on under a white silk dress?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the product itself, yes it&#x27;s a little smelly but evocative of the old-fashioned make-up I loved to smell on my mom and grandma growing up, so I don&#x27;t recoil.  But the color is awful.  I was so excited by the transformation from pale to more glow-y as I spread it over my skin, but the magic went away when the greasy color that bloomed on my eagerly waiting face turned out to look like bad bronzer from the &#x27;80&#x27;s.  Just to be sure I wasn&#x27;t insane, I spread some on the back of my hand one last time today.  After ten minutes, I wiped off the smelly mess with a napkin (paper, I&#x27;m no dummy), observed the same telltale smear of indelible orangey-ness that ruined my t-shirt, sniffed my still over-fragrant hand and gave up the fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal, please just pull this thing off the market.  This is not a good product.</li>
            <li> So I have very dry, but very fair skin.  I want a product that will moisturize and give a little spf at the same time.  This BB cream goes on well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin or eyes.  I like that aspect of it, and having a quick out the door option to doing a full blown makeup application.    I do not like the &#x27;radiance&#x27; aspect of the BB cream.  When you apply it, it has little to no color.  After being on your skin for a few minutes it turns into a more foundation-like color with some shimmer.  I find it collects along my eyebrows and leaves weird glittery brown streaks along my eyebrows that I have to remember to blend with a sponge.  It doesn&#x27;t really provide much coverage - my dark under-eye circles and rosacea are still fairly obvious, but it does kind of even my skin tone and make the blotches less obvious.  I feel slightly shiny with this product and I find I have to use a little powder on my nose, chin and forehead.    It is better than other BB and CC creams I have tried, but not nearly as good as Pond&#x27;s Radiance BB+ cream.</li>
            <li> I signed up for the automatic refill on this product, as I can no longer find it in retail stores and I have grown to love it.  For some of the reviewers mentioning the yellow effect it had on their skin was hard for me to understand.  Unless they have olive type or warm complextions.  I have a cool pallete  for my coloring and it works great on my skin tone.  Leaving a slight pinkish glow, much like  an afternoon roll in the sack might leave, if you know what I mean????!!!!  Seems to be a good moisturizer and certainly helps with te the sunblock, as if I put it one before a summer outing, I do not put on sunscreen and do not burn.  I am replacing makeup with this unless I have a formal occasion.  Believe me that is quite a testimonial being 67 years old.  Hope this helps you..</li>
            <li> Now that I have found this product, I make sure I never run out. Great on my very fair skin, only need a small amount for a lot of radiance. Works well as a quick touch of glow on otherwise dull skin. The trick is to use only a small amount as it goes a long way. One tube would last longer for me, however I use it on my arms and hands as well! Really gives a youthful look to mature skin and sun protection is a plus. Very pleased with this cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it since it first came out.</li>
            <li> Extremely greasy and sticky feel... orangish color. I use it just for a sunscreen working in the garden. Would not wear it out.</li>
            <li> I have tried over a dozen BB Creams in the last 2 years. All of them seem to do different things and have a slightly different purpose. Since BB Cream stands for \\&quot;Beauty Balm\\&quot; it is really left up to the interpretation of the brand. This BB Cream Nourishes, Redensifies, Evens, Perfects and Boosts Radiance. It also contains SPF 20 and a skin tone matching cream. I am really loving this BB Cream and I will be using it for when I want a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color is a perfect match for my light-medium skin that has reddish undertones. I was able to apply the cream easily with very little blending. It did not make my face look orange, or even like I was wearing makeup. It does have a very light coverage. If you are wanting to look \\&quot;made up\\&quot;, then this is not the BB Cream you want. If you want to look like a natural, ageless beauty then this is your BB Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made my face look like it would if I had perfect genes and gorgeous, clear skin. It hid my red spots, uneven skin tone and rosacea. It did make my oily skin feel slightly greasy and look slightly shinny when I first applied it. However, an hour later my skin looked WAY better than it would have without this BB Cream. It wasn&#x27;t near as oily or shiny as it normally is. I was even more impressed with this cream after working a 10 hour shift. My skin was not only NOT greasy or shiny, but it still looked flawless. It didn&#x27;t have the usual blotchy red spots and shiny t-zone that it normally does after work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is now my 2nd favorite BB Cream ([[ASIN:B0079HNKLI Smashbox Camera Ready BB Cream SPF 35 Light/Medium]] is still my favorite due to it&#x27;s better coverage). I use this when I am working or going to an event where I don&#x27;t want to look like I am wearing makeup. This is more of an everyday BB Cream. For the price, you can afford to wear this one everyday! I only wear the other one when I am dressing up for events and want to look special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-evens skintone&lt;br /&gt;-SPF 20&lt;br /&gt;-moisturizes&lt;br /&gt;-GREAT price for a BB Cream&lt;br /&gt;-makes skin look naturally gorgeous&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-very light coverage&lt;br /&gt;-looks slightly shinny when you first apply it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I definitely say this BB Cream is a win.

            <li> This made my normal skin a greasy shiny mess.  It was so bad that I went into the bathroom and tried to blot my face with a tissue.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I am sorry to see that it is no longer on the market except through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It is the perfect blend of moisturizer, color enhancer, good coverage and light application.</li>
            <li> This cream is targeted toward mature women and is supposed to even out your complexion and fade spots over time.  However, like others have commented, this L&#x27;Oreal BB Cream for Light/Medium complexions is most definitely NOT for the cool/fair/very light complected.  I am that and, upon application of this actually very nice BB cream, my face turned to a weirdly orange tone or unnatural flesh color.  I always apply any kind of cosmetic in natural light (before a window), and so the artificiality was quite apparent.  That&#x27;s disappointing because overall this has a very nice consistency - kind of a gel/cream, and I did not find the fragrance overpowering but instead quite pleasant.  Also this cream comes with a SPF 20 (sun protection factor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended for light/fair complexions and, per manufacturer&#x27;s instructions, this should not be applied to irritated or damaged skin.  Perhaps, L&#x27;Oreal should repackage this as solely for Medium/Warm complexions?</li>
            <li> Despite the title of this review, I can only rate this cream 4 stars because the color problems I wrote about with Youth Code BB Cream, are also present in THIS cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shade I used here was light/medium, and here&#x27;s what I liked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--It spreads smoothly and evenly.&lt;br /&gt;--A small amount covers the entire face.&lt;br /&gt;--It imparts a \\&quot;sheen\\&quot; which mimics \\&quot;radiance\\&quot;, but that is helpful for dry/older skin like mine.&lt;br /&gt;--It is moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;--SPF of 20 is stronger than many other BB creams out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The COLOR is what I wasn&#x27;t crazy about. It starts out a pale pink, and \\&quot;transforms\\&quot; into a light/medium shade. The problem?  The light/medium shade is TOO YELLOW. (Much less so that the Youth Code medium shade, but still, too yellow is too yellow.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish more BB creams (and even foundations for that matter) made truly neutral BEIGE shades ranging from light to deep. Too many of them have this yellow thing going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you happen to have more yellow undertones than I do, this might look fine on you, and you might rate it five stars. But I can only rate it four, because of the color-match problem.</li>
            <li> BB Cream, Beauty Balms, confuse me. Is it makeup, a skin treatment, moisturizer, sunscreen or all of the above? This particular one is a nice consistency for a moisturizing, SPF20 sunscreen with a hint of color. At it&#x27;s  best, it is a HIT for my olive complexion. On me, it&#x27;s good for quick natural, casual no-makeup look with just mascara and lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The daily use of sunscreen prevents dark spots from darkening further so using this for it&#x27;s SPF20 on casual days IS a good thing. My skin feels soft like a moisturizer&#x27;s been used BUT my skin couldn&#x27;t handle a foundation or powder on top of it without feeling SMOTHERED. Beyond that, using this as a treatment and waiting 8 weeks for other mature skin improvements is a MISS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be looking for another Day Cream with SPF + hydroxy-acids to effectively treat my \\&quot;mature skin issues\\&quot; that nicely handles the addition of  foundation and powder on dressier days without feeling SMOTHERED.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the flowery smell - it should be made unscented</li>
            <li> I liked this BB cream much better than the Ponds. The Ponds BB cream made my skin look somewhat dry. This didn&#x27;t do that. Instead it gave my skin a nice smooth coverage, and it helped with the undereye circles. The finish is just much nicer than what I received with the other cream. I think the reason for this may be because I have mature skin, and so I have all kinds of imperfections that need to be covered. This glides on smoothly, covers up a lot of the flaws, and as I said before, helps with the undereye circles. It also works really well if you combine it with the Age Perfect SPF skin cream, which I also received. I highly recommend this if you have mature skin, want a good coverage without a product that is sticky. It works really well and not only goes on nice and smooth, it makes your skin feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find it in the stores...everytime a good product comes out someone tries to improve it and fails...</li>
            <li> Of all the BB creams this is the lightest- HOWEVER, it is now officially hot in Nevada...I would only order this in the winter.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after I noticed my neighbors skin looked so nice!  I really like this product and will continue to order!</li>
            <li> This item seemed old and not fully mixed well. If it were newer, I think it would have worked great and not have been as oily. Even the lettering on the bottle was rubbed off some.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product. It&#x27;s a nongreasy, tinted moisturizer and I am always getting compliments on my beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like product with fragrance this is not for you- the smell just doesn&#x27;t go away- and it is way too much like a bad perfume to have linger forever.  The color is also questionable.  Light to fair skin comes out very dark and tinted orange.  I consider myself to have a medium tone skin and this looks like a bad fake tan.  Going right back because I know I&#x27;ll never use it again!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find the best product for my 70 year old ex-smoker (23 years) wrinkled skin for some time now.  I started with Olay but found as the supposed effectiveness of their creams and lotions increased so did my eyes&#x27; sensitivity (When I wrote them about the problem, they sent coupons for more of the same so I stopped using them)  Then I tried Garnier lotion (liked a lot) and then the Garnier BB cream but it was really thick and seemed  too cakey.  Finally I saw the ads for this product and here I am, pretty happy at last.  It does not make the wrinkles disappear but it seems to minimize them.  I like the glow it gives but that is me.  You may not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some things to be aware of if you are looking for a product like this.  The cream is light, both in color and texture and goes on very smoothly, very easily.  I thought it was too light in color but it darkens slightly after exposure to the air.  It does have a fairly strong perfume to it so if you want something odor free, this is NOT for you.  The &amp;#34;radiance&amp;#34; part of this is rather strong.  I you want a matte look you will need a finishing powder because this goes on pretty shiny.  It works for me and I have tubes at home, my son&#x27;s and my Mom&#x27;s for when I visit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try one of the new \\&quot;B&amp;B\\&quot; creams and found this product by L&#x27;Oreal easy to apply with no noticeable fragrance and a smooth texture. It&#x27;s lighter than a foundation, which makes it good for every day, when you want a little bit of polish, but aren&#x27;t doing full makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the promises of this product are appealing--boosting skin&#x27;s radiance, diminishing dark spots over time, nourishing the complexion, and strengthening skin along with built-in SPF 20 sunscreen. I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to judge the diminishment of dark spots, but I am willing to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Age Perfect B&amp;B Cream for Mature Skin should be used sparingly, or else it will look like a mask. It does not come in a wide variety of shades, so you may have trouble finding a perfect match. I would use it over additional sunscreen, since my dermatologist suggests a 30 SPF for every day.</li>
            <li> Even if you are careful about not getting any on your lips, this product has an aftertaste which i think shows it is really soaking into one&#x27;s skin.  A very nice under coat before putting on finishing powder.  I can see difference in skin the longer it is used.</li>
            <li> My wife tried to use this product but after 3 or 4 attempts got rid of it.  She thought it would be a real time-saver to be able to use a tinted moisturizer for those days when she doesn&#x27;t want to put on \\&quot;full make up\\&quot;.  It is on the thick side as it comes out of the tube and smooths on face easily, but the tint doesn&#x27;t show as she applied it, so no matter how careful she was to put it on evenly it ended up being darker in some areas.  Once it changes color it&#x27;s almost impossible to even out, plus it turns a sort of orange color instead of a natural color.  In reading some other reviews this is a problem for some and not for others, so if you don&#x27;t mind buying a product that may or may not work out, this would be the one to try.</li>
            <li> Me: Late 40&#x27;s and dry sensitive skin--cool light skin tone. I&#x27;ve used Missha Perfect Cover BB Cream from Korea, as well as some drugstore brands made by Maybelline and CoverGirl. This one (for me!) ranks right behind the Missha. Not as much coverage or SPF as the Missha has, but I like the way this makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated. The Missha made my face feel even drier than it is normally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel this L&#x27;Oreal BB cream is for oily skin types, more for those of us with dry skin. It came out of the tube very light white/pink but adjusted to my skin tone. The SPF 20 seems to be enough for me in the Fall, but probably not in the summer when the sun is more direct. It has a scent, but it didn&#x27;t overwhelm me. I&#x27;m docking it a star because the first hour or two my face is too shiny. After that, it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail. Instead of waiting, and thinking about it, I decided to write the review right off the cuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;HOLY MOLEY!!! Does this stuff contain a lot of perfume or what?\\&quot;, I exclaimed. \\&quot;Phewee! Good thing I tried this on the back of my hand and not my face!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, there you have it, my initial reaction. It did go on smoothly, made my skin look nice, and a little goes a long way, but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to put this smelly stuff on my face near my nose and eyes.</li>
            <li> I had been purchasing Pond&#x27;s BB cream and was very happy with it.  Went to the store and could not find it on the shelf.  Looked at the other brands and decided that LÓreal Paris would be a good brand to try.  The next day, I used it and my skin immediately felt like it was burning.  I looked more closely at the ingredients and noticed that it contained Vitamin C.  That&#x27;s wonderful if I&#x27;m eating it, but who wants to put ascorbic acid on their skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pond&#x27;s cream evened my skin tone, possibly due to the light tint and the zinc oxide.  The LÓreal cream was so sheer that it went right into my skin and I was left with a red, blotchy complexion due to the burning.  I am calling them next week to get a refund...and they were 50% higher in price than the Pond&#x27;s too.</li>
            <li> The color matching technology didn&#x27;t work for me.  It leaves an orangey colored cast on my skin.  I usually purchase fair/light for BB creams, and ivory for foundations.  My skin has a red undertone, not yellow, and the color just never adjusted well for me.  The texture is great, and the coverage would have been perfect for me if the color had been a good match.  I love that it has SPF 20, the tube is easy to use and just wish that it worked for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> This is only the 2nd BB cream that I have tried. The first was an expensive, department store brand and I *hated* it. I love this L&#x27;Oreal BB cream. The texture is light, and made my skin look and feel soft and smooth. It had a pleasant smell. It was so easy to apply and blended in instantly. I think I&#x27;ll be using this product for a while. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect BB Cream does a very fine job of moisturizing my skin.  It is easy to use, requires very little product to get results, but remained \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; feeling throughout the day.  Personally, I would use this more as a night moisturizer and use something different for daytime.</li>
            <li> It took a long while for the ordering system to get this one right, but boy is this product worth the wait!&lt;br /&gt;My skin tends to revolt at the mere hint of oil-containing face products. Revolting is what it becomes.  But this BB Cream has all the right oils, in just the right proportions in finely-milled-pigment emulsions to make my pores glisten with age-perfected glee.  Myrh? Shea? Titanium dioxide is the cherry on top, for my fair face. Add carbomer, an assortment of benz-type things, lin- and cinn- alools to keep errant irritants at bay, and this allergic-to-everything skin of mine is ready for anything.&lt;br /&gt;After a summer spent in ICU, recovering from a wasp sting with swelling so severe I ended up with pulmonary and cranial embolisms, and piles of nasty drugs which all share creepy side effects like weight gain, hair loss, etc compounded by the void where daily skincare regimen once lived, my skin has been so very confused. Reasserting one&#x27;s place in the world with that there as your roster of recent accomplishments, all the components of a once fierce and accomplished self kind of shattered and scattered somewhere back there beyond the injuries that left the massive blood clots that once mobilized took this toll...post-violence social support is all retail and kind strangers. And sometimes that&#x27;s bolstered by products that live up to their names.  I&#x27;m pritnear middle-aged, I guess, on paper anyway, and am carded [ID checked at doors to clubs, or for alcohol purchase]  with near-sincerity once in a while. I&#x27;m not great at accepting flattery, in the wake of [domestic violence], but I can reflect it around where it might be more useful.  Sometimes it&#x27;s the little things, their sweetening twist of perspective, that shine a light on the path you knew was there, obscured by creepy shadow.  This BB Cream feels great going on, blends effortlessly, makes last-minute rushes to presentability, on the way to yet another battery of diagnostic tests and therapies seem less like torture and more like reifying treasure. L&#x27;oreal Age Perfect BB has me feeling pretty good at having made it to 43, considering, and looking forward to 53, 63, 73, 83...  Def. worth the moderate price. Absolutely worth a try.ss like torture and more like reifying treasure. L&#x27;oreal Age Perfect BB has me feeling pretty good at having made it to 43, considering, and looking forward to 53, 63, 73, 83...  Def. worth the moderate price. Absolutely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Been using it since it came out.</li>
            <li> I need to stop trying BB creams and stick with one I already know works well. Instead I was at Walgreens feeling spendy and saw this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was from L&#x27;Oreal, a decent brand, which has other products I have used and been satisfied with. How could I not try a tube of the light/medium? I snuck a little onto the back of my hand and it looked good, plus it was marked way down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it wasn&#x27;t a huge loss, I wish I hadn&#x27;t bothered. If you want to know about L&#x27;Oreal BB creams, I&#x27;m your girl and this is your review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A true BB cream will give you \\&quot;glow\\&quot;, minimize skin imperfections, and if good, can even take the place of your foundation. I had found all these assets in a different L&#x27;Oreal&#x27; product, their Skin Beautifier BB Cream, and thought perhaps their Age Perfect BB Cream Instant Radiance version would be even better. Not even close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff evolves on your skin. When I first put it on, it was alarming - very orangy and greasy-looking (though it was not greasy, just shiny). Maybe 15 minutes later it had settled down with less shine, but a few hours later (maybe 3) it was just gone. Zero tint, zero coverage. I know not to expect major coverage from a BB cream, but this was ridiculous. Nothing was left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the possibility of using it as a semi-foundation... nope. I tried applying a second coat in case more was required for results or staying power, but still nada. It is not buildable and a heavier coating doesn&#x27;t last longer or look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code BB Cream Illuminator (Medium) and it was as useless as this Age Perfect one, except the Youth Code one did not disappear, it just never appeared, period. Nothing. A glorified colored sunscreen calling itself a BB cream because BB creams are hot right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other, superior Skin Beautifier BB Cream (now also being called \\&quot;Studio Secrets\\&quot;) leaves my skin tone even with a subtle pearly finish, minimizes pores,and makes my face look flawless. This is the one that works for me and from which I should not stray. It&#x27;s light, non-greasy, gives no greasy appearance, provides some light coverage and looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are experimenting with BB Creams and not looking to fork out a wad of cash for a premium one, I&#x27;d suggest trying the L&#x27;Oreal Magic Skin Beautifier BB Cream. You might even try the Maybelline (which was ok but too shiny for my taste). But don&#x27;t let this Age Perfect Instant Radiance product be your only try of BB creams because there&#x27;s better stuff out there, honest.</li>
            <li> The product is too shiny, so that skin seems greasy. I bought light/medium tone and it blended in the skin as if it had no color at all. I didn&#x27;t have time to evaluate anti-aging benefits yet, so cannot say anything about that.</li>
            <li> Up front, I&#x27;ll say that I LOVE L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s antecedent face brightener: [[ASIN:B001E5EKM4 Loreal Age Perfect Pro-Calcium Radiance Perfector Sheer Tint Moisturizer, Light - 1.7 Oz]] (See my Amazon review.) The decision makers at L&#x27;Oreal apparently did not learn the awkward lesson suffered by Coca-Cola leaders when they tried to fix what wasn&#x27;t broken and rolled out \\&quot;new Coke.\\&quot; L&#x27;Oreal discontinued the superb original product (currently rated an average of 4.3 out of 5 stars by 50 Amazon reviewers), and seems to have replaced it with this BB cream (which has a very similar description and ingredients). From the box: \\&quot;In one luxurious step, sheer color + anti-aging benefits boost radiance and skin&#x27;s resilience.\\&quot; Also it \\&quot;transform[s] upon touch to illuminate skin with a healthy glow.\\&quot; These reasons, plus the sunscreen, are what I love about the original Sheer Tint Moisturizer, so I decided to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holey moley, what a disappointment! The \\&quot;healthy glow\\&quot; and \\&quot;radiance\\&quot; promised on the box were non-existent. \\&quot;Sheer color\\&quot; only existed if you define it as \\&quot;virtually no color\\&quot; (and I have very light skin). No wonder the tube itself reads as if this is basically a sunscreen. An over-priced sunscreen is the only use I can find for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Update 7/31/13: As this didn&#x27;t color my skin when used sparingly (which technique worked well with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s original Sheer Tint Moisturizer), I tried glopping it on and not rubbing in so well. I&#x27;m now getting decent color, so maybe that&#x27;s the trick. Just have to be sure to spread it evenly. I should emphasize that this does NOT turn me orange, even though I am fair-skinned. So maybe you just have to see what works for you. Still wish it contained the radiance factor that made the original so outstanding. See next paragraph.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ironically, the day before buying this product, I was wearing the original L&#x27;Oreal Sheer Tint Moisturizer. My friends know that I have been sick lately. The owner of a local skin and hair salon stopped what she was doing and commented, \\&quot;You are really a beautiful woman. You look so healthy. Your face glows. I mean, it glows!\\&quot; That was the third such comment I had received in the past few weeks when wearing the original product. When I applied the new one, my first thought was \\&quot;Well, no one is going to say that I look healthy or glow with this stuff!\\&quot; Indeed . . . as predicted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Some of the negative reviewers of the \\&quot;good\\&quot; moisturizer complain that it made their skin look orange (as do some reviewers of this product). I&#x27;ve never had that problem with the original, but I use very little and massage it in well. (The color seems to enhance using this technique.) People differ, and apparently the original isn&#x27;t for everyone. But 80% of Amazon reviewers praised it highly.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite BB cream on the market.  It is perfect for aging skin, looks radiant and I got it here for a good price.  I use it with a light mineral powder and it lasts great all day and keeps my face moist.  I will use it forever!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I was in search of a good BB cream for dry skin. It makes my skin extremely moisturized and fresh. I use it every single day. If you have greasy skin this is probably not the product for you since the finish is quite dewey. My skin looks so healthy and radiant!</li>
            <li> A little less coverage than I was hoping for as well as a slightly shinier finish.&lt;br /&gt;However, overall I am satisfied with this product, as it does moisturize well, and coupled with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Beauty Magic Perfecting BB Cream the coverage is just right for my now less-than-perfect skin. Aging isn&#x27;t fair!&lt;br /&gt;The price is definitely right</li>
            <li> Always wonder about the verrrry negative reports about some products - but I have to leave one for this product.  This one just makes my skin look greasy (do not have oily skin).  More importantly, it causes rosacea flare ups each time I use it.  I have stopped and restarted using it 3 times.  Each time (and there will be no further tries) - each time developed bumps and skin got much redder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have rosacea - stay away.</li>
            <li> I have since researched this and found this as a complaint multiple times on multiple sites.  Very disappointed in L&#x27;Oreal.  I have a fine rash from using this (know it is from this as only on my face, only where I put this and only change in anything!) on my face - fortunately only slightly itchy, but very disturbing.  It seems this complaint is out there a lot, so not sure if this product should not be pulled.</li>
            <li> Age: 56&lt;br /&gt;skin tone: not pale but light, tan easily (but I never tan anymore - lawd, I learned my lesson after my errant youth in the sun)&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: slightly sensitive with slight rosacea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time to try a BB cream and so far I&#x27;m happy with the product. Sunscreens can burn or irritate my face, but when I apply this one, I don&#x27;t feel a thing. I&#x27;ve worn it alone and over a serum. I&#x27;ve worn it with dry skin and I&#x27;ve worn it after I&#x27;ve washed my face and it&#x27;s still \\&quot;damp.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I also like is although it may have a barely-there color, I don&#x27;t notice it - perhaps it&#x27;s covering a little, and that&#x27;s fine with me. I do notice a bit of a \\&quot;sheen\\&quot; - I think this is the \\&quot;radiance\\&quot; part--it subsides some so that it doesn&#x27;t look as if I have a shiny face. I&#x27;d imagine wearing my mineral make-up over it would be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m intrigued with the soy seed protein addition - have no idea what it will do, if anything, but I&#x27;m curious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it&#x27;s an SPF 20 instead 15 - just an extra bit of coverage there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve worn it on walks, out and about on errands, and once to work out in - all without any burning or stinging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light-medium color, as I said, goes on my face without notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal products work well with my skin, and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> I love this unexpensive BB clream ant it also gives sun protection!</li>
            <li> This is a nice creamy face lotion that provides SPF coverage.  I think I ordered a tint too dark so next time will go a little lighter.</li>
            <li> Because I had a heart transplant I  can&#x27;t be out in the sun, I get cancers on my face and my aging had started to give me spots along with the damage of my surgery scars and, because of my transplant medicine and the sun.  I already can see he difference after using L&#x27;Oreal Paris SPF 20 Age Perfect Instant Radiance BB Cream.  It gives me more confidence and makes me feel younger. Even my children have commented!</li>
            <li> As an Asian woman with a fair complexion, I don&#x27;t like to wear heavy makeup and want a more natural, light tone.  That said, I appreciate that this BB cream is sheer, but if you&#x27;re looking to use it as a foundation to cover up blemishes, it may or may not work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like with other BB creams, I like that this has multiple benefits, so I don&#x27;t feel the need to separately apply a moisturizer and sunscreen for simple daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I see with this product is the skin matching tone enhancer.  It starts off a pink color that may appear to give your skin a pinkish-brown tone when applied directly to your face.  I usually dab some to the back of my hand and use that to apply to my face, so I haven&#x27;t noticed any problems with the cream not matching my skin tone.  Still, it may be a concern for others and the possibility of it leaving that pink/brown color on your face if you apply too much is my reason for deducting a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, though, I do like the product, and will likely continue to use it.  It&#x27;s a good product that seems to be comparable to department store products that cost 2-3 times as much.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect BB Cream Instant Radiance, Light/Medium\\&quot; looked like it would be perfect for ivory or very fair skin tones.  The soft, pale petal pink color disappeared nicely when applied as a test to my inner wrist.  Then, I applied this BB Cream to my face!  Almost immediately the color changed to a sickly, yellow-orange that was similar to the color produced by self-tanning products in the early 1970&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect BB Cream Instant Radiance, Light/Medium\\&quot; was a major disappointment.  Although it was not too heavy and applied smoothly, the resulting color was atrocious.  The jaundiced look is less than desirable.  The fragrance of \\&quot;L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect BB Cream Instant Radiance, Light/Medium\\&quot; is quite strong.  That might have been tolerable, if the product had not resulted in a sickly appearance.  Further, based on the packaging, it does not appear this product is hypo-allergic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend \\&quot;L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect BB Cream Instant Radiance, Light/Medium\\&quot;.  The radical color change when applied to skin is unacceptable.</li>
            <li> All I can say that&#x27;s nice,  is that it kind of smelled good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on in the early evening, no big deal, it was orange-ish. It didn&#x27;t cover nor did it really even things out, unless you call my face being orange while my neck was white, &#x27;even&#x27;.  And then I woke up the next day looking like I had a 20th degree sunburn (ITCH!! BURN! RED! SWELLING!). If I had known that this is not uncommon with the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect BB, I would never have ordered it. Even my eyes were swollen up, and it took two days of Benadryl before the itching and redness went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And by the way? I don&#x27;t know why they call this a BB Cream. It bears no resemblance whatsofreaking ever to real BB creams. It kind of just made me angry with the whole experience.</li>
            <li> I am 45 with fair skin and hazel eyes.  Saw the commercial and wanted to try it.  Fragrance is pretty strong, but it didn&#x27;t bother me.  Comes out white, so I lathered it on before I left the house.  Came home, and hubs says in a shocked voice, what happened to your face?  I rushed to the mirror and almost fell over, it made my face shockingly orange!  It advertises self adjusting, but unless you come from a fantasy land, it doesn&#x27;t adjust to any human skin tone.  Coupled with the fact that it just pretty much laid on the surface of my face and never absorbed in, I could easily wipe it with a tissue.  I am wondering what people thought when they saw me out and about running my errands. ;). Going to dump this stuff and try another brand</li>
            <li> I tried this because I adore the L&#x27;Oreal BB cream.  This did not cover the uneven skin tones and felt too thin,&lt;br /&gt;so I went back to the other L&#x27;Oreal product.</li>
            <li> Hated this product. it&#x27;s greasy, streaky, very light orangy coverage and it smells. There is nothing I liked about this product.</li>
            <li> This cream goes on clear and adjusts to your skins own color. It leaves a nice glow and makes your skin so soft. Love the spf20. This is a light coverage and natural looking cream.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is different from most I have ordered. For one thing, it is more than twice the normal 1oz size. It looks really light when you apply it but within a minute (when it dries) it turns tan/darker. Unfortunately, it is totally sheer so unlike other BB creams (Avon, Mabeline etc) it does not cover even the smallest blemish or red mark.It does even out the complexion though. It is a pretty nice alternative to foundation but only for people who have totally clear skin. Much closer to a facial moisturizer  than any type of light foundation. Goes on very smooth, very light feel. I thought the tiny shimmer to it would look silly on me (middle-aged) but it was OK. I just don&#x27;t like that it makes my reddish complexion more so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair-medium skin-toned woman in my late 50&#x27;s.  Love this stuff!  Light tint and coverage-slight shine when first applied-I just dust with face powder to counter this.  My skin looks and feels great, and it has a builti-in sunscreen!  I&#x27;m seeing it less abundantly on store shelves and hope it is not being fazed out.</li>
            <li> Nice consistency, but it made me a tad orange and it is very fragrant.  Not a bad product, but from all the over the counter BB Creams, the Aveeno for Fair to Light skins worked best on my pale skin.</li>
            <li> Light, delicate, moisturizing, and good coverage all in one. I will definitely buy this product again</li>
            <li> Works well as SPF, BB, primer for liquid or powder foundation, lazy days, rushed days and day cream!! This is what true BB creams are meant to do. Didn&#x27;t break me out, smells fresh/ mildly floral, long term benefits. I&#x27;m in my mid 30s and my skin loves this. For reference, I use Olay Regenerist products, have medium warm skin, dark brown hair and eyes. Blurs my large pores and plumps out fine lines, softens wrinkles. I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I had not done my homework on this product thinking it was the infamous BB Asian cream come to America.  The long and short is it is a disappointing expensive sunscreen that isn&#x27;t even a good one and I use sunblock daily.  This BB cream turns my fair to medium skin a shiny orangish (now reading the purpose on the back of the tube - sunscreen.) I have had more than one person comment on my complexion wondering if I am ill/depressed or people I don&#x27;t know literally just staring at my face oddly if I don&#x27;t put my foundation over it. Also beware of the active ingredients. I gave it 2 stars only because some sunscreen is better than none. I am a long time L&#x27;Oreal user and will not buy this product again or recommend it.</li>
            <li> I tried the sample that was in a foil pack inside the April 2013 issue of Health Magazine.  Interesting stuff - it starts out looking very light pink but then turns into a suntan color as it soaks in.  The suntan color fades after 5 minutes, so give it a little time before you rush to a conclusion.  The color is *very* sheer.  This is not a concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to agree with others who note that this is probably not best for those with very cool, fair skin color. For me, it turns out too yellow/orange. In case it helps for comparison, I use Lancome&#x27;s Teint Idole Ultra 24H in 110 Ivory (C), and Elizabeth Arden Flawless Finish Mousse Foundation in \\&quot;Shell\\&quot; color.  I had to reject Estee Lauder&#x27;s Invisible Fluid makeup in 2CN1 because it was too orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this in winter, when my skin is more pale.</li>
