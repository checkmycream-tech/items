            <li>but i&#x27;m glad i listened to my sister and got it!</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and just buy a better one from walmart!</li>
            <li>These tools are good for the price, but my $14 tool works much better.</li>

            <li>Very nice to clean my face and my family member too.</li>

            <li>My pores are looking so much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok product for its price</li>
            <li>I have been using the loop end the most.</li>
            <li>Here are my tips for getting the most out of your extraction process:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love these for getting my pimples cleaned up.</li>
            <li>We were confident we knew how</li>
            <li>Does the job, my faces heals so much better with these tools.</li>
            <li>Many years ago the physician I worked for had instruments like these for treating acne and blemishes.  </li>
            <li>There are better tools for removing blackheads than this.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s sure not surgical steel.</li>
            <li>more like toy jewelry material.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>I love this product .</li>
            <li>Okay quality.</li>
            <li>This is much better than using a hairpin.  </li>
            <li>Saves money, time, hassle, and most of all, your beautiful natural face!</li>
            <li>If your skin damages easy than be sure to get a thicker version of these tools.</li>
            <li>The main loop is perfect, well made, and better at extracting blackheads and whiteheads compared to a normal loop extractor.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love these use them almost every day works fantastic after shower.</li>
            <li>Product came in safe and sound.</li>
            <li>The needle is nice too, but the blackhead remover is very much worth your purchase.</li>
            <li>Maybe my pores are already clean? :)</li>
            <li>There is some cheap finish on these that was not put on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I guess you get what you paid for, it was cheap.</li>
            <li>I decided to take a chance and buy a pair of cheap blemish extractors,  and boy</li>
            <li>This is made of obviously cheap materials</li>
            <li>They took forever to arrive but when they got here 3 weeks later, they were in great condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;They seem super light and cheap ..</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this in the mail.</li>
            <li>mom with a  teen comes in handy all the time!</li>
            <li>I would just reccomend sanitizing them first just to be safe(:</li>
            <li>THANKS! :-)</li>
            <li>I clean them and sanitize them every time I use them.</li>
            <li>Super cheap,</li>
            <li>I clean it with alcohol.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for black heads, amazing results I wont get graphic</li>
            <li>did I make the right choice!</li>
            <li>Cheap, though, and worth a try.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this is the part with the hole in the end to squeeze out blackheads</li>
            <li>Great handy little tools I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Now this is by FAR the most important step in your skin care routine.  </li>
            <li>This item also arrived really quickly considering that it came all the way from China.  </li>
            <li>Lucky for me</li>
            <li>This seller also provided very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I never received my first order and they offered to resend free of charge.</li>
            <li>For less than two dollars this is a great deal.</li>
            <li>The needlepoint one is great for getting at splinter removal.hoops are sturdy and rake out pesky little blackheads with ease.</li>
            <li>Great little tools.</li>
            <li>it gets my blackheads out and it&#x27;s totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>but it would be useful for someone with severe blackheads or acne</li>
            <li>Additionally there was some kind of hardened substance that was blue and stuck to the tools themselves.  </li>
            <li>Shipping took a while, but was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t mind waiting I think this product is worth it.</li>
            <li>Both of them broke right away.  </li>
            <li>They get the job done, and particularly the blackhead remover is a fantastic innovation.</li>
            <li>Perfect beginner tools for big black heads.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, professional salon/spa grade quality,  </li>
            <li>:) You&#x27;ll need to continue to use these tools on your face regularly for the desired appearance, but trust me, the end result is SO worth your time.</li>
            <li>although for it&#x27;s use and purpose as described, it works very, very well</li>
            <li>I tried it on my sons blackheads, which is what I really bought it for, and it did not work at all!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>The packaging is really funny, though.</li>
            <li>‚óè2 have a warm wet washcloth on hand before you start this process.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>Regular scrubbing reduced the quantity, but there was always one or more hovering on the surface.</li>
            <li>These are really quality tools and have done the job for me!</li>
            <li>I have seen better but for the price I didn&#x27;t bother sending it back.</li>
            <li>I would buy a similar more sturdy and put together version if I can find one but not this one.</li>
            <li>I got the blackhead out first try, in seconds.</li>
            <li>I was weary of this at first</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>It really gets everything out!</li>
            <li>I think it was because the first time it was sent it got lost in the mail or something but thank you for reseeding me it and taking ur time to reply to all my questions.</li>
            <li>Pretty good for such a low price</li>
            <li>Works great to get the black heads out for deep pore cleansing.</li>
            <li>There is a big lump for the chrome finish pooled at the opening of the cup, as you can imagine pushing that against your sensitive facial skin isn&#x27;t so pleasant.</li>
            <li>If you do not want to purchase a good facial steamer right here on Amazon for only about $20 - $25 bucks, then what I would recommend using is simply a STEAMING HOT tall cup of water.</li>
            <li>Makes poppin&#x27; pimples that much easier and efficient without the irritation.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t use it very often.</li>
            <li>TOO MUCH.</li>
            <li>it really works.&amp;#34; Painless.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t damage my skin as much.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really find any use for it</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think I want to use anything but stainless steel to poke into my face.</li>
            <li>Not really anything yo say besides that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much better than digging you nails into your face, and doesn&#x27;t leave marks all over your face.</li>
            <li>Also, these tools are very well made.</li>
            <li>I find myself using these so much.</li>
            <li>These really help with blackheads.</li>
            <li>Or stainless steel.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take that much pressure and everything comes out in one blow.</li>
            <li>really work for blackheads.</li>
            <li>Much much easier than removing blackheads from the hairpin.  </li>
            <li>Great product, it got rid of all of my blemishes virtually pain free and without leaving any facial scars behind!</li>
            <li>Mainly black heads, these extractors are able to get to the bottom of that.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li>I wish it was able to get out the super deep black heads out</li>
            <li>Now all you do is gently pat away the excess water you&#x27;ll have on your face from the steam with your damp, warm washcloth, and GENTLY AT FIRST press down on the infected area with your tool, focusing the blemish into the center of the tool.</li>
            <li>Well worth the wait for International shipping.</li>
            <li>You put your nose and mouth into the tall cup or mug with the piping hot water already in it, and just gently blow onto the water with your face directly above the cup.</li>
            <li>The pointy sharp end is great for extracting small pores.</li>
            <li>My skin is dark and it is really easy to damage if using the fingers to try to dislodge blackheads.  </li>
            <li>I am very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I actually use a lot for many things and its really sharp and has stayed that way so far.</li>
            <li>I have purchased a more expensive beauty tool like this and this one is just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li>..just expected it to be larger and easy to see..</li>
            <li>This will naturally steam your pores open for you without the hassle of turning on your shower head on full blast for 8 minutes, and this way it also saves you the money of buying a professional facial steamer</li>
            <li>the loops are too big to take care of anything except for large blackheads</li>
            <li>I seriously love these little guys, especially the needle end.</li>
            <li>Not sure really how much these really work.</li>
            <li>I always suffered with huge red marks on my face from the pressure I put on my face with my fingers and nails, this guy makes it a lot less damaging.</li>
            <li>It makes quick work of pimples that are ready to pop, but leaves red rings on skin if you push too hard to get at blackheads.</li>
            <li>Yet to try it cuz the skin is clear, but definitely I won&#x27;t be poking myself with pointy one!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a painless way to clear your skin, look no further.</li>
            <li>Now that area of my face is back to its natural color.  </li>
            <li>Arrived a few days early, exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really know the function of the sharp end of one of the tools.</li>
            <li>This one works pretty well and doesn&#x27;t leave dark red circles all over my face.</li>
            <li>That sucker should squeeze right outof there!</li>
            <li>not painful at all if you steam your face for a little bit before you use it!!</li>
            <li>It does take a little technique to use, so it might feel like it is not working for you at first, but you just need to try different ways.</li>
            <li>The circle parts are so thin that it damages the skin really easy and takes the skin off 8 out of the 10 times when using it.</li>
            <li>With this tools , I can easily get rid of my nasty blackhead , the material is good , I think I can use it in a long time ! !</li>

            <li> Now this is by FAR the most important step in your skin care routine.  </li>
            <li> This item also arrived really quickly considering that it came all the way from China.  </li>
            <li> Lucky for me</li>
            <li> This seller also provided very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I never received my first order and they offered to resend free of charge.</li>
            <li> For less than two dollars this is a great deal.</li>
            <li> The needlepoint one is great for getting at splinter removal.hoops are sturdy and rake out pesky little blackheads with ease.</li>
            <li> Great little tools.</li>
            <li> it gets my blackheads out and it&#x27;s totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> but it would be useful for someone with severe blackheads or acne</li>
            <li> Additionally there was some kind of hardened substance that was blue and stuck to the tools themselves.  </li>
            <li> Shipping took a while, but was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t mind waiting I think this product is worth it.</li>
            <li> Both of them broke right away.  </li>
            <li> They get the job done, and particularly the blackhead remover is a fantastic innovation.</li>
            <li> Perfect beginner tools for big black heads.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, professional salon/spa grade quality,  </li>
            <li> :) You&#x27;ll need to continue to use these tools on your face regularly for the desired appearance, but trust me, the end result is SO worth your time.</li>
            <li> although for it&#x27;s use and purpose as described, it works very, very well</li>
            <li> I tried it on my sons blackheads, which is what I really bought it for, and it did not work at all!  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> The packaging is really funny, though.</li>
            <li> ‚óè2 have a warm wet washcloth on hand before you start this process.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Regular scrubbing reduced the quantity, but there was always one or more hovering on the surface.</li>
            <li> These are really quality tools and have done the job for me!</li>
            <li> I have seen better but for the price I didn&#x27;t bother sending it back.</li>
            <li> I would buy a similar more sturdy and put together version if I can find one but not this one.</li>
            <li> I got the blackhead out first try, in seconds.</li>
            <li> I was weary of this at first</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> It really gets everything out!</li>
            <li> I think it was because the first time it was sent it got lost in the mail or something but thank you for reseeding me it and taking ur time to reply to all my questions.</li>
            <li> Pretty good for such a low price</li>
            <li> Works great to get the black heads out for deep pore cleansing.</li>
            <li> There is a big lump for the chrome finish pooled at the opening of the cup, as you can imagine pushing that against your sensitive facial skin isn&#x27;t so pleasant.</li>
            <li> If you do not want to purchase a good facial steamer right here on Amazon for only about $20 - $25 bucks, then what I would recommend using is simply a STEAMING HOT tall cup of water.</li>
            <li> Makes poppin&#x27; pimples that much easier and efficient without the irritation.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t use it very often.</li>
            <li> TOO MUCH.</li>
            <li> it really works.&amp;#34; Painless.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t damage my skin as much.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t really find any use for it</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think I want to use anything but stainless steel to poke into my face.</li>
            <li> Not really anything yo say besides that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much better than digging you nails into your face, and doesn&#x27;t leave marks all over your face.</li>
            <li> Also, these tools are very well made.</li>
            <li> I find myself using these so much.</li>
            <li> These really help with blackheads.</li>
            <li> Or stainless steel.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take that much pressure and everything comes out in one blow.</li>
            <li> really work for blackheads.</li>
            <li> Much much easier than removing blackheads from the hairpin.  </li>
            <li> Great product, it got rid of all of my blemishes virtually pain free and without leaving any facial scars behind!</li>
            <li> Mainly black heads, these extractors are able to get to the bottom of that.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> I wish it was able to get out the super deep black heads out</li>
            <li> Now all you do is gently pat away the excess water you&#x27;ll have on your face from the steam with your damp, warm washcloth, and GENTLY AT FIRST press down on the infected area with your tool, focusing the blemish into the center of the tool.</li>
            <li> Well worth the wait for International shipping.</li>
            <li> You put your nose and mouth into the tall cup or mug with the piping hot water already in it, and just gently blow onto the water with your face directly above the cup.</li>
            <li> The pointy sharp end is great for extracting small pores.</li>
            <li> My skin is dark and it is really easy to damage if using the fingers to try to dislodge blackheads.  </li>
            <li> I am very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I actually use a lot for many things and its really sharp and has stayed that way so far.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a more expensive beauty tool like this and this one is just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li> ..just expected it to be larger and easy to see..</li>
            <li> This will naturally steam your pores open for you without the hassle of turning on your shower head on full blast for 8 minutes, and this way it also saves you the money of buying a professional facial steamer</li>
            <li> the loops are too big to take care of anything except for large blackheads</li>
            <li> I seriously love these little guys, especially the needle end.</li>
            <li> Not sure really how much these really work.</li>
            <li> I always suffered with huge red marks on my face from the pressure I put on my face with my fingers and nails, this guy makes it a lot less damaging.</li>
            <li> It makes quick work of pimples that are ready to pop, but leaves red rings on skin if you push too hard to get at blackheads.</li>
            <li> Yet to try it cuz the skin is clear, but definitely I won&#x27;t be poking myself with pointy one!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a painless way to clear your skin, look no further.</li>
            <li> Now that area of my face is back to its natural color.  </li>
            <li> Arrived a few days early, exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really know the function of the sharp end of one of the tools.</li>
            <li> This one works pretty well and doesn&#x27;t leave dark red circles all over my face.</li>
            <li> That sucker should squeeze right outof there!</li>
            <li> not painful at all if you steam your face for a little bit before you use it!!</li>
            <li> It does take a little technique to use, so it might feel like it is not working for you at first, but you just need to try different ways.</li>
            <li> The circle parts are so thin that it damages the skin really easy and takes the skin off 8 out of the 10 times when using it.</li>
            <li> With this tools , I can easily get rid of my nasty blackhead , the material is good , I think I can use it in a long time ! !</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product, but if you plan on purchasing from a seller that ships from Hong Kong plan to wait about a week and a half for it.</li>
            <li> The round piece came off the extractor, which is the main part of the tool.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a long time as well.  </li>
            <li> I was attracted by the price of these items but when they arrived they were covered in a strange film.  </li>
            <li> It did take a long time for me to receive it</li>
            <li> and I waited for this for too long</li>
            <li> AS LONG AS YOU DID IT WITH THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend compared to ones they sell in the drugstore that are super expensive.</li>
            <li> (although I would HIGHLY highly recommend that you buy one if you&#x27;re serious about your skin care and overall skin</li>
            <li> Pores on my cheeks are closing up due to this tool removes the white heads that have been in my face for years with no or minimum scaring.  </li>
            <li> Shipping took a very very long time.</li>
            <li> Always had black heads on my back.</li>
            <li> Does the job....  minimal damage to skin....</li>
            <li> ‚óè1 Soak the tip ends that you want to use in isopropyl alcohol for about 45 sec.</li>
            <li> The blackhead remover is what I expected.  </li>
            <li> These items worked as expected.</li>
            <li> never really tried anything like it before</li>
            <li> Obviously you have to be REALLY careful with it, as I&#x27;ve poked my hands a few times.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to use any other part of the tool.</li>
            <li> The other tools make me worry.  </li>
            <li> The part that is supposed to scoop the blackhead out aas jagged and sharp.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to use the sharp end</li>
            <li> However I still have the other end to use</li>
            <li> and I only have a few small ones</li>
            <li> and that tool is sharp!</li>
            <li> my face is now clear of blackheads kinda hurt when i press too hard to get the hard ones</li>
            <li> Very sharp object (caution),</li>
            <li> you have to steam face before using the tool for black heads  </li>
            <li> Bought another black head extractor on here that didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I used the looped end for my blackheads and it worked about 75% of the time and with a little pain.</li>
            <li> it does take a while to come but whatever you&#x27;re paying so little for it.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> The end with the little hole has a pointy piece of finish that would jab your face.  </li>
            <li> I like the little plastic pouch that they send it in.</li>
            <li> ‚óè5 Make certain to wipe the dirty tool end on your washcloth getting all of the icky-sticky stuff off of it, then throughly swish it around in your little cup of isopropyl alcohol after each blemish extraction to insure that you don&#x27;t re-infect your surrounding pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not cheap at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Helps a lot for small black heads or pimples.</li>
            <li> Useless tool, just a sharp needle that it is not clear what you are supposed to do with it,except heart yourselves.</li>
            <li> They work as intended, some are to small to get with this tool</li>
            <li> but then again usually you get this if its a problem</li>
            <li> It is way too small to even see the blackhead when u place on blackhead..</li>
            <li> other tools are sharp and useless.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure what these are made of</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to work so hard to get the blackheads out of the remover.  </li>
            <li> After a long expected wait, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> And the other one, It useless too.</li>
            <li> They are very small and I thought that they would be sturdier than what they are.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone it leaves scars and look ugly but u can&#x27;t definitely get ur blackheads out</li>
            <li> but it left a scar on my face :(  </li>
            <li> Shipping is very slow for this item.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t, like my son&#x27;s whose seem hard, the tool is useless.</li>
            <li> One other bad thing was the set I got</li>
            <li> no a good thing!</li>
            <li> but maybe I was using it wrong.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely useless...</li>
            <li> I am afraid I might break or snap off a part.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid it would scar my skin.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> One blemish is not as bad as the hell a lifetime scar gives you.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that this product comes with no instructions.</li>
            <li> I swear this piece of junk is so worthless....</li>
            <li> It is hysterical!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my disgusting, horrid blackheads that plague my nose, and it does WONDERS!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was disappointed that this product comes with no instructions. I used the looped end for my blackheads and it worked about 75% of the time and with a little pain. I tried it on my sons blackheads, which is what I really bought it for, and it did not work at all!  If you can squeeze them yourself this tool might work for those. If you can&#x27;t, like my son&#x27;s whose seem hard, the tool is useless. I don&#x27;t know how to use any other part of the tool. Shipping is very slow for this item.</li>
            <li> it gets my blackheads out and it&#x27;s totally worth the price. it does take a while to come but whatever you&#x27;re paying so little for it.&lt;br /&gt;5 out of 5 would recommend.</li>
            <li> There is some cheap finish on these that was not put on smoothly.  The end with the little hole has a pointy piece of finish that would jab your face.  Shipping took a long time as well.  I guess you get what you paid for, it was cheap.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s intended</li>
            <li> Shipping took a very very long time. Product is good though.</li>
            <li> Needs instructions on how to use each tool.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all for me but maybe I was using it wrong.</li>
            <li> I love these things. Makes poppin&#x27; pimples that much easier and efficient without the irritation.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product. Doesn&#x27;t work, difficult to use.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Pores on my cheeks are closing up due to this tool removes the white heads that have been in my face for years with no or minimum scaring.  I thought the pits came with age or I notice some smokers have them.  I have always had an oily face but no longer get blackheads.  These were clogging my pores beneath the surface.  Now that area of my face is back to its natural color.  Well worth the wait for International shipping.</li>
            <li> I swear this piece of junk is so worthless....I threw them in the trash almost immediately. Absolutely useless...by no means worth even a penny!!!</li>
            <li> I used it a lot to removed blackhead and whitehead.  Recommend to buy this product, you will be pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this in the mail. It does take a little technique to use, so it might feel like it is not working for you at first, but you just need to try different ways. My pores are looking so much better.</li>
            <li> The packaging is really funny, though. Obviously translated from Chinese to English- It is hysterical! Anyway, the product is good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the best product but it&#x27;s decent. It&#x27;s an ok product for its price but I wouldn&#x27;t use it very often.</li>
            <li> Very nice to clean my face and my family member too. I clean them and sanitize them every time I use them. So do my sisters and son.</li>
            <li> Does the job....  minimal damage to skin.... you have to steam face before using the tool for black heads  and that tool is sharp!</li>
            <li> worked good nice product! perfect for what I needed it for. mom with a  teen comes in handy all the time!</li>
            <li> I decided to take a chance and buy a pair of cheap blemish extractors,  and boy did I make the right choice! Easy to use, professional salon/spa grade quality,  and they came right on time and in beautifully perfect packaged condition. I have been using the loop end the most. I&#x27;ve used it on my disgusting, horrid blackheads that plague my nose, and it does WONDERS! Never has my nose felt so very healthy after using this extractor kit. :) You&#x27;ll need to continue to use these tools on your face regularly for the desired appearance, but trust me, the end result is SO worth your time. Saves money, time, hassle, and most of all, your beautiful natural face! Here are my tips for getting the most out of your extraction process:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‚óè1 Soak the tip ends that you want to use in isopropyl alcohol for about 45 sec. to about a minute.&lt;br /&gt;‚óè2 have a warm wet washcloth on hand before you start this process.&lt;br /&gt;‚óè3 Steam your face. Now this is by FAR the most important step in your skin care routine.  If you do not want to purchase a good facial steamer right here on Amazon for only about $20 - $25 bucks, then what I would recommend using is simply a STEAMING HOT tall cup of water. You put your nose and mouth into the tall cup or mug with the piping hot water already in it, and just gently blow onto the water with your face directly above the cup. This will naturally steam your pores open for you without the hassle of turning on your shower head on full blast for 8 minutes, and this way it also saves you the money of buying a professional facial steamer (although I would HIGHLY highly recommend that you buy one if you&#x27;re serious about your skin care and overall skin health)&lt;br /&gt;‚óè4 Now all you do is gently pat away the excess water you&#x27;ll have on your face from the steam with your damp, warm washcloth, and GENTLY AT FIRST press down on the infected area with your tool, focusing the blemish into the center of the tool. And VOIL&amp;Agrave;! That sucker should squeeze right outof there! If it doesn&#x27;t, DON&#x27;T FORCE IT TOO MUCH. Or else you risk scarring. One blemish is not as bad as the hell a lifetime scar gives you.&lt;br /&gt;‚óè5 Make certain to wipe the dirty tool end on your washcloth getting all of the icky-sticky stuff off of it, then throughly swish it around in your little cup of isopropyl alcohol after each blemish extraction to insure that you don&#x27;t re-infect your surrounding pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy extracting!!</li>
            <li> Best ever pimple remover</li>
            <li> Always had black heads on my back. Regular scrubbing reduced the quantity, but there was always one or more hovering on the surface. Saw a segment on the Dr. Oz show about pimples and blackheads, and he recommended an extractor. I ordered this set and put my husband to work. His response was &amp;#34;Pretty good. Very good idea, and it really works.&amp;#34; Painless. Bye, bye blackheads.</li>
            <li> I seriously love these little guys, especially the needle end. Obviously you have to be REALLY careful with it, as I&#x27;ve poked my hands a few times. I know picking my skin isn&#x27;t good for it, but I feel like with these I don&#x27;t damage my skin as much.</li>
            <li> Arrived a few days early, exactly as promised.  Yet to try it cuz the skin is clear, but definitely I won&#x27;t be poking myself with pointy one!</li>
            <li> These are really quality tools and have done the job for me! Super cheap, but they do take a while to get here.</li>
            <li> the loops are too big to take care of anything except for large blackheads and I only have a few small ones so I didn&#x27;t really find any use for it but it would be useful for someone with severe blackheads or acne</li>
            <li> It makes quick work of pimples that are ready to pop, but leaves red rings on skin if you push too hard to get at blackheads. I bought it for blackheads, so I&#x27;m not giving it five stars. Cheap, though, and worth a try.</li>
            <li> I bought this to get gunk out of my nose/pores, but still haven&#x27;t been able to get anything out! My fiance used it though, and said it totally worked for him. Maybe my pores are already clean? :)</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. Great item. Very easy to use. Seems to be sturdy and does it job. Not overly beautiful and super shiny but works and great for the price</li>
            <li> For less than two dollars this is a great deal. The needlepoint one is great for getting at splinter removal.hoops are sturdy and rake out pesky little blackheads with ease.</li>
            <li> my face is now clear of blackheads kinda hurt when i press too hard to get the hard ones but it works.</li>
            <li> Bought another black head extractor on here that didn&#x27;t work at all. This one works pretty well and doesn&#x27;t leave dark red circles all over my face. I wish it was able to get out the super deep black heads out but it works well on smaller ones, especially in the nose area. I&#x27;m happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> Not well made - I have seen better but for the price I didn&#x27;t bother sending it back. Save your money.</li>
            <li> This is made of obviously cheap materials and I don&#x27;t think I want to use anything but stainless steel to poke into my face. It&#x27;s a Chinese product with only Chinese language on the packaging. It was only three bucks so I won&#x27;t return it. I guess that&#x27;s how they get you.</li>
            <li> The require a lot of pressure to be applied and I still don&#x27;t always get results.  I still use them but....</li>
            <li> I was attracted by the price of these items but when they arrived they were covered in a strange film.  It was sticky and I thoroughly washed them to remove the film.  Additionally there was some kind of hardened substance that was blue and stuck to the tools themselves.  It looked a bit like toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> The round piece came off the extractor, which is the main part of the tool. Very cheaply constructed. I would buy a similar more sturdy and put together version if I can find one but not this one.</li>
            <li> Both of them broke right away.  The tip just broke off.</li>
            <li> Very sharp object (caution), although for it&#x27;s use and purpose as described, it works very, very well I must say.</li>
            <li> They work as intended, some are to small to get with this tool but then again usually you get this if its a problem, I got it since i saw some you tube video of a doctor who was using the tool to remove &amp;#34;acne/blackheads&amp;#34;without damaging your skin by scaring it with your finger nails. Great handy little tools I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think it would be smaller, the circle, for your blackheads; like I&#x27;ve seen in videos. So it&#x27;s just another thing sitting around taking up space</li>
            <li> Excellent for black heads, amazing results I wont get graphic but if you need one of these you will be impressed.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic! I purchased this on december 21 came in december 23, works great, i have head 6-10 blackheads for years finally got rid of em.</li>
            <li> It is way too small to even see the blackhead when u place on blackhead..also the loops are not even big..just expected it to be larger and easy to see..</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to get used to how it will work with your skin (everyone is different) but it is a quality product. I use it often and it works great.</li>
            <li> They work I would just reccomend sanitizing them first just to be safe(:</li>
            <li> Good buy, good shipping!</li>
            <li> This was a good product at an excellent price.  I recommend it if you&#x27;re in need of skin care extraction.</li>
            <li> Work we&#x27;ll and do what they tell you...I would recommend this to anyone it leaves scars and look ugly but u can&#x27;t definitely get ur blackheads out</li>
            <li> Works great to get the black heads out for deep pore cleansing. I definitely recommend compared to ones they sell in the drugstore that are super expensive. This seller also provided very fast shipping! I</li>
            <li> Is what it is, and foes what it&#x27;s advertised to do. Not really anything yo say besides that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much better than digging you nails into your face, and doesn&#x27;t leave marks all over your face.</li>
            <li> They are very small and I thought that they would be sturdier than what they are. The circle parts are so thin that it damages the skin really easy and takes the skin off 8 out of the 10 times when using it. If your skin damages easy than be sure to get a thicker version of these tools. The needle end I actually use a lot for many things and its really sharp and has stayed that way so far.</li>
            <li> Love these for getting my pimples cleaned up.</li>
            <li> A great way to pop those pimples.</li>
            <li> I just receive this yesterday. Took a month to arrive lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it. It looks sturdy.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife because we discovered a blackhead in her ear that neither of us could get. It was quite noticeable. We waited for a couple weeks after ordering to receive it. We watched a video online about how to use the product. We were confident we knew how but the video had great tips. I got the blackhead out first try, in seconds. Awesome. Also, these tools are very well made. Not cheap at all. Would recommend and would buy again! Can&#x27;t be beat for the price although be prepared to wait for it to arrive.</li>
            <li> Great product, it got rid of all of my blemishes virtually pain free and without leaving any facial scars behind!</li>
            <li> I happened upon these items after watching a Korean drama.  My skin is dark and it is really easy to damage if using the fingers to try to dislodge blackheads.  This product allowed me to pinpoint the blackhead, remove it, and maintain the integrity of my skin with no scarring.  This item also arrived really quickly considering that it came all the way from China.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Perfect beginner tools for big black heads.</li>
            <li> Does the job, my faces heals so much better with these tools.</li>
            <li> Useless tool, just a sharp needle that it is not clear what you are supposed to do with it,except heart yourselves. And the other one, It useless too.</li>
            <li> Very nice seller. I never received my first order and they offered to resend free of charge. Great quality item and very kind seller. The pointy sharp end is great for extracting small pores. Great tools.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these use them almost every day works fantastic after shower.</li>
            <li> They work and you get what you order.</li>
            <li> This item exceeded my expectations!  Many years ago the physician I worked for had instruments like these for treating acne and blemishes.  Shipping took a while, but was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> This product is really great. I find myself using these so much. I like that it is a two pack with different sides. I use alcohal to sterilize between uses and I have noticed a difference in my acne. By using these tools instead of my fingers my flareups are not as stubborn as before.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use. There are better tools for removing blackheads than this. The hoop can be bigger. Don&#x27;t really know the function of the sharp end of one of the tools.</li>
            <li> The blackhead remover is what I expected.  The other tools make me worry.  I am afraid I might break or snap off a part.  One other bad thing was the set I got had no instructions and the text on the package was written in Chinese. (I think)  Lucky for me I have had a derm use these on me so I know what to do.</li>
            <li> I have seen these used on youtube but they didn&#x27;t seem to work well for my family. They also hurt to use.</li>
            <li> Great little tools. They took forever to arrive but when they got here 3 weeks later, they were in great condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helps a lot for small black heads or pimples. I always suffered with huge red marks on my face from the pressure I put on my face with my fingers and nails, this guy makes it a lot less damaging.</li>
            <li> These really help with blackheads. I like the little plastic pouch that they send it in. It helps to keep them together and prevent losing them. It did take a long time for me to receive it but if you don&#x27;t mind waiting I think this product is worth it.</li>
            <li> These items worked as expected. I use the needle point quite often to break the skin. Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> never really tried anything like it before but i&#x27;m glad i listened to my sister and got it! not painful at all if you steam your face for a little bit before you use it!!</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this is the part with the hole in the end to squeeze out blackheads but it left a scar on my face :(  other tools are sharp and useless. Do yourself a favor and just buy a better one from walmart!</li>
            <li> After a long expected wait, I was disappointed. It came damaged. The part that is supposed to scoop the blackhead out aas jagged and sharp. I was NOT going to put that to my face. Trash.</li>
            <li> Promptly shippesd &amp; arrived as described.  THANKS! :-)</li>
            <li> These tools are very cheap, and very fantastic. They get the job done, and particularly the blackhead remover is a fantastic innovation. The needle is nice too, but the blackhead remover is very much worth your purchase.</li>
            <li> received only 1 although I ordered 10</li>
            <li> Not sure really how much these really work. My daughter wanted them for Christmas and it seems like she is always picking her face now that she has these....no a good thing!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure what these are made of but it&#x27;s sure not surgical steel. Or stainless steel. Or Steel. Doesn&#x27;t seem sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;They seem super light and cheap .. more like toy jewelry material.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a more expensive beauty tool like this and this one is just as good, if not better. I&#x27;d order it again.</li>
            <li> I was weary of this at first but I was tried of hurting my fianc&amp;eacute; that I figured what&#x27;s the harm. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this. It doesn&#x27;t take that much pressure and everything comes out in one blow. I haven&#x27;t had to use the sharp end but the rest of it works great.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> These tools are good for the price, but my $14 tool works much better. It might be helpful for instructions on use to be included.</li>
            <li> I know it is very cheap product but wasn&#x27;t working that well and I waited for this for too long</li>
            <li> I love this product . It really gets everything out! (: it doesn&#x27;t scar AT ALL . NO MATTER WHAT YOU POP OR REMOVE AS LONG AS YOU DID IT WITH THIS PRODUCT IT WILL NOT SCAR !!:) I&#x27;ve had it for three months I clean it with alcohol.  Hasn&#x27;t tarnished .</li>
            <li> They do a good job but could&#x27;ve done without them</li>
            <li> Pretty good for such a low price</li>
            <li> Okay quality. Isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d call medical grade. They work for what they are needed for, don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy them again. There is a big lump for the chrome finish pooled at the opening of the cup, as you can imagine pushing that against your sensitive facial skin isn&#x27;t so pleasant. However I still have the other end to use so I didn&#x27;t throw it out.</li>
            <li> Product came in safe and sound. (: it finally came in, bit I think it was because the first time it was sent it got lost in the mail or something but thank you for reseeding me it and taking ur time to reply to all my questions. Thank you once again.</li>
            <li> Works good for extracting zitts</li>
            <li> really work for blackheads.</li>
            <li> A great tool I am referring to the tool with the loop ends not the one with the lancet. The main loop is perfect, well made, and better at extracting blackheads and whiteheads compared to a normal loop extractor. I would highly recommend this product, but if you plan on purchasing from a seller that ships from Hong Kong plan to wait about a week and a half for it. I received my item before the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> I suffer from acne. Mainly black heads, these extractors are able to get to the bottom of that. If you are looking for a painless way to clear your skin, look no further.</li>
            <li> With this tools , I can easily get rid of my nasty blackhead , the material is good , I think I can use it in a long time ! !</li>
            <li> ...and that&#x27;s what these are. It&#x27;s not quite the same model that I had growing up that I got from the dermatologist but it works.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would scar my skin. I am very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet.  But the price is write and it is what is says it is...zit poker, popper, etc.</li>
            <li> This is much better than using a hairpin.  The removers are the perfect size.  You don&#x27;t have to work so hard to get the blackheads out of the remover.  Much much easier than removing blackheads from the hairpin.  Try it, You&#x27;ll like it.</li>
