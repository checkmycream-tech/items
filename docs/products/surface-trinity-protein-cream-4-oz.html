            <li> down side: I don&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li> I have thin and fine hair.  </li>
            <li> My relaxed hair was really damaged from not conditioning, getting trims and and excessive blow drying and using the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t look flat.</li>
            <li> This works well because then my fine, thin hair isn&#x27;t weighted down.</li>
            <li> it air dried, but otherwise it was completely manageable</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair dresser gives me so much grief (in a good way) for how dry my hair is.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate &amp; have thick, short hair.</li>
            <li> I then dry it and blow it out.  </li>
            <li> My dry hair loves this.</li>
            <li> I brush it through,blow dry, apply bassu gold oil, and straighten.</li>
            <li> I use it every time I wash and blow dry my hair!</li>
            <li> If your hair needs a little help later in the day, just spray it with water and the product keeps working.  </li>
            <li> I have thin curly long hair, so keeping it manageable in south Texas humidity is no small issue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> not worth the price.</li>
            <li> It conditions well without weighing my hair down or making it look oily.  </li>
            <li> less hair</li>
            <li> So a little goes</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> so I add water (1 part water to one part cream) and mix in a separate pump bottle (a small hand soap pump bottle).</li>
            <li> I find the cream too thick</li>
            <li> I have thick and color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> No more tangles!</li>
            <li> I wish it were less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have the worst hair.  </li>

Using this product before drying it has helped keep my hair in great shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only down side: I don&#x27;t really like the smell. But the benefit to the texture of my hair makes up for that!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product a year ago by my hair stylist and I absolutely love this protein spray!  My hair is very fine and tangles easy when wet, and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that actually works well as a leave-in conditioner and helps to brush my hair out without ripping it out and damaging it.  It smells great and the spray nozzle coats you hair well!</li>
            <li> For starters--I have straight, fine, slightly frizzy hair that manages to poof out no matter how often I use a deep conditioning treatment or products to repair it.  I used this for the first time today, and WOW!!!  It&#x27;s the best hair day I&#x27;ve had in a LONG time because it didn&#x27;t poof out!  I have shoulder length hair and sprayed 2 pumps of the protein cream into my hands.  I then rubbed them together, ran my fingers through my damp hair and brushed it like I normally do.  I had to do a quick brushing once it air dried, but otherwise it was completely manageable and I found myself running my fingers through my hair frequently because it was SO soft!  Just the right amount of shine too.  I got this in a subscription box, and I am very happy I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> i use this all the time on my dyed curly hair...I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product line. I LOVE their Bassu hair oil as well!</li>
            <li> I absolutley love this product! It makes my hair very shiney, soft, and manageable. I really recommend this product to anyone to help the texture of their hair!</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I have thin and fine hair.  This product help my hair look and feel healthier.  Also, I am a hair twirler:) and it helped my hair become significantly stronger .so less hair breakage.&lt;br /&gt;The good news is if you use too much of this hair product is will make your hair heavy and feeling like it is filled with product.  So a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I use it while my hair is wet, massage it in right after towel drying, then use a wet brush to comb through my hair.  This works well because then my fine, thin hair isn&#x27;t weighted down. I then dry it and blow it out.  It&#x27;s just like a vitamin for your hair.  Love the results I have received.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I use it every time I wash and blow dry my hair! Works great to keep the frizz awa.</li>
            <li> This product works well but has soy protein in it ( I am allergic). If you aren&#x27;t allergic to soy then this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair that breaks easy, especially in the winter.  This product makes your hair stronger, softer, and gives it a great shine.  I use it daily.</li>
            <li> Again anything from Surface is the best</li>
            <li> You do not need a lot of product to get the smoothing results, smells great  great quick spray in conditioner</li>
            <li> not worth the price. it smells really good, but it leaves my hair feeling somewhat crusty or stiff. I was hoping for softer hair from it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 4 years now &amp; it&#x27;s perfect for my tangled wet hair. I can comb it out so much easier with the protein cream and then I use a styling product after that. Not too heavy. I have thin, easily tangled hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I like to use products together from the same line.  I have used Surface&#x27;s shampoo, conditioner, deep conditioner and styling products. I have the worst hair.  I am transitioning from relaxer to virgin hair.  My relaxed hair was really damaged from not conditioning, getting trims and and excessive blow drying and using the flat iron.  I can&#x27;t say that this repaired my hair or provided a miracle result but it is a very rich, luxurious product and now when I do heat style I spray some of it in my hair before blow drying or sitting under the hooded dryer.  This is a great company and they have developed top of the line products.  I suggest buying this if you like heat protectant and are looking for a more substantial product.  My stylist uses these products and that was my reason for the purchase.</li>
            <li> Such a great product and smells so good. My hair dresser gives me so much grief (in a good way) for how dry my hair is. I wash it too much. This stuff is my saving grace with her :-)</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I wish it were less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have used Surface Trinity Protein Cream on my hair for several years.  I find it really helps to keep my frizzy hair under better control than other products I have used (note that it is not a miracle product).  This cream also keeps your hair soft, not stiff like other control products.  If your hair needs a little help later in the day, just spray it with water and the product keeps working.  I find the cream too thick so I add water (1 part water to one part cream) and mix in a separate pump bottle (a small hand soap pump bottle).</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. No more tangles!</li>
            <li> Great product for helping with hair growth and hair strengthening!  Received within 2 business days!</li>
            <li> Love this product, have used for years!</li>
            <li> MY hair was dry ,frizzy,and pretty much dead it was even falling out this spray along with the shampoo &amp; cond brings your hair back to life love it !</li>
            <li> On my, admittedly find hair this stuff over powered it, and left my hair sticky.  Seller does not accept returns.  I think this should be bought at a store so you can take it back if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> My dry hair loves this. You only need a couple sprays.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Its great for color treated hair.  I won&#x27;t use anything else on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renee Jones</li>
            <li> Love the product and the customer service has been excellent.</li>
            <li> again, you only need a few sptitz&#x27;s to achieve a great result. It is especially good in the dry winter months</li>
            <li> I have hair prone to greasiness rather quickly so I am always hesitant about &amp;#34;after-shower&amp;#34; products. This makes my hair feel amazing and it never transforms to a greasy mess as times goes on.</li>
            <li> I love this protein cream and I use it along with Surface Bassu Gold Hydrating Oil. I spray this on damp hair. (The mist is nice and fine, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about applying too much in one spot. You can also spray it on your palm, rub your hands together and smooth through your hair that way) I brush it through,blow dry, apply bassu gold oil, and straighten. With these 2 products my hair has never looked better. I use an organic, sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner brand and all of these things together make my hair look incredibly healthy, smooth and shiny. I&#x27;m forever grateful to Surface!</li>
            <li> An amazing product for maintaining shine and healthy texture!!!! Managing style and appearance is a breeze!!!!!!! So easy to order Amazon. Com..... No hassle shopping!!!!!</li>
            <li> great for dry, damaged hair.  very pleased with product.</li>
            <li> Protects my hair when I flat iron it and makes it so soft.  Love this stuff.  I have thick and color treated hair.  It is perfect!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have problems with the sprayer getting clogged.  I usually just pour a dab onto my palms and that works better than spraying.  Great for frizz.</li>
            <li> Amazing protein spray, best around for color treated long hair</li>
