            <li>This is fantastic!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite exfoliator, and I have tried a lot of them.  </li>
            <li>I looked up &amp;#34;best exfoliating for face&amp;#34; and this is one of the top products.  </li>
            <li>love this face wash.</li>
            <li>And make sure you rinse thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I love so many of philosophy&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>I love Philosophy&#x27;s cleansing line.  </li>
            <li>Love all their products -</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for many years.  </li>
            <li>My all time favorite fash wash.  </li>
            <li>I love how my skin feels when I ues this product.</li>
            <li>I love Philosophy products.</li>
            <li>Love this,has been using it for years and could never be without it.</li>
            <li>Nothing outstanding.</li>
            <li>Yes, the top does clog a bit</li>
            <li>This product is gentle yet scrubs very nicely.  </li>
            <li>For older people who still have breakouts, it does a great job of preparing skin to better absorb acne products.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>When my face was closely examined before a microdermabrasion at the spa, I was told I have very clean skin.</li>
            <li>It is mild but effective.  </li>
            <li>It also makes make-up smooth on better.</li>
            <li>Just like all of the other Philosophy products that I have tried this is great!</li>
            <li>The lid on this container gets easily clogged up.</li>
            <li>I find that it&#x27;s very mild, but gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>I have tried to shake the bottle but all that is there is a nearly full bottle of smooth product that does just an OK job of cleansing.</li>
            <li>feel so good on the skin, even my skin that is so very sensitive with rosacea.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite addition to my skin cleansing ritual!</li>
            <li>I ahve been using this scrub for years and love that the grains are very fine and feel like they are really getting my skin clean.</li>
            <li>After one use I noticed a huge difference all over my body.</li>
            <li>LIght exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>But I think it is important to watch your eyes</li>
            <li>I searched all over the internet for a product that was reasonably priced and effective.  </li>
            <li>Great product - feels like a facial every time I take a shower.  </li>
            <li>Another great product from Philosophy, and like all Philosophy skin care you only need the SMALLEST amount!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice and it really does work.</li>
            <li>This product is great for minor exfoliation each morning.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for carrying this!  :)</li>
            <li>It feels great, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin</li>
            <li>It does a great job of clearing up dry skin while moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>granules give me the feeling of clean without any irritation to my skin.</li>
            <li>There is not perfume smell nor chemical smell to this product--just clean smelling.  </li>
            <li>I like knowing that my pores are clean.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I have used soap, (even the most gentle), on my face since I was 30.</li>
            <li>I love this facial cleanser: very fine  </li>
            <li>I SERIOUSLY FEEL BETTER ABOUT MYSELF!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way to mild.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that makes my face clear and soft.</li>
            <li>My face really does feel clean and smooth after.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has a light exfoliation to give you a deep clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing daily face wash.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Buy lush face products they work better on your skin.</li>
            <li>I love to exfoliate to keep my skin to keep it young and glowing.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several products from philosophy and liked them so decided to try this.  </li>
            <li>it is a great purchase because there is no color, no dye, no moisturizers, nothing except a super gentle scrub that sloughs off dry skin and leaves skin feeling soft, smooth, and fresh.  </li>
            <li>After a daily sweaty workout, I love the clean this does to my face.</li>
            <li>so it all seemed to be right.  </li>
            <li>Now it seems all of the nice little exfoliating beads that worked so well to smooth out</li>
            <li>And it is pretty right.  </li>
            <li>product is absolutely, totally the best,  Gentle enough to use every day and powerful enough to get results!!!!</li>
            <li>When I first used these products I knew immediately that I had smelled them at a spa.</li>
            <li>Clears up your skin with in the first week or two of use.</li>
            <li>I enjojy it so much I have given it as a gift!</li>
            <li>Plus - in the middle of all of my current stress, it&#x27;s nice to have something that adds a bit of luxury to my day!</li>
            <li>Not that I&#x27;m splashing it around in my eyes, it just lets me know there are some harsh/not sensitive skin friendly ingredients in here.</li>
            <li>Usually order it directly from Philosphy but found the quick delivery and economical price on Amazon too good to pass up.  </li>
            <li>It leaves the skin feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on the face/neck and leaves your skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Although the price seems high, it only takes a quarter-sized dollop to do my face, neck, chest, and shoulders; it&#x27;s a good value because it goes a LONG way.  </li>
            <li>My skin has cleared up and is smooth from the tiny exfoliates.</li>
            <li>morning and night I washed my face with it, scrubbing gently with my fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I use it daily and follow it with hope in a jar moisturizer for incredibly smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Shake very well when using...</li>
            <li>Very runny and exfoliating &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; dissolve as you rub them in  </li>
            <li>It exfoliated the skin gently</li>
            <li>And if you have a gentle make-up remover, I would use it before applying a dollop of  Philosophy Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I went straight to Philosophy.</li>
            <li>Really scrub my face</li>
            <li>The exfoliants are that gentle.</li>
            <li>Leaves me with a fresh face every time, recommended by my skin care professional.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going through a very stressful time with a child in the hospital for over six months, and my face/skin shows it.</li>
            <li>It cleans and exfoliates and does it gently.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>cuz it really works on my skin.id like to slap proactive docs in the face for sellng garbage and congeadulate philosphy for there product nothings ever worked</li>
            <li>SO MUCH PHILOSPHY</li>
            <li>so I purchased the 16 oz (which I thought was a bit much).  </li>
            <li>It really works for me.  </li>
            <li>Really clens your face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using,  my face feels clean but not dry.  </li>
            <li>; it works better than other well known name brands.</li>
            <li>I like this although I&#x27;ve used other products that were more of an exfoliant.  </li>
            <li>As long as I keep it low, like right around my cheek bones, it seems ok</li>
            <li>I am in love with Philosophy brand, as they tend to treat my extremely dry and sensitive skin quite well.</li>
            <li>Once you get past the spoiled fruit smell it is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Whether it&#x27;s the purity made simple, when hope is not enough, or otherwise, I generally love this line.</li>
            <li>next morning i seen a tremendous improvment l.bi could never afford proactive</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend alone with the purity cleanser.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this for all skin types.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this face wash to others</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Based on very positive reviews I finally decided to try Philosophy Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash.  </li>
            <li>I had a lot of clogged pores on my forehead and chin from dead skin cells that weren&#x27;t being sloughed off well enough, I decided to try this cleanser out and loved it, especially in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin in my old age (65) and need to use my Vani-cream etc.</li>
            <li>To apply you just get a little on your fingers and scrub lightly in circular motions on your face for up to thirty-seconds or so.  </li>
            <li>My skin is starting to clear up very well.</li>
            <li>I am a guy, and have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates yet still leaves your skin moist and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 15 years old</li>
            <li>It cleans the skin and also sloughs off old skin cells.</li>
            <li>Well, I went to have a trial makeup session for my wedding done, and the lady suggested I start exfoliating even though I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t have enough of the micro abrasion stuff in the bottle to do anything for my face.</li>
            <li>Also the purity facial wash just melts off make up and is a gentle complement to use along with the exfoliating wash.</li>
            <li>Yummy and no harsh chemical smell.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft, and the dull/dry look has disappeared.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This exfoliator is so gentle that it can be used daily.  </li>
            <li>This is gentle, made for daily use.  </li>
            <li>I recalled using this in the past, but wow has it made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Within the first time of using this product, I had a soft pink glow.  </li>
            <li>so while the cost seems large, the product goes a long way.</li>
            <li>have told me various things about them:  too much fat in the diet, not drinking enough water, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Gentle enough to not irritate the skin with regular exfoliation, but it also does a thorough job of exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>I have always used gentle facial cleansers, especially those recommended by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>I tried a different, highly regarded cleanser, but came back to Philosophy, as I far prefer it.</li>
            <li>There is no other exfoliant out there quite like this one...</li>
            <li>This product is sensitive enough for daily use which really helps with my sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for male or female.  </li>
            <li>This product is the only cleanser/scrub that has kept my skin clear.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was recommended in the local news for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better and much less than my dermatologist!!!!</li>
            <li>I am 50 now and have large pores that get clogged with every other cleanser and makeup I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>MDW does have a fragrance, which isn&#x27;t exactly pleasant or unpleasant, but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger on the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really been in to washing my face, but mainly because I have never found a decent wash that didn&#x27;t dry out my skin ASAP.</li>
            <li>It makes my face brighter and youthful, I do not recommend this as a everyday wash, although you can but scrubbing to much can be damaging,...perfect for make up removal!</li>
            <li>Then, it promptly goes back to being dry and sensitive.</li>

            <li> I have been using this for many years.  </li>
            <li> My all time favorite fash wash.  </li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels when I ues this product.</li>
            <li> I love Philosophy products.</li>
            <li> Love this,has been using it for years and could never be without it.</li>
            <li> Nothing outstanding.</li>
            <li> Yes, the top does clog a bit</li>
            <li> This product is gentle yet scrubs very nicely.  </li>
            <li> For older people who still have breakouts, it does a great job of preparing skin to better absorb acne products.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> When my face was closely examined before a microdermabrasion at the spa, I was told I have very clean skin.</li>
            <li> It is mild but effective.  </li>
            <li> It also makes make-up smooth on better.</li>
            <li> Just like all of the other Philosophy products that I have tried this is great!</li>
            <li> The lid on this container gets easily clogged up.</li>
            <li> I find that it&#x27;s very mild, but gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> I have tried to shake the bottle but all that is there is a nearly full bottle of smooth product that does just an OK job of cleansing.</li>
            <li> feel so good on the skin, even my skin that is so very sensitive with rosacea.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite addition to my skin cleansing ritual!</li>
            <li> I ahve been using this scrub for years and love that the grains are very fine and feel like they are really getting my skin clean.</li>
            <li> After one use I noticed a huge difference all over my body.</li>
            <li> LIght exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> But I think it is important to watch your eyes</li>
            <li> I searched all over the internet for a product that was reasonably priced and effective.  </li>
            <li> Great product - feels like a facial every time I take a shower.  </li>
            <li> Another great product from Philosophy, and like all Philosophy skin care you only need the SMALLEST amount!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice and it really does work.</li>
            <li> This product is great for minor exfoliation each morning.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for carrying this!  :)</li>
            <li> It feels great, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin</li>
            <li> It does a great job of clearing up dry skin while moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> granules give me the feeling of clean without any irritation to my skin.</li>
            <li> There is not perfume smell nor chemical smell to this product--just clean smelling.  </li>
            <li> I like knowing that my pores are clean.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have used soap, (even the most gentle), on my face since I was 30.</li>
            <li> I love this facial cleanser: very fine  </li>
            <li> I SERIOUSLY FEEL BETTER ABOUT MYSELF!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way to mild.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that makes my face clear and soft.</li>
            <li> My face really does feel clean and smooth after.  </li>
            <li> I love that it has a light exfoliation to give you a deep clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing daily face wash.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Buy lush face products they work better on your skin.</li>
            <li> I love to exfoliate to keep my skin to keep it young and glowing.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several products from philosophy and liked them so decided to try this.  </li>
            <li> it is a great purchase because there is no color, no dye, no moisturizers, nothing except a super gentle scrub that sloughs off dry skin and leaves skin feeling soft, smooth, and fresh.  </li>
            <li> After a daily sweaty workout, I love the clean this does to my face.</li>
            <li> so it all seemed to be right.  </li>
            <li> Now it seems all of the nice little exfoliating beads that worked so well to smooth out</li>
            <li> And it is pretty right.  </li>
            <li> product is absolutely, totally the best,  Gentle enough to use every day and powerful enough to get results!!!!</li>
            <li> When I first used these products I knew immediately that I had smelled them at a spa.</li>
            <li> Clears up your skin with in the first week or two of use.</li>
            <li> I enjojy it so much I have given it as a gift!</li>
            <li> Plus - in the middle of all of my current stress, it&#x27;s nice to have something that adds a bit of luxury to my day!</li>
            <li> Not that I&#x27;m splashing it around in my eyes, it just lets me know there are some harsh/not sensitive skin friendly ingredients in here.</li>
            <li> Usually order it directly from Philosphy but found the quick delivery and economical price on Amazon too good to pass up.  </li>
            <li> It leaves the skin feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on the face/neck and leaves your skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Although the price seems high, it only takes a quarter-sized dollop to do my face, neck, chest, and shoulders; it&#x27;s a good value because it goes a LONG way.  </li>
            <li> My skin has cleared up and is smooth from the tiny exfoliates.</li>
            <li> morning and night I washed my face with it, scrubbing gently with my fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I use it daily and follow it with hope in a jar moisturizer for incredibly smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Shake very well when using...</li>
            <li> Very runny and exfoliating &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; dissolve as you rub them in  </li>
            <li> It exfoliated the skin gently</li>
            <li> And if you have a gentle make-up remover, I would use it before applying a dollop of  Philosophy Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went straight to Philosophy.</li>
            <li> Really scrub my face</li>
            <li> The exfoliants are that gentle.</li>
            <li> Leaves me with a fresh face every time, recommended by my skin care professional.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going through a very stressful time with a child in the hospital for over six months, and my face/skin shows it.</li>
            <li> It cleans and exfoliates and does it gently.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> cuz it really works on my skin.id like to slap proactive docs in the face for sellng garbage and congeadulate philosphy for there product nothings ever worked</li>
            <li> SO MUCH PHILOSPHY</li>
            <li> so I purchased the 16 oz (which I thought was a bit much).  </li>
            <li> It really works for me.  </li>
            <li> Really clens your face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using,  my face feels clean but not dry.  </li>
            <li> ; it works better than other well known name brands.</li>
            <li> I like this although I&#x27;ve used other products that were more of an exfoliant.  </li>
            <li> As long as I keep it low, like right around my cheek bones, it seems ok</li>
            <li> I am in love with Philosophy brand, as they tend to treat my extremely dry and sensitive skin quite well.</li>
            <li> Once you get past the spoiled fruit smell it is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s the purity made simple, when hope is not enough, or otherwise, I generally love this line.</li>
            <li> next morning i seen a tremendous improvment l.bi could never afford proactive</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend alone with the purity cleanser.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this for all skin types.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this face wash to others</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Based on very positive reviews I finally decided to try Philosophy Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash.  </li>
            <li> I had a lot of clogged pores on my forehead and chin from dead skin cells that weren&#x27;t being sloughed off well enough, I decided to try this cleanser out and loved it, especially in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin in my old age (65) and need to use my Vani-cream etc.</li>
            <li> To apply you just get a little on your fingers and scrub lightly in circular motions on your face for up to thirty-seconds or so.  </li>
            <li> My skin is starting to clear up very well.</li>
            <li> I am a guy, and have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates yet still leaves your skin moist and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 15 years old</li>
            <li> It cleans the skin and also sloughs off old skin cells.</li>
            <li> Well, I went to have a trial makeup session for my wedding done, and the lady suggested I start exfoliating even though I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t have enough of the micro abrasion stuff in the bottle to do anything for my face.</li>
            <li> Also the purity facial wash just melts off make up and is a gentle complement to use along with the exfoliating wash.</li>
            <li> Yummy and no harsh chemical smell.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft, and the dull/dry look has disappeared.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This exfoliator is so gentle that it can be used daily.  </li>
            <li> This is gentle, made for daily use.  </li>
            <li> I recalled using this in the past, but wow has it made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Within the first time of using this product, I had a soft pink glow.  </li>
            <li> so while the cost seems large, the product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> have told me various things about them:  too much fat in the diet, not drinking enough water, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Gentle enough to not irritate the skin with regular exfoliation, but it also does a thorough job of exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> I have always used gentle facial cleansers, especially those recommended by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> I tried a different, highly regarded cleanser, but came back to Philosophy, as I far prefer it.</li>
            <li> There is no other exfoliant out there quite like this one...</li>
            <li> This product is sensitive enough for daily use which really helps with my sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for male or female.  </li>
            <li> This product is the only cleanser/scrub that has kept my skin clear.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was recommended in the local news for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better and much less than my dermatologist!!!!</li>
            <li> I am 50 now and have large pores that get clogged with every other cleanser and makeup I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> MDW does have a fragrance, which isn&#x27;t exactly pleasant or unpleasant, but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really been in to washing my face, but mainly because I have never found a decent wash that didn&#x27;t dry out my skin ASAP.</li>
            <li> It makes my face brighter and youthful, I do not recommend this as a everyday wash, although you can but scrubbing to much can be damaging,...perfect for make up removal!</li>
            <li> Then, it promptly goes back to being dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it is not too rough on my delicate aging skin.</li>
            <li> I bought the 16 oz bottle and it will last me a LONG, LONG time!</li>
            <li> The little corrosive things tend to get in my eyes even if I don&#x27;t run the wash near my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The difference between Philosophy and other facial cleansers, is that this is an exfoliating wash.</li>
            <li> I bought this for post-pregnancy dry skin and it worked wonders.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out either.</li>
            <li> So...good-bye dry flaky</li>
            <li> and I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Does not leave my face dry.</li>
            <li> I could not live without this face wash.</li>
            <li> about a month ago I started to use this bottle of philosophy microderm exfoliating wash every single day.  </li>
            <li> bottle lasts about 6-7 months and that&#x27;s using 1-2 pumps every single night</li>
            <li> moisturization in this very cold, dry winter weather, I use Philosophy&#x27;s Back to Nourishment moisturizer, which I also love.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve done anything to my skin, other than it feels slightly smoother for the next five minutes.</li>
            <li> Too harsh and this size bottle would last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> Imagine a left out papaya, some lemons and few bananas</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter if you use this wash, or another, or soap, always be careful to rinse all residue off before patting dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful what I use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just your standard pop-up lid, but it gets jammed up with dried out face wash.</li>
            <li> You betcha and won&#x27;t buy any other competing product because it works worders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh, and it burns if you accidentally get it in your eyes, which I haven&#x27;t had happen with other philosophy products before.</li>
            <li> There are little exfoliating beads in it that scrub just enough to take off that layer of dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I am very careful with what I put on my skin.</li>
            <li> It polishes my skin without scrubbing too hard and cleanses at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Basically had to throw away over half the bottle since it lost it&#x27;s exfoliating powers.</li>
            <li> apply this to my slightly damp face and massage for about 30 seconds...always massage upward.</li>
            <li> This worked well and has the little pieces in it for exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> Although this scrub does cleanse, it won&#x27;t take off mascara and is a bit too rough on the delicate eye area.  </li>
            <li> I wasted $38 dollars on it, I would like a refund.</li>
            <li> For some reason after a few weeks it started to turn gunky and all the exfoliating beads seemed to have all melted.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin you cannot go wrong with this exfoliator in my opinion.</li>
            <li> If you try to squeeze too hard, it \\&quot;pops\\&quot; the dried up seal and a bunch comes out.</li>
            <li> I usually end up unscrewing the lid and trying to get some out that</li>
            <li> do use this once a day, usually before I go to bed...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m disappointed to say it works no better than much cheaper drugstore brands like Neutrogena or Olay.</li>
            <li> I have horrible sensitive skin--and old</li>
            <li> I am over 55 and my face was looking a bit dull</li>
            <li> Not totally thrilled with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in my late 50s and tried everything else before.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it around the delicate eye area though.</li>
            <li> it sucks philosophy  </li>
            <li> I ordered a couple of in the past already!</li>
            <li> Love the product, but unfortunately it was shipped to me in terrible condition.  </li>
            <li> seriously ive tried everything</li>
            <li> use to exfoliate especially dried areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seems to me it&#x27;s rather expensive for what you get and for what you are doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells weird too.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong!  </li>
            <li> - for the bad part.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had some seriously bad skin years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very annoying.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this face wash, it&#x27;s the best one I have found. I am a guy, and have sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve never really been in to washing my face, but mainly because I have never found a decent wash that didn&#x27;t dry out my skin ASAP. I go to the beauty isle at my local grocery store and am overwhelmed. So a couple years ago, I came on amazon to see if I could find a face wash that was recommended. And I found this one. It feels great, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now - for the bad part. The lid on this container gets easily clogged up. It&#x27;s very annoying. It&#x27;s just your standard pop-up lid, but it gets jammed up with dried out face wash. It gets to the point where you can&#x27;t squeeze any out. If you try to squeeze too hard, it \\&quot;pops\\&quot; the dried up seal and a bunch comes out. I usually end up unscrewing the lid and trying to get some out that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish this company would fix the lid - would be a 5 star product!</li>
            <li> Execellent as always. I ordered a couple of in the past already!</li>
            <li> I love it!  My skin has cleared up and is smooth from the tiny exfoliates.</li>
            <li> Too harsh and this size bottle would last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I have been using Philosophy Microdelivery Face Wash for about a month, it is the best exfoliator that I have used. It&#x27;s gentle on the face/neck and leaves your skin feeling clean and soft. I alternate this with Purity, am hooked on both products.</li>
            <li> Product is okay.  Not totally thrilled with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to me it&#x27;s rather expensive for what you get and for what you are doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll finish the bottle....will i buy again?  Nope, don&#x27;t think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 3, 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I buy it again?  You betcha and won&#x27;t buy any other competing product because it works worders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have, for over 20 years, had these tiny cists underneath my eyes.  Drs. have told me various things about them:  too much fat in the diet, not drinking enough water, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well about a month ago I started to use this bottle of philosophy microderm exfoliating wash every single day.  I had not previously been impressed with the purchase, but thought I should finish the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyday, morning and night I washed my face with it, scrubbing gently with my fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it&#x27;s been a month and gradually I have seen my skin change:  smaller, much smaller pores and the tiny cists under my eyes are gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is absolutely, totally the best,  Gentle enough to use every day and powerful enough to get results!!!!</li>
            <li> LUV LUV LUV THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be without this product. Not harsh but does a wonderful job. Worth every penny. Remember to shake a couple times B4 using.</li>
            <li> I use nothing else to wash my face. I wash with this product at night before applying my night product and in the morning I use Purity Made Simple. When I first used these products I knew immediately that I had smelled them at a spa. I swear by these washes and I&#x27;m in my late 50s and tried everything else before. When my face was closely examined before a microdermabrasion at the spa, I was told I have very clean skin.</li>
            <li> Your skin becomes noticeably smoother and softer after use. Clears up your skin with in the first week or two of use. Would highly recommend alone with the purity cleanser.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing daily face wash.  It exfoliates the skin without drying it.  It leaves the skin feeling soft and clean.  It is one face that I may not be able to give up on although it is pricey.</li>
            <li> I use this product in the evening in the shower.  It polishes my skin without scrubbing too hard and cleanses at the same time.  Although this scrub does cleanse, it won&#x27;t take off mascara and is a bit too rough on the delicate eye area.  Some people may prefer to use it as their AM cleanser.  Although the price seems high, it only takes a quarter-sized dollop to do my face, neck, chest, and shoulders; it&#x27;s a good value because it goes a LONG way.  MDW does have a fragrance, which isn&#x27;t exactly pleasant or unpleasant, but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger on the skin.</li>
            <li> Great stuff; it works better than other well known name brands.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff</li>
            <li> Based on very positive reviews I finally decided to try Philosophy Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash.  After using it just once I was unimpressed but I continued to use it daily and I&#x27;m disappointed to say it works no better than much cheaper drugstore brands like Neutrogena or Olay. I&#x27;ll finish the bottle but won&#x27;t be ordering it again. I&#x27;m subtracting one star simply because of the price.</li>
            <li> The microdelivery exfoliating face wash worked well for about 1 week. Now it seems all of the nice little exfoliating beads that worked so well to smooth out my skin are gone! I have tried to shake the bottle but all that is there is a nearly full bottle of smooth product that does just an OK job of cleansing. It no longer exfoliates or smoothes which is what is was suppost to do</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite addition to my skin cleansing ritual!</li>
            <li> This product made me breakout, its not for people with acne problems. Every time I used it made me breakout or a blemish would appear.  I wasted $38 dollars on it, I would like a refund. Buy lush face products they work better on your skin.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic! use to exfoliate especially dried areas. Use to exfoliate every morning? Does not damage imagined, but please to&amp;ntilde;uipnoby il&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Aresxcvvbvvtvttty</li>
            <li> I bought this for post-pregnancy dry skin and it worked wonders.  It does a great job of clearing up dry skin while moisturizing.  I also use Hope in a Jar afterward.</li>
            <li> I have been using this wash for almost two years. It exfoliates yet still leaves your skin moist and soft. I enjojy it so much I have given it as a gift!</li>
            <li> The beads were dissolved and the item did not have any exfoliating properties..</li>
            <li> always great  i am a 6 year devotee</li>
            <li> I could not live without this face wash. It&#x27;s amazing. I use it daily and follow it with hope in a jar moisturizer for incredibly smooth skin. Love love love it!</li>
            <li> Good product.  LIght exfoliating.  Good for using a couple times a week. I prefer a heavier exfoliation but I would recommend this product anyway.  Philosophy makes great product and the cost is really great.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash! way cheaper on Amazon than at Macy&#x27;s where I traditionally purchased it from . It makes my face brighter and youthful, I do not recommend this as a everyday wash, although you can but scrubbing to much can be damaging,...perfect for make up removal! Shake very well when using...I am African american and I swear by this! non drying and I recommend also using the moisturizer lotion as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 15 years old and I had acne breakouts on my cheeks, chin, and forehead. This product is sensitive enough for daily use which really helps with my sensitive dry skin. Within a week of using this my breakouts stopped and my skin tone evened out. This product takes off makeup like a charm as well. Only problem with this is the smell. Imagine a left out papaya, some lemons and few bananas and that&#x27;s what it smells like. Once you get past the spoiled fruit smell it is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite exfoliator, and I have tried a lot of them.  I use it after my regular cleanser and before toner, once a day at night.  This thing is packed with microbeads and they exfoliate beautifully.  Gentle enough to not irritate the skin with regular exfoliation, but it also does a thorough job of exfoliation.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out either.</li>
            <li> Very runny and exfoliating &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; dissolve as you rub them in  I looked up &amp;#34;best exfoliating for face&amp;#34; and this is one of the top products.  I don&#x27;t agree.  Smells weird too.  Will finish bottle but not buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was recommended in the local news for sensitive skin.  I have horrible sensitive skin--and old so it all seemed to be right.  And it is pretty right.  My problem is what others probably know how to avoid.  The little corrosive things tend to get in my eyes even if I don&#x27;t run the wash near my eyes.  I don&#x27;t know how they do, but for example.....never can I put it on my forehead and wash it off or I am washing my eyes out for days.  So it seems like that isn&#x27;t a good thing.  As long as I keep it low, like right around my cheek bones, it seems ok and I wash with it about 3-4 times a week.  I have very sensitive skin in my old age (65) and need to use my Vani-cream etc. products afterwards.  But I think it is important to watch your eyes or you will be in misery.</li>
            <li> love this face wash. it works great, and even removes my make-up.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle. I love this facial cleanser: very fine  granules give me the feeling of clean without any irritation to my skin. I tried a different, highly regarded cleanser, but came back to Philosophy, as I far prefer it. Will be sticking with it for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but unfortunately it was shipped to me in terrible condition.  The container was dented and the package looked as if it were dragged through the dirt.  Sorry.</li>
            <li> Just like all of the other Philosophy products that I have tried this is great!</li>
            <li> I love this face wash! For someone who is prone to acne it is a great purchase because there is no color, no dye, no moisturizers, nothing except a super gentle scrub that sloughs off dry skin and leaves skin feeling soft, smooth, and fresh.  Also, the 60oz. bottle lasts about 6-7 months and that&#x27;s using 1-2 pumps every single night so while the cost seems large, the product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This item was pretty awesome. Me and my GF shared it. It exfoliated the skin gently and i left the bathroom feeling like a baby&#x27;s butt! For some reason after a few weeks it started to turn gunky and all the exfoliating beads seemed to have all melted. Basically had to throw away over half the bottle since it lost it&#x27;s exfoliating powers. It was wonderful while it lasted</li>
            <li> I am very careful with what I put on my skin. I don&#x27;t think I have used soap, (even the most gentle), on my face since I was 30. I have always used gentle facial cleansers, especially those recommended by my dermatologist.  A friend told me she has been using Philosophy Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash for quite some time and she finds the results to be excellent. So, I tried it and have used it daily ever since. The difference between Philosophy and other facial cleansers, is that this is an exfoliating wash. It cleans the skin and also sloughs off old skin cells. Most importantly, it is not too rough on my delicate aging skin. So...good-bye dry flaky skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this to my slightly damp face and massage for about 30 seconds...always massage upward. And make sure you rinse thoroughly. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you use this wash, or another, or soap, always be careful to rinse all residue off before patting dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use this once a day, usually before I go to bed...and then I moisturize. I wouldn&#x27;t use it around the delicate eye area though. And if you have a gentle make-up remover, I would use it before applying a dollop of  Philosophy Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was designed to effectively cleanse the skin while providing resurfacing benefits. This formula is sulfate-free and formulated with ingredients designed to replenish and protect the skin with topical antioxidants as it helps condition the skin and retain its moisture level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are: water (aqua), decyl glucoside, sodium cocoyl apple amino acids, diatomaceous earth, acrylates&amp;#8260;steareth-20 methacrylate crosspolymer, glycerin, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, borago officinalis seed oil, phytosterols, tocopherol, tocotrienols, oryza sativa (rice) bran wax, panthenol, sodium magnesium silicate, tetrasodium edta, sodium hydroxide, citric acid, methylchloroisothiazolinone, methylisothiazolinone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;JANAtypes.&lt;br /&gt;JANA</li>
            <li> I ahve been using this scrub for years and love that the grains are very fine and feel like they are really getting my skin clean.</li>
            <li> Meh, me thinks not. I am in love with Philosophy brand, as they tend to treat my extremely dry and sensitive skin quite well. Whether it&#x27;s the purity made simple, when hope is not enough, or otherwise, I generally love this line. Well, I went to have a trial makeup session for my wedding done, and the lady suggested I start exfoliating even though I have sensitive skin. I went straight to Philosophy. Well, I&#x27;ve used this stuff about 20x now. The results are always the same. It doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve done anything to my skin, other than it feels slightly smoother for the next five minutes. Then, it promptly goes back to being dry and sensitive. Furthermore, if I use this daily as it&#x27;s supposedly \\&quot;gentle enough for daily use,\\&quot; my skin is completely dried out and irritated. Oh, and it burns if you accidentally get it in your eyes, which I haven&#x27;t had happen with other philosophy products before. Not that I&#x27;m splashing it around in my eyes, it just lets me know there are some harsh/not sensitive skin friendly ingredients in here.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t have enough of the micro abrasion stuff in the bottle to do anything for my face. I received packages for trail sometime ago. And I though these wonderful. Really scrub my face and you could feel the difference. Thought this was going to be the same. My Mistake. It&#x27;s way to mild. Like washing with soapy mixture. No scrub.</li>
            <li> I love to exfoliate to keep my skin to keep it young and glowing. I love so many of philosophy&#x27;s products. Also the purity facial wash just melts off make up and is a gentle complement to use along with the exfoliating wash.</li>
            <li> For me this product is a must-have.  Usually order it directly from Philosphy but found the quick delivery and economical price on Amazon too good to pass up.  Some prefer the purity cleanser and I sometimes use it but for aging skin I like a good exfoliator.  This is it.  It is mild but effective.  Matter of fact I use this with my Clarisonic and have no irritation.  For me this 16 ounce bottle should last a year if used twice daily.  There is not perfume smell nor chemical smell to this product--just clean smelling.  Your face will love it!</li>
            <li> I love Philosophy&#x27;s cleansing line.  This product is great for minor exfoliation each morning.  I like to use it with their Purity cleanser.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This is a really great product to use on your face.  I love that it has a light exfoliation to give you a deep clean feeling.  I especially love it in the summer when my face is sometimes sunburned.  The exfoliants are that gentle.</li>
            <li> I searched all over the internet for a product that was reasonably priced and effective.  Within the first time of using this product, I had a soft pink glow.  My bumpy skin was converted into smoothness.  So far so good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Philosophy - it&#x27;s always GREAT.  Love all their products - you can&#x27;t go wrong!  Thanks for carrying this!  :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t start using this product with the expectation of it being a miracle product, but it turned out to be one for me.  I mostly needed something that would help exfoliate my sensitive, acne-prone skin, because the washcloth scrubbing wasn&#x27;t cutting it.  I had a lot of clogged pores on my forehead and chin from dead skin cells that weren&#x27;t being sloughed off well enough, I decided to try this cleanser out and loved it, especially in the shower.  I find that it&#x27;s very mild, but gets the job done.  Just massage it into a damp face for about 60 seconds and then rinse it off.  There&#x27;s no residue and my skin is never irritated.&lt;br /&gt;For moisturization in this very cold, dry winter weather, I use Philosophy&#x27;s Back to Nourishment moisturizer, which I also love.  These two products in combination have made my skin the best it&#x27;s ever been in my life and I&#x27;ve had some seriously bad skin years.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping! Will order again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Philosophy Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash, 16 Ounces  Is GREAT! After one use I noticed a huge difference all over my body. There was no need to use body lotion after showering  and I have dry skin. Trust me on this one. Yummy and no harsh chemical smell.</li>
            <li> After a daily sweaty workout, I love the clean this does to my face. And a 16oz bottle lasts almost 5 months! Leaves me with a fresh face every time, recommended by my skin care professional.</li>
            <li> The best!!!  I have been using this for many years.  Have tried others in between, but keep going back to it because it&#x27;s the best of its kind.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that makes my face clear and soft.</li>
            <li> Great product - feels like a facial every time I take a shower.  I highly recommend this face wash to others</li>
            <li> All the &#x27;exfoliating beads&#x27; disappeared within a matter of days. Just left with a gooey, watery mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will never purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 8 years. I am 50 now and have large pores that get clogged with every other cleanser and makeup I&#x27;ve used. This product is the only cleanser/scrub that has kept my skin clear. i stopped using it for about 6 months because every time I&#x27;d go to Sephora they were out. So when I started using it again- i did break out but I think it was just bringing up everything to the surface. My skin is starting to clear up very well.</li>
            <li> Another great product from Philosophy, and like all Philosophy skin care you only need the SMALLEST amount! So this will last you forever. There is no other exfoliant out there quite like this one... feel so good on the skin, even my skin that is so very sensitive with rosacea.</li>
            <li> I had somehow worked this out of my regular daily regimen. I&#x27;m going through a very stressful time with a child in the hospital for over six months, and my face/skin shows it. I was looking for something to brighten my skin, and it was suggested to try exfoliation. I recalled using this in the past, but wow has it made a huge difference. My skin is so soft, and the dull/dry look has disappeared. Plus - in the middle of all of my current stress, it&#x27;s nice to have something that adds a bit of luxury to my day! Absolutely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for one year and it has done wonders for my face!!!! It&#x27;s better and much less than my dermatologist!!!! I am in so much love with this line of products!!!!</li>
            <li> My all time favorite fash wash.  It cleans and exfoliates and does it gently.  I love how my skin feels when I ues this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I use it every day with my shower.  My face really does feel clean and smooth after.  Does not leave my face dry.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Philosophy Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash from a television shopping channel in the 32 oz. version.  This exfoliating wash is awesome.  I have sensitive skin so I have to be careful what I use.  This product is gentle yet scrubs very nicely.  There are little exfoliating beads in it that scrub just enough to take off that layer of dead skin.  This exfoliator is so gentle that it can be used daily.  I like to use  Philosophy&#x27;s Purity Made Simple facial wash at night to remove makeup and use this product in the mornings.  To apply you just get a little on your fingers and scrub lightly in circular motions on your face for up to thirty-seconds or so.  If you have sensitive skin you cannot go wrong with this exfoliator in my opinion.</li>
            <li> screw proactive it sucks philosophy  is def the best out there. my mom said try this and wham it took my acne away almost immediatly.the next morning i seen a tremendous improvment l.bi could never afford proactive and i had to use so much of it working with oil gas and chemicals everyday but since i used this amazing product i dont care that its costing me about 40 a hit every time cuz it really works on my skin.id like to slap proactive docs in the face for sellng garbage and congeadulate philosphy for there product nothings ever worked seriously ive tried everything and then i tried evrything again and again even started to mixing diff face stuff together brands and types and still nothing till this exfoilating wash....... THANK U SO MUCH PHILOSPHY I SERIOUSLY FEEL BETTER ABOUT MYSELF!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love Philosophy products. This exfoliating wash is excellent for anyone with large pores, oily skin and combination skin. I use this with my portable Clarasonic machine. I highly recommend this product for male or female.  The fragrance is nice and it really does work. I like knowing that my pores are clean.  I have been using this product for years. Happy customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year, and it is wonderful. For older people who still have breakouts, it does a great job of preparing skin to better absorb acne products. It also makes make-up smooth on better. I use it daily, and it has definitely improved my skin - both the skin tone and clarity. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Got a sample of this which worked wonders for me.  I am over 55 and my face was looking a bit dull so I tried the sample.  Ran out so I purchased the 16 oz (which I thought was a bit much).  Great product but a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> very good product for the face.</li>
            <li> It really works for me.  I don&#x27;t use a lot of Philosophy, but this is very good product.  Really clens your face.</li>
            <li> Love this,has been using it for years and could never be without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several products from philosophy and liked them so decided to try this.  I like this although I&#x27;ve used other products that were more of an exfoliant.  This is gentle, made for daily use.  It has a pleasant scent.  I&#x27;ll probably reorder.</li>
            <li> This worked well and has the little pieces in it for exfoliating.  Nothing outstanding.</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews and found them helpful.  Yes, the top does clog a bit but it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using,  my face feels clean but not dry.  I bought the 16 oz bottle and it will last me a LONG, LONG time!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son. He loves it. I bought some for myself and I agree that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Great Product, shipped fast!</li>
