            <li> This product is very small, i can bring it in my bag When I&#x27;m on vacation, can easily dry my nail polish. One for each hand! I love how I can either have them battery opporated or I can use a 3 Volt adaptor to plug in and power these babies.&lt;br /&gt;I will ordered a new one as a gift for my teen daughter.

            <li> The fan did not work for me. You have to press it really hard in order for the fan to operate yet it was running really slow. I would rather use a hair dryer to dry up my nail polish. I had to return the product.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Will order from this Seller again.</li>
            <li> This dryer may be small but it does a good job. You can walk around drying your nails. You can go to the kitchen make a cup of cafe bustelo grab some grapes or a pear. I will tell you this pick one up its worth every dollar you pay.</li>

And I am so glade I did it was more then great ! Better then I expected ! The fan was pretty strong and it dry nails in a reasonable time . The only thing I wish is that it came with the 3V DC Adaptor but other then that a cute good nail dryer for a good price .</li>
