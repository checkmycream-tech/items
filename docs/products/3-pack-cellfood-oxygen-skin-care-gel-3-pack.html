            <li>Safe to use on your skin, not toxic like most creams out there.</li>
            <li>I am healing myself of some kind of gastric tumors  I needed to create a toxic free body and face care that could  deliver oxygen to my skin.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell you how many comments I receive from friends and asking &amp;#34;what</li>
            <li>The gel firms up the skin and makes me look more youthful.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is more even, the redness is gone and my skin is more luminous, and fine lines are diminished.  </li>
            <li>I have had very good results and apply it daily then apply moisturizer and make up .</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with delivery, it came quickly.</li>
            <li>This product might be somewhat more helpful than pure aloe gel, but it my take longer use to determine whether or not it is better.</li>
            <li>I used this product for quite a while; it is a great product for my facial regimen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and leaves my skin feeling clean rather than like i put something on it.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, does not bother my eyes and really really works!  </li>
            <li>I have the most sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve tried almost everything out there</li>
            <li>I soaks right and and moisturizes very well!!  </li>
            <li>I have definitely experienced a progressive firming and pore-restoration to a smaller size (a few more pores that were enlarged).</li>
            <li>my husband has sun damaged skin and cell food skin care has been very calming to his face and mine.  </li>
            <li>Really soothing, too.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and I can tell you that It has really improved the condition and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using Cellfood gel for 8 years and really like it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many natural &amp; synthetic products (including 2 very expensive high-end lines, in the multiple $100&#x27;s for a kit) over the years, for antiaging, and this product works best for me.</li>
            <li>It is a HIGH PERFORMANCE product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Keep my skin smooth, tight, and clean!!!&lt;br /&gt;Would recomment to anyone who is very self concious for their skin!</li>
            <li>This product is more like an aloe gel, not a smooth lotion.  </li>
            <li>I use it with new tattoos too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really gentle on my sensitive skin &amp; has made a difference in my adult acne.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin completely.</li>
            <li>There is no oily  or heavy feel to it - rather it is light as air.  </li>
            <li>The product seems to be natural and causes no irritation.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Been using this for my night-time routine for several years. I prefer using it during night time than daytime as it doesn&#x27;t go well with sunblock and makeup. Affordable and keeps your skin moisturised.</li>
            <li> Great product, works!&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
            <li> I have the most sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve tried almost everything out there (I&#x27;m a product whore :)!) and everything makes me break out in a rash. This stuff is awesome and heals burns and cuts overnight, i love it!!</li>
            <li> Cheaper than the price I paid at Wholefoods.  Good product.</li>
            <li> This product might be somewhat more helpful than pure aloe gel, but it my take longer use to determine whether or not it is better.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, does not bother my eyes and really really works!  Safe to use on your skin, not toxic like most creams out there.</li>
            <li> This product is more like an aloe gel, not a smooth lotion.  I soaks right and and moisturizes very well!!  Removes the wrinkles and at a great price!  I use at night and in the morning my skin looks great!  I love this!!  I also use the cellfood product drops as well.  I have tried a lot of supplements and could never see any difference, except these products.  I love them and they don&#x27;t break the bank!!</li>
            <li> Keep my skin smooth, tight, and clean!!!&lt;br /&gt;Would recomment to anyone who is very self concious for their skin! Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with delivery, it came quickly. It is a HIGH PERFORMANCE product. I am healing myself of some kind of gastric tumors  I needed to create a toxic free body and face care that could  deliver oxygen to my skin. I incorporate the gel with therapeutic essential oils, and argan oil for my face. I create body care with the gel, shea butter, essential oils  ( therapeutic grade) and other ingredients for my body. It has been a beautiful experience.</li>
            <li> Cell food skin care works beautifully,  my husband has sun damaged skin and cell food skin care has been very calming to his face and mine.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> This product is so wonderful! I see immediate results for wrinkles, tightening pores, smoothing skin on my face (&amp; neck)&lt;br /&gt;overall. It&#x27;s really gentle on my sensitive skin &amp; has made a difference in my adult acne. Really soothing, too. I love it!</li>
            <li> I only order from thebalanceoflife.net I trust thier reviews and articles . I have a lot of puffiness, brown spots , loss of collagen due to life and aging . I applied this at bed time and did a am double take I could see firmness in chin ,cheeks and neck area. I have had very good results and apply it daily then apply moisturizer and make up .</li>
            <li> This wonderful product also enhances skin products already in use..  It absorbs into the skin completely. There is no oily  or heavy feel to it - rather it is light as air.  It is excellent for all skin types</li>
            <li> Excellent service and product. Thanks</li>
            <li> Love it! It has transformed my skin. I bought several as Christmas gifts for my girlfriends and mom. Highly recommend. I started noticing great results in about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> My skin definitely feels and looks different when I do not apply cell-food every morning. Can&#x27;t tell you how many comments I receive from friends and asking &amp;#34;what do you use on your skin&amp;#34;? It looks amazing!</li>
            <li> I have definitely experienced a progressive firming and pore-restoration to a smaller size (a few more pores that were enlarged).</li>
            <li> I have been using Cellfood Oxygen Gel for about 1 year now and I can tell you that It has really improved the condition and texture of my skin. A lot of people tell me that I have beautiful skin and I know that it is because of the gel and also the vitamins and supplements that I take every day. The gel firms up the skin and makes me look more youthful.</li>
            <li> I bought the 3 pack - great value - and gave one to my friend because this stuff works!!  She loves it also. Use it like a serum and put your creme over it.  Amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone. It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve used where I can actually see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using Cellfood gel for 8 years and really like it.  It is great for healing all kinds of skin problems.  I use it with new tattoos too.  Usually I apply it with damp or wet fingers to make it spread a bit thinner, and last longer, but for problem areas I use it undiluted.  Some skin creams burn my eyes if it gets in them by accident.  This does not happen with Cellfood.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many natural &amp; synthetic products (including 2 very expensive high-end lines, in the multiple $100&#x27;s for a kit) over the years, for antiaging, and this product works best for me. I&#x27;ve even had several coworkers &amp; friends ask what I&#x27;m using b/c my skin has a nice healthy glow to it now. Even my nutritionist asked me what I&#x27;ve been doing and she ordered some and reported back that she too loves it! The product seems to be natural and causes no irritation. My son uses it successfully for acne control too. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> smooths face and reduces wrinkles, I have recommended this item to friends and relatives.  Will continue to use it and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I used this product for quite a while; it is a great product for my facial regimen. I commend everyone to try it. I only use it in the evening because I have another product that I use during the day. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about four months ago and it has done wonders for my skin.  I had a lot of sun damage from years in the sun, redness, uneven skin tone and sunspots.  My skin tone is more even, the redness is gone and my skin is more luminous, and fine lines are diminished.  Sunspots are gone with the aid of sunspot es also found on amazon (use together).  In short I look decades younger for pennies,</li>
            <li> I SWEAR by this product. It&#x27;s light and leaves my skin feeling clean rather than like i put something on it.</li>
