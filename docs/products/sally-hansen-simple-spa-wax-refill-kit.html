            <li>I&#x27;m happy I did as I love it!  </li>
            <li>came as advertised - good price</li>
            <li>But the price is good for the product, so I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this more times than I can count and have always been happy with my results.</li>
            <li>I have no even used it yet because I bought more at CVS because it didn&#x27;t appear to be in great condition.</li>
            <li>i love the smell of caramel!</li>

            <li>Love this waxer!</li>
            <li>I just love this wax!</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen wax kit takes forever to warm the wax.</li>
            <li>Having used this system for over a year I can honestly say it has started thinning out my unwanted hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i would recommend this product to people out there who want to start waxing at the comfort of your own home</li>
            <li>By far best product I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>But once it reaches the right temp, it&#x27;s a great product to work with.</li>
            <li>It is a great wax that does the job and does it right.</li>
            <li>Peels off easy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most convient one I&#x27;ve found and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to go over any area twice or use tweezers because this great wax got it all the first try.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and stores easily.</li>
            <li>The instructions say that you can use it without strips, but for me - the strips worked better.</li>
            <li>Use this on my underarms, bikini area and upper lip and it works great!</li>
            <li>I love this strip free/peel off wax.</li>
            <li>This stuff takes some skill to use but its definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to see this in stock again.  </li>
            <li>I love the Sally Hansen Strip-free Wax.</li>
            <li>what I do instead is turn on the stove to the lowest heat, put a pan on top, and then put the refills in the pan.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>have been to many drug stores and Target and Walmart and seems like it everyone quit carrying it.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find this at my local store and was very happy to find more on amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this system.</li>
            <li>WAY better than honey</li>
            <li>like what most reviewers say here, it does take forever to melt the wax.</li>
            <li>and I was pleased to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it on here</li>
            <li>I love this wax and have been using it for awhile now.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>Perfect refill kit, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It should be easy to stir/scoop the wax when you use it - if not, let it heat more.  </li>
            <li>works great especial for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After many hours browsing on the web looking for a solution to get smooth armpits, I decided to try waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use (even for a beginner).</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t pull off easily at all, and some of it doesn&#x27;t come off.  </li>
            <li>It cools very quick so err on the side of too hot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use on myself</li>
            <li>Have tried many different waxing products and this really is great.</li>
            <li>Best of all, I don&#x27;t need to mess with cloth strips.      </li>
            <li>easy to use, easy to clean up.  </li>
            <li>Lay the strip on the wax, smooth it out (just like the salon)</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I moved to KS and could not located a place that I was comfortable with price, environment or staff</li>
            <li>So I am happy and hoping that eventually I can stop waxing overall using this method.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but then I checked on amazon and it works great same as I used to use from Walmart, so</li>
            <li>I primarily do underarm and bikini line.</li>
            <li>Hope this helped and enjoy smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried shaving, but I got stubbles, which really wasn&#x27;t the kind of look that I was trying to get, either.</li>
            <li>So excited to see I could get it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is the easiest and most effective method I have found to remove unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to put on and comes off well if you do it right.</li>
            <li>When a tub is full it can take forever to heat up (and I remove the rubber ring to make it go faster).</li>
            <li>Everybody seems to have good experience with GiGi, but I was turned off by the price (especially since I wasn&#x27;t sure it waxing would really solve my armpit problem), and also the size of the product.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you have the right warmer kit and do not close the wax refill when it&#x27;s hot cause</li>
            <li>Waxing really gives me the smooth armpits I&#x27;m looking for, and it is really easy to do.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and becomes very brittle, so you definitely want to pull while its still on the goopy side and it clumps up in your fingers and sticks to hair great.</li>
            <li>It hardens relatively quickly after applying, so it makes the process faster.</li>
            <li>Its a refill kit so not much to say besides its cost effective and comes with what you need, works well!</li>
            <li>my first time using this product and it works greats!</li>
            <li>The only part that I would change about it is that it doesn&#x27;t have a warm setting.</li>
            <li>I use a candle warmer and get it completely liquid, then shut the warmer off and stir until the wax is more gummy.</li>
            <li>the instructions say warm for 20 minutes; i find that it is double that.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, the more and more you use your product the faster it heats up due to the amt in the can</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need any of those fancy wax removers to get it off my fingers or skin as it peels right off</li>
            <li>Granted i have been going to the spa for waxing for a long time, so i had absorbed techniques of using the wax, but the results were amazing.  </li>
            <li>so I was so so happy to find it on here and for a little cheaper!</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use (you need the Sally Hansen Simple Spa wax warmer).  </li>
            <li>The more I use it the less hair I have-I use it for my face and bikini area mostly.</li>
            <li>I find one of the containers lasts me a good 6 months or so with doing my waxing every month to month and a half.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easier than it sounds, not as time consuming, melts the wax well and quickly.</li>
            <li>love it, works great, but it really does dry up really quick and hard to use wax strips so you need to apply and quickly use the strip</li>
            <li>Besides some lovely mood swings, it also darkens the hair on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product recently jumped from $8 or so but i still get it because i dont have a better price/ value replacement.</li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t be able to open it!</li>
            <li>You could definitely find better.</li>
            <li>Once the wax has hardened it will come off of most surfaces by simply yanking it</li>
            <li>Since it came in a metal tin, I just placed the tin on top of my flat-surface electric stove at home, with the heat set at low temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just found a similar product to use, that I love just as much</li>
            <li>It allows me to have a fresh wax whenever I want to without paying high prices and going out to let someone else do it.</li>
            <li>The wax is easily applied and remove, seldom requiring a second application.</li>
            <li>The only was someone is going to notice the hair is by starring at my armpits up close and in person lol, and lastly I have seen that a lot of hair HAS NOT EVEN GROWN BACK, and actually led my armpit to be very bald looking :)</li>
            <li>If it pulls away without strings, it&#x27;s ready.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>The Sally Hansen Simple Spa Wax Refill Kit is a product  I use because it is economical and is more efficient than similar products I have used.</li>
            <li>It heats up well and fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very affordable (each refill kit comes with two pots of wax, making each pot cost around 7.50 or 8 dollars).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the heat in the microwave kits and some of those work well but can get really sticky.  </li>
            <li>Works very well pulling out stubborn</li>
            <li>Would recommend this to anyone who wants to save money by jot going to salon</li>
            <li>I use it for my whole body.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I had never waxed before, I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much money buying something that wouldn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>It really works &amp; saves lots of $</li>
            <li>But I really like this wax and the wax warmer thing in which it is supposed to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come with strips and you don&#x27;t need them, although you can always make them if you really want.</li>
            <li>I have gone walking around in a tank without waxing for two weeks because im busy, timing isnt right, school, motherhood</li>
            <li>The older I get, the more I&#x27;ve become conscious about how my armpits look, especially in the summer time when I feel like wearing sleeveless tops.</li>
            <li>I originally bought the kit at my local supermarket on clearance and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Inexpensive compared to most other solutions.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s on or it&#x27;s off so either it will continue to get hotter, burning you, or you turn it off and hope to go fast enough that it doesn&#x27;t cool too much to not be used.</li>
            <li>I just think that the little warming pot is the MOST simple and easy way to use this wax.</li>
            <li>When the tub gets smaller and after the wax has been heated once (even if it&#x27;s nearly full still), it heats up much faster.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using itfor over a year now and because I am so satisfied I am not really looking for a new solution any time soon.  </li>
            <li>Actually over time I&#x27;ve learned exactly when is the right time</li>
            <li>It gets very messy if you are doing large areas but absolutely perfect for small areas</li>
            <li>most people, I had such frustrating getting this to warm up, so</li>
            <li>It is not painful at all, either (but maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to plucking, which kinda works the same way)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered this product from this seller and it came quickly- better then other sellers where they make you wait a week!</li>
            <li>This is a hard wax and only great for that area.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is your classic heated wax.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Sally Hansen spa removal wax.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like many of the other products do, and it actually works well (which many other products don&#x27;t).</li>
            <li>It quickly melts it, but just be careful because it does get much hotter than the heater</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen many negative reviews on it, but the thing is you have to follow instructions careful and pull it off at the right time to get the right results.</li>
            <li>Truth be told, I have my significant other using this wax to wax my armpits</li>
            <li>It is much easier to do detail work, such as eyebrows, that way.</li>
            <li>Also, my skin is sensitive, and this never bothers me.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gone and had body hair waxed professionally.  </li>
            <li>thanks to amazon and definitely will recommend this to customers.</li>
            <li>(hint: don&#x27;t wait for the wax to harden completely).</li>
            <li>and I find it nearly painless and</li>
            <li>I have tried quite a few different hair removal products at home and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Comes with quite a few wooden sticks, more than</li>
            <li>put the metal container on my electronic stove, and I let it cool down completely till it has medium consistency otherwise it drips.</li>
            <li>By forever I mean an hour or more.  </li>
            <li>As long as the container is pushed in to the heater all the way, it will heat up in reasonable time.</li>
            <li>The description above states that this is a new product with 2 wax refills in it.  </li>
            <li>Down side is, it takes forever to heat the wax especially if it&#x27;s a new tin.</li>
            <li>When I opened my wax there were many broken pieces inside.  </li>
            <li>I started buying this wax after my old stand-by became super hard to find.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave sticky gunk behind on my skin.</li>

            <li> Hope this helped and enjoy smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried shaving, but I got stubbles, which really wasn&#x27;t the kind of look that I was trying to get, either.</li>
            <li> So excited to see I could get it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the easiest and most effective method I have found to remove unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to put on and comes off well if you do it right.</li>
            <li> When a tub is full it can take forever to heat up (and I remove the rubber ring to make it go faster).</li>
            <li> Everybody seems to have good experience with GiGi, but I was turned off by the price (especially since I wasn&#x27;t sure it waxing would really solve my armpit problem), and also the size of the product.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you have the right warmer kit and do not close the wax refill when it&#x27;s hot cause</li>
            <li> Waxing really gives me the smooth armpits I&#x27;m looking for, and it is really easy to do.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and becomes very brittle, so you definitely want to pull while its still on the goopy side and it clumps up in your fingers and sticks to hair great.</li>
            <li> It hardens relatively quickly after applying, so it makes the process faster.</li>
            <li> Its a refill kit so not much to say besides its cost effective and comes with what you need, works well!</li>
            <li> my first time using this product and it works greats!</li>
            <li> The only part that I would change about it is that it doesn&#x27;t have a warm setting.</li>
            <li> I use a candle warmer and get it completely liquid, then shut the warmer off and stir until the wax is more gummy.</li>
            <li> the instructions say warm for 20 minutes; i find that it is double that.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the more and more you use your product the faster it heats up due to the amt in the can</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need any of those fancy wax removers to get it off my fingers or skin as it peels right off</li>
            <li> Granted i have been going to the spa for waxing for a long time, so i had absorbed techniques of using the wax, but the results were amazing.  </li>
            <li> so I was so so happy to find it on here and for a little cheaper!</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use (you need the Sally Hansen Simple Spa wax warmer).  </li>
            <li> The more I use it the less hair I have-I use it for my face and bikini area mostly.</li>
            <li> I find one of the containers lasts me a good 6 months or so with doing my waxing every month to month and a half.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easier than it sounds, not as time consuming, melts the wax well and quickly.</li>
            <li> love it, works great, but it really does dry up really quick and hard to use wax strips so you need to apply and quickly use the strip</li>
            <li> Besides some lovely mood swings, it also darkens the hair on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product recently jumped from $8 or so but i still get it because i dont have a better price/ value replacement.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be able to open it!</li>
            <li> You could definitely find better.</li>
            <li> Once the wax has hardened it will come off of most surfaces by simply yanking it</li>
            <li> Since it came in a metal tin, I just placed the tin on top of my flat-surface electric stove at home, with the heat set at low temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just found a similar product to use, that I love just as much</li>
            <li> It allows me to have a fresh wax whenever I want to without paying high prices and going out to let someone else do it.</li>
            <li> The wax is easily applied and remove, seldom requiring a second application.</li>
            <li> The only was someone is going to notice the hair is by starring at my armpits up close and in person lol, and lastly I have seen that a lot of hair HAS NOT EVEN GROWN BACK, and actually led my armpit to be very bald looking :)</li>
            <li> If it pulls away without strings, it&#x27;s ready.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> The Sally Hansen Simple Spa Wax Refill Kit is a product  I use because it is economical and is more efficient than similar products I have used.</li>
            <li> It heats up well and fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very affordable (each refill kit comes with two pots of wax, making each pot cost around 7.50 or 8 dollars).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the heat in the microwave kits and some of those work well but can get really sticky.  </li>
            <li> Works very well pulling out stubborn</li>
            <li> Would recommend this to anyone who wants to save money by jot going to salon</li>
            <li> I use it for my whole body.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I had never waxed before, I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much money buying something that wouldn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> It really works &amp; saves lots of $</li>
            <li> But I really like this wax and the wax warmer thing in which it is supposed to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with strips and you don&#x27;t need them, although you can always make them if you really want.</li>
            <li> I have gone walking around in a tank without waxing for two weeks because im busy, timing isnt right, school, motherhood</li>
            <li> The older I get, the more I&#x27;ve become conscious about how my armpits look, especially in the summer time when I feel like wearing sleeveless tops.</li>
            <li> I originally bought the kit at my local supermarket on clearance and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Inexpensive compared to most other solutions.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on or it&#x27;s off so either it will continue to get hotter, burning you, or you turn it off and hope to go fast enough that it doesn&#x27;t cool too much to not be used.</li>
            <li> I just think that the little warming pot is the MOST simple and easy way to use this wax.</li>
            <li> When the tub gets smaller and after the wax has been heated once (even if it&#x27;s nearly full still), it heats up much faster.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using itfor over a year now and because I am so satisfied I am not really looking for a new solution any time soon.  </li>
            <li> Actually over time I&#x27;ve learned exactly when is the right time</li>
            <li> It gets very messy if you are doing large areas but absolutely perfect for small areas</li>
            <li> most people, I had such frustrating getting this to warm up, so</li>
            <li> It is not painful at all, either (but maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to plucking, which kinda works the same way)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from this seller and it came quickly- better then other sellers where they make you wait a week!</li>
            <li> This is a hard wax and only great for that area.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is your classic heated wax.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Sally Hansen spa removal wax.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like many of the other products do, and it actually works well (which many other products don&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> It quickly melts it, but just be careful because it does get much hotter than the heater</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen many negative reviews on it, but the thing is you have to follow instructions careful and pull it off at the right time to get the right results.</li>
            <li> Truth be told, I have my significant other using this wax to wax my armpits</li>
            <li> It is much easier to do detail work, such as eyebrows, that way.</li>
            <li> Also, my skin is sensitive, and this never bothers me.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gone and had body hair waxed professionally.  </li>
            <li> thanks to amazon and definitely will recommend this to customers.</li>
            <li> (hint: don&#x27;t wait for the wax to harden completely).</li>
            <li> and I find it nearly painless and</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few different hair removal products at home and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Comes with quite a few wooden sticks, more than</li>
            <li> put the metal container on my electronic stove, and I let it cool down completely till it has medium consistency otherwise it drips.</li>
            <li> By forever I mean an hour or more.  </li>
            <li> As long as the container is pushed in to the heater all the way, it will heat up in reasonable time.</li>
            <li> The description above states that this is a new product with 2 wax refills in it.  </li>
            <li> Down side is, it takes forever to heat the wax especially if it&#x27;s a new tin.</li>
            <li> When I opened my wax there were many broken pieces inside.  </li>
            <li> I started buying this wax after my old stand-by became super hard to find.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave sticky gunk behind on my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on this result, maybe my theory is right about Sally Hansen wax&#x27;s not having a low melting point since I have a completely different experience with GiGi all purpose hard wax.</li>
            <li> I really like this for small areas.  </li>
            <li> Based on my online research, all I could think about was that maybe Sally Hansen wax didn&#x27;t have a low melting point, and that was why it took so long to melt.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some of those microwave kits are not even easily washable off of skin, making leftover wax on the skin truly difficult to deal with and heaven help you if you get it on a porous surface.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some helpful advice: the black rubber ring around the tins is made to keep them from making direct contact with the heating surface.</li>
            <li> Gets hard fast but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> next week or even a few days from now because it wasn&#x27;t long enough to get plucked during the last salon</li>
            <li> It was not available early spring</li>
            <li> laser hair removal did not completely stop me from shaving for the rest of my life unlike what those commercials claim.  </li>
            <li> Once I had enough volume of melted wax, I started pouring this liquid wax into my Sally Hansen tin that was empty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It didn&#x27;t take long at all for the wax to melt!</li>
            <li> Very strange and unprofessional.</li>
            <li> Will not be buying this again and even threw out what I had after that single use.</li>
            <li> The pain doesnt last long at least for me, and I have never bled, turned red or had any reaction to using this product.</li>
            <li> So you end up scraping off little tiny pieces at a time, with a couple of hairs stuck to it, which hurts a lot!  </li>
            <li> so you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> I grew up plucking my armpit hair, which I think made my armpit skin really rough over time.</li>
            <li> I assume hard wax are painless specially for sensetive areas, not great for any where</li>
            <li> So, if taking too long to melt the was is the only complaint you have about this Sally Hansen wax warmer, perhaps you want to try what I&#x27;ve done before you decide to pitch this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried very nearly all of the Sally Hansen hair removal products, and overall I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> I usually get a package of 20 from the local Sally&#x27;s Beauty Salon for $3.</li>
            <li> It lasts a lot longer than all other methods I have tried, too.</li>
            <li> I will not use any other wax kits.</li>
            <li> Prefer this to all other waxes I have tried through my furry lifetime, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> Use a THIN layer, think sun screen on your shoulders, enough to float on the surface, but not enough to \\&quot;goop\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> i prefer this type to any other, it doesnt have the sticky hard to remove or paper necessary wax.</li>
            <li> Some of those will wash off skin really well but can be difficult on other things like carpet, fabric, or even linoleum.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s coarse and thick.</li>
            <li> I just turn it off for a little and then turn it back on before it starts getting too hard again.  </li>
            <li> Shaving gets ugly fast, plucking takes too long, and going to a salon all the time is pricey.</li>
            <li> I am so sorry that this is becoming difficult to find.</li>
            <li> I am one of those poor unfortunate women who can practically grow a full beard.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s too little, forcing you to buy tons of wax if you want to wax both legs, for example.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;do\\&quot; my cowlicks allow, then stir the wax a few times to keep it evenly heated, and start the process.</li>
            <li> I use this product every few weeks.</li>
            <li> The solution I found was to turn in on for a few moments and</li>
            <li> Hair removal is both frustrating and embarrassing, because my facial hair isn&#x27;t the wispy thin stuff that comes off with bleach, Nair, the green slime mess, strips, or other \\&quot;removal\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li> I just put the melted wax on the stick, blow it a little until I see that it&#x27;s getting a little hard again and then apply it.</li>
            <li> No more hair.</li>
            <li> If you want to conserve and use thin/ small amounts to apply each &amp;#34;strip&amp;#34; of wax, you need to have it hotter</li>
            <li> This product comes in 2 small metal container.</li>
            <li> and I used another brand (4 jars), and I was sorry the entire summer.</li>
            <li> It took me 2-3 hours to melt this small tin of wax that came with the Sally Hansen wax warmer kit.</li>
            <li> In addition, I noticed that the amount of hair GROWN BACK is very thin and not noticeable.</li>
            <li> , once I had used up all the Sally Hansen hard wax that came with the warmer kit, I decided to purchase a 14-oz GiGi</li>
            <li> all purpose hard wax.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ve discontinued this, but it&#x27;s hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> After heating up the unit (which is my biggest complaint as it takes forever to heat up)</li>
            <li> Takes at least 45 minutes to heat &amp; melt.  </li>
            <li> and my face every week, so the money did slowly add up within a month for twelve months and</li>
            <li> It never takes long at all now for me to melt this GiGi hard wax using my Sally Hansen wax warmer kit!!!</li>
            <li> i was skeptical; in the past i had tried similar products and was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with it</li>
            <li> hard to melt the wax when its to cold, but works fine,needed to re-do some parts, but it takes the hair out, wax should be hot,not burning.</li>
            <li> Not ideal though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So sad that this is no longer being made.</li>
            <li> For some reason it has been difficult to find the refills at the stores now</li>
            <li> I was always afraid of waxing that area</li>
            <li> /&gt;First I was very sad when I found out that this Sally was is discontinued in stores</li>
            <li> thats my fav wax ever too bad that they dont have it anymore</li>
            <li> have PCO (Poly-cystic Ovaries) which means that my hormones are all out of wack and have been since puberty. :(</li>
            <li> I hated going to a salon to get my hair waxed and</li>
            <li> I tried going to salons, but it was EXPENSIVE!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> By far best product I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> This kit has saved my sanity and my pocket book. LOVE it!!! Easy to use (even for a beginner). Doesn&#x27;t burn. Heats in minutes. Convenient enough for every day use. I can&#x27;t sing the praises of this kit enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have PCO (Poly-cystic Ovaries) which means that my hormones are all out of wack and have been since puberty. :( Besides some lovely mood swings, it also darkens the hair on my upper lip. Hair removal is both frustrating and embarrassing, because my facial hair isn&#x27;t the wispy thin stuff that comes off with bleach, Nair, the green slime mess, strips, or other \\&quot;removal\\&quot; products. It&#x27;s coarse and thick. I tried going to salons, but it was EXPENSIVE!!! $15-20 each visit. Your hair grows in intervals, so what you wax today won&#x27;t be the stuff growing in (needing a wax) next week or even a few days from now because it wasn&#x27;t long enough to get plucked during the last salon visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sally Hansen Spa Wax ...WORKS!!! I turn on the heater, put my hair up in rollers or whatever \\&quot;do\\&quot; my cowlicks allow, then stir the wax a few times to keep it evenly heated, and start the process. The instructions say that you can use it without strips, but for me - the strips worked better. It gave me something to hold onto when pulling the wax off. I usually get a package of 20 from the local Sally&#x27;s Beauty Salon for $3. I test the wax by dipping a wooden stick into the mixture, stir, then remove. If it pulls away without strings, it&#x27;s ready. Use a THIN layer, think sun screen on your shoulders, enough to float on the surface, but not enough to \\&quot;goop\\&quot;. Lay the strip on the wax, smooth it out (just like the salon) wait a moment, breathe in, then pull back when you exhale. To-dah! No more hair. Repeat wherever you see stray strands.</li>
            <li> I use to wax my arm pits ($22), upper lip ($10, and eyebrows ($10)  for a total of $42 in Hawaii. I would wax my armpits once every two week and my face every week, so the money did slowly add up within a month for twelve months and so forth. Nonetheless, I moved to KS and could not located a place that I was comfortable with price, environment or staff so I decided to do it myself. That is when I came across this product in Target, and never looked back. I have purchased this more times than I can count and have always been happy with my results. However, It may take FOREVER to heat up but if I KNOW that I am going to WAX than I plan ahead, meaning I Wake up and immediately turn on my product, and to distract myself I start doing things around the house and than I come back to it. AND yes it does hurt but what else do you expect your pulling multiple hair from the root out. The pain doesnt last long at least for me, and I have never bled, turned red or had any reaction to using this product. Additionally, the more and more you use your product the faster it heats up due to the amt in the can that isnt being put back when your done waxing. In addition, I noticed that the amount of hair GROWN BACK is very thin and not noticeable. I have gone walking around in a tank without waxing for two weeks because im busy, timing isnt right, school, motherhood you name it, it probably was it lol...The only was someone is going to notice the hair is by starring at my armpits up close and in person lol, and lastly I have seen that a lot of hair HAS NOT EVEN GROWN BACK, and actually led my armpit to be very bald looking :) So I am happy and hoping that eventually I can stop waxing overall using this method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use this product for my armpits, upper lip and eyebrows. Nothing else!</li>
            <li> This is the easiest and most effective method I have found to remove unwanted facial hair. It lasts a lot longer than all other methods I have tried, too. I highly recommend Sally Hansen spa removal wax.</li>
            <li> came as advertised - good price</li>
            <li> So I have been using this for over a year now. Used to get it at Wal-mart but they stopped carrying it so I was so so happy to find it on here and for a little cheaper! Use this on my underarms, bikini area and upper lip and it works great! The only part that I would change about it is that it doesn&#x27;t have a warm setting. When it&#x27;s on the wax keeps getting hotter and can burn so you have to be careful. I just turn it off for a little and then turn it back on before it starts getting too hard again.  Works great on removing unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> The box that contained the refills was open and one of the wax container lids was totally off.  Very strange and unprofessional.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find anymore for an inexpensive price. Was a great product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It is very easy to use (you need the Sally Hansen Simple Spa wax warmer).  Best of all, I don&#x27;t need to mess with cloth strips.      I find that if I use latex gloves I don&#x27;t even need an applicator.  I just dip my fingers in the warmed wax and use them.  It is much easier to do detail work, such as eyebrows, that way.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull off easily at all, and some of it doesn&#x27;t come off.  So you end up scraping off little tiny pieces at a time, with a couple of hairs stuck to it, which hurts a lot!  Will not be buying this again and even threw out what I had after that single use.</li>
            <li> I love this strip free/peel off wax. It does take a while to melt, but the results are great! I started buying this wax after my old stand-by became super hard to find.</li>
            <li> This stuff takes some skill to use but its definitely my favorite. Dries quickly and becomes very brittle, so you definitely want to pull while its still on the goopy side and it clumps up in your fingers and sticks to hair great. I use a candle warmer and get it completely liquid, then shut the warmer off and stir until the wax is more gummy. If you want to conserve and use thin/ small amounts to apply each &amp;#34;strip&amp;#34; of wax, you need to have it hotter so youll have a second to rip it off before the wax dries too brittle to remove. It cools very quick so err on the side of too hot.&lt;br /&gt;Product recently jumped from $8 or so but i still get it because i dont have a better price/ value replacement.</li>
            <li> This product comes in 2 small metal container. This is a hard wax and only great for that area. I was always afraid of waxing that area and here I go, I waxed all the bikini lines and further bymyself. I assume hard wax are painless specially for sensetive areas, not great for any where else.&lt;br /&gt;I put the metal container on my electronic stove, and I let it cool down completely till it has medium consistency otherwise it drips.</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen wax kit takes forever to warm the wax. Plus, it&#x27;s too little, forcing you to buy tons of wax if you want to wax both legs, for example. Not happy with it</li>
            <li> The Sally Hansen Simple Spa Wax Refill Kit is a product  I use because it is economical and is more efficient than similar products I have used. The wax is easily applied and remove, seldom requiring a second application.</li>
            <li> The description above states that this is a new product with 2 wax refills in it.  When I received it, it was an open box and one of the wax refills wasn&#x27;t there</li>
            <li> I love this product. I will not use any other wax kits. It gets very messy if you are doing large areas but absolutely perfect for small areas</li>
            <li> hard to melt the wax when its to cold, but works fine,needed to re-do some parts, but it takes the hair out, wax should be hot,not burning. i love the smell of caramel!</li>
            <li> This wax is the best I have ever used. It was not available early spring and I used another brand (4 jars), and I was sorry the entire summer. I&#x27;m glad to see this in stock again.  Update. Since the cost of this skyrocketed I found another brand that works like it. FORTY NINE Dollars for this???? No thanks.</li>
            <li> I love the Sally Hansen Strip-free Wax. It&#x27;s really easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave sticky gunk behind on my skin. Also, my skin is sensitive, and this never bothers me.</li>
            <li> I love this for underarm hair removal! That&#x27;s basically the only thing I use it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most people, I had such frustrating getting this to warm up, so what I do instead is turn on the stove to the lowest heat, put a pan on top, and then put the refills in the pan. It quickly melts it, but just be careful because it does get much hotter than the heater and it could hurt your skin. I just put the melted wax on the stick, blow it a little until I see that it&#x27;s getting a little hard again and then apply it.</li>
            <li> Its a refill kit so not much to say besides its cost effective and comes with what you need, works well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had laser hair removal and I&#x27;ve gone and had body hair waxed professionally.  I hated going to a salon to get my hair waxed and laser hair removal did not completely stop me from shaving for the rest of my life unlike what those commercials claim.  I originally bought the kit at my local supermarket on clearance and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I&#x27;m happy I did as I love it!  You don&#x27;t have to use strips and it&#x27;s easy to use on myself (I use it for my bikini section).  After heating up the unit (which is my biggest complaint as it takes forever to heat up) you smear it on the hair you want to remove and then rip it off.  I don&#x27;t need any of those fancy wax removers to get it off my fingers or skin as it peels right off and if I&#x27;ve missed any areas with wax still on my skin it comes off with soap and water in the shower.  I find one of the containers lasts me a good 6 months or so with doing my waxing every month to month and a half.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Ive been using it for over 5 years. It heats up well and fast. Peels off easy!</li>
            <li> use this product for over10 years&lt;br /&gt;the best wax on the face of the earth. i call it a lazer wax :-)&lt;br /&gt;it pulls everything out. but i use it for face though,  never used it on a body</li>
            <li> I love this have been to many drug stores and Target and Walmart and seems like it everyone quit carrying it. So excited to see I could get it here on Amazon. Have tried many different waxing products and this really is great.</li>
            <li> I am so sorry that this is becoming difficult to find. It allows me to have a fresh wax whenever I want to without paying high prices and going out to let someone else do it. Love this waxer!</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I need.  Takes at least 45 minutes to heat &amp; melt.  But once it reaches the right temp, it&#x27;s a great product to work with.</li>
            <li> I really like this for small areas.  I did watch some YouTube videos before trying it.  I didn&#x27;t have to go over any area twice or use tweezers because this great wax got it all the first try.</li>
            <li> Hi everyone,&lt;br /&gt;First I was very sad when I found out that this Sally was is discontinued in stores but then I checked on amazon and it works great same as I used to use from Walmart, so thanks to amazon and definitely will recommend this to customers. 5*****</li>
            <li> love it, works great, but it really does dry up really quick and hard to use wax strips so you need to apply and quickly use the strip</li>
            <li> Just make sure you have the right warmer kit and do not close the wax refill when it&#x27;s hot cause you won&#x27;t be able to open it!</li>
            <li> Perfect refill kit, lasts a long time. Couldn&#x27;t find this at my local store and was very happy to find more on amazon. I primarily do underarm and bikini line.</li>
            <li> You could definitely find better. But the price is good for the product, so I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> When this product came out (the warmer/wax kit) i was skeptical; in the past i had tried similar products and was disappointed.  HOwever, i bought the wax warmer from Sally Hansen and was amazed at how similar it was to my spa experience. Granted i have been going to the spa for waxing for a long time, so i had absorbed techniques of using the wax, but the results were amazing.  My only comment would be to be patient when warming the wax:  the instructions say warm for 20 minutes; i find that it is double that.  It should be easy to stir/scoop the wax when you use it - if not, let it heat more.  Also follow the tips in the instructions.    Regardless i was so happy with it that i went ahead and bought these refills for it as i expect to continue to use this kit to stretch out my visits to the spa for waxing.</li>
            <li> So sad that this is no longer being made. I just found a similar product to use, that I love just as much but it was more expensive than this use to be.</li>
            <li> I use this product every few weeks. The more I use it the less hair I have-I use it for my face and bikini area mostly. I even introduced the item to my sister who used it for beauty routine. So every once in awhile I&#x27;ll be buying refills which is great for me so I can keep up my routine.</li>
            <li> This keeps saving me!</li>
            <li> I just love this wax! It is the best one to do the Brazilian by yourself! Why is it out of stock!!??</li>
            <li> I am one of those poor unfortunate women who can practically grow a full beard. Shaving gets ugly fast, plucking takes too long, and going to a salon all the time is pricey. I have tried quite a few different hair removal products at home and this one is my favorite. It&#x27;s very affordable (each refill kit comes with two pots of wax, making each pot cost around 7.50 or 8 dollars). I&#x27;ve tried the heat in the microwave kits and some of those work well but can get really sticky.  Some of those will wash off skin really well but can be difficult on other things like carpet, fabric, or even linoleum. Some of those microwave kits are not even easily washable off of skin, making leftover wax on the skin truly difficult to deal with and heaven help you if you get it on a porous surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I will outline what I think are the pros and cons of this system:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Works very well pulling out stubborn hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with quite a few wooden sticks, more than I&#x27;ve ever needed.&lt;br /&gt;- Each pot comes with a lid and can be resealed between uses.&lt;br /&gt;- Once the wax has hardened it will come off of most surfaces by simply yanking it off.&lt;br /&gt;- Inexpensive compared to most other solutions.&lt;br /&gt;- Having used this system for over a year I can honestly say it has started thinning out my unwanted hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Wax can take a while to heat. When a tub is full it can take forever to heat up (and I remove the rubber ring to make it go faster). By forever I mean an hour or more.  When the tub gets smaller and after the wax has been heated once (even if it&#x27;s nearly full still), it heats up much faster.&lt;br /&gt;- There is no \\&quot;warm\\&quot; setting. It&#x27;s on or it&#x27;s off so either it will continue to get hotter, burning you, or you turn it off and hope to go fast enough that it doesn&#x27;t cool too much to not be used. The solution I found was to turn in on for a few moments and then off again.  Not ideal though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product. I&#x27;ve been using itfor over a year now and because I am so satisfied I am not really looking for a new solution any time soon.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> your pricing is off $499.99.</li>
            <li> It is a great wax that does the job and does it right. It doesn&#x27;t irrate my skin and melts evenly</li>
            <li> I love this system. It&#x27;s the most convient one I&#x27;ve found and very easy to use. Works great. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Gets hard fast but gets the job done. Would recommend this to anyone who wants to save money by jot going to salon</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from this seller and it came quickly- better then other sellers where they make you wait a week! my first time using this product and it works greats! i would recommend this product to people out there who want to start waxing at the comfort of your own home.. beats paying $25 bucks each time...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked on this product, have been using for just over a year. For some reason it has been difficult to find the refills at the stores now so I order several at a time. Some helpful advice: the black rubber ring around the tins is made to keep them from making direct contact with the heating surface. Down side is, it takes forever to heat the wax especially if it&#x27;s a new tin. I take the ring off on just keep an eye on the wax checking in regularly and stirring it. Once it&#x27;s melted enough I turn the heat off and turn it back on if I need to. It&#x27;s really easier than it sounds, not as time consuming, melts the wax well and quickly. Hope this helped and enjoy smooth skin.</li>
            <li> works great especial for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Use alone or with muslin strips, this wax is the bomb- it&#x27;s flexible and efficient. Truth be told, I have my significant other using this wax to wax my armpits so I can&#x27;t say how the wax operates alone.</li>
            <li> easy to use, easy to clean up.  WAY better than honey*** wax.  I use it for my whole body.  As long as the container is pushed in to the heater all the way, it will heat up in reasonable time.</li>
            <li> i prefer this type to any other, it doesnt have the sticky hard to remove or paper necessary wax. It hardens relatively quickly after applying, so it makes the process faster. Its cleaner, i like it, have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I grew up plucking my armpit hair, which I think made my armpit skin really rough over time. The older I get, the more I&#x27;ve become conscious about how my armpits look, especially in the summer time when I feel like wearing sleeveless tops. I&#x27;ve tried shaving, but I got stubbles, which really wasn&#x27;t the kind of look that I was trying to get, either. After many hours browsing on the web looking for a solution to get smooth armpits, I decided to try waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I had never waxed before, I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much money buying something that wouldn&#x27;t work for me. There were two wax warmer kit products I was considering: this Sally Hansen brand, or GiGi. Everybody seems to have good experience with GiGi, but I was turned off by the price (especially since I wasn&#x27;t sure it waxing would really solve my armpit problem), and also the size of the product. So, I went to Walmart &amp; bought a Sally Hansen kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I&#x27;ve found this product!! Waxing really gives me the smooth armpits I&#x27;m looking for, and it is really easy to do. It is not painful at all, either (but maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to plucking, which kinda works the same way)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem:&lt;br /&gt;Just like what most reviewers say here, it does take forever to melt the wax. It took me 2-3 hours to melt this small tin of wax that came with the Sally Hansen wax warmer kit. Based on my online research, all I could think about was that maybe Sally Hansen wax didn&#x27;t have a low melting point, and that was why it took so long to melt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, once I had used up all the Sally Hansen hard wax that came with the warmer kit, I decided to purchase a 14-oz GiGi all purpose hard wax. Since it came in a metal tin, I just placed the tin on top of my flat-surface electric stove at home, with the heat set at low temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t take long at all for the wax to melt! Once I had enough volume of melted wax, I started pouring this liquid wax into my Sally Hansen tin that was empty. Guess what? It never takes long at all now for me to melt this GiGi hard wax using my Sally Hansen wax warmer kit!!! It takes me maybe only 15-20 minutes now to melt the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on this result, maybe my theory is right about Sally Hansen wax&#x27;s not having a low melting point since I have a completely different experience with GiGi all purpose hard wax. So, if taking too long to melt the was is the only complaint you have about this Sally Hansen wax warmer, perhaps you want to try what I&#x27;ve done before you decide to pitch this product.</li>
            <li> It really works &amp; saves lots of $ so you don&#x27;t have to go to a salon to get waxed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ve discontinued this, but it&#x27;s hard to find in stores and I was pleased to find it on Amazon. I&#x27;ve tried very nearly all of the Sally Hansen hair removal products, and overall I&#x27;m not impressed. But I really like this wax and the wax warmer thing in which it is supposed to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is your classic heated wax. It doesn&#x27;t come with strips and you don&#x27;t need them, although you can always make them if you really want. It&#x27;s easy to put on and comes off well if you do it right. (hint: don&#x27;t wait for the wax to harden completely). Smells nice and stores easily. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like many of the other products do, and it actually works well (which many other products don&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> thats my fav wax ever too bad that they dont have it anymore hope they bring it back soon</li>
            <li> I am hairy but you&#x27;d never know it. Prefer this to all other waxes I have tried through my furry lifetime, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> everytime I find a product I like it seems they quit selling it in stores. So glad I found it on here</li>
            <li> I love this wax and have been using it for awhile now. I&#x27;ve seen many negative reviews on it, but the thing is you have to follow instructions careful and pull it off at the right time to get the right results. Actually over time I&#x27;ve learned exactly when is the right time and I find it nearly painless and a very good product</li>
            <li> My wife loves tourchering me with it LOL</li>
            <li> I just think that the little warming pot is the MOST simple and easy way to use this wax. I love these.</li>
            <li> When I opened my wax there were many broken pieces inside.  I have no even used it yet because I bought more at CVS because it didn&#x27;t appear to be in great condition.</li>
