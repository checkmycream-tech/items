    <ol>
            <li>Awesome product.</li>
            <li>Amazon always has the best price for it</li>
            <li>Wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is indeed creamy and has a wonderful scent!</li>
            <li>This one is excellent.</li>
            <li>(I apply it with a plastic mesh pouf), and smells great!</li>
            <li>Wonderfully calming and cleansing.</li>
            <li>Perfect for winter skin irritation and dryness.</li>
            <li>One of the best body washes I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Smells great and Sea Buckthorn is very good for your skin.</li>
            <li>A great product.  </li>
            <li>This body wash is great with a great smell.</li>
            <li>It is a joy to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizing wash, but doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling over hydrated or oily.</li>
            <li>Refreshing and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>This is a pleasant smelling body wash.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always on the hunt for good products.</li>
            <li>This, plus a good price, is what I look for in a body wash and Weleda&#x27;s got it.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>And skin feels good after shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for a good price to buy it.</li>
            <li>, I keep trying them for good reviews and just no results</li>
            <li>Nice odor, like rosemary, absorbes well.</li>
            <li>No weird ingredients, just a great body wash.</li>
            <li>I love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>love the holistic approach to the brand, the smells and mostly the price...</li>
            <li>I was so glad I tried this.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Even better when followed with Weleda Sea Buckthorn lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this bath wash.</li>
            <li>I think think this product is ok, although not my favorite.</li>
            <li>This bath wash smells amazing  and feels great afterwards, leaving my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li>And it has a nice fresh scent that I love.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s bright but gentle scent</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic (as is most of the Weleda line of Sea Buck thorn products).  </li>
            <li>we love all weleda products and our loyal users....</li>
            <li>Love all Weleda products, but always buy this one consistently!</li>
            <li>you have normal skin, you will probably love this product!</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the clean, but, mild orange-citrus fragrance.</li>
            <li>Smells clean and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Smell is nice, natural - not overpowering.</li>
            <li>happened, didn&#x27;t make it drier, but no added moisture, quite surprised because I hear such good things about sea buckthorn, but to be honest this has been my issue with all Weleda oils, lotions, and washes</li>
            <li>Has a nice fresh orange scent - very natural scent and lightly scented, very understated.</li>
            <li>Smells so good, and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li>Nice way to slowly wake up or nice to unwind as well.</li>
            <li>Great for dry or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I know that lather does not &#x3D; clean, but I was using 3x&#x27;s as much body wash and at the price, that isn&#x27;t a great deal.</li>
            <li>Fast service!</li>
            <li>I love Weleda oils, but the body wash left a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li>I actually need to order more because I just ran out</li>
            <li>And I love that it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; scent, but real essential oils!</li>
            <li>I like all of their scents, but this one really gets me going in the morning -- citrusy!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am German myself, just like Weleda, and supporting german companies is usually a good thing for me.</li>
            <li>The result was that much of the product ended up on the counter of my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>I would expect this from any product for \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin, but this was promising \\&quot;nurishment\\&quot;, and I guess I was misled in my expectations.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy, lathers very well</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, and hydrates the skin, but no better than a cheaper brand would, like caress.</li>
            <li>(Whole Foods always seems to have it for a little more), and you especially can&#x27;t beat the price when you Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
            <li>To be honest I didn&#x27;t use this product long enough to see if there was a difference in my dry skin.</li>
            <li>The price here is pretty high, considering that the same amount of my french body wash costs about 4 $, but I had received a 10$ gift card as an incentive AND it was on sale, so I thought I&#x27;d take my chance</li>
            <li>Weleda always uses health conscious ingredients.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft, not sticky.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my skin feel smoother, hydrated and less dry.</li>
            <li>I love using this product in the cold winter - the fresh, orange scent lifts my spirits.</li>
            <li>Usually I am mail ordering my cosmetica from France (Jouvance and Ricaud, both from the Rocher Corporation), and I guess I am pretty spoilt by their high quality and low prices.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry sensitive skin and nothing</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It reduces skin irritation and I do believe that my skin, particularly on my neck and chest area, looks better--smoother and less of a tendancy to look dry and stressed.</li>
            <li> I use this at the end if the day as a face wash to remove makeup and it cleanses and hydrates my face and cleared up minor acne I had from clogged pores.</li>
            <li> B000NRV00Y Weleda Sea Buckthorn Body Oil, 3.4 Ounce]] on a regular basis to treat the keratosis pilaris on my upper arms and was curious about other Sea Buckthorn-containing products.</li>
            <li> Weleda Sea Buckthorn Body wash is different than other washes.  </li>
            <li> I am having a very dry skin, and shortly after my shower (like 2 hours later) my lower legs were hurting and getting too tight within my skin.</li>
            <li> I have really dry, itchy winter skin</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s so positive for morning time or when you&#x27;re tired</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to review.</li>
            <li> hated smell and did nothing like it said it did, to be fair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether this body wash alone would help soothe my keratosis pilaris (would have to experiment a little bit), but it does leave my skin silky soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, just due to expense.</li>
            <li> And a little bit goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> I am in my late 40s, and the product is not enough \\&quot;nurishing\\&quot; for my needs, despite the creamy showering experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> or you mood is down.</li>
            <li> But the extremely high postage makes the transactions expensive in the end, so I was thinking of trying something</li>
            <li> It feels like I am wearing too tight socks, if you can imagine that.</li>
            <li> My skin is wrapped too tight around my flesh, and it needs immediate care (by creams).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little bit covers a lot and moisturizes while it cleans.</li>
            <li> It also has a little bit of grit that helps exfoliate, so after you shower you can use a moisturizer that will absorb in your skin.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t so expensive for such a small bottle I would buy only this product.</li>
            <li> I am back buying it for a friend that had broken out with some acne on her chin.</li>
            <li> You feel and look as though you have had a pedicure after putting a small amount on your feet.  </li>
            <li> (usually I just purchase Target brand body wash).  </li>
            <li> No notable difference with my skin though.</li>
            <li> Alas I found myself trying to funnel this pricey product into little travel bottles I had on hand.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the tube in which it comes is so poorly designed that the cap broke upon opening.</li>

And a little bit goes a very long way.  It is healing and softens the skin, second to none.  I also enjoy the clean, but, mild orange-citrus fragrance.</li>

            <li> What can I say? This cleanser does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  It cleans and moisturizers your skin. I have really dry, itchy winter skin and I&#x27;m always on the hunt for good products. This one is excellent. And it has a nice fresh scent that I love. Win/win.</li>
            <li> we love all weleda products and our loyal users.... we also use the weleda baby line on our baby... love the holistic approach to the brand, the smells and mostly the price...</li>
            <li> I purchased this body wash because I already use Weleda&#x27;s Sea Buckthorn body oil [[ASIN:B000NRV00Y Weleda Sea Buckthorn Body Oil, 3.4 Ounce]] on a regular basis to treat the keratosis pilaris on my upper arms and was curious about other Sea Buckthorn-containing products. I was so glad I tried this. It&#x27;s creamy, lathers very well (I apply it with a plastic mesh pouf), and smells great! The scent is actually somewhat citris-y to me, which is invigorating in the early-morning shower before work. I&#x27;m not sure whether this body wash alone would help soothe my keratosis pilaris (would have to experiment a little bit), but it does leave my skin silky soft and moisturized. I actually need to order more because I just ran out and I totally miss it!</li>
            <li> I love using this product in the cold winter - the fresh, orange scent lifts my spirits. And I love that it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; scent, but real essential oils! Love it.</li>
            <li> Smells so good, and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. This, plus a good price, is what I look for in a body wash and Weleda&#x27;s got it. I like all of their scents, but this one really gets me going in the morning -- citrusy!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to review. However, it does not lather. It does not smell like Sea Buckthorn. Would not recommend, and I will not order again.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizing wash, but doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling over hydrated or oily. Has a nice fresh orange scent - very natural scent and lightly scented, very understated. Nice way to slowly wake up or nice to unwind as well.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully calming and cleansing. Perfect for winter skin irritation and dryness. Even better when followed with Weleda Sea Buckthorn lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this bath wash. Weleda always uses health conscious ingredients. This bath wash smells amazing  and feels great afterwards, leaving my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Nice odor, like rosemary, absorbes well.</li>
            <li> I like this body wash for it&#x27;s bright but gentle scent - it&#x27;s so positive for morning time or when you&#x27;re tired or you mood is down. And skin feels good after shower.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and smells wonderful! Would purchase again to treat myself (usually I just purchase Target brand body wash).  No notable difference with my skin though.</li>
            <li> I know that lather does not &#x3D; clean, but I was using 3x&#x27;s as much body wash and at the price, that isn&#x27;t a great deal. To be honest I didn&#x27;t use this product long enough to see if there was a difference in my dry skin.</li>
            <li> One of the best body washes I have ever used. Smells clean and not overpowering. Leaves skin soft, not sticky.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel smoother, hydrated and less dry.</li>
            <li> I Use it all the time.  Smells great and Sea Buckthorn is very good for your skin. I&#x27;m always looking for a good price to buy it.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t so expensive for such a small bottle I would buy only this product.</li>
            <li> I think think this product is ok, although not my favorite. My spouse finds it &amp;#34;too greasy.&amp;#34; The scent is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I use this at the end if the day as a face wash to remove makeup and it cleanses and hydrates my face and cleared up minor acne I had from clogged pores. I will not go without this product period. I am back buying it for a friend that had broken out with some acne on her chin. Weleda makes their products from plant extracts, just sayin!</li>
            <li> hated smell and did nothing like it said it did, to be fair I have extremely dry sensitive skin and nothing happened, didn&#x27;t make it drier, but no added moisture, quite surprised because I hear such good things about sea buckthorn, but to be honest this has been my issue with all Weleda oils, lotions, and washes, I keep trying them for good reviews and just no results</li>
            <li> Weleda Sea Buckthorn Body wash is different than other washes.  It reduces skin irritation and I do believe that my skin, particularly on my neck and chest area, looks better--smoother and less of a tendancy to look dry and stressed.</li>
