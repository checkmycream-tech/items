            <li>The search for the perfect nail brush continues...</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfectly styled to be effective!</li>
            <li>Great brush.</li>
            <li>Great product cleans nails with ease.  </li>
            <li>and it still is great shape.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great for getting up under this artists nails.</li>
            <li>For the price, excellent for cleaning under nails, but wish bristles were a bit more rigid.</li>
            <li>Good and well made.  </li>
            <li>I use them often good deal</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, I would say that this is a good nail brush.</li>
            <li>This is a good fingernail brush.</li>
            <li>I was looking for an effective and goodlooking nail brush</li>
            <li>and I hope this one holds it own.</li>
            <li>But this is a good brush and the bristles are stiff-enough for most men.  </li>
            <li>How can you was your hands decently without a nail brush and this one is the perfect size.  </li>
            <li>The brush arrived with most of the bristles bent to one side, so they aren&#x27;t effective.  </li>
            <li>I keep it right on top of my bathroom vanity and it looks great.</li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;m looking for another brand that will do the job better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS NAIL BRUSH -</li>
            <li>I intend to order more.</li>
            <li>IT IS BETTER THAN THE WOOD BRUSH THAT WARPS FROM WATER.....</li>
            <li>This works better for shorter nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many brushes don&#x27;t like the minerals in our water.</li>
            <li>Glad to have found this one.</li>
            <li>Bought two of these because I like the top bristle arrangement for getting under the fingernails.  </li>
            <li>This appears to be a good finger nail brush at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>My daughter loves this brush and uses it at the sink or in the bath most days for keeping her nails clean!</li>
            <li>The bristles seem strong and they have the nice angled side which helps clean your nails.</li>
            <li>I used to have one of the old ones made from wood, and it worked great for many years.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping at a good price.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to keep the area under your nails clean!</li>
            <li>I used to be able to use the water pressure in the shower to have sparkling clean nails but not anymore.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I even bought and had delivered to family members!  </li>
            <li>it did a great job, but now it isn&#x27;t much better than many other nail brushes.</li>
            <li>The MASH nail brush bristles have just the right strength and rigidilty to clean effectively under your nails.</li>
            <li>it works just fine.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a better one and still use it in general, but it doesn&#x27;t fill the bill for a good under the nails cleaning brush.</li>
            <li>I need a knuckle brush that will clean under my nails and not be destroyed doing it.</li>
            <li>but it will get into the groves of your hand and nails to give you clean hands.</li>
            <li>The single row of bristles on one side are great for getting the crud out from under your nails, but they don&#x27;t hold up under use.</li>
            <li>The sideways bristles are really good for getting grease and grime from under your fingernails--much faster and easier than a traditional nail brush.</li>
            <li>I got this because of the price compared to other options that also didn&#x27;t get great reviews.  </li>
            <li>They bend and break and angle off to the side quickly when used as intended.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Tweezerman makes a better nail brush in my opinion, but the shipping is so high that I decided to order this model instead.  </li>
            <li>The portion on top which is for under your nails works great however the bristles will not last very long as after not so much use they will begin to fray and disperse making them not as effective as when you first use it.</li>
            <li>These brushes are great for cleaning under the nails and the bottom brushes are soft enough to clean the skin of the hands without tearing or scaring the flesh.</li>
            <li>I have it 2 stars because the soft bristles are ok for the soil that is ground into my skin (but not nails).</li>
            <li>This brush is definitely more masculine than others I have seen (which is a plus).</li>
            <li>Can hold water on top and get kind of gross if you&#x27;re not careful and leave it in the shower.</li>
            <li>I liked this at first, but despite running it through the dishwasher the white bristles start to look yucky pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The bristles are the right stiffness and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I threw them away and bought more expensive brushes which are holding up beautifully.</li>
            <li>That part of the brush works great, but after a week the bristles on the other side of the brush rusted completely.</li>
            <li>Then there are men who have normal fingers, hands, and jobs, and just want to scrub their hands and clean under their nails.  </li>
            <li>First use and the bristles are deforming and breaking off.</li>
            <li>I love nailbrushes with the second layer of bristles.  </li>
            <li>I used this brush 3 times and the bristles on the top (the single row on the flat most useful for cleaning under fingernails) are all bent out of shape and unusable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Theis nail brush is very styrdy and seems like it will last for many years.  </li>
            <li>brushes top bristles are way too long and bend out of shape after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li>After a few uses the bristles discolored at the bottom and it does not look very appealing.</li>
            <li>This brush looks good, but the bristles are short on the flat side.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy.</li>
            <li>The dual sides lets you get the whole fingernail area.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like it as much as the Stanley one.</li>
            <li>however I would say that this one works very well.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the poorest quality...</li>
            <li>subsequently bought the Tweezerman nail brush that has a similar design and found it to be far superior and a decent product.</li>
            <li>I eventually got the Eppco heavy duty 2 sided nail brush, which is far superior in quality, and also far cheaper!</li>
            <li>While I do have it my shower area I really think that a nail brush should be able to stand up to a little moisture.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made with an elegant matte black plastic.</li>
            <li>Bristles fell out and split apart on first use, cheaply put together obviously, not worth the money.  </li>
            <li>See http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007N5758/ref&#x3D;ox_sc_sfl_title_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;smid&#x3D;A1T0VEFK4F7RX4 if you want a decent brush.</li>
            <li>Bristles on the &amp;#34;fingernail&amp;#34; side of the brush are too long to clean &amp;#34;man-length&amp;#34; nails.</li>
            <li>I read other reviews on here, which is usually safe to go by, and I completely disagree.</li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars if the bristles were more stiff.</li>
            <li>When it was brand new</li>
            <li>However the side with the single layer of bristles (for getting under nails) quickly became ruined as the bristles bent.</li>
            <li>I waste more time and, ironically, more water by standing in the shower and cleaning my nails with this brush than I did before being forced to use a low-flow shower head.</li>
            <li>The nail brush is also black, sleek and nice looking, rather than a funny green or purple color.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to find a nail brush with the side bristle feature to get up under my fingernails (they are not as common as one would think).  </li>
            <li>They are now more sturdy but not quite as hard as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>So many brushes have bristles that are too soft and do not work a all or too hard and cause harm to the soft skin under one&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li>I work in the garden a great deal and get a lot of dirt under my nails and fairly dirty hands.  </li>
            <li>The soft bristles are soft, I&#x27;ll give the brush that.</li>
            <li>The bristles are too soft to work as a nail scrubber.</li>
            <li>I like the design as it doesn&#x27;t take up much room on the back of my sink.</li>
            <li>Bristles too soft, wore out almost immediately.</li>
            <li>There is only so much excitement I can exhibit when talking about a brush</li>
            <li>Bought two of them to replace my old Baxters that lasted over two years each.</li>
            <li>Not even 2 weeks old</li>
            <li>I agree with previous reviewers that the brushes on the bottom are too soft and the top brushes are too long to be of use.  </li>
            <li>tried switching away from the Tweezerman one because it&#x27;s hollow and if you drop it just right, it comes apart and then moisture gets in there and gets funky.</li>
            <li>I garden a lot and end up needing to clean under my nails a few times a day on the weekends.</li>
            <li>so much I bought an extra one for future use.</li>
            <li>The bristles all lose their shape and look the same as an old toothbrush that has been used for cleaning things apart from teeth!</li>
            <li>To small to hold and the bristles too wimpy to clean.</li>
            <li>I trimmed the top brushes (a tedious and messy task) but now that part is fine.  </li>
            <li>I needed it because I moved to a new place that was a victim of California&#x27;s low-flow shower head law.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the single file bristles on the top are too long.</li>

            <li> My only complaint is that the single file bristles on the top are too long.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the \\&quot;stiff\\&quot; bristles for scrubbing under the nails are soft, too, and aren&#x27;t very useful.</li>
            <li> The bristles are long enough, and they stand up to continued use.</li>
            <li> The brissels and stiff and soft enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li> I will say that the bristles on this brush are a little stiffer than usual, which is useful for scrubbing off the dirt and gunk.</li>
            <li> I finally got out a small pair of scissors and cut off the bristles on the single soft row.</li>
            <li> I am a mechanic and this would certainly not be good to use in a shop environment because it certainly would not hold up however as a household brush</li>
            <li> I had hoped that the extra row might be stiff enough for the job, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> The reviews from that crowd always complain that the brush isn&#x27;t manly enough or stiff enough.  </li>
            <li> This brush is rough for nails.</li>
            <li> Total waste of $.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Then the little bristles in the other short  nail side began falling out.</li>
            <li> Small bristles are not stiff enough to do serious under the nail cleaning.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush due to the reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not sturdy enough for hard use.  </li>
            <li> These brushes (bought 2) do not hold the second layer in place, after minimal use, the bristles of the second layer became useless, bristles pointing in all directions.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are almost useless after the first few uses.</li>

            <li> The nail bristles were angled down, couldn&#x27;t get them underneath the nail to do the job it was intended to do.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the bristles are held in with metal, so the base of the bristles rusts easily.</li>
            <li> men seem to be buying these nail brushes because they work with dirty junk all day and need a real torture device to scrape their finger tips and under their nails.  </li>

            <li> I still use it, but it&#x27;s not great if you want to use the short bristle side.</li>
            <li> The bristles all splay out sideways and the nailbrush looks like it has been in use for decades, not just a few days.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This brush is rough for nails.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy. The bristles tore up on the under nail section almost immediately. You could possibly use the bottom bristle area to spread watercolors for posters...</li>
            <li> the&amp;#34; under the nails&amp;#34; part of the brush was soft and useless within weeks.</li>
            <li> I liked this at first, but despite running it through the dishwasher the white bristles start to look yucky pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I used this brush 3 times and the bristles on the top (the single row on the flat most useful for cleaning under fingernails) are all bent out of shape and unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried switching away from the Tweezerman one because it&#x27;s hollow and if you drop it just right, it comes apart and then moisture gets in there and gets funky.</li>
            <li> The soft bristles are soft, I&#x27;ll give the brush that. Unfortunately, the \\&quot;stiff\\&quot; bristles for scrubbing under the nails are soft, too, and aren&#x27;t very useful. I garden a lot and end up needing to clean under my nails a few times a day on the weekends. I bought 2 of these - but now I&#x27;m looking for another brand that will do the job better.</li>
            <li> I like the design, but the materials are lacking. The single row of bristles on one side are great for getting the crud out from under your nails, but they don&#x27;t hold up under use. Within 3 weeks the bristles bend and lose effectiveness. I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an effective and goodlooking nail brush and I finally found it! The MASH nail brush bristles have just the right strength and rigidilty to clean effectively under your nails. So many brushes have bristles that are too soft and do not work a all or too hard and cause harm to the soft skin under one&#x27;s nails. The nail brush is also black, sleek and nice looking, rather than a funny green or purple color. I keep it right on top of my bathroom vanity and it looks great. I like it so much I bought an extra one for future use.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars if the bristles were more stiff. I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it if I could have felt it at a store.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Only complaint is that the bristles are held in with metal, so the base of the bristles rusts easily.</li>
            <li> The bristles are too soft to work as a nail scrubber. I am a gardener and when I come in I need to hard scrub my nails. I had hoped that the extra row might be stiff enough for the job, but it&#x27;s not. I have it 2 stars because the soft bristles are ok for the soil that is ground into my skin (but not nails).</li>
            <li> The side brush brissels began to fray within several uses.</li>
            <li> Good and well made.  I work in the garden a great deal and get a lot of dirt under my nails and fairly dirty hands.  These brushes are great for cleaning under the nails and the bottom brushes are soft enough to clean the skin of the hands without tearing or scaring the flesh.</li>
            <li> I use them often good deal</li>
            <li> The nail bristles were angled down, couldn&#x27;t get them underneath the nail to do the job it was intended to do.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush due to the reviews. Mike the mechanic especially. He must wear rubber gloves at work, because this thing is worthless as is. I finally got out a small pair of scissors and cut off the bristles on the single soft row. This helped but it still sucks. Now I am back here trying to find a brush that is made for cleaning under fingernails.</li>
            <li> This brush is well made, but it won&#x27;t get the job done. I need a knuckle brush that will clean under my nails and not be destroyed doing it. Small bristles are not stiff enough to do serious under the nail cleaning. First use and the bristles are deforming and breaking off. I won&#x27;t be buying another one.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS NAIL BRUSH - I liked it so much that I even bought and had delivered to family members!  It&#x27;s perfectly styled to be effective!</li>
            <li> I like this nail brush a lot. I intend to order more. I especially like the side that gets under nails. The bristles are long enough, and they stand up to continued use.</li>
            <li> Great product cleans nails with ease.  The dual sides lets you get the whole fingernail area. Especially underneath the nail</li>
            <li> The brush arrived with most of the bristles bent to one side, so they aren&#x27;t effective.  The small \\&quot;stiff\\&quot; bristles are anything but.  It is also too small to get a grip on, so it is an all around useless item for me.  I</li>
            <li> Bristles on the &amp;#34;fingernail&amp;#34; side of the brush are too long to clean &amp;#34;man-length&amp;#34; nails. Does not work.</li>
            <li> As a professional gardener who gets her hands and nails fairly dirty I was so psyched for this nail brush. However the side with the single layer of bristles (for getting under nails) quickly became ruined as the bristles bent. When it was brand new it did a great job, but now it isn&#x27;t much better than many other nail brushes. I will say that the bristles on this brush are a little stiffer than usual, which is useful for scrubbing off the dirt and gunk. The search for the perfect nail brush continues...</li>
            <li> USE ALL THE TIME........IT IS BETTER THAN THE WOOD BRUSH THAT WARPS FROM WATER.....</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t have to hide the brush away. It&#x27;s made with an elegant matte black plastic. The bristles seem strong and they have the nice angled side which helps clean your nails. Fast shipping at a good price.</li>
            <li> Bristles fell out and split apart on first use, cheaply put together obviously, not worth the money.  Back to searching for a nail brush again!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like it as much as the Stanley one.</li>
            <li> I have been using this nail brush for about a month. I needed it because I moved to a new place that was a victim of California&#x27;s low-flow shower head law. I used to be able to use the water pressure in the shower to have sparkling clean nails but not anymore. Enter the Mash dual surface nailbrush. This brush is definitely more masculine than others I have seen (which is a plus). I waste more time and, ironically, more water by standing in the shower and cleaning my nails with this brush than I did before being forced to use a low-flow shower head. My only complaint is that the single file bristles on the top are too long. I would have preferred them to be shorter and thus, stiffer. This works better for shorter nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I would say that this is a good nail brush.</li>
            <li> Theis nail brush is very styrdy and seems like it will last for many years.  I use it daily and it still is great shape.</li>
            <li> The Nail Brush small end not happy with. Brushes just fold over and then become useless Sorry about the bad Review</li>
            <li> Quality product, will order it again</li>
            <li> This brush looks good, but the bristles are short on the flat side. I got used to that. Then the little bristles in the other short  nail side began falling out. I still use it, but it&#x27;s not great if you want to use the short bristle side.</li>
            <li> I got this because of the price compared to other options that also didn&#x27;t get great reviews.  I agree with previous reviewers that the brushes on the bottom are too soft and the top brushes are too long to be of use.  I trimmed the top brushes (a tedious and messy task) but now that part is fine.  The bottom brushes also got a trim.  They are now more sturdy but not quite as hard as I&#x27;d like.  At least the brush is now usable.</li>
            <li> This is a good fingernail brush. I like the design as it doesn&#x27;t take up much room on the back of my sink. The bristles are the right stiffness and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Bristles too soft, wore out almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I used to have one of the old ones made from wood, and it worked great for many years. This one uses the same design and also works well, though it&#x27;s all man made materials.</li>
            <li> Can hold water on top and get kind of gross if you&#x27;re not careful and leave it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to keep the area under your nails clean! I keep mine in the shower and use it every day.</li>
            <li> This appears to be a good finger nail brush at a very reasonable price.  Things fall to pieces here and I hope this one holds it own. Many brushes don&#x27;t like the minerals in our water.</li>
            <li> Works great! I searched all over for this style nail brush in stores and couldn&#x27;t find it. Glad to have found this one.</li>
            <li> For the price, excellent for cleaning under nails, but wish bristles were a bit more rigid. Clarissa says buy several and share with your gardener friends!</li>
            <li> There is only so much excitement I can exhibit when talking about a brush however I would say that this one works very well. I am a mechanic and this would certainly not be good to use in a shop environment because it certainly would not hold up however as a household brush it works just fine. The portion on top which is for under your nails works great however the bristles will not last very long as after not so much use they will begin to fray and disperse making them not as effective as when you first use it. All in all I would purchase this again for in home use.</li>
            <li> Mine had this weird manufacturers defect but it wasn&#x27;t affecting the use so I never bothered returning. I like how it works and it&#x27;s great for getting up under this artists nails.</li>
            <li> Bought two of these because I like the top bristle arrangement for getting under the fingernails.  However these brushes are awful.  Soon after using them, the metal bands that hold the bristles started rusting.  And the bristles are falling out.  Total waste of $.&lt;br /&gt;I subsequently bought the Tweezerman nail brush that has a similar design and found it to be far superior and a decent product.</li>
            <li> The sideways bristles are really good for getting grease and grime from under your fingernails--much faster and easier than a traditional nail brush.</li>
            <li> I love nailbrushes with the second layer of bristles.  These brushes (bought 2) do not hold the second layer in place, after minimal use, the bristles of the second layer became useless, bristles pointing in all directions.  I threw them away and bought more expensive brushes which are holding up beautifully.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work well. bristles are placed wrong or something.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to find a nail brush with the side bristle feature to get up under my fingernails (they are not as common as one would think).  That part of the brush works great, but after a week the bristles on the other side of the brush rusted completely. While I do have it my shower area I really think that a nail brush should be able to stand up to a little moisture.  I had purchased two and they both did the same thing.  I realize it was relatively inexpensive but I didn&#x27;t expect this to happen.</li>
            <li> I wanted a tough brush to clean under my nails after I&#x27;ve been working dirty.  The angle side bristles look like they should work and would if they were a bit shorter AND a lot stiffer.  They bend and break and angle off to the side quickly when used as intended.  It&#x27;s just not sturdy enough for hard use.  I haven&#x27;t found a better one and still use it in general, but it doesn&#x27;t fill the bill for a good under the nails cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> These brushes are almost useless after the first few uses. The bristles all lose their shape and look the same as an old toothbrush that has been used for cleaning things apart from teeth! The bristles all splay out sideways and the nailbrush looks like it has been in use for decades, not just a few days. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I eventually got the Eppco heavy duty 2 sided nail brush, which is far superior in quality, and also far cheaper! See http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007N5758/ref&#x3D;ox_sc_sfl_title_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;smid&#x3D;A1T0VEFK4F7RX4 if you want a decent brush.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does</li>
            <li> Absolutely the poorest quality...&lt;br /&gt;This brushes top bristles are way too long and bend out of shape after a couple of uses. Bought two of them to replace my old Baxters that lasted over two years each. I thought Brush #1 was maybe a fluke... Nope.  Brush #2 was just as bad.  Wasted money and time.</li>
            <li> got this brush for cleaning my nails of dirt after working in the garden. Not worth the dirt under my nails. To small to hold and the bristles too wimpy to clean. In other words useless for my needs</li>
            <li> Will use this brush everyday. In fact a week ago we thought we lost it and everybody was upset about it</li>
            <li> After a few uses the bristles discolored at the bottom and it does not look very appealing.</li>
            <li> There are different types of people buying these nail brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most men seem to be buying these nail brushes because they work with dirty junk all day and need a real torture device to scrape their finger tips and under their nails.  The reviews from that crowd always complain that the brush isn&#x27;t manly enough or stiff enough.  Then there are men who have normal fingers, hands, and jobs, and just want to scrub their hands and clean under their nails.  I fall into that camp, so keep that in mind for this review to determine whether or not it&#x27;ll help you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tweezerman makes a better nail brush in my opinion, but the shipping is so high that I decided to order this model instead.  In the future, I&#x27;d get another Tweezerman.  But this is a good brush and the bristles are stiff-enough for most men.  I&#x27;ve never had any trouble getting my fingernails spotless scrubbing with this brush.</li>
            <li> Not even 2 weeks old and it&#x27;s destroyed. NOT DURABLE Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. I read other reviews on here, which is usually safe to go by, and I completely disagree.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this brush and uses it at the sink or in the bath most days for keeping her nails clean!</li>
            <li> Every home sink should have one of these!  How can you was your hands decently without a nail brush and this one is the perfect size.  The brissels and stiff and soft enough to do the job.  It not a workman&#x27;s nail brush...this is  your everyday nail brush.  It won&#x27;t take off Gorilla Glue but it will get into the groves of your hand and nails to give you clean hands.</li>
