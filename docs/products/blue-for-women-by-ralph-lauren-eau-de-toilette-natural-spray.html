            <li>Then I searched the web for better pricing and found it cheaper.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>Not flowery or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I think it is better to go to a store and have the product in our hands when we leave.</li>
            <li>nothing more to say will probably order again when she has used it up</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance, but as with all things, it has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>

            <li>I love this parfume, it became my signature since it was released,  everybody asks me &amp;#34;waht</li>
            <li>Love this cologne.  </li>
            <li>Get many compliments.</li>
            <li>Well in this situation this just might be true because the first day I wore it my husband told me how beautiful I smelled and he doesn&#x27;t always comment.</li>
            <li>Very clean and floral.  </li>
            <li>i have purchased this product in department stores locally, and it was a very pleasant smell tha lasted thruout the day.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance is great for any woman who appreciates a light, yet classy scent.</li>
            <li>Also, once again the package came very quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>I am going to finish this bottle quickly!  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping made it that much better.</li>
            <li>The price has gone up significantly so don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I like clean fragrances</li>
            <li>This scent is fresh and not too strong.</li>
            <li>It has a clean fresh smell to it</li>
            <li>This is a fresh, clean smell.</li>
            <li>This seller ships quickly.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately she was able to use the one off of her old bottle.</li>
            <li>I bought Ralph Lauren Blue perfume and it smell so nice.</li>
            <li>then the product is worth.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume, it is the only perfume I use</li>
            <li>&amp; I use it daily :)</li>
            <li>The first I ever smelled \\&quot;Blue\\&quot;</li>
            <li>would definately recommend this product to the woman who wants to smell nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this happens to be one of my very favorites.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Ralph.</li>
            <li>came fast</li>
            <li>it is a good thing because it can mean that it blends very well with your body chemistry.</li>
            <li>Its charming and subtle.  </li>
            <li>My body chemistry causes many colognes to sour at the end of the day, this never does.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite fragrance- hands down.</li>
            <li>RLB is my #1 perfume, it&#x27;s classic and not over powering.  </li>
            <li>Knowing our postal service, this will create more of a mess</li>
            <li>So either Amazon is price matching everyday, or they have a way of knowing what you&#x27;re searching the web for and putting a better deal in front of you.</li>
            <li>It doesnt matter what new perfume comes out, I never try anythng because nothing compares to this perfume.</li>
            <li>The latter being VERY spooky.</li>
            <li>It is pleasing, soft, feminine.</li>
            <li>i also mailed this to amazon, but no reaction so far.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this perfume, it&#x27;s not overwhelming just soft enough to not overwhelm the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All I can say is, if I ever find a hole in my underwear and on my next visit to Amazon they recommend new underwear before I even do a search, the computer goes into the dumpster.</li>
            <li>when i sprayed it on, i could barely smell it.  </li>
            <li>and I have to be careful with what I wear since my coworker is very sensitive to perfumes.</li>

            <li> /&gt;i had a bit of a shock when i saw the prize AND the shipping prize, but decided to buy it afterall, because i had been searching very long for this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The package came in</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m picky about perfumes and only like a few kinds</li>

            <li> i have the other Ralph Lauren in the brown bottle and have worn that for yrs with no prob</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sour when I have mood swings (happens often)</li>

            <li> Would recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like anything too heavy.</li>
            <li> no if it was old or just a bad batch but definitely not worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this happened, considering the plastic wrapping was still around the box.</li>
            <li> but when I checked Amazon one day it listed an ordinary price.</li>
            <li> smell is subjective, wife told me to buy this for the mother-in-law, she loves it, and I saved a few bucks off dept. store prices!</li>
            <li> afterall a very expensive present for myself</li>
            <li> I hung in there with it because I remember one time a perfume enthusiast said to me that when you have a difficult time smelling a fragrance on yourself</li>
            <li> unhappy with the fact 1 als had to pay the postman 35 euro for bringing the parcell through the douane.</li>
            <li> i was so sad that the perfume \\&quot;blue\\&quot;made by ralph lauren was sold out in europe!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume. It doesnt matter what new perfume comes out, I never try anythng because nothing compares to this perfume. I get the most compliments when I wear it. When the bottle is almost finished, I will be buying another  bottle!!!</li>
            <li> Very clean and floral.  I am going to finish this bottle quickly!  Have gotten complements already.  Would recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like anything too heavy.</li>
            <li> This seller ships quickly.  The cologne was a good price and cosmetic counter quality/condition.  Will shop again.</li>
            <li> I purchased Blue by Ralph Lauren. I have never tested this fragrance but I am usually impressed by anything from Ralph Lauren. I like clean fragrances and I have to be careful with what I wear since my coworker is very sensitive to perfumes. AT first I was a bit disappointed because I could not smell the fragrance very much on myself, so I wondered if this fragrance would go unnoticed. I hung in there with it because I remember one time a perfume enthusiast said to me that when you have a difficult time smelling a fragrance on yourself it is a good thing because it can mean that it blends very well with your body chemistry. Well in this situation this just might be true because the first day I wore it my husband told me how beautiful I smelled and he doesn&#x27;t always comment. Also, once again the package came very quickly and well packaged. Great price too!</li>
            <li> My order was filled in a timely manner, well packaged and received in excellent condition. Thank you for your superb service.</li>
            <li> This scent is fresh and not too strong. it&#x27;ll stay on clothes for a long time. good for any occasion.</li>
            <li> This was the best price I found for this perfume. Quick shipping made it that much better. Very happy. Word.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY PERSONAL PERFUMED. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> i would not recommend purchasing this product.  when i sprayed it on, i could barely smell it.  15 minutes later, there was no smell.  i have purchased this product in department stores locally, and it was a very pleasant smell tha lasted thruout the day.  dont no if it was old or just a bad batch but definitely not worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> I order this once every 6 months or so. I love this perfume, it is the only perfume I use &amp; I use it daily :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my wife for Christmas. Upon opening it we noticed there was no cap in order to spray it. Fortunately she was able to use the one off of her old bottle. Not sure how this happened, considering the plastic wrapping was still around the box.</li>
            <li> When I learned my wife was almost out of this perfume I decided to buy her some as a stocking stuffer for Christmas. Maybe it&#x27;s just me but when I checked Amazon one day it listed an ordinary price. Then I searched the web for better pricing and found it cheaper. When I went back to Amazon the next day for something else, I found they LOWERED the price. So either Amazon is price matching everyday, or they have a way of knowing what you&#x27;re searching the web for and putting a better deal in front of you. The latter being VERY spooky. In the end, they had the best price with free shipping, and items always arrive quickly. All I can say is, if I ever find a hole in my underwear and on my next visit to Amazon they recommend new underwear before I even do a search, the computer goes into the dumpster.</li>
            <li> I bought Ralph Lauren Blue perfume and it smell so nice. It has a clean fresh smell to it I really love it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!!  I always get lots of complements.  It is very hard for me to find it locally, thankfully Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume, it&#x27;s not overwhelming just soft enough to not overwhelm the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definately recommend this product to the woman who wants to smell nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m picky about perfumes and only like a few kinds and this happens to be one of my very favorites.  I&#x27;m thankful to my co-worker for introducing me to this fragrance it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> This is a fresh, clean smell. Not flowery or overwhelming. I get compliments on a regular basis when I wear this perfume.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is great for any woman who appreciates a light, yet classy scent. It&#x27;s perfect for the Summer because it is not overpowering. This is my fourth time purchasing it. The first I ever smelled \\&quot;Blue\\&quot; was on one of my cousins. She smelled great! I knew I had to have it. It&#x27;s a shame that Ralph Lauren has discontinued it. Almost everyone I know has complimented me on wearing this fragrance.</li>
            <li> my friend was wearing it and it smelled really nice so i ord&#x27;d it but when i put it on i was allergic to it. i have the other Ralph Lauren in the brown bottle and have worn that for yrs with no prob so guess just depends on the partic fragrance.</li>
            <li> We never received this product.  I suppose it was lost in the mail and now if we want it we will have to go to the post office (imagine going to the post office at this time of the year, and have them research it.  Knowing our postal service, this will create more of a mess then the product is worth.  At this point, we both agree that ordering anything thru Amazon is not reliable and we probably will not use your service again.  I think it is better to go to a store and have the product in our hands when we leave.</li>
            <li> my wife like the scent, recomended by my daughter. nothing more to say will probably order again when she has used it up</li>
            <li> I buy this for my mother every year. She loves this scent and it gets harder and harder for me to find it. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> My mother wanted this for her birthday. When we gave it to her, she was thrilled. It was shipped and packaged properly and expediently. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, but as with all things, it has been discontinued.  The price has gone up significantly so don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance- hands down. It is pleasing, soft, feminine. This is not overpowering in any way. Once you smell it you are hooked!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t sour when I have mood swings (happens often) lasts all day long and friends like the way it smells. Thanks Ralph.</li>
            <li> i was so sad that the perfume \\&quot;blue\\&quot;made by ralph lauren was sold out in europe! i was happy to find it om amazon.&lt;br /&gt;i had a bit of a shock when i saw the prize AND the shipping prize, but decided to buy it afterall, because i had been searching very long for this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The package came in ok, i was very happy with the best smell of the world, but unhappy with the fact 1 als had to pay the postman 35 euro for bringing the parcell through the douane. This was not mentioned at the website.&lt;br /&gt;So afterall a very expensive present for myself, i do not think i would do this again. i also mailed this to amazon, but no reaction so far.</li>
            <li> RLB is my #1 perfume, it&#x27;s classic and not over powering.  I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on a perfume before.</li>
            <li> I love this parfume, it became my signature since it was released,  everybody asks me &amp;#34;waht is your parfume&amp;#34; when I go out</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for myself. Love this cologne.  Get many compliments.</li>
            <li> My son asked a sales lady what to get me for my  birthday and explained that I am a teacher.  She recommended RL Blue.  Its going to be my signature fragrance.  Its charming and subtle.  My body chemistry causes many colognes to sour at the end of the day, this never does.</li>
            <li> as advertised, good price,. smell is subjective, wife told me to buy this for the mother-in-law, she loves it, and I saved a few bucks off dept. store prices! came fast</li>
