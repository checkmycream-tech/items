            <li>As a matter of fact this is one of the best products I know for fixing the hair.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with it</li>
            <li>It is an excellent brilliantine</li>
            <li>This is an awesome product.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>But, keep in mind, a great pomp needs not just a great pomade, but also a great haircut.    </li>
            <li>Great product happy with it.</li>
            <li>The smell is great.</li>
            <li>This is a product that has been around for decades and continues to be great for your hair.</li>
            <li>This is one great product.  </li>
            <li>Smells great.  </li>
            <li>But it does as good a job of taming the mane,</li>
            <li>As mentioned, the scent is great but the selling point is how it smooths my hair into a refined appearance with a nice finish.</li>
            <li>The scent is good and the product works.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good for the day.  </li>
            <li>and I am very glad.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find this product on your site, since I could no longer find it in stores.</li>
            <li>and great if you want a nice gel to hold your hair with a marvelous classic &amp;#34;lavender&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>He is thrilled to have it again.</li>
            <li>I purchased a nice tweed coat at a Goodwill thrift store.</li>
            <li>Everyone liked the scent of my hair.</li>
            <li>Nice hold.  </li>
            <li>In the jar, the fragrance smells very nice and the lavender scent seems to be light.</li>
            <li>I am also pleased to see that the formula has not changed, and leaves my hair manageable and with that nice lavender fragrance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This works better than Alberto VO5 -</li>
            <li>This is a man&#x27;s pomade to be sure.     </li>
            <li>Now I was able to get it with You</li>
            <li>Enjoy!  </li>
            <li>Love the scent.  </li>
            <li>I have been used this product for more than forty years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Great fragrance, good hold, and was able to give me an awesome slick pomp that was near Elvis quality.</li>
            <li>This is one the the first pomades I ever tried when I started wearing a pomp over 10 years ago &amp; loved it.</li>
            <li>This has a classic scent that is pleasant and not over-powering.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>The scent is too strong.</li>
            <li>It seems to be thinner or more fine &amp; is not quite the way the original was.</li>
            <li>The Brillantine was fine, however the one I used to buy from England had a stronger scent of Lavendar than this one has, but otherwise it was fine.</li>
            <li>It has pretty good hold, but if you really want your pomp to stand tall and proud, you might need to first work in a bit of heavier pomade like Murray&#x27;s then use the Yardely as a nice top coat to give you the wet looking shine you want.</li>
            <li>And goodness knows, it is more pleasant a scent that the other!</li>
            <li>It has a certain scent that is androgynous, which is fine, but it is rather too strong for me.</li>
            <li>The wonderful thing about pomades is you can use just a tiny bit to get a cool bed-head look, or use enough to get a rockin pomp just like the kings of Rock.</li>
            <li>the smell isn&#x27;t super feminine</li>
            <li>This product is worth the price.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but I&#x27;m worth it.</li>
            <li>Yardley of London English Brilliantine is exactly what I needed to have my hair always looking stylish and easy to shape.</li>
            <li>Nice long scent.  </li>
            <li>I have fond memories of my mother using this as a detangler/styling product on my hair when I was a child, and so I was delighted to find it on Amazon for my little daughter.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty, dont&#x27;cha think?</li>
            <li>One of my favorite short essays is about Yardley&#x27;s Brilliantine and I wanted to share it.</li>
            <li>I normally have rough hair and have often opted for pomade to provide a smooth appearance and better hold.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many pomade styles including original pomade formulas from the 30&#x27;s and have largely avoided the newer goopy mess.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is exactly as I remember it, and the product works very well for smoothing fly-aways, detangling, etc.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t get plastic helment hair that flakes using pomade unlike modern dippity doo-like gels.</li>
            <li>Cost was reasonable.</li>
            <li>I apply feel like very smooth,soft skin , I feel much much batter.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Thanks to yardley  of London</li>
            <li>I use a good dab - enough to spread over the insides of my fingers - to distribute through all the layers of my thick hair, then finish by smoothing the top layer with what&#x27;s left on my fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how this Brilliantine tames my unruly hair - some of which is wavy, some straight as an arrow, some tightly curled.  </li>
            <li>I moved to San Francisco after college and was ready to try new things.</li>
            <li>Just need a little bit to achieve the shiny elegant look.</li>
            <li>When he wasn&#x27;t looking, I would glom too much Brylcreem into my hair, put some shaving cream on my fresh young face, and razor it with the Yellow Pages comb.</li>
            <li>I even tried mixing some of my perfume into the jar and it wasn&#x27;t powerful enough to overcome the existing fragrance.</li>
            <li>For ten bucks its worth the try..</li>
            <li>When you try to go back again, they won&#x27;t have the right hair stuff or anything. </li>
            <li>One of my new favorites.</li>
            <li>Years later, as a man, I decided to cut my hair short again, but by then I couldn&#x27;t find the Yardley&#x27;s Lavender Brilliantine any more, only a cloudy replacement that smelled like perfume.      </li>
            <li>With a fine-tooth comb my hair comes out looking well-groomed with a low gloss appearance visible only at a close distance, it&#x27;s not the high gloss/shiny nonsense that makes most other pomades shimmer.</li>
            <li>I am an old user of Yardley Brillantine.  </li>
            <li>You can only be a young man fresh to the big city once.</li>
            <li>The issue for me is the fragrance, which is decidedly male, reminding me of an old junior high math teacher.</li>
            <li>I went to gay clubs, and I also picked up women in small hipster bars in the Mission District.</li>
            <li>It is a classic petrolatum based pomade like men wore back in the day.</li>
            <li>It works beautifully as long as you don&#x27;t use too much (then it can look greasy).While</li>
            <li>Each morning in the new city before going to work at various temp jobs, I rubbed the pomade on my hair and it smelled like the 1950&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Yardley provides a decent hold and isn&#x27;t some mess for \\&quot;bed-head\\&quot; modern styles.</li>
            <li>Yardley Brilliantine is a step above anything I&#x27;ve tried thus far.</li>

            <li> but without weighing it down completely like the Alberto does.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not masculine either; I would say it&#x27;s a unisex scent.</li>
            <li> As a kid, I remember every morning my father, a code breaker for the Navy in WWII, before work would squeeze out a dab of white Brylcreem and fashion it into his dark hair with a sturdy comb with &amp;#34;Yellow Pages&amp;#34; on the handle.</li>

            <li> This product also arrived almost two weeks sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> However, it is called &amp;#34;Brilliantine,&amp;#34; and NOT Pomade, so I would guess that it would be just dandy for other needs.</li>
            <li> The aroma isn&#x27;t as fragrant &amp; it doesn&#x27;t do the job quite as well as previously.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t as heavy.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy and no strong smell either.</li>
            <li> I use this like a finishing cream to tame frizz and flyaways.</li>
            <li> A small jar though.</li>
            <li> I usually apply a small amount to still-damp hair after a bath so that it adheres evenly to the hair.</li>
            <li> Yardley of London English , me and my mother crazy about it.</li>

            <li> I love how this Brilliantine tames my unruly hair - some of which is wavy, some straight as an arrow, some tightly curled.  Talk about a bush!  I use a good dab - enough to spread over the insides of my fingers - to distribute through all the layers of my thick hair, then finish by smoothing the top layer with what&#x27;s left on my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works better than Alberto VO5 - it isn&#x27;t as heavy.  But it does as good a job of taming the mane, but without weighing it down completely like the Alberto does.  And goodness knows, it is more pleasant a scent that the other!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a friend who has been using this forever.  He couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, not even in London!  He is thrilled to have it again.</li>
            <li> I use this like a finishing cream to tame frizz and flyaways. It works beautifully as long as you don&#x27;t use too much (then it can look greasy).While the smell isn&#x27;t super feminine, it&#x27;s not masculine either; I would say it&#x27;s a unisex scent.</li>
            <li> This is one the the first pomades I ever tried when I started wearing a pomp over 10 years ago &amp; loved it. Great fragrance, good hold, and was able to give me an awesome slick pomp that was near Elvis quality. This is not GEL. It is a classic petrolatum based pomade like men wore back in the day. You won&#x27;t get plastic helment hair that flakes using pomade unlike modern dippity doo-like gels. It remains pliable so you can recomb your hair anytime without getting \\&quot;poofy dry\\&quot; hair you would get with those mamby pamby girly gels. This is a man&#x27;s pomade to be sure.     The wonderful thing about pomades is you can use just a tiny bit to get a cool bed-head look, or use enough to get a rockin pomp just like the kings of Rock. But, keep in mind, a great pomp needs not just a great pomade, but also a great haircut.    It has pretty good hold, but if you really want your pomp to stand tall and proud, you might need to first work in a bit of heavier pomade like Murray&#x27;s then use the Yardely as a nice top coat to give you the wet looking shine you want.</li>
            <li> I am an old user of Yardley Brillantine.  Sometime ago I was disapointed to verify that Amazon was not carrying this product and I needed to buy it in England.  Now I was able to get it with You and I am very glad.  I hope that in the future I allwais will find the Brllantine at Amazon.  As a matter of fact this is one of the best products I know for fixing the hair.</li>
            <li> It seems to be thinner or more fine &amp; is not quite the way the original was. The aroma isn&#x27;t as fragrant &amp; it doesn&#x27;t do the job quite as well as previously.</li>
            <li> I grew up admiring Yardley products. Today, as a Living Historian for the Civil War, and needing Pomade for creating the correct hair for the mid 1800&#x27;s, I bought this product. It has a certain scent that is androgynous, which is fine, but it is rather too strong for me. The texture is a bit wet, so is the shine, and again, for my needs, I would not buy it again. I bought it to basically plaster my frizzy hair into resembling smoothness, and it it not up to the job. However, it is called &amp;#34;Brilliantine,&amp;#34; and NOT Pomade, so I would guess that it would be just dandy for other needs. The color is pretty, dont&#x27;cha think? Cost was reasonable.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite short essays is about Yardley&#x27;s Brilliantine and I wanted to share it. Enjoy!  Yardley&#x27;s Brilliantine by Stephen Johnson      In the box marked &amp;#34;SF 1989-91,&amp;#34; I found a small, clear jar labeled Yardley&#x27;s Brilliantine. The neon-green hair goop inside the glass rim still smelled like lavender.     I moved to San Francisco after college and was ready to try new things. I bought the jar in a drugstore and promptly slicked back my hair. I purchased a nice tweed coat at a Goodwill thrift store. I went to gay clubs, and I also picked up women in small hipster bars in the Mission District. Everyone liked the scent of my hair. Each morning in the new city before going to work at various temp jobs, I rubbed the pomade on my hair and it smelled like the 1950&#x27;s. I figured that Montgomery Clift had probably used this brand.      As a kid, I remember every morning my father, a code breaker for the Navy in WWII, before work would squeeze out a dab of white Brylcreem and fashion it into his dark hair with a sturdy comb with &amp;#34;Yellow Pages&amp;#34; on the handle. When he wasn&#x27;t looking, I would glom too much Brylcreem into my hair, put some shaving cream on my fresh young face, and razor it with the Yellow Pages comb. I wonder if he still uses Brylcreem.      When I left San Francisco, I stopped the 1950&#x27;s sensitive-guy business and grew my hair long. Years later, as a man, I decided to cut my hair short again, but by then I couldn&#x27;t find the Yardley&#x27;s Lavender Brilliantine any more, only a cloudy replacement that smelled like perfume.      You can only be a young man fresh to the big city once. You can only pretend to be Montgomery Clift or your father once. When you try to go back again, they won&#x27;t have the right hair stuff or anything. </li>
            <li> It looked like what i expected but the cap of it is cant be closed and it loosens out</li>
            <li> This works as others have stated. The issue for me is the fragrance, which is decidedly male, reminding me of an old junior high math teacher. I even tried mixing some of my perfume into the jar and it wasn&#x27;t powerful enough to overcome the existing fragrance. I personally would not wear this is in my hair as a woman.</li>
            <li> Yardley of London English Brilliantine is exactly what I needed to have my hair always looking stylish and easy to shape. Not greasy and no strong smell either. Just need a little bit to achieve the shiny elegant look. I am very happy with it and I do recommended it.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find this product on your site, since I could no longer find it in stores. I am also pleased to see that the formula has not changed, and leaves my hair manageable and with that nice lavender fragrance.</li>
            <li> I thought to leave a review and give credit where it&#x27;s due.&lt;br /&gt; This has a classic scent that is pleasant and not over-powering. I normally have rough hair and have often opted for pomade to provide a smooth appearance and better hold. Yardley Brilliantine is a step above anything I&#x27;ve tried thus far. I&#x27;ve tried many pomade styles including original pomade formulas from the 30&#x27;s and have largely avoided the newer goopy mess. Yardley provides a decent hold and isn&#x27;t some mess for \\&quot;bed-head\\&quot; modern styles. As mentioned, the scent is great but the selling point is how it smooths my hair into a refined appearance with a nice finish. With a fine-tooth comb my hair comes out looking well-groomed with a low gloss appearance visible only at a close distance, it&#x27;s not the high gloss/shiny nonsense that makes most other pomades shimmer. This is in-between with a low-gloss making your hair appear well conditioned.</li>
            <li> Yardley of London English , me and my mother crazy about it. I would like to say&lt;br /&gt;When I apply feel like very smooth,soft skin , I feel much much batter.&lt;br /&gt;  Thanks to yardley  of London</li>
            <li> Great product happy with it.</li>
            <li> The scent is good and the product works. After my shower I dab this on my hair followed with a brush or currycomb and I&#x27;m good for the day.  A small jar though. If you dislike the overpowering scents that seem to dominate these days then this may be for you. It seems that Gillette is marketing its products towards those with an olfactory malfunction. For ten bucks its worth the try..</li>
            <li> Love the scent.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I just received this today, therefore, I haven&#x27;t had the time to use it yet. In the jar, the fragrance smells very nice and the lavender scent seems to be light. This product also arrived almost two weeks sooner than I expected. I will update this review after I&#x27;ve had a chance to use the product.</li>
            <li> The Brillantine was fine, however the one I used to buy from England had a stronger scent of Lavendar than this one has, but otherwise it was fine.</li>
            <li> I have been used this product for more than forty years. It is an excellent brilliantine</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. The smell is great. You do not have to use a lot. This product is worth the price. This is a product that has been around for decades and continues to be great for your hair.</li>
            <li> and great if you want a nice gel to hold your hair with a marvelous classic &amp;#34;lavender&amp;#34; smell. A bit pricey, but I&#x27;m worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. However; the fragrance does not resemble lavender. The scent is too strong.</li>
            <li> This is one great product.  Smells great.  Easy to apply.  Nice hold.  Nice long scent.  One of my new favorites.</li>
            <li> I have fond memories of my mother using this as a detangler/styling product on my hair when I was a child, and so I was delighted to find it on Amazon for my little daughter. The fragrance is exactly as I remember it, and the product works very well for smoothing fly-aways, detangling, etc. I usually apply a small amount to still-damp hair after a bath so that it adheres evenly to the hair. Great product!</li>
