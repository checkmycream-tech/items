    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I am very fair skinned, so maybe its just me.</li>
            <li>My wife used this and said very nice...</li>
            <li>it was a very nice color though just didnt get the stain effect</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to find a color stain that doesn&#x27;t seem so BRIGHT.</li>
            <li>I had bought this lip stain many years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li>Nice color.</li>
            <li>It kind of reminds me of when I was a kid</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t transfer off on my teeth or glasses, either, which is nice.</li>
            <li>And it does not stay on as well as most stains.</li>
            <li>I personally love this product, just wish it lasted longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do love this product.  </li>
            <li>This lip color is okay...</li>
            <li>I was looking for a more nude shade</li>
            <li>Easy application.  </li>
            <li>nice color at first</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Just wish it wasn&#x27;t full of hideous chemicals.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d take the scented markers and paint my nails and lips with them just for fun.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice color, the Champagne is a nice dark pink shade but it isn&#x27;t a pretty color for my skin-tone.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Color: the color a rose petal turns after its started to dry ..</li>
            <li>But it does last all day and doesn&#x27;t clump, goes on like a magic marker.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work as described, color faded fast.</li>
            <li>so far 3 in trash to dang ORANGE!!!</li>
            <li>It was an okay product, but I kept it because it was not worth the cost to return.</li>
            <li>Only problem -runs out quickly.</li>
            <li>but otherwise the color would have been vibrant</li>
            <li>In the end, I wish I&#x27;d gone with a slightly lighter/pinker color, but this is gorgeous too, goes on evenly, and lasts well on my lips, which are often dry.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the color and the last; however, after only a week of use, the marker tip is running dry.</li>
            <li>a deep red with light hues of creamy</li>
            <li>Lasts longer on my lips and look natural.  </li>
            <li>No mess in my purse andeasy application.</li>
            <li>This is a major downside, but the fact that the colors are so natural and flattering makes this a four star product in my book.  </li>
            <li>This one feels darker, but that may just be in comparison to the last tube, which was quite old when I replaced it.  </li>
            <li>And applies too dark, at first.</li>
            <li>I barely use it.</li>
            <li>NYC version didn&#x27;t stay nearly as long and seemed harder to get consistent coverage.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> doesn&#x27;t last very long (especially when you eat or drink)</li>
            <li> And too dry on the lips.  </li>
            <li> it was dried out when I received it so could only use a couple of times</li>
            <li> I need a lighter shade of pink for my complexion.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the CoverGirl Lipstain for a year or so and was looking for other lipstains that might dry my lips out less.  </li>
            <li> I took out the inner inktube and added 2 small drops of water to see if that would help..</li>
            <li> With that you need to apply, let it dry for a few minutes and then put a gloss of some sort over it.</li>
            <li> This was a lip stain and it is too dark.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> dried up ...</li>
            <li> Waste of Money.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it sat on a shelf for quite some time</li>
            <li> applied it and the tip was a bit hard.</li>
            <li> but it was too late.</li>
            <li> but it bleeds to a weird shade</li>
            <li> I got it because I hate that waxy, heavy feeling of lipstick, but I need some color on my lips.</li>
            <li> Wear time is about 10 minutes if you don&#x27;t drink or eat. :(</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed the colour is misleading..</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave marks on drinking glasses which I find very unappetizing.  </li>

            <li> I had bought this lip stain many years ago and loved it. This one feels darker, but that may just be in comparison to the last tube, which was quite old when I replaced it.  In the end, I wish I&#x27;d gone with a slightly lighter/pinker color, but this is gorgeous too, goes on evenly, and lasts well on my lips, which are often dry.</li>
            <li> This was a lip stain and it is too dark. I was hoping it would be lighter but it was not the color in the picture and you cannot tell by the name of it. It is just a lip stain and has no shine or gloss to it. And it does not stay on as well as most stains. It was an okay product, but I kept it because it was not worth the cost to return.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the CoverGirl Lipstain for a year or so and was looking for other lipstains that might dry my lips out less.  With that you need to apply, let it dry for a few minutes and then put a gloss of some sort over it. It still doesn&#x27;t last all day, but I&#x27;ll get almost to the end of the workday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NYC version didn&#x27;t stay nearly as long and seemed harder to get consistent coverage.  My search continues.</li>
            <li> After approx. one week of use  .... gone ... dried up ... trash</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed the colour is misleading..this is definately not champagne..it&#x27;s red..wish i could get back my money</li>
            <li> I personally love this product, just wish it lasted longer.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;nice color&lt;br /&gt;easy to use&lt;br /&gt;no mess&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;color doesn&#x27;t last very long (especially when you eat or drink)</li>
            <li> I do love this product.  Lasts longer on my lips and look natural.  No mess in my purse andeasy application.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find a color stain that doesn&#x27;t seem so BRIGHT. I am very fair skinned, so maybe its just me.</li>
            <li> nice color at first but it bleeds to a weird shade</li>
            <li> Nice color. Easy application.  I like that it is smooch proof. It doesn&#x27;t leave marks on drinking glasses which I find very unappetizing.  Only problem -runs out quickly.</li>
            <li> it was dried out when I received it so could only use a couple of times</li>
            <li> My wife used this and said very nice...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as described, color faded fast. And applies too dark, at first. And too dry on the lips.  Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice color, the Champagne is a nice dark pink shade but it isn&#x27;t a pretty color for my skin-tone.  I need a lighter shade of pink for my complexion.</li>
            <li> This is a lip stain, but I still have to use a lipstick or gloss with this and I didn&#x27;t think it last any longer that lipstick or gloss. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to my friends and family. May as well just use lipstick or gloss for the money.</li>
            <li> I like pinks and redish  NOT ORANG LIKE BACK IN THE DAY --  so far 3 in trash to dang ORANGE!!! YUKKK</li>
            <li> Tip keeps falling out!!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the color and the last; however, after only a week of use, the marker tip is running dry. This is a major downside, but the fact that the colors are so natural and flattering makes this a four star product in my book.  I would buy them again even knowing that the color runs out.</li>
            <li> This lip color is okay... I some what did not like it because it seems like I&#x27;m writing on my lip with a marker. Like a crayola marker... smells like it too. I barely use it.</li>
            <li> I got it because I hate that waxy, heavy feeling of lipstick, but I need some color on my lips. This does that. It kind of reminds me of when I was a kid and I&#x27;d take the scented markers and paint my nails and lips with them just for fun. It doesn&#x27;t last all day, just a few hours. But that&#x27;s fine. Doesn&#x27;t transfer off on my teeth or glasses, either, which is nice.</li>
            <li> The color arrived dry&lt;br /&gt;Not moist and juicy.&lt;br /&gt;I applied it and the tip was a bit hard. Not sure if it sat on a shelf for quite some time but otherwise the color would have been vibrant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color: the color a rose petal turns after its started to dry ..a deep red with light hues of creamy pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good color but it didnt arrive in the condition it should have. Tossed it out after a month. I took out the inner inktube and added 2 small drops of water to see if that would help.. but it was too late.</li>
            <li> Just wish it wasn&#x27;t full of hideous chemicals.  But it does last all day and doesn&#x27;t clump, goes on like a magic marker.</li>
            <li> Waste of Money. Doesn&#x27;t stay on. Wear time is about 10 minutes if you don&#x27;t drink or eat. :(</li>
            <li> i bought this for my wedding and the color faded! it was a very nice color though just didnt get the stain effect</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more nude shade but i do like this as well</li>
