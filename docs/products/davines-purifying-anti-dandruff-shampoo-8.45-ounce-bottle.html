            <li>I follow it with the davines yogurt conditioner and it balances perfectly any drying of the hair.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Best dandruff/psoriasis shampoo I have ever found</li>
            <li>The best Anti-dandruff shampoo!</li>
            <li>Davines is amazing!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it smells very good either.</li>
            <li>I just moved on to Neutrogena T-Gel, which works great for me.</li>
            <li>but I am so happy I did.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and the gel that works with it!</li>
            <li>I tried every product on the market before this (including Rx products from a derm) and suffered for more than 20 years.</li>
            <li>I have been using for more than 6 months and none of my symptoms have returned.</li>
            <li>well it control my dandruff for a while it was ok ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best shampoo for my hair, and I&#x27;d never use any other one.</li>
            <li>I first tried this when purchasing it at a salon, but the price here was far better, and LOVe that you can setup auto-ship and set how many months you want before it ships again.    </li>
            <li>it gives a good deep cleaning removing the build up from the week.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing and totally cleared my dandriff.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>I was introduced to the natural tech product line by a friend who works at Tom Brophy salon in Los Angeles and it immediately became my favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked a heads up if it was a differnt product or if they used a different bottle.</li>
            <li>What makes it my favorite is not only the amazing clean feeling you have afterwards, it&#x27;s noticing how gentle the product is on your hair and how natural it feels afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I like the weight and texture that the natural oils from your hair and scalp produce which allow for easy styling without having to resort to a ton of products.  </li>
            <li>This product works amazingly - and truly helps with the dry, flaky scalp that I had; I even get the flakiness on my ears, and since this product is safe for your skin, I rub it in my ears and it has also made a big difference there as well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad Amazon is finally selling this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo that I have found that has been able to keep my hair hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Helps my dandruff almost immediately and even if I don&#x27;t use it consistently it keeps the problem at bay.</li>
            <li>By buying 2 or more bottles, I get free shipping, bringing the cost down to $15.99/bottle, which is lower than you can find it anywhere.  </li>
            <li>I have tried all the available products on the market and they simply did not work.</li>
            <li>Within a week of starting this, my scalp was completely clear and healthy.</li>
            <li>I have shopped around at half a dozen salons that carry Davines, as well as on ebay, and I am glad that I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo came recommended to me by a salon owner a few years ago, and I&#x27;m so glad I let her sell me on it.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it dried out my scalp even more and made it flakier.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t send back because the product was till useful.</li>
            <li>I use it every other day, along with a cheap conditioner.  </li>
            <li>note, you should either disinfect your brushes and combs, etc or buy new.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin and scalp.</li>
            <li>I can usually get around 3 months or more out of a bottle.  </li>
            <li>Less dryness overall, but still many flakes remained.</li>
            <li>Love their stuff for my curly hair, got this one for my daughter&#x27;s chronic dry flakes, it seems gentler than other dandruff products but for her it did not work well.</li>
            <li>I use this in combination with Davines Natural Tech Well Being De Stress, Yogurt Conditioner or Macadamia Masque.</li>
            <li>B001RDRG8S Natural Tech Well Being De Stress Creme Yogurt Conditioner]]</li>
            <li>I adamantly bought this product</li>
            <li>If you continue to use your old stuff the dandruff will stay.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo to anyone with dry hair or scalp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it was even the right stuff.</li>

            <li> Naturally it is not as easy on my color (red) as a color conserving shampoo, but it is about the least harsh in that way of any EFFECTIVE scalp treating shampoo.</li>
            <li> at long last i have found you!</li>
            <li> I am a guy, with long hair, and I often receive compliments on how my hair looks.  </li>
            <li> It keeps dry scalp</li>
            <li> This is the only dandruff shampoo that I have found that actually treats my dandruff AND doesn&#x27;t destroy my hair.  </li>
            <li> Maybe this product would work for you, but it&#x27;s something I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again - especially when TGel is about half the price as well</li>
            <li> I find that purifying shampoos or anti-dandruff shampoos like Selsun Blue, Head and Shoulders, or Neutrogena T-Gel are extremely harsh on hair.  </li>
            <li> but no more... the only flakes falling from his head happens in the winter time.</li>
            <li> If you are tired of that chemically processed, over dried, and brittle feeling your current shampoo leaves, then I suggest you try Davines Natural Tech Anti-Dandruff shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Those products often leave my hair feeling chemically processed, over dried, and brittle...not to mention unbelievably unmanageable the next day without using a ton of styling products...  </li>
            <li> The price point is comparable with other high quality products, without being overly expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered from dandruff since I was a little girl.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair that often, usually 1 (maybe 2) times per week.  </li>
            <li> There is no more dandruff and the hair looks shiny and luscious.</li>
            <li> but it was weird that it was in a different package</li>
            <li> My secret...</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this has held back what was a very bad case of dandruff.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but it works.</li>
            <li> I let my hair air-dry, though, and as it&#x27;s drying sometimes I catch a whiff of a sulfur-y, faintly rotten-eggy smell emanating from my head.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> It gave me an immediate improvement in my very bad dandruff.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that clears up my itchy scalp issues instantly.  Definitely worth the money and it lasts ages.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad Amazon is finally selling this shampoo. It&#x27;s the best shampoo for my hair, and I&#x27;d never use any other one. Always take it with me everywhere I go.</li>
            <li> Love their stuff for my curly hair, got this one for my daughter&#x27;s chronic dry flakes, it seems gentler than other dandruff products but for her it did not work well. Less dryness overall, but still many flakes remained.</li>

I will always have this in my cabinet!</li>
            <li> Buy this product it works wonders my son had scalp issues this is the only shampoo treatment line that helped not even what the dermotoligist proscribed works.. Davines is amazing!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me after repeated use. I just moved on to Neutrogena T-Gel, which works great for me. Maybe this product would work for you, but it&#x27;s something I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again - especially when TGel is about half the price as well</li>
            <li> I am a guy, with long hair, and I often receive compliments on how my hair looks.  My secret...I don&#x27;t wash my hair that often, usually 1 (maybe 2) times per week.  I like the weight and texture that the natural oils from your hair and scalp produce which allow for easy styling without having to resort to a ton of products.  With that being said, washing infrequently does leave lot of build up.  I was introduced to the natural tech product line by a friend who works at Tom Brophy salon in Los Angeles and it immediately became my favorite shampoo.  The price point is comparable with other high quality products, without being overly expensive.  It keeps dry scalp and/or flakes under control, and it gives a good deep cleaning removing the build up from the week.  What makes it my favorite is not only the amazing clean feeling you have afterwards, it&#x27;s noticing how gentle the product is on your hair and how natural it feels afterwards.

            <li> This is the only dandruff shampoo that I have found that actually treats my dandruff AND doesn&#x27;t destroy my hair.  I also have colored hair and it doesn&#x27;t affect my color.  Give it a try!!</li>
            <li> Best dandruff/psoriasis shampoo I have ever found</li>
            <li> This shampoo came recommended to me by a salon owner a few years ago, and I&#x27;m so glad I let her sell me on it.  At $20-25 retail, I would not have picked this one up or even known about it.  This is the only shampoo that I have found that has been able to keep my hair hydrated.  I use it every other day, along with a cheap conditioner.  You don&#x27;t have to use much, especially with short hair.  I can usually get around 3 months or more out of a bottle.  I have shopped around at half a dozen salons that carry Davines, as well as on ebay, and I am glad that I found it on Amazon.  By buying 2 or more bottles, I get free shipping, bringing the cost down to $15.99/bottle, which is lower than you can find it anywhere.  I highly recommend this shampoo to anyone with dry hair or scalp.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but it works. I let my hair air-dry, though, and as it&#x27;s drying sometimes I catch a whiff of a sulfur-y, faintly rotten-eggy smell emanating from my head. It&#x27;s the shampoo, I swear.</li>
            <li> The best Anti-dandruff shampoo!</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin and scalp. It gets too itchy during winter season. I ve tried  everything even the prescriptions ones but it did not work. Since then, i tried Davines Anti Dandruff shampoo! man! at long last i have found you! I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo since 2009. Compared to all anti dandruff shampoo in the market, this one works ssso well.   Five star For Davines!</li>
            <li> My dad has always had dandruff, itchy scalp issues.... but no more... the only flakes falling from his head happens in the winter time.</li>
            <li> I have scalp issues and after reading all of the reviews on here I was hopeful that this shampoo would help. This product was also recommended by a friend who has similar scalp issue who said if did wonders for her.&lt;br /&gt;It did not help me AT ALL. In fact, it dried out my scalp even more and made it flakier. I don&#x27;t think it smells very good either. I guess everyone is different but I&#x27;m really disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from dandruff since I was a little girl. I have tried all the available products on the market and they simply did not work. I adamantly bought this product but I am so happy I did. Although it smells like yellow sansung, it works wonders. There is no more dandruff and the hair looks shiny and luscious.</li>
            <li> Quality formula. It gave me an immediate improvement in my very bad dandruff. note, you should either disinfect your brushes and combs, etc or buy new. If you continue to use your old stuff the dandruff will stay. Otherwise, this has held back what was a very bad case of dandruff. I do recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Helps my dandruff almost immediately and even if I don&#x27;t use it consistently it keeps the problem at bay. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> well it control my dandruff for a while it was ok ...</li>
            <li> So I purchased this item for the 3rd time. I&#x27;m not sure if it was even the right stuff. It came in a different bottle that I have never seen Davines use. I can&#x27;t complain because it still worked but it was weird that it was in a different package and it didn&#x27;t smell the same. Didn&#x27;t send back because the product was till useful. I would have liked a heads up if it was a differnt product or if they used a different bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and the gel that works with it! It is amazing and totally cleared my dandriff. Only problem now is trying to find it again....</li>
