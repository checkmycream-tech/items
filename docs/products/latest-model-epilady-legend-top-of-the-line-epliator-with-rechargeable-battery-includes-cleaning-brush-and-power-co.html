    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>So, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>; this epilady is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I am an epilady user for over 15 years and this Epilady Legend is great!</li>
            <li>But it works so beautiful that I did not even realize it was doing its work.</li>
            <li>This product has worked great.</li>
            <li>this epilator is great for travel too.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of removing hair from my legs.</li>
            <li>The product is good but after 30 minutes of using, it stopped working...</li>
            <li>I wish it would pick up the very fine hairs, but I just pluck those.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I got it.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>I agree that you have to go over an area many times before you can get all your hair plucked out.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>although it works OK, and the rechargable option is nice, I have decided to return it to look for another that is made more like my original.</li>
            <li>I have a full sleeve tattoo and think it looks better to not be all hairy and was looking for a way to not have to shave my arms, so, this does the trick.</li>
            <li>And the second time you use it, it&#x27;s much more pleasant.   </li>
            <li>It is very efficient, and it is easy to use, especially with the Perfect Angle Guide that was included.  </li>
            <li>this one is smooth as butter.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER, after you stick to it for a awhile, you really don&#x27;t feel that much (HONESTLY).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I had such a good experiance with my original Epliady Epilator, I decided to purchase this one.</li>
            <li>I have owned an Epliady Epliator for several years now and loved it.  </li>
            <li>but surely my armpits are returning to thier normal color!</li>
            <li>this is the third epilady she has had and is very satisfied with all of them, they do the job.</li>
            <li>This is a great little gadget .</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>&amp; I really don&#x27;t care much about smooth legs these days.</li>
            <li>When I charge it full (overnight), it has more than enough power to finish epilating my whole body, so I never have to lug around my charger when I go on vacation.</li>
            <li>This epilator is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>But the key is to make sure you pull your skin taught--that keeps it from pulling the skin when it tweezes out the hair.  </li>
            <li>After the first time you use it, it gets easier and easier to use.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Epilady!</li>
            <li>This does work, and works pretty well, but, it does hurt.</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s more flat).</li>
            <li>But, if you remember to keep your skin taught and put aloe vera on any red bumps you get, you&#x27;re fine.  </li>
            <li>I had to make several passes with the new one to pull out the same amount of hair that I used to be able to pull with just one or two passes with the original.</li>
            <li>Also, I could never take the Nair creams with me when I travel, but the Epilady is much easier to travel with.      </li>
            <li>really like this epilator.</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s really great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;m new to the whole hair removal methods besides shaving</li>
            <li>still a little too scared to try my legs, but I know after the first time it gets better.</li>
            <li>It works GREAT &amp; then I am not sitting there tweezing for so long, missing stray hairs or paying monthly for waxing.</li>
            <li>I had an older version years ago</li>
            <li>would highly recommend the Legend, and in fact, some of my friends who epilate got one to replace the ones they had.</li>
            <li>highly recommended, just be patient</li>
            <li>I was ready for all the pinching and pulling as it used to be from my old model, but</li>
            <li>It is painless and does not cause as much dryness and rash as my old model used to.  </li>
            <li>It is faster and smoother than my old one, and it never pinches my skin, even not behind the knees.</li>
            <li>Your underarms should be clean (no deodorant, etc) but the area MUST be dry.</li>
            <li>tried some other epilators by other manufacturers that my friends bought, but none of them do as good a job for me as the Legend.</li>
            <li>my wife loves her new epilady legend.  </li>
            <li>For some reason, the way they make the new tweezer holder does not work as well at pulling the hairs out.  </li>
            <li>I got some red bumps after my first use, but those went away after one or two days.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s totally worth it and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Works well, keep the skin tight and dry and maybe a couple of passes are necessary but it does a good job.</li>
            <li>My upper lip is more sensitive, but is less so each time I use the Epilady.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried nearly everything.</li>
            <li>The first time you use the Epilady, it&#x27;s a little intense.  </li>
            <li>While this product works very well on the underarms and bikini area, I find that it takes too long on the legs and does not catch the finer hair.  </li>
            <li>It is not that painful, I actually enjoyed this more than a date I had several weeks ago!</li>
            <li>I tried any angle possible because I read that was an issue, but still it took me awhile to clear the hair.</li>
            <li>I bought an Epilady Legend rechargeable epilator when my old Epilady finally died - after 17 years!</li>
            <li>This one barely grabs my hair.  </li>
            <li>Epilation is fast and as painless as can be expected.</li>
            <li>And the main reason why I like this product so much is that I&#x27;m African Afmerican with really dark underarms from ingrown hairs and such</li>
            <li>Oh and by the way the higher the setting the less</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Waxing was also too expensive.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about upgrading my epilady...</li>
            <li> and I felt it was uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Gives me bumps, leave lots of hair behind, bad quality.</li>
            <li> I did not find that it was at all painful to me to remove the hairs, which is somewhat what I had been concerned about.  </li>

            <li> ingrown hair gets worst when using this.</li>

            <li> Totally painful the first couple times I used this, but after getting used to the pain, I can do it quickly once a week and my legs remain hairless. I wish it would pick up the very fine hairs, but I just pluck those.</li>
            <li> This epilator is exactly what I was looking for.  It is very efficient, and it is easy to use, especially with the Perfect Angle Guide that was included.  The guide aids in finding the correct angle in which to hold the epilator.  I did not find that it was at all painful to me to remove the hairs, which is somewhat what I had been concerned about.  So, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> my wife loves her new epilady legend.  this is the third epilady she has had and is very satisfied with all of them, they do the job.</li>
            <li> I have owned an Epliady Epliator for several years now and loved it.  However, it is getting old and I accidentally broke the on/off switch, so it is now hard to use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since I had such a good experiance with my original Epliady Epilator, I decided to purchase this one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although this one isn&#x27;t bad, it is not nearly as good as the original one I purchased.  The problem is that they changed the housing that holds the 32 tweezers.  For some reason, the way they make the new tweezer holder does not work as well at pulling the hairs out.  I had to make several passes with the new one to pull out the same amount of hair that I used to be able to pull with just one or two passes with the original. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So although it works OK, and the rechargable option is nice, I have decided to return it to look for another that is made more like my original.</li>
            <li> While this product works very well on the underarms and bikini area, I find that it takes too long on the legs and does not catch the finer hair.  I&#x27;m tempted to return the product.</li>
            <li> The first time you use the Epilady, it&#x27;s a little intense.  Especially in you bikini area.  But the key is to make sure you pull your skin taught--that keeps it from pulling the skin when it tweezes out the hair.  After the first time you use it, it gets easier and easier to use.  By the fourth or fifth time, you don&#x27;t feel any discomfort at all.  I got some red bumps after my first use, but those went away after one or two days.  I used to use Nair similar products, but they are expensive, smelly, time consuming, and I have accidentally ruined clothing by staining it with the cream.  The Epilady lasts longer than those creams, takes less time to use, and will pay for itself in less than two months (according to how much I spent on the creams: $5 a bottle, one bottle a week, it was $20-$25 a month).

But, if you remember to keep your skin taught and put aloe vera on any red bumps you get, you&#x27;re fine.  And the second time you use it, it&#x27;s much more pleasant.   I&#x27;m really glad I got it.  I recommend it to anyone who used to shave or use those awful creams.  You&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. I do not have to shave with a razor again. Waxing was also too expensive. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about upgrading my epilady...but no fear; this epilady is wonderful. I was ready for all the pinching and pulling as it used to be from my old model, but noooo....this one is smooth as butter.  It is painless and does not cause as much dryness and rash as my old model used to.  For a minute I thought it was not working! But it works so beautiful that I did not even realize it was doing its work. I am an epilady user for over 15 years and this Epilady Legend is great! I just wish the charger was a little lighter to make it easier during travels.</li>
            <li> This product has worked great. It does a good job of removing hair from my legs. I had an older version years ago and I felt it was uncomfortable to use. I have no discomfort with this model.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought an Epilady Legend rechargeable epilator when my old Epilady finally died - after 17 years! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I really like this epilator. It is faster and smoother than my old one, and it never pinches my skin, even not behind the knees. I use it all over - legs, arms, underarms and even some in the bikini.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I tried some other epilators by other manufacturers that my friends bought, but none of them do as good a job for me as the Legend. The fact that it is rechargeable help a lot. I can use it corded too, when I forget to charge it. this epilator is great for travel too. When I charge it full (overnight), it has more than enough power to finish epilating my whole body, so I never have to lug around my charger when I go on vacation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend the Legend, and in fact, some of my friends who epilate got one to replace the ones they had. Thanks Epilady!</li>
            <li> I agree that you have to go over an area many times before you can get all your hair plucked out. It is not that painful, I actually enjoyed this more than a date I had several weeks ago! seriously!  I tried any angle possible because I read that was an issue, but still it took me awhile to clear the hair. Nevertheless, I am still sold because I don&#x27;t have to shave and it&#x27;s totally worth it and lasts a long time.  sometimes going backwards over a spot helped to get the hair that wouldn&#x27;t catch. highly recommended, just be patient</li>
            <li> This epilady does not work as well as similar products I have owned over the years. This one barely grabs my hair.  It leaves a lot of hairs behind and I always feel like I have a little stubble.</li>
            <li> Gives me bumps, leave lots of hair behind, bad quality. ingrown hair gets worst when using this.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m new to the whole hair removal methods besides shaving and I tried the occasional waxing my armpits. I was extremely scared to try this and after I bought it, I stared at it for days as it sat on my bathroom counter. I finally tried it, and yes it hurts--HOWEVER, after you stick to it for a awhile, you really don&#x27;t feel that much (HONESTLY). I&#x27;ve only tried my armpits...still a little too scared to try my legs, but I know after the first time it gets better. Oh and by the way the higher the setting the less it hurts (at the least for the small test that I tried on my leg).    And the main reason why I like this product so much is that I&#x27;m African Afmerican with really dark underarms from ingrown hairs and such and I&#x27;ve tried nearly everything. I was almost about to give up, until a friend of mine told me that she used one like this. So I gave it a try and slowly but surely my armpits are returning to thier normal color! Yay!!! Plus I have had no problems with it pintching my skin--as long as you hold your skin taut, but still even when I forget to, I&#x27;ve had no problems.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Well made unit.  Meets my expectations. Epilation is fast and as painless as can be expected.</li>
            <li> This is a great little gadget . Did what it is supposed to do .</li>
            <li> Updated:  I don&#x27;t use this on my legs. I do, however, use it on my chin &amp; upper lip (not the brows, people). It works GREAT &amp; then I am not sitting there tweezing for so long, missing stray hairs or paying monthly for waxing. My upper lip is more sensitive, but is less so each time I use the Epilady. Since I initially wrote this review I now use it on my underarms. Your underarms should be clean (no deodorant, etc) but the area MUST be dry. Sometimes I do need to hold the skin taut (so there is no give &amp; it&#x27;s more flat). I tried this on my legs long ago, slightly painful but it worked. You do have to keep at it over time since hair grows in cycles. It was a little time consuming though &amp; I really don&#x27;t care much about smooth legs these days. I I have not shaved my underarms for YEARS now &amp; it&#x27;s really great.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend purchasing this product for (for chin, lip, underarms OR legs).</li>
            <li> The product is good but after 30 minutes of using, it stopped working... This is frustrating because I have to return it (and I am just here in the US for a short vacation)...I hope that I will get the replacement within the week (before my scheduled departure)...</li>
            <li> Works well, keep the skin tight and dry and maybe a couple of passes are necessary but it does a good job.</li>
            <li> This does work, and works pretty well, but, it does hurt. It is also a bit time consuming and leaves your arms red and splotchy from ripping out the hair. I bought this cause I have a full sleeve tattoo and think it looks better to not be all hairy and was looking for a way to not have to shave my arms, so, this does the trick.</li>
