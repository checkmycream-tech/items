            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what they put in this stuff to make it so awesome.</li>
            <li>Gives your nails a nice shine.</li>
            <li>I just do one top coat and wait unit 5-8 minutes to see good results.</li>
            <li>This is a must have if you paint your own nails or use Salon Effects.  </li>
            <li>No chip, great shine, great feel, and fast drying.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s thinking of sneaking in her own bottle of Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>After much research, I found this to be the best one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s best to apply a lot, but not so much that it pools up.  </li>
            <li>The nail polish is the perfect consistency and makes your nails look very shiny.  </li>
            <li>This is absolutely without a doubt the best product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The chipping happens with any kind of nail polish I use too...</li>
            <li>However, it is still the cheapest of the best top coats out there, so I use it consistently.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best top coat on the market!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m super happy with the results</li>
            <li>The smell is very strong though</li>
            <li>Love this top coat !</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased this product because I love doing my nails!</li>
            <li>This is the best top coat high gloss polish I have ever found, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  </li>
            <li>The best high gloss top coat I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best topcoat.</li>
            <li>You could obtain a perfect manicure on a fidgety two year old with this.  </li>
            <li>The top coat is amazing and shiny.</li>
            <li>This top coat is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Very quick drying and lasts for days!</li>
            <li>I have used plenty of top coats and all kinds, this is the best by far!</li>
            <li>This is the best top coat I have ever owned, the smell is kind of bad, but it works great, it was packaged perfectly</li>
            <li>This is clearly the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This one dries VERY fast and gives the polish a very nice shine.</li>
            <li>But It thickened very quickly, the shine it gives is really nice.</li>
            <li>This dries out the nails super fast and my nails look awesome even after I sleep within 15 minutes of applying!</li>
            <li>Looks wonderful and dries super fast.  </li>
            <li>However when this top coat chips, it takes layers of the nail with it.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite is my favorite top coat.</li>
            <li>Mine shipped really fast and came in great condition.</li>
            <li>I applied the top coat and waited approx.</li>
            <li>Love this topcoat.</li>
            <li>I wish they have more color or gel polish.</li>
            <li>LOVE seche vite.</li>
            <li>I love this topcoat and take it with me to the nail salon.</li>
            <li>They were OKAY, but not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would give this top coat six stars if that was an option. :)</li>
            <li>It works with every brand of polish I have used, no matter how many coats I have applied.  </li>
            <li>top coat has changed my life.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely the best top coat out there.</li>
            <li>For a top coat, i.e. the most used bottle in your arsenal of polish &amp; nail accessories, the price just can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>A friend from school introduced me to this top coat</li>
            <li>Over and over again, I always noticed that my favorite beauty channels used this stuff.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>More shine than with color</li>
            <li>Give it a try, I&#x27;m sure you will like it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Seche Vite top coat.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the shine and</li>
            <li>Take this to your manicurist and make sure</li>
            <li>I love this top coat</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why so many people love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>In addition, I did not even find it to be as shiny as my Essie top coat.  </li>
            <li>Great for the price and was shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I would manicure my nails and then use this as the top coat before I went to bed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like night and day to have this top coat on your nails or not.  </li>
            <li>Ok..this is the MUST HAVE top coat.</li>
            <li>Simply put, this is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>most people gave it 5 stars, perhaps this indicates that my painted nails aren&#x27;t destined to be chip-free.</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>most folks believing that I must have gel nails.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li>I used to love painting my nails</li>
            <li>I wish I could combine the quick-drying time of the Seche with the more liquidy formula of the OTD.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Great for a quick shine-refresher if it&#x27;s not quite time for full manicure.</li>
            <li>It really seals in nail polish and leaves it looking very nice and shiny.</li>
            <li>It provides a great shine that covers most imperfections, and acts as a great shield so you spend less time reapplying nail polish.</li>
            <li>I got some Seche Vite the next day, and was able to smooth out 90% of the marks so my nails look nearly flawless again!</li>
            <li>It makes nails looks so pretty, even if there are imperfections in your main polish, Seche Vite smooths it out and makes it look shiny and great!</li>
            <li>The price was even great compared to in the stores where I live</li>
            <li>It really is amazing how quick this product works.</li>
            <li>It dries so quickly and leaves nails shiny :) love love love</li>
            <li>This is super durable, beautifully glossy and dries way fast.</li>
            <li>I love this top coat bcus it leaves a good shine on my nails &amp; it drys the nail polish pretty quick</li>
            <li>I like it best on my daughter nails because she is rough and tumble, with her dress and sandals even.</li>
            <li>If you want longer, I&#x27;d recommend a gel polish system (I have that too, but enjoy changing my polish more often).  </li>
            <li>This top coat is beyond fantastic.</li>
            <li>Not only does it make your nails incredibly shiny, it helps with chipping.</li>
            <li>a product that allows me to quickly go on with my day right after doing my nails and not have them smudge!!!</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a great top coat after reading several reviews; which it is.</li>
            <li>I use this all the time and was able to get it here cheaper than retail but same great</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell, but it works wonders.  </li>
            <li>i love it, it dries quite fast, leaves your nails looking nice and glossy, easy to peel off so</li>
            <li>however it has a strong smell.</li>
            <li>It dries very fast and gives your nails a nice shine.</li>
            <li>This top coat definitely dries very quickly, but it lacks in good top coat durability.</li>
            <li>Since the first time, I bought many more.</li>
            <li>I do my nails myself and this one works just fine.</li>
            <li>Either one is fine for me.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick on it though:)</li>
            <li>Fulfilled and shipped my order quickly!</li>
            <li>However, once it&#x27;s on, my nails stay super shiny!</li>
            <li>It allows you (and me) to quickly apply three coats of polish, top with Seche Vite and go on with life.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOOOOOVE this top coat!</li>
            <li>I just bought a 4 oz refill bottle since I love this stuff SO much!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m talking huge chunks.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of this polish and have used it for years.</li>
            <li>It is a great product and make my nail poslish last.</li>
            <li>Stop wasting your money on off brands or over priced top coats that do not keep your polish fresh.</li>
            <li>I have tried over 10 different brands of top coat and this is by far the best I have used.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, packaged well, works amazingly.</li>
            <li>My nails are smooth and shiny without finger imprints on them.</li>
            <li>This top coat is worth the money since it works so well</li>
            <li>This one though is fast drying and covers any imperfection, so it&#x27;s nice when you are in a rush.</li>
            <li>very glossy coat, and only $5 - great value!</li>
            <li>I always paint my nails myself and most of the time, after only a day or two, I start getting chips in even really good polishes.</li>
            <li>the best thing about this is that it really does dry your nails in 5 minutes.. without being tacky feeling or easily blemished.  </li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY, hands down, the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever, ever used.  </li>
            <li>Ive never spent more than $3 for a polish of any kind.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice high gloss shine.</li>
            <li>It drys your manicure super fast &amp; leaves a nice shine that lasts for days.</li>
            <li>Simply amazed and super happy.</li>
            <li>My first trial run with this top coat was over three coats of OPI.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff so much!</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and has a very nice shine when dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best top coat in the game in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This product is not only cheap, but works really good.</li>
            <li>I am not hard on my nails and an at-home manicure easily lasts me 5 or more days without touchups.</li>
            <li>This Seche Vite Fast Dry Top Coat is great.  </li>
            <li>The Seche Vite  fast dry top coat is a great product for extending the life of a manicure.</li>
            <li>Then, three days after, brush on another coat, paying special attention to edges and corners of the nails.</li>
            <li>The price is right if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m super excited to try it.</li>
            <li>I will definitely repurchase, specially considering the good price.</li>
            <li>Thanks I will be buying again. :)</li>
            <li>I really like the top coat.</li>
            <li>I really do wish I had bought this top coat sooner.</li>
            <li>But my nails chip within a day, and this top coat makes them smell absolutely horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it seals it to a very shiny appearance that lasts for a week or more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and very much worth the money.  </li>
            <li>But it glides on my nails easily and dries VERY fast.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m pretty sure this will be your new favorite.</li>
            <li>This fast dying top cost dries quickly.</li>
            <li>If you want something that goes on easily, dries quickly and finishes off your manicure with a nice shine, look no further!</li>
            <li>The problem is that the bottle thickens quickly.</li>
            <li>it dries your nail polish really quickly</li>
            <li>It dries SO quickly,</li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands of top coat</li>
            <li>I use it all the time, quick drying and almost fool proof.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, and it works better than the clear coats in the store.</li>
            <li>It is also super glossy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super glossy looking to.</li>
            <li>Also, use this product quickly, or within a couple of months.</li>
            <li>Aside from its super toxic ingredients</li>
            <li>I am lucky if I can go one day</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal fan for 15+ years.  </li>
            <li>This does dry your nails very fast, which is great.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this top coat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products and this by far is the best topcoat that I have used.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good top coat, it really is dry and not surface dry.</li>
            <li>This is the quick dry top coat that I have used for a long time, and my nails always look good because they are sealed without any smudges!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s half the price compared to retail stores, so I was happy to hit the place order</li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;m usually not one to write reviews, but I felt the need to do it this time.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t look any further for a top coat!</li>
            <li>Still weary, I left my nails under the fan for a couple more minutes and they were done!</li>
            <li>The Sally Hansen top coat usually keeps my nail polish looking great for 4-5 days and dries decently fast.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
            <li>The only thing I dont like is after 4-5 days its easy to peel off the top coat.</li>
            <li>Like many women reviewing this product, I had searched tirelessly for a top coat that would prevent chipping and dry in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li>Awesome shiny topcoat which causes polish to dry quickly to touch, and protect finish from minor bumps while drying.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite applies smoothly and dries incredibly fast.  </li>
            <li>I change my nail polish frequently because I love to do nail art.</li>
            <li>I polish my nails every week, sometimes more frequently, so use this a lot.</li>
            <li>I can go about my day and have freshly painted nails.</li>
            <li>+ times daily, have to for work), but overall, it&#x27;s a good top coat.  </li>
            <li>It keeps your polish fresh and the staying power is remarkable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well the chipping occurred, like most top coats after the second or third day (I am now convinced my nail beds are at odds with top coats).</li>
            <li>I rarely did my nails until I found this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This dries pretty quickly which is great for me since I&#x27;m really impatient.</li>
            <li>Still waiting for it to pass the chip test, as it has only been 24 hrs since I first applied it, but I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;ll get another couple of days out of it!</li>
            <li>this product for yourself,  you&#x27;ll see that its superior to any other topcoat on the market.</li>
            <li>I heard about this fast dry top coat from a person in London who said this is all they use as a Top Coat.</li>
            <li>Then using one of the same polishes as before (that had chipped), instead of just a clear coat on top, I used this Seche Vite and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Not only does it dry quickly, the end result is a beautiful shiny finish.</li>
            <li>It seals my colored polish in nicely and makes my nails dry super fast!</li>
            <li>Well worth the higher price.</li>
            <li>Seche dries them super fast</li>
            <li>If it changes texture, supposedly you can buy another seche vite product (&amp;#34;restore&amp;#34;) to get it back to the original (smoother and easy to use) consistency.</li>
            <li>I wasnt always successful), then do the design the following day and either stick my hands in the freezer for a few minutes or wait two hours before touching anything.</li>
            <li>I use this over OP1 base and OP1 color polish and it lasts a full week, sometimes more if I don&#x27;t garden :)  Great high gloss finish and</li>
            <li>Works great and dries quickly and creates a very hard nail.</li>
            <li>But the second time I used it, I had a better experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Two things: dries fast and makes your nails shine a lot!</li>
            <li>It serves as a great polish protector since it&#x27;s so thick.</li>
            <li>This stuff does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>Did some research and got my wife this along with some nail polishes as a gift and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many nail products, and this one definitely lives up to the hype!</li>
            <li>I most recently attempted NailTek&#x27;s Ceramnic Glaze topcoat, and while I like the shine</li>
            <li>I will never use a different top coat after discovering Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>and I used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>There are many products out there that work just as we&#x27;ll without the problems in the future.</li>
            <li>This will be the only top coat I buy from now on.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much cheaper!</li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;m pretty picky about my nails).</li>
            <li>I love this product I&#x27;ll be purchasing my second bottle very soon!</li>
            <li>although I will say, I definitely wait a couple of hours after my nail polish has fully cured (I use the OPI drying drops) to put on this top coat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found great reviews for this because three full days later my dark red polish looks as immaculate as it did on day one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years, but this is the first time I ordered from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>the product: let&#x27;s just say that I don&#x27;t do my nails without this stuff, as I&#x27;m able to paint them with polish, apply one coat of Seche Vite, then 3 minutes later</li>
            <li>That said, if you don&#x27;t like the thick formula, the Insta-Dri is a great option.</li>
            <li>the only top coat I will use.</li>
            <li>makes my manicure last a week and some change :)</li>
            <li>I have tried multiple polishes and top coats.</li>
            <li>Drys REALLY fast and doesn&#x27;t smudge nail art!</li>
            <li>I can do my own nails again without worrying about messing them up, because they&#x27;re dry so fast</li>
            <li>I often use something like Hard as Nails as a top coat, but now that I do more nail art, I wanted to save some time with the drying process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fabulous product, worth the price, would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>The most amazing part is that it dry super fast less than 10 min.</li>
            <li>really prefer Sally Hansen&#x27;s Insta-Dry Anti-Chip top coat (the one in the red bottle)</li>
            <li>My manicure started chipping so much faster than it does with my Essie top coat (started chipping on the second day).  </li>
            <li>and I tell all of my family and friends, \\&quot;Use any old cheap polish or acrylic paint you want to do your nail design, BUT always finish it with a layer of Seche Vite Fast Dry Top Coat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rough on my nails (CrossFit, dishes, using them as tools), but this top coat really does keep my polish looking fresh for longer.  </li>
            <li>This product really does what it says - it dries FAST!</li>
            <li>For example, last night I used this to top an Essie polish (we all know how high quality that polish is).  </li>
            <li>5 minutes before touching it and to my surprise it was completely dry.</li>
            <li>One example is CND air dry top coat.</li>
            <li>it is so viscous, Seche takes a couple more minutes to dry to a *truly hardened finish.  </li>
            <li>My manicures last an easy 10 to 14 days.  </li>
            <li>I have gone through every fast dry top coat there is, and none of them were *</li>
            <li>but no one can compare with Seche Vite&#x27;s Fast Dry Top Coat.  </li>
            <li>FYI, I don&#x27;t see the difference between this one and the essie&#x27;s fast dry top coat.</li>
            <li>this fast dry top coat is a lifesaver and has saved many a mani/pedi because of how fast it dries and it keeps the nail polish on for a long time!!!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it to buy from Amazon too - much lower prices than local drug stores and reasonably fast, free shipping offers!</li>
            <li>I have tried top coats - Sally Hansen instadry, out the door, and other fast dry top coats-</li>
            <li>heard so much about this, so I decided to buy it.</li>
            <li>Plus it dries fast.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It dries your polish fast and leaves it looking shiny.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what I have done all these years without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves your nails very shiny as well.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the product arrived on time.</li>
            <li>Feels like a gel manicure, but it goes on so much easier</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t help much protecting the nail polish.</li>
            <li>and then i&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li>(Maybe 3-5 minutes to REALLY cure.)  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Dries really fast and creates a coating that makes my nail polish really stay on.</li>
            <li>This dries my nails incredibly fast.</li>
            <li>It really dries within mins maybe even secs(too</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d smudge a nail and be very upset.</li>
            <li>I would buy it again though just b/c it dries so fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>Dries fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even bought my sister and a few friends a bottle of their own and they swear by it too.</li>
            <li>With time though, it will get gooey like other nail polishes so make sure to use it all up as soon as you can.</li>
            <li>This product gives a quality finish that lasts unlike the other top reviewed products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve been trying to do my nails at home to save money, but I never was able to get my nails to dry completely, unless I sat and touched nothing for hours!</li>
            <li>I have tried one other quick dry product, by Relvon and that seemed to work at first, but the polish can still get dented or smeared, it just needed more pressure to do so.</li>
            <li>Not only were they dry, but they have a really nice glossy finish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made my home manicures a lot more convenient and a whole lot less time consuming.</li>
            <li>Usually dry within 5 minutes and leaves your nails super shiny!</li>
            <li>and I usually just do my own nails at home</li>
            <li>Get yourself a bottle of Seche Vite!!!&lt;br /&gt;Seche Vite WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN :)</li>
            <li>A few times I&#x27;ve reapplied the top coat two or three days after I do my nails and it will peel off in large chunks.</li>
            <li>yes even though it works very well you still new to read the label.</li>
            <li>After purchasing it at Target and really liking it, I was so happy to get it for less than half the price</li>
            <li>Instead of saving me time with drying, I typically spend MORE time on my nails because of all the touch-ups.</li>
            <li>Previously I used the Sally Hansen Insta-Dri Anti-Chip Top Coat, which I found dries faster</li>
            <li>Keeps my nails looking decent for over a week</li>
            <li>Its the only top coat that will make my manicure last.</li>
            <li>This top coat is long lasting and makes my nails very shiny.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I use only this brand of fast dry top coat.</li>
            <li>It is decently priced (compared to other ones out there) and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>and it makes the polish dry fast enough that I have time to do my nails more often since I don&#x27;t have to wait forever for drying.</li>
            <li>So is much longer than other top coat that barely make it 24 hours.</li>
            <li>I only get my nails done professionally for special occasions</li>
            <li>Almost like it was normal tip wear.</li>
            <li>Definitely well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I have heard that this can be battled by applying a top coat almost everyday.</li>
            <li>I like to run my own personal tests whenever possible, especially regarding beauty products.  </li>
            <li>Also, I found that my polish would chip way sooner than normal</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time last night and it really does work as you would expect it too.</li>
            <li>The coat is kind of thick</li>
            <li>I mean I feel like I could get high off this stuff, obviously there is something in it that makes it so good, but I highly suggest to every woman out there!</li>
            <li>so when i actually get a chance to paint my nails being able to sit around waiting for them to dry just isnt happening.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended quick dry</li>
            <li>Do not be leisurely when you apply this..........have to be quick due to the thickness and fast drying.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>It really dries super fast and goes on really smoothly, not goopy and no streaks.</li>
            <li>I actually bought a UV light (different brand) and both my toes and nails look like they are always manicured.  </li>
            <li>and it does dry quickly.  </li>
            <li>The scent is a bit strong but it doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different topcoats, from Wet N Wild, Rimmel, Sally Hansen, OPI and Barielle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will never go back to any other top coat.  </li>
            <li>It actually does what it claims to do - it dries fast!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell didn&#x27;t bother me and the polish dried so very quickly.</li>
            <li>only issue with Seche Vite is that it does contain Toluene, so it smells more like paint thinner than typical nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a top coat that dries fast, but also works extremely well in the long run of your manicure.  </li>
            <li>Hard As Nails Top Coat.</li>
            <li>This stuff is far better than GEL nails, it&#x27;s incredibly hard, shiny and they carry additional products that I like.  </li>
            <li>I no longer have to plan to paint my nails at night and clear my schedule of everything to do so.  </li>
            <li>It clearly states that this product can cause birth defects.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 42 years old with the patience level of a 5 year old.</li>
            <li>People always ask me if I got my nail done professionally.</li>
            <li>w/out using the fan) almost completely within 5 mins.</li>
            <li>It makes the polish last much longer.</li>
            <li>Personally, I will probably never try another fast drying topcoat again because there&#x27;s no need!&lt;br</li>
            <li>:) I can go at LEAST three weeks without repainting my toenails, and I know (tested it)</li>
            <li>Even when you use it over nail art or make a tiny mistake it makes your nails look really shiny.  </li>
            <li>I am frequently complemented on my manicures.  </li>
            <li>This product suppose to protect my nails but the sender sent me damaged product that was old</li>
            <li>I use to wreck my nails before they were completely dry...not anymore.</li>
            <li>So far I am on day 5 and not one chip, not one smudge.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>The few times I wait longer, this top coat makes my manicure last.</li>
            <li>I was not satisfied with this brand as a top coat, or by itself on bare nails.</li>
            <li>and she hates the top coat the school uses because it dries too slowly.</li>
            <li>It does dry very fast and it helps a lot with chips, etc.  </li>
            <li>I no longer have an excuse not to paint my nails on a regular basis because after applying this top coat my nails were dry in about four minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is thick but drys pretty darn quick.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li>And boy does this stuff really dry fast!</li>
            <li>Works for me since I live a fast life and don&#x27;t have time to waiting around for nails to dry.</li>
            <li>I would typically use OPI&#x27;s top coat and would end up smudging my nails or waiting forever for them to dry.</li>
            <li>It definitely does what I was expecting (no more weird patterns from the sheets after going to sleep with &#x27;dry&#x27; nails), but I found that my polish chips much more easily with this top coat.</li>
            <li>I only did 1 layer of Seche Vite and then kept my hands under a mini fan to dry (no UV light or anything, just a personal fan).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the past I&#x27;ve always had problems with my manicures - at home or at the salon - lasting more than 24 hrs.</li>
            <li>I usually put more coats on my nails mid week as needed.</li>
            <li>It dries super fast and keeps your manicure shiny and without chips for at least 5 to 6 days.(mind</li>
            <li>It dries fast and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>The very first time I used this, I was already prepared for the shrinkage, bit since I use sinful colors, I only saw minimal shrinkage.</li>
            <li>Normally my polish wouldn&#x27;t last one day.</li>
            <li>I can now give myself a full manicure in less than 10 minutes!  </li>
            <li>Besides, this product is so much cheaper than any other &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; top coat that it doesn&#x27;t enrage me if it gets too thick.</li>
            <li>The dry time is so unbelievably fast.  </li>
            <li>It makes your polish dry SO fast and your polish set as if you got it done at a salon.</li>
            <li>and it really does dry in about one minute.</li>
            <li>I really love this product because you apply it over wet nail polish and it drys in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li>It dries in just a few seconds, goes on really smoothly, and makes nails last for days.  </li>
            <li>It does dry very fast, which is definitely a plus!</li>
            <li>what product others&#x27; are using, but I found this Seche Vite to be majorly subpar to others I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>That said, once it dries, the finish is like no other.  </li>
            <li>It dries fast, very shiny, but my con to this is that it does shrink up a bit once dry, like other reviewers have mentioned...</li>
            <li>product is a staple in my regular pedicures and semi-regular manicures (natural nails).</li>
            <li>It was much faster drying than I had expected.  </li>
            <li>(Between working in retail and doing dishes, my polish rarely lasts a few days, regardless of the brand).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this cannot be much worse than doing that.</li>
            <li>It can be a little hard to find, but so glad to see it here!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick, it dries quickly, and provides an extra wear to my normal over-the-counter nail polish.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong but that is the only negative thing about it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>From there, I do believe I will need to re-apply a fresh coat (every other day, or every second day) until I redo my nails entirely.</li>
            <li>Even when I would think they were \\&quot;dry enough\\&quot; to start doing normal stuff</li>
            <li>Like all the other reviews state, this product really does work.</li>
            <li>After using my fan for about 2-3 mins per hand, the new topcoat was 90% dry!</li>
            <li>My nail polish just peels right of my nail like if it was tape on my nail :/</li>
            <li>my nails were completely do-anything dry.</li>
            <li>Dries in 5-10 minutes and my nails are super shiny and chip-free for at least a week.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a must have if you paint your own nails or use Salon Effects.  </li>
            <li> No chip, great shine, great feel, and fast drying.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s thinking of sneaking in her own bottle of Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> After much research, I found this to be the best one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s best to apply a lot, but not so much that it pools up.  </li>
            <li> The nail polish is the perfect consistency and makes your nails look very shiny.  </li>
            <li> This is absolutely without a doubt the best product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The chipping happens with any kind of nail polish I use too...</li>
            <li> However, it is still the cheapest of the best top coats out there, so I use it consistently.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best top coat on the market!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m super happy with the results</li>

            <li> The top coat is amazing and shiny.</li>
            <li> This top coat is amazing.  </li>

            <li> This is clearly the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This one dries VERY fast and gives the polish a very nice shine.</li>
            <li> But It thickened very quickly, the shine it gives is really nice.</li>
            <li> This dries out the nails super fast and my nails look awesome even after I sleep within 15 minutes of applying!</li>
            <li> Looks wonderful and dries super fast.  </li>
            <li> However when this top coat chips, it takes layers of the nail with it.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is my favorite top coat.</li>
            <li> Mine shipped really fast and came in great condition.</li>
            <li> I applied the top coat and waited approx.</li>
            <li> Love this topcoat.</li>
            <li> I wish they have more color or gel polish.</li>
            <li> LOVE seche vite.</li>
            <li> I love this topcoat and take it with me to the nail salon.</li>
            <li> They were OKAY, but not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would give this top coat six stars if that was an option. :)</li>
            <li> It works with every brand of polish I have used, no matter how many coats I have applied.  </li>
            <li> top coat has changed my life.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely the best top coat out there.</li>
            <li> For a top coat, i.e. the most used bottle in your arsenal of polish &amp; nail accessories, the price just can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> A friend from school introduced me to this top coat</li>
            <li> Over and over again, I always noticed that my favorite beauty channels used this stuff.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> More shine than with color</li>
            <li> Give it a try, I&#x27;m sure you will like it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Seche Vite top coat.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the shine and</li>
            <li> Take this to your manicurist and make sure</li>
            <li> I love this top coat</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why so many people love this nail polish.</li>
            <li> In addition, I did not even find it to be as shiny as my Essie top coat.  </li>
            <li> Great for the price and was shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I would manicure my nails and then use this as the top coat before I went to bed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like night and day to have this top coat on your nails or not.  </li>
            <li> Ok..this is the MUST HAVE top coat.</li>
            <li> Simply put, this is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> most people gave it 5 stars, perhaps this indicates that my painted nails aren&#x27;t destined to be chip-free.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.</li>
            <li> most folks believing that I must have gel nails.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li> I used to love painting my nails</li>
            <li> I wish I could combine the quick-drying time of the Seche with the more liquidy formula of the OTD.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Great for a quick shine-refresher if it&#x27;s not quite time for full manicure.</li>
            <li> It really seals in nail polish and leaves it looking very nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> It provides a great shine that covers most imperfections, and acts as a great shield so you spend less time reapplying nail polish.</li>
            <li> I got some Seche Vite the next day, and was able to smooth out 90% of the marks so my nails look nearly flawless again!</li>
            <li> It makes nails looks so pretty, even if there are imperfections in your main polish, Seche Vite smooths it out and makes it look shiny and great!</li>
            <li> The price was even great compared to in the stores where I live</li>
            <li> It really is amazing how quick this product works.</li>
            <li> It dries so quickly and leaves nails shiny :) love love love</li>
            <li> This is super durable, beautifully glossy and dries way fast.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat bcus it leaves a good shine on my nails &amp; it drys the nail polish pretty quick</li>
            <li> I like it best on my daughter nails because she is rough and tumble, with her dress and sandals even.</li>
            <li> If you want longer, I&#x27;d recommend a gel polish system (I have that too, but enjoy changing my polish more often).  </li>
            <li> This top coat is beyond fantastic.</li>
            <li> Not only does it make your nails incredibly shiny, it helps with chipping.</li>
            <li> a product that allows me to quickly go on with my day right after doing my nails and not have them smudge!!!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great top coat after reading several reviews; which it is.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time and was able to get it here cheaper than retail but same great</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell, but it works wonders.  </li>
            <li> i love it, it dries quite fast, leaves your nails looking nice and glossy, easy to peel off so</li>
            <li> however it has a strong smell.</li>
            <li> It dries very fast and gives your nails a nice shine.</li>
            <li> This top coat definitely dries very quickly, but it lacks in good top coat durability.</li>
            <li> Since the first time, I bought many more.</li>
            <li> I do my nails myself and this one works just fine.</li>
            <li> Either one is fine for me.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick on it though:)</li>
            <li> Fulfilled and shipped my order quickly!</li>
            <li> However, once it&#x27;s on, my nails stay super shiny!</li>
            <li> It allows you (and me) to quickly apply three coats of polish, top with Seche Vite and go on with life.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOOOOOVE this top coat!</li>
            <li> I just bought a 4 oz refill bottle since I love this stuff SO much!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking huge chunks.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of this polish and have used it for years.</li>
            <li> It is a great product and make my nail poslish last.</li>
            <li> Stop wasting your money on off brands or over priced top coats that do not keep your polish fresh.</li>
            <li> I have tried over 10 different brands of top coat and this is by far the best I have used.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, packaged well, works amazingly.</li>
            <li> My nails are smooth and shiny without finger imprints on them.</li>
            <li> This top coat is worth the money since it works so well</li>
            <li> This one though is fast drying and covers any imperfection, so it&#x27;s nice when you are in a rush.</li>
            <li> very glossy coat, and only $5 - great value!</li>
            <li> I always paint my nails myself and most of the time, after only a day or two, I start getting chips in even really good polishes.</li>
            <li> the best thing about this is that it really does dry your nails in 5 minutes.. without being tacky feeling or easily blemished.  </li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY, hands down, the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever, ever used.  </li>
            <li> Ive never spent more than $3 for a polish of any kind.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice high gloss shine.</li>
            <li> It drys your manicure super fast &amp; leaves a nice shine that lasts for days.</li>
            <li> Simply amazed and super happy.</li>
            <li> My first trial run with this top coat was over three coats of OPI.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff so much!</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and has a very nice shine when dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best top coat in the game in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This product is not only cheap, but works really good.</li>
            <li> I am not hard on my nails and an at-home manicure easily lasts me 5 or more days without touchups.</li>
            <li> This Seche Vite Fast Dry Top Coat is great.  </li>
            <li> The Seche Vite  fast dry top coat is a great product for extending the life of a manicure.</li>
            <li> Then, three days after, brush on another coat, paying special attention to edges and corners of the nails.</li>
            <li> The price is right if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m super excited to try it.</li>
            <li> I will definitely repurchase, specially considering the good price.</li>
            <li> Thanks I will be buying again. :)</li>
            <li> I really like the top coat.</li>
            <li> I really do wish I had bought this top coat sooner.</li>
            <li> But my nails chip within a day, and this top coat makes them smell absolutely horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it seals it to a very shiny appearance that lasts for a week or more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and very much worth the money.  </li>
            <li> But it glides on my nails easily and dries VERY fast.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m pretty sure this will be your new favorite.</li>
            <li> This fast dying top cost dries quickly.</li>
            <li> If you want something that goes on easily, dries quickly and finishes off your manicure with a nice shine, look no further!</li>
            <li> The problem is that the bottle thickens quickly.</li>
            <li> it dries your nail polish really quickly</li>
            <li> It dries SO quickly,</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands of top coat</li>
            <li> I use it all the time, quick drying and almost fool proof.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, and it works better than the clear coats in the store.</li>
            <li> It is also super glossy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super glossy looking to.</li>
            <li> Also, use this product quickly, or within a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Aside from its super toxic ingredients</li>
            <li> I am lucky if I can go one day</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal fan for 15+ years.  </li>
            <li> This does dry your nails very fast, which is great.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this top coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and this by far is the best topcoat that I have used.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good top coat, it really is dry and not surface dry.</li>
            <li> This is the quick dry top coat that I have used for a long time, and my nails always look good because they are sealed without any smudges!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s half the price compared to retail stores, so I was happy to hit the place order</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m usually not one to write reviews, but I felt the need to do it this time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t look any further for a top coat!</li>
            <li> Still weary, I left my nails under the fan for a couple more minutes and they were done!</li>
            <li> The Sally Hansen top coat usually keeps my nail polish looking great for 4-5 days and dries decently fast.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
            <li> The only thing I dont like is after 4-5 days its easy to peel off the top coat.</li>
            <li> Like many women reviewing this product, I had searched tirelessly for a top coat that would prevent chipping and dry in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Awesome shiny topcoat which causes polish to dry quickly to touch, and protect finish from minor bumps while drying.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite applies smoothly and dries incredibly fast.  </li>
            <li> I change my nail polish frequently because I love to do nail art.</li>
            <li> I polish my nails every week, sometimes more frequently, so use this a lot.</li>
            <li> I can go about my day and have freshly painted nails.</li>
            <li> + times daily, have to for work), but overall, it&#x27;s a good top coat.  </li>
            <li> It keeps your polish fresh and the staying power is remarkable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well the chipping occurred, like most top coats after the second or third day (I am now convinced my nail beds are at odds with top coats).</li>
            <li> I rarely did my nails until I found this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This dries pretty quickly which is great for me since I&#x27;m really impatient.</li>
            <li> Still waiting for it to pass the chip test, as it has only been 24 hrs since I first applied it, but I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;ll get another couple of days out of it!</li>
            <li> this product for yourself,  you&#x27;ll see that its superior to any other topcoat on the market.</li>
            <li> I heard about this fast dry top coat from a person in London who said this is all they use as a Top Coat.</li>
            <li> Then using one of the same polishes as before (that had chipped), instead of just a clear coat on top, I used this Seche Vite and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Not only does it dry quickly, the end result is a beautiful shiny finish.</li>
            <li> It seals my colored polish in nicely and makes my nails dry super fast!</li>
            <li> Well worth the higher price.</li>
            <li> Seche dries them super fast</li>
            <li> If it changes texture, supposedly you can buy another seche vite product (&amp;#34;restore&amp;#34;) to get it back to the original (smoother and easy to use) consistency.</li>
            <li> I wasnt always successful), then do the design the following day and either stick my hands in the freezer for a few minutes or wait two hours before touching anything.</li>
            <li> I use this over OP1 base and OP1 color polish and it lasts a full week, sometimes more if I don&#x27;t garden :)  Great high gloss finish and</li>
            <li> Works great and dries quickly and creates a very hard nail.</li>
            <li> But the second time I used it, I had a better experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Two things: dries fast and makes your nails shine a lot!</li>
            <li> It serves as a great polish protector since it&#x27;s so thick.</li>
            <li> This stuff does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> Did some research and got my wife this along with some nail polishes as a gift and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many nail products, and this one definitely lives up to the hype!</li>
            <li> I most recently attempted NailTek&#x27;s Ceramnic Glaze topcoat, and while I like the shine</li>
            <li> I will never use a different top coat after discovering Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> and I used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li> There are many products out there that work just as we&#x27;ll without the problems in the future.</li>
            <li> This will be the only top coat I buy from now on.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so much cheaper!</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;m pretty picky about my nails).</li>
            <li> I love this product I&#x27;ll be purchasing my second bottle very soon!</li>
            <li> although I will say, I definitely wait a couple of hours after my nail polish has fully cured (I use the OPI drying drops) to put on this top coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found great reviews for this because three full days later my dark red polish looks as immaculate as it did on day one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years, but this is the first time I ordered from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> the product: let&#x27;s just say that I don&#x27;t do my nails without this stuff, as I&#x27;m able to paint them with polish, apply one coat of Seche Vite, then 3 minutes later</li>
            <li> That said, if you don&#x27;t like the thick formula, the Insta-Dri is a great option.</li>
            <li> the only top coat I will use.</li>
            <li> makes my manicure last a week and some change :)</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple polishes and top coats.</li>
            <li> Drys REALLY fast and doesn&#x27;t smudge nail art!</li>
            <li> I can do my own nails again without worrying about messing them up, because they&#x27;re dry so fast</li>
            <li> I often use something like Hard as Nails as a top coat, but now that I do more nail art, I wanted to save some time with the drying process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fabulous product, worth the price, would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> The most amazing part is that it dry super fast less than 10 min.</li>
            <li> really prefer Sally Hansen&#x27;s Insta-Dry Anti-Chip top coat (the one in the red bottle)</li>
            <li> My manicure started chipping so much faster than it does with my Essie top coat (started chipping on the second day).  </li>
            <li> and I tell all of my family and friends, \\&quot;Use any old cheap polish or acrylic paint you want to do your nail design, BUT always finish it with a layer of Seche Vite Fast Dry Top Coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rough on my nails (CrossFit, dishes, using them as tools), but this top coat really does keep my polish looking fresh for longer.  </li>
            <li> This product really does what it says - it dries FAST!</li>
            <li> For example, last night I used this to top an Essie polish (we all know how high quality that polish is).  </li>
            <li> 5 minutes before touching it and to my surprise it was completely dry.</li>
            <li> One example is CND air dry top coat.</li>
            <li> it is so viscous, Seche takes a couple more minutes to dry to a *truly hardened finish.  </li>
            <li> My manicures last an easy 10 to 14 days.  </li>
            <li> I have gone through every fast dry top coat there is, and none of them were *</li>
            <li> but no one can compare with Seche Vite&#x27;s Fast Dry Top Coat.  </li>
            <li> FYI, I don&#x27;t see the difference between this one and the essie&#x27;s fast dry top coat.</li>
            <li> this fast dry top coat is a lifesaver and has saved many a mani/pedi because of how fast it dries and it keeps the nail polish on for a long time!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it to buy from Amazon too - much lower prices than local drug stores and reasonably fast, free shipping offers!</li>
            <li> I have tried top coats - Sally Hansen instadry, out the door, and other fast dry top coats-</li>
            <li> heard so much about this, so I decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> Plus it dries fast.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It dries your polish fast and leaves it looking shiny.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what I have done all these years without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves your nails very shiny as well.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the product arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Feels like a gel manicure, but it goes on so much easier</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t help much protecting the nail polish.</li>
            <li> and then i&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li> (Maybe 3-5 minutes to REALLY cure.)  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Dries really fast and creates a coating that makes my nail polish really stay on.</li>
            <li> This dries my nails incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> It really dries within mins maybe even secs(too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d smudge a nail and be very upset.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again though just b/c it dries so fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> Dries fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even bought my sister and a few friends a bottle of their own and they swear by it too.</li>
            <li> With time though, it will get gooey like other nail polishes so make sure to use it all up as soon as you can.</li>
            <li> This product gives a quality finish that lasts unlike the other top reviewed products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been trying to do my nails at home to save money, but I never was able to get my nails to dry completely, unless I sat and touched nothing for hours!</li>
            <li> I have tried one other quick dry product, by Relvon and that seemed to work at first, but the polish can still get dented or smeared, it just needed more pressure to do so.</li>
            <li> Not only were they dry, but they have a really nice glossy finish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made my home manicures a lot more convenient and a whole lot less time consuming.</li>
            <li> Usually dry within 5 minutes and leaves your nails super shiny!</li>
            <li> and I usually just do my own nails at home</li>
            <li> Get yourself a bottle of Seche Vite!!!&lt;br /&gt;Seche Vite WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN :)</li>
            <li> A few times I&#x27;ve reapplied the top coat two or three days after I do my nails and it will peel off in large chunks.</li>
            <li> yes even though it works very well you still new to read the label.</li>
            <li> After purchasing it at Target and really liking it, I was so happy to get it for less than half the price</li>
            <li> Instead of saving me time with drying, I typically spend MORE time on my nails because of all the touch-ups.</li>
            <li> Previously I used the Sally Hansen Insta-Dri Anti-Chip Top Coat, which I found dries faster</li>
            <li> Keeps my nails looking decent for over a week</li>
            <li> Its the only top coat that will make my manicure last.</li>
            <li> This top coat is long lasting and makes my nails very shiny.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use only this brand of fast dry top coat.</li>
            <li> It is decently priced (compared to other ones out there) and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> and it makes the polish dry fast enough that I have time to do my nails more often since I don&#x27;t have to wait forever for drying.</li>
            <li> So is much longer than other top coat that barely make it 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I only get my nails done professionally for special occasions</li>
            <li> Almost like it was normal tip wear.</li>
            <li> Definitely well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I have heard that this can be battled by applying a top coat almost everyday.</li>
            <li> I like to run my own personal tests whenever possible, especially regarding beauty products.  </li>
            <li> Also, I found that my polish would chip way sooner than normal</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time last night and it really does work as you would expect it too.</li>
            <li> The coat is kind of thick</li>
            <li> I mean I feel like I could get high off this stuff, obviously there is something in it that makes it so good, but I highly suggest to every woman out there!</li>
            <li> so when i actually get a chance to paint my nails being able to sit around waiting for them to dry just isnt happening.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended quick dry</li>
            <li> Do not be leisurely when you apply this..........have to be quick due to the thickness and fast drying.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> It really dries super fast and goes on really smoothly, not goopy and no streaks.</li>
            <li> I actually bought a UV light (different brand) and both my toes and nails look like they are always manicured.  </li>
            <li> and it does dry quickly.  </li>
            <li> The scent is a bit strong but it doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different topcoats, from Wet N Wild, Rimmel, Sally Hansen, OPI and Barielle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will never go back to any other top coat.  </li>
            <li> It actually does what it claims to do - it dries fast!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell didn&#x27;t bother me and the polish dried so very quickly.</li>
            <li> only issue with Seche Vite is that it does contain Toluene, so it smells more like paint thinner than typical nail polish.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a top coat that dries fast, but also works extremely well in the long run of your manicure.  </li>
            <li> Hard As Nails Top Coat.</li>
            <li> This stuff is far better than GEL nails, it&#x27;s incredibly hard, shiny and they carry additional products that I like.  </li>
            <li> I no longer have to plan to paint my nails at night and clear my schedule of everything to do so.  </li>
            <li> It clearly states that this product can cause birth defects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 42 years old with the patience level of a 5 year old.</li>
            <li> People always ask me if I got my nail done professionally.</li>
            <li> w/out using the fan) almost completely within 5 mins.</li>
            <li> It makes the polish last much longer.</li>
            <li> Personally, I will probably never try another fast drying topcoat again because there&#x27;s no need!&lt;br</li>
            <li> :) I can go at LEAST three weeks without repainting my toenails, and I know (tested it)</li>
            <li> Even when you use it over nail art or make a tiny mistake it makes your nails look really shiny.  </li>
            <li> I am frequently complemented on my manicures.  </li>
            <li> This product suppose to protect my nails but the sender sent me damaged product that was old</li>
            <li> I use to wreck my nails before they were completely dry...not anymore.</li>
            <li> So far I am on day 5 and not one chip, not one smudge.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> The few times I wait longer, this top coat makes my manicure last.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with this brand as a top coat, or by itself on bare nails.</li>
            <li> and she hates the top coat the school uses because it dries too slowly.</li>
            <li> It does dry very fast and it helps a lot with chips, etc.  </li>
            <li> I no longer have an excuse not to paint my nails on a regular basis because after applying this top coat my nails were dry in about four minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is thick but drys pretty darn quick.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li> And boy does this stuff really dry fast!</li>
            <li> Works for me since I live a fast life and don&#x27;t have time to waiting around for nails to dry.</li>
            <li> I would typically use OPI&#x27;s top coat and would end up smudging my nails or waiting forever for them to dry.</li>
            <li> It definitely does what I was expecting (no more weird patterns from the sheets after going to sleep with &#x27;dry&#x27; nails), but I found that my polish chips much more easily with this top coat.</li>
            <li> I only did 1 layer of Seche Vite and then kept my hands under a mini fan to dry (no UV light or anything, just a personal fan).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve always had problems with my manicures - at home or at the salon - lasting more than 24 hrs.</li>
            <li> I usually put more coats on my nails mid week as needed.</li>
            <li> It dries super fast and keeps your manicure shiny and without chips for at least 5 to 6 days.(mind</li>
            <li> It dries fast and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> The very first time I used this, I was already prepared for the shrinkage, bit since I use sinful colors, I only saw minimal shrinkage.</li>
            <li> Normally my polish wouldn&#x27;t last one day.</li>
            <li> I can now give myself a full manicure in less than 10 minutes!  </li>
            <li> Besides, this product is so much cheaper than any other &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; top coat that it doesn&#x27;t enrage me if it gets too thick.</li>
            <li> The dry time is so unbelievably fast.  </li>
            <li> It makes your polish dry SO fast and your polish set as if you got it done at a salon.</li>
            <li> and it really does dry in about one minute.</li>
            <li> I really love this product because you apply it over wet nail polish and it drys in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It dries in just a few seconds, goes on really smoothly, and makes nails last for days.  </li>
            <li> It does dry very fast, which is definitely a plus!</li>
            <li> what product others&#x27; are using, but I found this Seche Vite to be majorly subpar to others I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> That said, once it dries, the finish is like no other.  </li>
            <li> It dries fast, very shiny, but my con to this is that it does shrink up a bit once dry, like other reviewers have mentioned...</li>
            <li> product is a staple in my regular pedicures and semi-regular manicures (natural nails).</li>
            <li> It was much faster drying than I had expected.  </li>
            <li> (Between working in retail and doing dishes, my polish rarely lasts a few days, regardless of the brand).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this cannot be much worse than doing that.</li>
            <li> It can be a little hard to find, but so glad to see it here!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, it dries quickly, and provides an extra wear to my normal over-the-counter nail polish.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong but that is the only negative thing about it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> From there, I do believe I will need to re-apply a fresh coat (every other day, or every second day) until I redo my nails entirely.</li>
            <li> Even when I would think they were \\&quot;dry enough\\&quot; to start doing normal stuff</li>
            <li> Like all the other reviews state, this product really does work.</li>
            <li> After using my fan for about 2-3 mins per hand, the new topcoat was 90% dry!</li>
            <li> My nail polish just peels right of my nail like if it was tape on my nail :/</li>
            <li> my nails were completely do-anything dry.</li>
            <li> Dries in 5-10 minutes and my nails are super shiny and chip-free for at least a week.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s harder to remove than other top coats.  </li>
            <li> Another issue is that the liquid becomes thick VERY fast.</li>
            <li> The nails appeared to be dry,  but indents or tiny lines were  left  when i tapped or touched the nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t let the last coat of polish dry when you put the seche vite on it.</li>
            <li> (color I always try to do super thin layers)</li>
            <li> I really have to be tough on my nails to get any chipping in the first few days.</li>
            <li> It drys so fast with a hard glass like finish.</li>
            <li> recommended by a friend, will be using this product for a long time</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that because it is fast dry is that you really only get to use 75% of the bottle, even when I used the seche restore to thin it out.</li>
            <li> Because of this, the Insta-Dri can be applied over the course of a few days to freshen up my mani without looking super thick on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> I recommend the same ventilation you&#x27;d use when applying any other nail polish.</li>
            <li> I have a little fan nail dryer to help, and even though I thought my polish was mostly dry before going to bed the other night, I woke up the next morning only to discover some seriously deep sheet and crease marks all over my nails!</li>
            <li> Mine turned into this thick, hard gel after about 8 months of owning it and as a result, didn&#x27;t spread smoothly onto the nail.</li>
            <li> And not just dry to the touch, like &#x27;so dry you could do a load of laundry</li>
            <li> , it takes FOREVER to dry.</li>
            <li> I even touched up 1 nail today with it, and the nail was dry (</li>
            <li> Seche Vite hand was 100% dry...</li>
            <li> /&gt;And in about 2 mins my nails were dry, meaning, when I tapped nail to nail, there was no stickiness there.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m looking for something to help me dry my nails in a pinch, I&#x27;ll use this</li>
            <li> I apply this over my nail polish which makes it dry faster and smoothest out the surface.</li>
            <li> Within 20 mins they&#x27;re completely dry.</li>
            <li> would ONLY use this polish to dry nail art done midway down my nail.</li>
            <li> Now, they last at least 5-6 days before I get any major chips.</li>
            <li> Dries fast, rock hard, and shiny!</li>
            <li> While you can&#x27;t do something crazy, like digging through your purse, this dries your polish VERY quickly.  </li>
            <li> I can put on three coats of polish and finish it with Seche Vite and everything will be solidly dry in under a minute, even when my polish is still slightly wet.  </li>
            <li> I swear it makes your polish last longer and chip less</li>
            <li> Dry&#x27;s way faster than I expected, one hand dry before started with other.</li>
            <li> just add pure acetone to thin it.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ll definitely get it from Amazon - even with shipping costs, it&#x27;s always at least $3 cheaper than the price at my local beauty supply store!</li>
            <li> I just wish it lasted longer; a bottle will thicken and turn cloudy and unusable only a few months after opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did some reading on the net and discovered a few things.</li>
            <li> The only bad part is that when you do chip the polish it sometimes peals off a HUGE chunk rather than just chipping off a little bit like it normaly would.</li>
            <li> I bought this just to have a spare because my other bottle is running out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t push this to the limit, I give it 30 minutes, but that would be to the detriment of any other polish.  </li>
            <li> I must say I was pretty skeptical when I ordered this product</li>
            <li> It has gotten a lot of hype in YouTube tutorials and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed :)</li>
            <li> First, I went out and found a decent brand of base coat.</li>
            <li> did not dry to a hard finish.  </li>
            <li> I am impatient and don&#x27;t like to wait around for nail polish to dry.</li>
            <li> Your nails are dry in a few minutes</li>
            <li> Stick with the smaller size unless you are a nail junkie because it is thick and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This helped my nail polish look especially shiny and protects them from chipping at least 2-3 days before adding another coat.</li>
            <li> I only used it for about 2 months because it got too thick.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that is tends to get too thick to use-but Seche does make a thinner.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s gets thick after it gets low-</li>
            <li> and I mean DRY as in go do whatever you want dry!</li>
            <li> Half the time I paint my nails, it&#x27;s as I&#x27;m rushing out the door....</li>
            <li> probably less</li>
            <li> Only within the past year have I gotten heavingly involved with polishing my nails, at least once a week, all sorts of designs.</li>
            <li> I have seen a little bit of the shrinking issue that others have mentioned, but I guess it just doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> With the Seche Vite I did coats that were a little thicker than the color</li>
            <li> Seriously I sit around just waiting for my nails to dry</li>
            <li> I found out about Seche Vite when watching a few nail tutorials on YouTube.</li>
            <li> Polish dried in a flash, but by the time I read a book, slept, and took a shower in the morning, I already  had a chipped nail.</li>
            <li> One can apply it to nail color that has not fully dried and</li>
            <li> Read a few reviews and all recommended it so went ahead and bought it.</li>
            <li> I find that my nail polish begins to chip within a few days after application.</li>
            <li> Dry and hard to the touch in minutes!</li>
            <li> This cover protects them so they&#x27;re not easily ruined.</li>
            <li> I mean a hard finish dry.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of having to wait for my polish to dry.</li>
            <li> Literally, a few minutes (I suggest 5) minutes after you put this stuff on you can run your fingers through your hair, touch stuff and your nails will not smudge, it&#x27;s a miracle!</li>
            <li> dries really quickly, usually in just 3-4 minutes.  </li>
            <li> In the past I tried opi</li>
            <li> I will never use this with a simple coat of polish, because your work is undone in mere hours.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews...</li>
            <li> I will keep using Seche Vite when I am in a hurry or when I need to fix any small chips or screw ups, but when I have the time will stick to my Sally Hansens</li>
            <li> Diffidently would recommend!</li>
            <li> I tried Opi, it was horrible and didn&#x27;t dry that fast.</li>
            <li> It dries to a shiny, hard sheen and it lasts without chipping or peeling.  </li>
            <li> Seems to almost drink in the hard to cover glitters.</li>
            <li> It dries my nail polish to the touch within the minute, and dries it rock hard within the hour.</li>
            <li> and no one has had a complaint.</li>
            <li> This stuff costs at least $12 anywhere</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, at least one nail chips within 12 hours of painting.  </li>
            <li> But after you get about halfway through the bottle it gets so thick</li>
            <li> No more fingerprints, bed sheet imprints, or gouge marks in my polish!  </li>
            <li> No more pillow cases in my fingernails!  </li>
            <li> , I just hate how my nailpolish starts peeling in less than a week sometimes even the next day!</li>
            <li> I would typically do the base color 30 mins before going to sleep, then hang my hands over the bed and hope they&#x27;d dry without any sheet marks(which</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is the smell</li>
            <li> Last weekend after waking up with sheet marks, I was SO frustrated that I decided to try Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> But I have found that using a base helps prevent the pealing a lot, so make sure you use a base coat with this product.</li>
            <li> complaint is this stuff smells like paint!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is VERY thick.  </li>
            <li> I did a base coat, dried it under a mini fan, then 2 coats of color, each dried under the fan, and then applied this.</li>
            <li> I would hate doing my nails only to have them ruined 30 minutes after applying or waking up with creases from my sheets.</li>
            <li> anytime I used it, a poor</li>
            <li> It makes my 99c nail polish last a week, when use with nail tech base coat.</li>
            <li> same brand base coat</li>
            <li> The shine is unbelievable!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff dries before I get bored with sitting still.</li>
            <li> This is an expensive product</li>
            <li> Yes it stinks</li>
            <li> I was desperate to find a solution to this problem.</li>
            <li> This polish dries incredibly slowly, smells terrible, and wears off in 2 days.</li>
            <li> I hate how useless my hands are for like an hour after doing my nails.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use it within 6 months you will end up throwing it away because it is impossible to spread on your nails.</li>
            <li> so has a bit of an odor, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> Plus, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, either.</li>
            <li> but I hated the drying part.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m usually not one to write reviews, but I felt the need to do it this time.This top coat is amazing! It dries super fast and keeps your manicure shiny and without chips for at least 5 to 6 days.(mind you, I&#x27;m always doing dishes and working around the house and I&#x27;m not a fan of gloves). Don&#x27;t look any further for a top coat!</li>
            <li> The very first time I used this, I was already prepared for the shrinkage, bit since I use sinful colors, I only saw minimal shrinkage. Almost like it was normal tip wear. However when this top coat chips, it takes layers of the nail with it. I&#x27;m talking huge chunks. But the second time I used it, I had a better experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little tip: don&#x27;t let the last coat of polish dry when you put the seche vite on it.</li>
            <li> This top coat is the BEST. I change my nail polish frequently because I love to do nail art. The few times I wait longer, this top coat makes my manicure last. I post pictures of my nail art designs on my Facebook page and I tell all of my family and friends, \\&quot;Use any old cheap polish or acrylic paint you want to do your nail design, BUT always finish it with a layer of Seche Vite Fast Dry Top Coat. This is super durable, beautifully glossy and dries way fast. I&#x27;m 42 years old with the patience level of a 5 year old. This stuff dries before I get bored with sitting still. It is good stuff so has a bit of an odor, but not too bad. I recommend the same ventilation you&#x27;d use when applying any other nail polish. I just bought a 4 oz refill bottle since I love this stuff SO much!! I HIGHLY recommend this top coat. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat high gloss polish I have ever found, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  I use this over OP1 base and OP1 color polish and it lasts a full week, sometimes more if I don&#x27;t garden :)  Great high gloss finish and the best thing about this is that it really does dry your nails in 5 minutes.. without being tacky feeling or easily blemished.  The best high gloss top coat I have ever used.  I am a huge fan of this polish and have used it for years.</li>
            <li> heard so much about this, so I decided to buy it. it was good, but not as perfect as people made it sound.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best topcoat. It really seals in nail polish and leaves it looking very nice and shiny. Plus it dries fast.</li>
            <li> This item is great keeps your nail polish from coming off and GPS on smooth so u can&#x27;t beat the price with this</li>
            <li> Two things: dries fast and makes your nails shine a lot! This is a must have, especially for women who paint their nails themselves. This cover protects them so they&#x27;re not easily ruined.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is my favorite top coat. It drys so fast with a hard glass like finish. Yes it stinks but most polish does lol. Mine shipped really fast and came in great condition. Thanks I will be buying again. :)</li>
            <li> This product really does what it says - it dries FAST! My first trial run with this top coat was over three coats of OPI. I applied the top coat and waited approx. 5 minutes before touching it and to my surprise it was completely dry. Not only does it dry quickly, the end result is a beautiful shiny finish. If you want something that goes on easily, dries quickly and finishes off your manicure with a nice shine, look no further!</li>
            <li> I will never buy another topcoat. Seche Vite is the best.  The dry time is so unbelievably fast.  And not just dry to the touch, like &#x27;so dry you could do a load of laundry and it wouldn&#x27;t smudge or wrinkle&#x27;. I have seen a little bit of the shrinking issue that others have mentioned, but I guess it just doesn&#x27;t bother me.  Love this topcoat.</li>
            <li> Awesome shiny topcoat which causes polish to dry quickly to touch, and protect finish from minor bumps while drying. Great for a quick shine-refresher if it&#x27;s not quite time for full manicure. Prevents polish from chipping at tips between manicures if reapplied every 2-3 days in between. Well worth the higher price.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I read the reviews and decided to give it a try. I will be a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> So happy with this! Dry&#x27;s way faster than I expected, one hand dry before started with other. Highly recommended quick dry</li>
            <li> Yes, this thing is great. People always ask me if I got my nail done professionally. It leaves your nails looking shiny as shellac. It serves as a great polish protector since it&#x27;s so thick. With time though, it will get gooey like other nail polishes so make sure to use it all up as soon as you can.</li>
            <li> This stuff does exactly what it says.  It dries fast and lasts a long time.  The price is right if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for!</li>
            <li> Did some research and got my wife this along with some nail polishes as a gift and she absolutely loves it! I don&#x27;t see her with her fingers up in the air trying not to touch anything because this top-coat dries nearly instantly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and this by far is the best topcoat that I have used.  I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great top coat after reading several reviews; which it is. But It thickened very quickly, the shine it gives is really nice. I didn&#x27;t notice that it made my polish stay on longer. I only used it for about 2 months because it got too thick. The shipping was quick on it though:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many nail products, and this one definitely lives up to the hype! I&#x27;ve recently started a nail care regimen and my nails have grown to their longest and strongest yet. So as a result I&#x27;ve taken up doing my nails at home again to show them off. In the past I&#x27;ve always had problems with my manicures - at home or at the salon - lasting more than 24 hrs. Well, it&#x27;s been a learning curve figuring out all the tips and tricks and trying some of the newer products on the market to get my manicure to last longer. I most recently attempted NailTek&#x27;s Ceramnic Glaze topcoat, and while I like the shine and it does harden the polish somewhat, it takes FOREVER to dry. I have a little fan nail dryer to help, and even though I thought my polish was mostly dry before going to bed the other night, I woke up the next morning only to discover some seriously deep sheet and crease marks all over my nails! I got some Seche Vite the next day, and was able to smooth out 90% of the marks so my nails look nearly flawless again! And boy does this stuff really dry fast! After using my fan for about 2-3 mins per hand, the new topcoat was 90% dry! I even touched up 1 nail today with it, and the nail was dry (w/out using the fan) almost completely within 5 mins. About 15 mins later, I proceeded to wash dishes for 40 mins and no dings, no chips, no nothing! Truly amazing product. Still waiting for it to pass the chip test, as it has only been 24 hrs since I first applied it, but I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;ll get another couple of days out of it! Definitely worth it to buy from Amazon too - much lower prices than local drug stores and reasonably fast, free shipping offers!</li>
            <li> This is a very good top coat, it really is dry and not surface dry. Definitely well worth it.  I wish they have more color or gel polish.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. This top coat is long lasting and makes my nails very shiny. I&#x27;ve let others use it too and no one has had a complaint. I like it best on my daughter nails because she is rough and tumble, with her dress and sandals even. It keeps her nails nice.</li>
            <li> LOVE seche vite. It is my go-to top coat! It makes your polish dry SO fast and your polish set as if you got it done at a salon. This seller was also great! Fulfilled and shipped my order quickly!</li>
            <li> I love this topcoat and take it with me to the nail salon. It dries your polish fast and leaves it looking shiny. It&#x27;s great to extend a manicure as well.</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell, but it works wonders.  It really dries super fast and goes on really smoothly, not goopy and no streaks.</li>
            <li> I have been a nail polish officionado since I was 12 (I&#x27;m 30).  I have gone through every fast dry top coat there is, and none of them were *that great*.  They were OKAY, but not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This?  This stuff is a miracle in a bottle.  You could obtain a perfect manicure on a fidgety two year old with this.  ABSOLUTELY, hands down, the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever, ever used.  I won&#x27;t ever use another one.  I would give this top coat six stars if that was an option. :)</li>
            <li> Best top coat I&#x27;ve had yet. Some people complain about the tips and sides shrinking, but I&#x27;ve never come across that yet with my use. Usually dry within 5 minutes and leaves your nails super shiny!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine raved about this product and I had to try it to believe it.  Seche Vite applies smoothly and dries incredibly fast.  I can put on three coats of polish and finish it with Seche Vite and everything will be solidly dry in under a minute, even when my polish is still slightly wet.  No more fingerprints, bed sheet imprints, or gouge marks in my polish!  It works with every brand of polish I have used, no matter how many coats I have applied.  It dries to a shiny, hard sheen and it lasts without chipping or peeling.  I have read some reviews that note that Seche Vite makes your polish shrink, but I have never had that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue with Seche Vite is that it does contain Toluene, so it smells more like paint thinner than typical nail polish.  But the smell goes away as soon as it is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This top coat has changed my life.  I no longer have to plan to paint my nails at night and clear my schedule of everything to do so.  I can now give myself a full manicure in less than 10 minutes!  Fabulous product, worth the price, would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I use only this brand of fast dry top coat. I tried Opi, it was horrible and didn&#x27;t dry that fast. This one dries VERY fast and gives the polish a very nice shine. However, the polish doesn&#x27;t last and starts chipping. I have heard that this can be battled by applying a top coat almost everyday. Another issue is that the liquid becomes thick VERY fast. I polish my nails every week, sometimes more frequently, so use this a lot. It does however thicken fast and almost 40% of the bottle goes in waste. This is an expensive product so I wish it lasted longer. However, it is still the cheapest of the best top coats out there, so I use it consistently.</li>
            <li> This product is a staple of my nail collection. I will never use a different top coat after discovering Seche Vite. The only downside is that is tends to get too thick to use-but Seche does make a thinner. Besides, this product is so much cheaper than any other &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; top coat that it doesn&#x27;t enrage me if it gets too thick.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what they put in this stuff to make it so awesome. Literally, a few minutes (I suggest 5) minutes after you put this stuff on you can run your fingers through your hair, touch stuff and your nails will not smudge, it&#x27;s a miracle! I really don&#x27;t know what I have done all these years without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is this stuff smells like paint! I mean I feel like I could get high off this stuff, obviously there is something in it that makes it so good, but I highly suggest to every woman out there!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely the best top coat out there. It is decently priced (compared to other ones out there) and dries very quickly. Gives your nails a nice shine. The coat is kind of thick but it does not bubble or anything. The smell is strong but that is the only negative thing about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I would hate doing my nails only to have them ruined 30 minutes after applying or waking up with creases from my sheets. This dries out the nails super fast and my nails look awesome even after I sleep within 15 minutes of applying!</li>
            <li> Love this top coat ! It&#x27;s the best top coat in the game in my opinion. It drys your manicure super fast &amp; leaves a nice shine that lasts for days. I usually put more coats on my nails mid week as needed. The smell is very strong though but still you won&#x27;t regret buying this !</li>
            <li> This came days before it was supposed to which is always a plus. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet but all of my friends say it&#x27;s the best top coat they&#x27;ve had so I&#x27;m super excited to try it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product works well.</li>
            <li> i love it, it dries quite fast, leaves your nails looking nice and glossy, easy to peel off so don&#x27;t do that lol, i scratch my nails when i&#x27;m nervous.</li>
            <li> Best top coat on the market and it really does dry in about one minute. Leaves your nails very shiny as well.</li>
            <li> Best top coat for the price and it does the job. My nail polish/art lasts me between 3-5 days. So is much longer than other top coat that barely make it 24 hours. A warning though, don&#x27;t over coat it or it will bubble up and eventually fall off. I just do one top coat and wait unit 5-8 minutes to see good results. Since the first time, I bought many more.</li>
            <li> This Seche Vite Fast Dry Top Coat is great.  It does dry very fast and it helps a lot with chips, etc.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Best purchase ever! I already reordered</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I have ever found. I even take it with me to the Salon and have them use it instead of the standard brand that the Salon carries.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a top coat that dries fast, but also works extremely well in the long run of your manicure.  My nails almost looked like they had gels on!  I will definitely repurchase, specially considering the good price.</li>
            <li> If you try to find this stuff at Ulta, prepare to pay over $7 for it.  For a top coat, i.e. the most used bottle in your arsenal of polish &amp; nail accessories, the price just can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Works great and dries quickly and creates a very hard nail. The only thing I dont like is after 4-5 days its easy to peel off the top coat.</li>
            <li> I really like the top coat. It dries very fast and gives your nails a nice shine. The problem is that the bottle thickens quickly. If you don&#x27;t use it within 6 months you will end up throwing it away because it is impossible to spread on your nails.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time and was able to get it here cheaper than retail but same great quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So happy...will order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Causes your nail polish to &amp;#34;shrink&amp;#34; and the tips of your nails lose their color.  Also, it causes you nail polish to chip off in sheets.  The best I&#x27;ve found is Sally Hansen Insta-Dri Top Coat.</li>
            <li> This polish dries incredibly slowly, smells terrible, and wears off in 2 days. I was not satisfied with this brand as a top coat, or by itself on bare nails.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product and the speedy delivery was wonderful!</li>
            <li> A friend from school introduced me to this top coat and I used it for the first time today. I absolutely love it!!!!!!! I no longer have an excuse not to paint my nails on a regular basis because after applying this top coat my nails were dry in about four minutes. I then washed dishes and my nails are still absolutely flawless. I HIGHLY recommend this product. Shipping was fast and the product arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I like to run my own personal tests whenever possible, especially regarding beauty products.  I&#x27;ve tried many different topcoats, from Wet N Wild, Rimmel, Sally Hansen, OPI and Barielle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tested Sech against all of the above mentioned products and recently, I tested  the Sally hansen Acrylic Gel and Seche Vite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results:&lt;br /&gt;The  hand with the Sally Hansen product did not dry to a hard finish.  The nails appeared to be dry,  but indents or tiny lines were  left  when i tapped or touched the nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Seche Vite hand was 100% dry...I mean a hard finish dry.  I tapped the tops of the nails, and no indents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Test this product for yourself,  you&#x27;ll see that its superior to any other topcoat on the market.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple months ago and yes even though it works very well you still new to read the label. It clearly states that this product can cause birth defects. There are many products out there that work just as we&#x27;ll without the problems in the future. One example is CND air dry top coat.</li>
            <li> I use this after I leave the nail salon or if I do my nails at home. It makes the polish last much longer. I work with my hands so I need something durable. The shine is unbelievable!!!</li>
            <li> This top coat is incredible.  Dries in 5-10 minutes and my nails are super shiny and chip-free for at least a week.  This will be the only top coat I buy from now on.  And I&#x27;ll definitely get it from Amazon - even with shipping costs, it&#x27;s always at least $3 cheaper than the price at my local beauty supply store!</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been trying to do my nails at home to save money, but I never was able to get my nails to dry completely, unless I sat and touched nothing for hours! Forget trying to do my nails at night, I always woke up with sheet marks in the morning. I have tried one other quick dry product, by Relvon and that seemed to work at first, but the polish can still get dented or smeared, it just needed more pressure to do so. Also, I found that my polish would chip way sooner than normal anytime I used it, a poor tradeoff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found out about Seche Vite when watching a few nail tutorials on YouTube. Over and over again, I always noticed that my favorite beauty channels used this stuff. Last weekend after waking up with sheet marks, I was SO frustrated that I decided to try Seche Vite. And I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time last night and it really does work as you would expect it too. I did a base coat, dried it under a mini fan, then 2 coats of color, each dried under the fan, and then applied this. With the Seche Vite I did coats that were a little thicker than the color (color I always try to do super thin layers) simply because I didn&#x27;t want any brush marks. I only did 1 layer of Seche Vite and then kept my hands under a mini fan to dry (no UV light or anything, just a personal fan).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in about 2 mins my nails were dry, meaning, when I tapped nail to nail, there was no stickiness there. Still weary, I left my nails under the fan for a couple more minutes and they were done! Not only were they dry, but they have a really nice glossy finish. More shine than with color alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m super happy with the results and I can finally give myself at-home manicures that look just as polished as the salon. Can&#x27;t beat the price either, totally a great value for money! Give it a try, I&#x27;m sure you will like it. Personally, I will probably never try another fast drying topcoat again because there&#x27;s no need!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I LOVE Seche Vite top coat.  It makes nails looks so pretty, even if there are imperfections in your main polish, Seche Vite smooths it out and makes it look shiny and great!</li>
            <li> Best top coat EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is VERY thick.  But it glides on my nails easily and dries VERY fast.  The shine is amazing!  I will never go back to any other top coat.  This is a must have if you paint your own nails or use Salon Effects.  I LOVE the shine and how well it seals!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a coworker; I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked!  I can do my own nails again without worrying about messing them up, because they&#x27;re dry so fast I can&#x27;t make a mistake!</li>
            <li> Best top coat EVER!! Dries fast, rock hard, and shiny! You cannot go wrong with this top coat. Dries my nails in under 5 minutes, and leaves a beautiful protective shine!</li>
            <li> Feels like a gel manicure, but it goes on so much easier and it&#x27;s so much cheaper! I love it!</li>
            <li> I was tired of having to wait for my polish to dry. This fast dying top cost dries quickly. The only bad thing is the smell but if you can tolerate it then this product is great!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It actually does what it claims to do - it dries fast! I don&#x27;t have to take almost 45 mins out of my day to do my nails anymore! It&#x27;s made my home manicures a lot more convenient and a whole lot less time consuming. And it actually makes my color last without chipping! I have an extra bottle already for when I run out of this one.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve found.  I recommend it for anyone who does their nails at home or even for a refresher coat midway through a manicure.</li>
            <li> I heard about this fast dry top coat from a person in London who said this is all they use as a Top Coat. I would typically use OPI&#x27;s top coat and would end up smudging my nails or waiting forever for them to dry. It really is amazing how quick this product works. I would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> This stuff costs at least $12 anywhere I&#x27;ve seen it. After purchasing it at Target and really liking it, I was so happy to get it for less than half the price here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a really great top coat. Keeps my nails looking decent for over a week (and I&#x27;m pretty picky about my nails). Also keeps it from chipping or smudging. I recommend it, although beware that if you use it a lot, the polish in the bottle dries out quicker than I would like.</li>
            <li> I like this topcoat! I am impatient and don&#x27;t like to wait around for nail polish to dry. It dries fast, very shiny, but my con to this is that it does shrink up a bit once dry, like other reviewers have mentioned... If I&#x27;m looking for something to help me dry my nails in a pinch, I&#x27;ll use this but it is not my go to topcoat. It works well enough that I would recommend this to others though!</li>
            <li> I bought this just to have a spare because my other bottle is running out. If you buy this, definitely get the Seche Vite Restore as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product I&#x27;ll be purchasing my second bottle very soon! This product dries the thickest polishes as if they are the thinnest it penetrates within seconds to give your nails a beautiful finish and seal in the color.</li>
            <li> Not just the best fast-drying, but the best of any. Period. Take this to your manicurist and make sure s/he uses it if they don&#x27;t already. Then, three days after, brush on another coat, paying special attention to edges and corners of the nails. Your manicure will last like you won&#x27;t believe.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat it dries your nail polish really quickly and it gives them that glossy look&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> dries really quickly, usually in just 3-4 minutes.  very glossy coat, and only $5 - great value! recommended by a friend, will be using this product for a long time</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading reader recommendations on Amazon. I absolutely LOOOOOVE this top coat! It dries SO quickly, although I will say, I definitely wait a couple of hours after my nail polish has fully cured (I use the OPI drying drops) to put on this top coat. However, once it&#x27;s on, my nails stay super shiny! And boy does this stuff last forever on your nails! Especially on my toes. :) I can go at LEAST three weeks without repainting my toenails, and I know (tested it) it&#x27;s because of this top coat! Can&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands of top coat but no one can compare with Seche Vite&#x27;s Fast Dry Top Coat.  It provides a great shine that covers most imperfections, and acts as a great shield so you spend less time reapplying nail polish.</li>
            <li> I really do wish I had bought this top coat sooner. I always paint my nails myself and most of the time, after only a day or two, I start getting chips in even really good polishes. I&#x27;m so glad I found great reviews for this because three full days later my dark red polish looks as immaculate as it did on day one. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> You MUST try this stuff.  I actually bought a UV light (different brand) and both my toes and nails look like they are always manicured.  This stuff is far better than GEL nails, it&#x27;s incredibly hard, shiny and they carry additional products that I like.  I would recommend this product a million times over!</li>
            <li> This product is not only cheap, but works really good. In the past I tried opi and it didn&#x27;t help much protecting the nail polish. The most amazing part is that it dry super fast less than 10 min. It makes my 99c nail polish last a week, when use with nail tech base coat. I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why so many people love this nail polish. It does dry very fast, which is definitely a plus! But my nails chip within a day, and this top coat makes them smell absolutely horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really prefer Sally Hansen&#x27;s Insta-Dry Anti-Chip top coat (the one in the red bottle) though I just got Out the Door and am giving it a try. The Sally Hansen top coat usually keeps my nail polish looking great for 4-5 days and dries decently fast.</li>
            <li> The best topcoat for covering any glitter polishes..I use it all the time, quick drying and almost fool proof. Seems to almost drink in the hard to cover glitters.</li>
            <li> I am not hard on my nails and an at-home manicure easily lasts me 5 or more days without touchups. I often use something like Hard as Nails as a top coat, but now that I do more nail art, I wanted to save some time with the drying process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell didn&#x27;t bother me and the polish dried so very quickly. Unfortunately, at least one nail chips within 12 hours of painting.  For example, last night I used this to top an Essie polish (we all know how high quality that polish is).  Polish dried in a flash, but by the time I read a book, slept, and took a shower in the morning, I already  had a chipped nail. WHAT?!  I hadn&#x27;t even shown my nails in public, washed a dish or gotten my hands dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would ONLY use this polish to dry nail art done midway down my nail. I will never use this with a simple coat of polish, because your work is undone in mere hours.  Instead of saving me time with drying, I typically spend MORE time on my nails because of all the touch-ups.</li>
            <li> I work at a drs office so I wash my hands a lot. Normally my polish wouldn&#x27;t last one day. Now my polish lasts a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years, but this is the first time I ordered from Amazon.  It&#x27;s half the price compared to retail stores, so I was happy to hit the place order button!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the product: let&#x27;s just say that I don&#x27;t do my nails without this stuff, as I&#x27;m able to paint them with polish, apply one coat of Seche Vite, then 3 minutes later, I&#x27;m good to go! I can go about my day and have freshly painted nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, it dries quickly, and provides an extra wear to my normal over-the-counter nail polish. It doesn&#x27;t prevent chipping, and I get an extra 1-3 days wear (I wash my hands 20+ times daily, have to for work), but overall, it&#x27;s a good top coat.  If you want longer, I&#x27;d recommend a gel polish system (I have that too, but enjoy changing my polish more often).  It&#x27;s cheap, and it works better than the clear coats in the store. I&#x27;d call it a good investment.</li>
            <li> Do I even need to explain why this is so great? The only downfall is that because it is fast dry is that you really only get to use 75% of the bottle, even when I used the seche restore to thin it out. But this Seche Vite is so awesome and amazing it will always be my one and only topcoat!</li>
            <li> Looks wonderful and dries super fast.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s harder to remove than other top coats.  I use acetone to get it off.  Traditional nail polish removers don&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what product others&#x27; are using, but I found this Seche Vite to be majorly subpar to others I&#x27;ve used.  My manicure started chipping so much faster than it does with my Essie top coat (started chipping on the second day).  In addition, I did not even find it to be as shiny as my Essie top coat.  Will not use again.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat ever made. It dries my nail polish to the touch within the minute, and dries it rock hard within the hour. It is also super glossy. I have never had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> The Seche Vite  fast dry top coat is a great product for extending the life of a manicure. One can apply it to nail color that has not fully dried and it seals it to a very shiny appearance that lasts for a week or more.</li>
            <li> Love it love it!!! I have a toddler so when i actually get a chance to paint my nails being able to sit around waiting for them to dry just isnt happening. Seche dries them super fast and then i&#x27;m ready to go. I&#x27;m on my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Read a few reviews and all recommended it so went ahead and bought it. The top coat is amazing and shiny. Great for the price and was shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat bcus it leaves a good shine on my nails &amp; it drys the nail polish pretty quick, I just hate how my nailpolish starts peeling in less than a week sometimes even the next day! My nail polish just peels right of my nail like if it was tape on my nail :/</li>
            <li> This is by far the best top coat on the market! It seals my colored polish in nicely and makes my nails dry super fast! I swear it makes your polish last longer and chip less :) Buy it!!</li>
            <li> It is a great product and make my nail poslish last. I am so glad I purchased this product because I love doing my nails!</li>
            <li> This product works great!!!!! Half the time I paint my nails, it&#x27;s as I&#x27;m rushing out the door.... this fast dry top coat is a lifesaver and has saved many a mani/pedi because of how fast it dries and it keeps the nail polish on for a long time!!! Great find!!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I have ever owned, the smell is kind of bad, but it works great, it was packaged perfectly and I received it in a great amount of time. The price was even great compared to in the stores where I live</li>
            <li> Seriously I sit around just waiting for my nails to dry if I don&#x27;t have this. I hate how useless my hands are for like an hour after doing my nails. With this your nails are good to go in like 10 mins!</li>
            <li> I started using this product years ago as my manicurist used it on my nails.  I bought some for my own use, and it is incredible!  I would manicure my nails and then use this as the top coat before I went to bed. No more pillow cases in my fingernails!  It dries instantly!</li>
            <li> This polish will change your world of painting your nails &amp; the manicure you have.  It&#x27;s like night and day to have this top coat on your nails or not.  I have tried top coats - Sally Hansen instadry, out the door, and other fast dry top coats- NOTHING beats the shine, durability and formula of seche vite.  You owe it to yourself &amp; the time you put into your nails to seal it w/the best there is- give it a try &amp; I&#x27;m pretty sure this will be your new favorite. If it&#x27;s gets thick after it gets low- just add pure acetone to thin it. Still works great!&lt;br /&gt;check out some mani&#x27;s at&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I really love this product because you apply it over wet nail polish and it drys in just a few minutes. It&#x27;s super glossy looking to. The only bad part is that when you do chip the polish it sometimes peals off a HUGE chunk rather than just chipping off a little bit like it normaly would. But I have found that using a base helps prevent the pealing a lot, so make sure you use a base coat with this product. Even with the risk of pealing, I still think it&#x27;s the best top coat I have ever tried and it makes the polish dry fast enough that I have time to do my nails more often since I don&#x27;t have to wait forever for drying.</li>
            <li> Stop wasting your money on off brands or over priced top coats that do not keep your polish fresh. Get yourself a bottle of Seche Vite!!!&lt;br /&gt;Seche Vite WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a staple in my regular pedicures and semi-regular manicures (natural nails). It keeps your polish fresh and the staying power is remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;It is thick but drys pretty darn quick. Stick with the smaller size unless you are a nail junkie because it is thick and a little goes a long way. Do not be leisurely when you apply this..........have to be quick due to the thickness and fast drying.&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This dries pretty quickly which is great for me since I&#x27;m really impatient. Same stuff they use at my salon.</li>
            <li> I like how shiny it makes my nails look.  Even when you use it over nail art or make a tiny mistake it makes your nails look really shiny.  It was just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll qualify my post title... Previously I used the Sally Hansen Insta-Dri Anti-Chip Top Coat, which I found dries faster (1 min.) and tends to help my nail polish last longer.  It is also a thinner formula, so it doesn&#x27;t thicken up like Seche.  Because of this, the Insta-Dri can be applied over the course of a few days to freshen up my mani without looking super thick on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it is so viscous, Seche takes a couple more minutes to dry to a *truly hardened finish.  (Maybe 3-5 minutes to REALLY cure.)  That said, once it dries, the finish is like no other.  SHINE FOR DAYS.  I&#x27;m rough on my nails (CrossFit, dishes, using them as tools), but this top coat really does keep my polish looking fresh for longer.  It&#x27;s cheap and very much worth the money.  That said, if you don&#x27;t like the thick formula, the Insta-Dri is a great option.</li>
            <li> Ok..this is the MUST HAVE top coat. My nail polish last forever when I use this. Plus you can&#x27;t beat the price. YES YES YES get this!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! Dry and hard to the touch in minutes! I just wish it lasted longer; a bottle will thicken and turn cloudy and unusable only a few months after opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the SV thinner but wish I didn&#x27;t have to spend that extra money; maybe next time I will try Essie which I&#x27;ve read doesn&#x27;t harden.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this by saying I never write reviews. This top coat is beyond fantastic. No chip, great shine, great feel, and fast drying. It was suggested by a youtube personality and I must say that I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the suggestion! Highly recommend! The seller was great too!</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this!  It stinks like old cheap polish BUT who cares!  I always had to sit an hour before I would do anything around the house because of dents in my polish.  This stuff is amazing!!!  Your nails are dry in a few minutes and I mean DRY as in go do whatever you want dry!</li>
            <li> Simply put, this is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. (Compared to Essie, various Sally Hansen products, etc). Dries really fast and creates a coating that makes my nail polish really stay on. (Between working in retail and doing dishes, my polish rarely lasts a few days, regardless of the brand). Love this. The scent is a bit strong but it doesn&#x27;t last that long. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I apply this over my nail polish which makes it dry faster and smoothest out the surface. A little pricey but worth it! Now if I could just get over the habit of picking at my polish!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I heard that it dried really fast and was set, not tacky, immediately. It definitely does what I was expecting (no more weird patterns from the sheets after going to sleep with &#x27;dry&#x27; nails), but I found that my polish chips much more easily with this top coat.</li>
            <li> Like all the other reviews state, this product really does work. This dries my nails incredibly fast. I only get my nails done professionally for special occasions and I usually just do my own nails at home and I use this every time. I&#x27;ve even bought my sister and a few friends a bottle of their own and they swear by it too. My sister goes to school for nails and makeup and she hates the top coat the school uses because it dries too slowly. She&#x27;s thinking of sneaking in her own bottle of Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite top coat, but you have to have the base coat that goes with this because the top coat does not properly hold without the Seche Vite base coat.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Leaves a shiny finish&lt;br /&gt;Dries quickly&lt;br /&gt;Nail polish lasts long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Need same brand base coat</li>
            <li> I have tried over 10 different brands of top coat and this is by far the best I have used. It goes on smoothly and has a very nice shine when dry.</li>
            <li> I do my nails myself and this one works just fine. FYI, I don&#x27;t see the difference between this one and the essie&#x27;s fast dry top coat. Either one is fine for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I am very pleased with my purchase! It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
            <li> Like many women reviewing this product, I had searched tirelessly for a top coat that would prevent chipping and dry in a heartbeat. Well the chipping occurred, like most top coats after the second or third day (I am now convinced my nail beds are at odds with top coats). Also, use this product quickly, or within a couple of months. Mine turned into this thick, hard gel after about 8 months of owning it and as a result, didn&#x27;t spread smoothly onto the nail. I had to toss it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If most people gave it 5 stars, perhaps this indicates that my painted nails aren&#x27;t destined to be chip-free.</li>
            <li> I rarely did my nails until I found this stuff. Not only does it make your nails incredibly shiny, it helps with chipping. I use my hands a lot, and my nails used to only last 2-3 days. Now, they last at least 5-6 days before I get any major chips. I always keep it in my cabinet now. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, either. A win-win in my book.</li>
            <li> this is the best top coat nail polish you will ever try! love this stuff. great product for great price!</li>
            <li> This is the quick dry top coat that I have used for a long time, and my nails always look good because they are sealed without any smudges!</li>
            <li> This product is the number one innovation in nail polish.  It allows you (and me) to quickly apply three coats of polish, top with Seche Vite and go on with life.  I have often polished my nails at bed time and awakened with no damage to the nails.  I don&#x27;t push this to the limit, I give it 30 minutes, but that would be to the detriment of any other polish.  I am frequently complemented on my manicures.  most folks believing that I must have gel nails.  This product gives a quality finish that lasts unlike the other top reviewed products I&#x27;ve tried.  (Poshe and CND).  My manicures last an easy 10 to 14 days.  Bravo!</li>
            <li> Only within the past year have I gotten heavingly involved with polishing my nails, at least once a week, all sorts of designs. I would typically do the base color 30 mins before going to sleep, then hang my hands over the bed and hope they&#x27;d dry without any sheet marks(which I wasnt always successful), then do the design the following day and either stick my hands in the freezer for a few minutes or wait two hours before touching anything. Finally, I was done. After much research, I found this to be the best one. It really dries within mins maybe even secs(too scared too touch them too soon) Within 20 mins they&#x27;re completely dry. Ive never spent more than $3 for a polish of any kind. Got this for $5 and am so happy. Fast shipping, packaged well, works amazingly.</li>
            <li> I must say I was pretty skeptical when I ordered this product but I&#x27;m really glad I did. I used to love painting my nails but I hated the drying part. Even when I would think they were \\&quot;dry enough\\&quot; to start doing normal stuff I&#x27;d smudge a nail and be very upset. I used this stuff last night and within 5 minutes probably less my nails were completely do-anything dry. I am super impressed and will continue to keep using this product. My nails are smooth and shiny without finger imprints on them. Simply amazed and super happy. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This does dry your nails very fast, which is great.  But after you get about halfway through the bottle it gets so thick you have to buy a separate thinning product to add to it.  Also, Seche &amp;#34;shrinks&amp;#34; as it dries.  So even though you&#x27;ll apply it to the entire nail the shiny coverage will shrink inward a bit after it dries.  I would buy it again though just b/c it dries so fast. I also have Out The Door topcoat.  I wish I could combine the quick-drying time of the Seche with the more liquidy formula of the OTD.  It&#x27;d be the perfect topcoat!</li>
            <li> This is clearly the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. It is 100% the fastest drying and it does prevent chips for a longer period of time! I&#x27;ve gone through a couple bottles in the past year as an avid nail painter.</li>
            <li> Aside from its super toxic ingredients lol I LOVE this top coat! It dries so quickly and leaves nails shiny :) love love love</li>
            <li> This product suppose to protect my nails but the sender sent me damaged product that was old and I just had to throw it away</li>
            <li> This top coat is amazing.  It dries in just a few seconds, goes on really smoothly, and makes nails last for days.  I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s best to apply a lot, but not so much that it pools up.  If it changes texture, supposedly you can buy another seche vite product (&amp;#34;restore&amp;#34;) to get it back to the original (smoother and easy to use) consistency.</li>
            <li> Finally! a product that allows me to quickly go on with my day right after doing my nails and not have them smudge!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this, I use it all the time over any nail polish I wear. It has gotten a lot of hype in YouTube tutorials and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed :)</li>
            <li> Having tried just about every brand or type of Nail Polish that is supposed to be great for not chipping or peeling off, all of them do (it seems) on my nails. I was desperate to find a solution to this problem. I did some reading on the net and discovered a few things. First, I went out and found a decent brand of base coat. Then using one of the same polishes as before (that had chipped), instead of just a clear coat on top, I used this Seche Vite and so far so good. I really have to be tough on my nails to get any chipping in the first few days. From there, I do believe I will need to re-apply a fresh coat (every other day, or every second day) until I redo my nails entirely. So basically, yeah. This helped my nail polish look especially shiny and protects them from chipping at least 2-3 days before adding another coat. I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  While you can&#x27;t do something crazy, like digging through your purse, this dries your polish VERY quickly.  I use to wreck my nails before they were completely dry...not anymore.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> the only top coat I will use. Love this stuff so much! makes my manicure last a week and some change :)</li>
            <li> Very impressed. Works for me since I live a fast life and don&#x27;t have time to waiting around for nails to dry.</li>
            <li> This top coat is worth the money since it works so well and it does dry quickly.  The nail polish is the perfect consistency and makes your nails look very shiny.  Its become a staple in my nail polish bag and is my go-to top coat; its the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple polishes and top coats. This is absolutely without a doubt the best product I have ever used. It gives a nice high gloss shine. It lasts and lasts. So far I am on day 5 and not one chip, not one smudge. I am lucky if I can go one day and I have chips. I would highly recommend this product. I used a cheap nail polish too and it is flawless. It does have the toulene in it so it does smell and has a warning on it. With all the layers of polish that I have to use I&#x27;m sure this cannot be much worse than doing that. I just kept the area well ventilated. Definitely will be using this from now on and you cannot beat the price!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews...but I absolutely love this nail polish!  I wish I had come across this product years ago!  I am extremely impressed with how well it works.  It was much faster drying than I had expected.  It is a great top coat for any polish and provides a nice shine.  The best part....its been several days and my nails are yet to chip!</li>
            <li> This is the best topcoat ever!  I have been a loyal fan for 15+ years.  It can be a little hard to find, but so glad to see it here!  Its the only top coat that will make my manicure last.</li>
            <li> This top coat definitely dries very quickly, but it lacks in good top coat durability. I find that my nail polish begins to chip within a few days after application. A few times I&#x27;ve reapplied the top coat two or three days after I do my nails and it will peel off in large chunks. The chipping happens with any kind of nail polish I use too...Essie, OPI, Forever21, Sally Hansen, etc. I will keep using Seche Vite when I am in a hurry or when I need to fix any small chips or screw ups, but when I have the time will stick to my Sally Hansens Hard As Nails Top Coat.</li>
            <li> This is tied for best top coat with Barielle Gel Top Coat.  This one though is fast drying and covers any imperfection, so it&#x27;s nice when you are in a rush.</li>
            <li> Very quick drying and lasts for days! Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap stuff. This is well worth the price. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used plenty of top coats and all kinds, this is the best by far! Drys REALLY fast and doesn&#x27;t smudge nail art! Diffidently would recommend!</li>
            <li> good stuff...however it has a strong smell. Dries fast. I would recommend to everyone who paints their nails by themselves</li>
