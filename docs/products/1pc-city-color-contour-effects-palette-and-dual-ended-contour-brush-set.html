            <li>Loved the colors and the brush.</li>
            <li>The palette is good....</li>
            <li>Feels like a good quality brush.</li>
            <li>Very nice if you&#x27;ve never contoured before or need something easy.</li>
            <li>The brush is nice.</li>
            <li>The contour is perfect - not orangey like many shades are, and this is the only bronzer shade I&#x27;ve ever used that didn&#x27;t need some kind of tweaking with a lighter powder or touch of blush.</li>
            <li>the package was fine nothing was damaged !</li>
            <li>Makeup applies very smooth and creamy on face.</li>
            <li>For someone with less fair skin I&#x27;m sure the darkest color would be wonderful as well.</li>
            <li>Love it love it love it</li>
            <li>Love the bronzer shade.</li>
            <li>I love how the instructions are depicted in the lid.  </li>
            <li>Excellent, finally I have an airbrushed look make up.</li>
            <li>Love it&lt;</li>
            <li>I love the brush</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s me...  :)</li>
            <li>I love that they do not do animal testing</li>
            <li>ive used it 3 times, and it broke me out every time, the brush is okay.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know why I chose to try this, but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>and I love the brush.</li>
            <li>I had given up contouring, because with fair skin and blond hair, nothing looked right.</li>
            <li>This is pretty good for someone just learning how to contour.</li>
            <li>Excited to try it!</li>
            <li>Good for the price - easy way to learn/experiment with contouring for first time users.  </li>
            <li>The light highlighter is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>The highlighter doesn&#x27;t blend easy and is too opaque and glittery.</li>
            <li>I enjoy my contour kit and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>Fantastic pigment</li>
            <li>I just started and this is very easy to apply, however I will be getting the liquid kind next time.</li>
            <li>The colors worked well on my fair skin as well as on my daughter whose skin is a little more of a medium shade.  </li>
            <li>overall i do love this palette for beginners like me :)</li>
            <li>LOVE the brush - soft and blends well.</li>
            <li>Came very quickly, everything is one piece, brush is very soft, powders are pretty pigmented.</li>
            <li>This was a great way to practice before committing to something more expensive.  </li>
            <li>First time doing thisðŸ˜†</li>
            <li>The double headed brush is really nice and soft with no hairs shedding.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the colors are a bit dark for my fair skin which was remedied easily by applying color very sparingly and going back with a clean brush and blending more.  </li>
            <li>Love this looks very dark but it blends very well and contours very well...</li>
            <li>it is very soft !</li>
            <li>the highlighter is all shimmer so cannot be used for day at all or anywhere other than on top of the cheek bone - and after just one use it made my face break out - not really worth it - but as cheap as it is-</li>
            <li>It is very natural looking.</li>
            <li>i do not use the first color ,its way to dark for me and i cant really blend it,</li>
            <li>but after a few tries, it works amazingly.</li>
            <li>(My foundation makeup should be called Early Morgue.)  </li>
            <li>tired it once and let&#x27;s just say I need to practice more...</li>
            <li>It takes a little finesse to get the right amount</li>
            <li>so i would suggest using a little bit not so much !</li>

            <li> Love it love it love it</li>
            <li> I really liked it! Came in time with my Prime and love the brush!! First time doing thisðŸ˜†</li>
            <li> Real nice starter kit for contouring. Blends well and the included contour brush is great! Very nice if you&#x27;ve never contoured before or need something easy. Love the bronzer shade.</li>
            <li> the package was fine nothing was damaged ! Learning how to contour</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all,doesn&#x27;t blend good.</li>
            <li> Good for the price - easy way to learn/experiment with contouring for first time users.  This was a great way to practice before committing to something more expensive.  The colors worked well on my fair skin as well as on my daughter whose skin is a little more of a medium shade.  However, if your skin color is closer to the darkest shade in the kit I don&#x27;t think it would work for you.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love how the instructions are depicted in the lid.  I&#x27;m a pale, blue-eyed blonde.  (My foundation makeup should be called Early Morgue.)  The darkest color is way too dark for me, but I&#x27;ll use it for eye shadow.  The middle color contours well without being too noticeable.  The light highlighter is my favorite.  The brush won&#x27;t stay put together, so today I&#x27;m going to glue it.  I would recommend this product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Great way to get started with Contouring.  A very little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Excellent, finally I have an airbrushed look make up. Love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Duda&#x60;s wife</li>
            <li> Loved the colors and the brush. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> i do not use the first color ,its way to dark for me and i cant really blend it, but however i do use the second color for contouring and the highlight . i will say the highlight is almost white so i would suggest using a little bit not so much ! overall i do love this palette for beginners like me :) I love the brush it is very soft ! &amp; This item came well packaged so that was a plus .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is very good, I just need to practice applying it....  tired it once and let&#x27;s just say I need to practice more... Definitely not the product it&#x27;s me...  :)</li>
            <li> the highlighter is all shimmer so cannot be used for day at all or anywhere other than on top of the cheek bone - and after just one use it made my face break out - not really worth it - but as cheap as it is- you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> not a fan of learning to contour with powder, i think liquid is the way to go...</li>
            <li> The brush is nice. The powder does not blend. Unless u want to look like a clown don&#x27;t buy this</li>
            <li> Great contouring and the texture is awesome</li>
            <li> I cannot personally wear the darkest shade in this pallet, but the other two, the medium shade and the highlight are what I use as the contouring and highlight and they work great. The brush does a wonderful job of picking up the product and depositing it onto my skin. It takes a little finesse to get the right amount but after a few tries, it works amazingly.

            <li> I was a little nervous in the beginning that the brush would fall apart but I&#x27;ve had it for a while now and it&#x27;s doing a great job holding up.  As for the contour kit itself, I usually have to put multiple layers of the powder on, (I wanna try liquid contour and see the difference) for now I enjoy my contour kit and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work for me coz its in powder form not foundation type.</li>
            <li> The colors are very good!. I like this product. And the brush its great.</li>
            <li> I broke out immediately. I love that they do not do animal testing but my skin immediately became red and itchy.</li>
            <li> The highlighter doesn&#x27;t blend easy and is too opaque and glittery. I have dry skin so this powdwr formula didn&#x27;t do the trick for me. It&#x27;s a good kit for beginners since it brushes off easily...not very good for longevity though.</li>
            <li> Love this looks very dark but it blends very well and contours very well... I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> The palette is good....however the highlight is too white for darker skin tones....so that is a bit of a waste.</li>
            <li> Came very quickly, everything is one piece, brush is very soft, powders are pretty pigmented. Great beginners set up!!</li>
            <li> it does not blend well and clogs my pores. ive used it 3 times, and it broke me out every time, the brush is okay. i would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good for someone just learning how to contour. I just started and this is very easy to apply, however I will be getting the liquid kind next time. I think I have learned well enough now to move on from powder contouring! Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I had given up contouring, because with fair skin and blond hair, nothing looked right. I don&#x27;t even know why I chose to try this, but I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s wonderful.
