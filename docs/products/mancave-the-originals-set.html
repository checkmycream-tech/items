            <li> My husband received as a gift. Love the smells and will definitely reorder again. So happy I was able to locate on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Recieved as a gift the first time around. Now a regular buyer.  Love the stuff.</li>
            <li> Received this set as a gift.  My husband loved it! smells great.  My son uses the products as well, does not irritate his skin.  Great Product! will continue to purchase this brand.  Highly recommend tho product.</li>
            <li> does the job. i like the face products but the deodorant does not work with my body chemistry.  as far as the deodorant goes i think it makes me smell worse then if i had not put any on.</li>
            <li> I started using Man Cave When I was on a boys ski trip. One of the guys had just gotten the gift set. By the end of the trip we were hooked.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Great scent without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  It is a bit pricy, but high quality.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this and their product smells so good.</li>
            <li> Spent an Amazon gift card on this set.  I especially like the shower gel and the deodorant.</li>
            <li> I got a gift set and shared the products with my friends. I have used the ManCave Conditioning Style Cream, the Shave Gel and Post Shave Balm. I have used a few hair style creams and gels before, but ManCave&#x27;s is the first one that I&#x27;ve used that isn&#x27;t greasy and provides a very natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shave Gel is unique in that it is easy to use and not messy like other shave gels. The Post Shave Balm is a nice touch that keeps my skin feeling soothed right after a good shave.</li>
            <li> My wife votes 5 stars and the product is a much better value than what I was purchasing in the past. Great packaging, too!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product for my husband (so he would stop using my shampoo and conditioner) and he really loves the products.  The shampoo was recommended to me from a friend, but I purchased the entire gift set so that my husband could try all of the products.  Great buy.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Man Cave products are great! I bought the set for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves everything. Definitely recommend these products to everyone!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my brother and he has been pleased. I like purchasing grooming products on the more natural side.</li>
            <li> Bought this set for my son.  The face wash did not irritate his acne, and left his face clean and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fresh and clean and not overwhelming.  My son loved that it is a product made for men.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!!!!  I will definitely be purchasing these items again!!!!</li>
            <li> I love these products and recommend them for every ManCave!!!</li>
            <li> Great bargain - you could not assemble these products for the cost.  I&#x27;m not enthralled with the antiperspirant.  The shampoo, face wash and body wash are all nice.  The after shave balm is quite good.  I believe the moisturizer to be exceptional and would recommend it highly.  Odor is pleasant and not overpowering, waning rather quickly so you can utilize your favorite after shave without concern.  Try the value pack and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> The gift set is a great introduction to ManCave. My fiancé especially loves the cedarwood shower gel and the caffeine shampoo... everything smells great!</li>
            <li> I received the gift set from a friend.  Liked it so much I tried, and also loved, the shaving gel.  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
