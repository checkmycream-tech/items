            <li> This is a BIG fragrance with lot-o-note. It&#x27;s well-rounded, well-blended and full of depth &amp; character. A classic-type of perfume for a classy lady. It&#x27;s on the sweet side due to all the white florals. Very nice if you like that kind of thing. I prefer my orientals spicier, so not my thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boucheron is a high quality perfume. If you like Elizabeth Taylor frags and are ready to step it up a notch, put this on your test list. Just my 2 cents.</li>
            <li> Awesome . liked it. product is good.</li>
            <li> Perfect price thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been using Boucheron for over 20 years and won&#x27;t use anything else - it has a smooth sophispicated smell to it .  People are always complementing me on evern people I don&#x27;t know -  and it doesn&#x27;t come on strong!</li>
            <li> excellent. very responsible</li>
            <li> This product is not original. I lost my money buying this perfume on the Internet sold by Amazon. It does not smell the same like original Boucheron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Boucheron for over 25 years and every time I wear the Toilet Water or Perfume, both men and&lt;br /&gt;women ask me &amp;#34; what is the name of your perfume... it has such a delightful fragrance&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great product.  Love it.</li>

            <li> This product that I received does NOT smell like the Bucheron I&#x27;ve been getting in the department store.  I&#x27;m not sure it is real.</li>
            <li> I first bought this fragrance back in 1992, I think and I paid so much for the bottle that I was mildly teased for it. I treated myself again this year and was not disappointed. Now that I have a &amp;#34;nose&amp;#34; for detecting certain cents, this fragrance is even more pleasing. I am a fan of orange blossoms and I can really detect them in the perfume now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will become part of my regular rotation</li>
