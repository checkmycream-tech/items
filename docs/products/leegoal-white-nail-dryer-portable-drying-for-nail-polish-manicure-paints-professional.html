            <li>You&#x27;d be better off buying a mini fan.</li>
            <li>Would have been much better if it had an &amp;#34;on/off&amp;#34; button or switch.</li>
            <li>Its better to use a hair dryer than this thing.</li>
            <li>altho sure, it gets</li>
            <li>I brought this for myself because I love doing nail.</li>

            <li>I have used this many times now and love it - for the price that I paid.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This works much better than drying them air dry.&lt;br /&gt;Thamks</li>
            <li>and you won&#x27;t be able to hold it on.</li>
            <li>Thanks very nice to do your nails and keep going, all should have one you love it to</li>
            <li>Super cheap so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but its a great product!</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast and the product is in good condition.</li>
            <li>, very good condition and the dryer is small but very effective</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very light and somewhat cheaply made, but what can you expect for under $5.00.  </li>
            <li>She loved it and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work right out of the box, do not buy!!</li>
            <li>Not Be The Best Of Quality Like Other System That Are Made Like This One.</li>
            <li>Love these little portable nail dryers, great to take over to the girls for beauty night!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and gets then job done with ease.</li>
            <li>They love doing our nails together, and this was just what we needed to make it even more fun.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works.</li>
            <li>it came very quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li>It is easy for kids to use, however.</li>
            <li>The two pieces come apart, but can easily be snapped abck together.</li>
            <li>Does not have a strong fan.</li>
            <li>Best little dryer out there</li>
            <li>AND I REALLY ENJOY</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a hunk of cheap plastic, then feel free to buy.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s seriously cheap.</li>
            <li>WHAT I GET FOR BUYING CHEAP THINGS</li>
            <li>Works great actually has quite a bit of power!!</li>
            <li>TO FIT</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap cause</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a cheap product.</li>
            <li>It wasent all that i hoped for but it gets the job done and it was cheap.</li>
            <li>Originally I bought one for my daughter-in-law&#x27;s birthday</li>
            <li>I WAS SO EXCITED TOUSETHIS</li>
            <li>It is small and compact and perfect for its intended use at a child&#x27;s spa party.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;they were very professional and nice about it.</li>
            <li>For the money spent, it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>I can put my hands in ok and it does not take much effort to keep the fan on.</li>
            <li>I do use nail polish that is quick drying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Adequate for battery operated dryer.</li>
            <li>AND WHEN IT CAME I WAS SUPER EXITING</li>
            <li>When I first saw the product I ordered you could tell it was not a well made product, cheap looking product, not made in the USA.</li>
            <li>overall very pleased.</li>
            <li>These were exactly what I ordered for my four grandaughters for a christmas gift and know they will enjoy them</li>
            <li>Love my new nail dryer.</li>
            <li>:) it was exactly what I needed, thanks.</li>
            <li>This came fully intact and ready to use, easy to use</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted !  </li>
            <li>THIS MAKES IT FUN FOR THEM</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that you get what you pay for by the value, but it isn&#x27;t even worth the $4.</li>
            <li>With the $3 price tag, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a high-quality product, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised when I saw the smeared logo stamped on the top of the dryer.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t really worth buying.</li>
            <li>then it isn&#x27;t useful.</li>
            <li>She can now work more professional as she does her fave job</li>
            <li>Finally found one I liked on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Thefan gives a nice amount of air and is fairly quiet.</li>
            <li>It has come in handy for when she needs a quick dry before going.</li>
            <li>This tool is handy with some quick dry spray.</li>
            <li>Great for the price though, no more smudged nails</li>
            <li>nail dry does work really nice on your nails</li>
            <li>My nails could probably dry faster with my own breath.</li>
            <li>This little gem sounded so good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently started painting my nails more and wanted to quicken the drying process for myself.  </li>
            <li>I love it especially for the price you cannot beat it.dries</li>
            <li>product did not work when we got it at first, my girlfriend smacked it on the coffee table and it started working somehow.</li>
            <li>first it takes me forever</li>
            <li>Sure enough the product didn&#x27;t even work!!</li>
            <li>Great device, slow shipping</li>
            <li>I thought this might be a professional light drying product</li>
            <li>Overall, satisfied with what I got for what I paid.</li>
            <li>It would be better if you didn&#x27;t have to push the button so hard, but it would be even better if you just flipped a switch</li>
            <li>After reading a bunch of positive reviews I decided to order it.</li>
            <li>I figured it was small and looked like a good deal.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this little invention very much, but with the force you have to use to operate it, it isn&#x27;t worth it unless you truly have hand muscles.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be better off using a hair dryer to dry your nails</li>
            <li>Better use use your home fan to dry your nails.</li>
            <li>It dries the nails really fast</li>
            <li>my nails fast</li>
            <li>Haha when I got this I was so Syked it works like butter</li>
            <li>THanks for the product</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t cost much</li>
            <li>You might be cautious about using ultraviolet dryers on a regular basis; there is some indirect evidence that chronic UV light exposure is connected to skin cancer.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my daugther, Although I paid close to nothing for the dryer, she said it works really well.</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves the nail dryer.</li>
            <li>Was so surprised at how powerful the fan is.</li>
            <li>i havnt used it yet to know if it really dries your polish or not.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really found that it dries my nails any faster, but I am keeping and using it anyway.</li>
            <li>But other than that it worked very well. :)</li>
            <li>Its a good gift for a tween; thumb won&#x27;t go on the same surface with your other 4 fingers.</li>
            <li>other then that its ok..</li>
            <li>usually do a full manicure (clear coat, 2 coats of regular nail polish, and a final clear top coat).</li>
            <li>This device also comes in handy for drying glue on small items.</li>
            <li>Dried my nails fast and air blows very smooth and doesn&#x27;t cause bubbles.</li>
            <li>You do have to press and hold down on the top part to enable the flow of air.  </li>
            <li>I would prefer to see an on/off switch so that I so t have to hold down on the top to operate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The longer you hold down the button, the more your hand cramps.</li>
            <li>I wish it blew a little harder, but its great for nails on car trips or on the go.</li>
            <li>I feel it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a huge difference in dry time.</li>
            <li>But Who Ever Made This Unit Came Up With A Clever Idea.</li>
            <li>This product is too small, fingers can not put into it, but the fan works great dry</li>
            <li>not strong enough to do any good</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I can blow harder than the cheap fan in this product.  </li>
            <li>When the nail dryer came today I put new batteries in</li>
            <li>I&#x27;VE TRIED BRAND NEW BATTERIES AND EVERYTHING,</li>
            <li>This was supposed to be brand new, but didn&#x27;t appear to be.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to a person who likes to dry their nails quickly, but also has hand muscles.</li>
            <li>Quick dry nails on steroids.  </li>
            <li>Look for another solution if you want your nail polish to dry quickly.</li>
            <li>But I am excited to use it to see how fast my nails dry with it than just letting them air dry.</li>
            <li>This is such a cute little gadget - works</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT ARRIVED LATE THEN ON TOP OF THAT</li>
            <li>This products didn&#x27;t seem to do anything near what it was supposed to.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The fan is so loud and annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Came only a very teeny bit banged up, but it was probably my postal service seeing as they dont care about anyone packages.</li>
            <li>Even while it is on, there isn&#x27;t enough air movement to make much difference.</li>
            <li>Cheap junk, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li>ill find how good xmas day</li>
            <li>It is pretty good for the price, but it is a little weak.</li>
            <li>Blowing air onto your nails to dry them can be pretty risky because it can sometimes cause bubbles in your polish, but I&#x27;ve never had that problem with this dryer.</li>
            <li>Who wouldn&#x27;t want a simple device to dry their polish quickly?</li>
            <li>I received the item and put brand new batteries in it, only to find out it does not work.</li>
            <li>I stringly recommend for the people that want to do their nails and want them dry fast.</li>
            <li>when I painting my  nails, I use this nail dryer, it had cold air, and the nails dried faster, its perfect for manicure in the house.</li>
            <li>It smells like its overheating, but the product itself is still cool to the touch, which is odd, but it&#x27;s not enough for me to stop using it.</li>
            <li>This nail dryer is very cheaply made and there is hardly any air coming from it to dry the nails.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t realize it worked with batteries.. o_O</li>
            <li>This item barely creates a movement of air.  </li>
            <li>I really is what I expected</li>
            <li>I understand that it was a cheap investment to dry my nails, but i expect things I cheaply purchase to at least work for a little bit.</li>
            <li>The battery door did not fit quite right but works.</li>
            <li>Does not completely dry nails</li>
            <li>This little dryer is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Barely works but it works enough that it helps.</li>
            <li>Blows cool air not warm</li>
            <li>I have tried using this dryer for 10 min on each hand (20 min total) and my nails are still not dry fully.</li>
            <li>its more of a hassle to keep pressing down than to just buy a small fan!</li>

            <li> Love them</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be better off buying a mini fan.</li>
            <li> Would have been much better if it had an &amp;#34;on/off&amp;#34; button or switch.</li>
            <li> Its better to use a hair dryer than this thing.</li>
            <li> altho sure, it gets</li>
            <li> I brought this for myself because I love doing nail.</li>

            <li> but this one is way better.</li>
            <li> I have used this many times now and love it - for the price that I paid.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This works much better than drying them air dry.&lt;br /&gt;Thamks</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t be able to hold it on.</li>
            <li> Thanks very nice to do your nails and keep going, all should have one you love it to</li>
            <li> Super cheap so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but its a great product!</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast and the product is in good condition.</li>
            <li> , very good condition and the dryer is small but very effective</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very light and somewhat cheaply made, but what can you expect for under $5.00.  </li>
            <li> She loved it and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work right out of the box, do not buy!!</li>
            <li> Not Be The Best Of Quality Like Other System That Are Made Like This One.</li>
            <li> Love these little portable nail dryers, great to take over to the girls for beauty night!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and gets then job done with ease.</li>
            <li> They love doing our nails together, and this was just what we needed to make it even more fun.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works.</li>
            <li> it came very quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li> It is easy for kids to use, however.</li>
            <li> The two pieces come apart, but can easily be snapped abck together.</li>
            <li> Does not have a strong fan.</li>
            <li> Best little dryer out there</li>
            <li> AND I REALLY ENJOY</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a hunk of cheap plastic, then feel free to buy.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s seriously cheap.</li>
            <li> WHAT I GET FOR BUYING CHEAP THINGS</li>
            <li> Works great actually has quite a bit of power!!</li>
            <li> TO FIT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap cause</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a cheap product.</li>
            <li> It wasent all that i hoped for but it gets the job done and it was cheap.</li>
            <li> Originally I bought one for my daughter-in-law&#x27;s birthday</li>
            <li> I WAS SO EXCITED TOUSETHIS</li>
            <li> It is small and compact and perfect for its intended use at a child&#x27;s spa party.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> /&gt;they were very professional and nice about it.</li>
            <li> For the money spent, it does a great job.  </li>
            <li> I can put my hands in ok and it does not take much effort to keep the fan on.</li>
            <li> I do use nail polish that is quick drying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Adequate for battery operated dryer.</li>
            <li> AND WHEN IT CAME I WAS SUPER EXITING</li>
            <li> When I first saw the product I ordered you could tell it was not a well made product, cheap looking product, not made in the USA.</li>
            <li> overall very pleased.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I ordered for my four grandaughters for a christmas gift and know they will enjoy them</li>
            <li> Love my new nail dryer.</li>
            <li> :) it was exactly what I needed, thanks.</li>
            <li> This came fully intact and ready to use, easy to use</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted !  </li>
            <li> THIS MAKES IT FUN FOR THEM</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that you get what you pay for by the value, but it isn&#x27;t even worth the $4.</li>
            <li> With the $3 price tag, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a high-quality product, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised when I saw the smeared logo stamped on the top of the dryer.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t really worth buying.</li>
            <li> then it isn&#x27;t useful.</li>
            <li> She can now work more professional as she does her fave job</li>
            <li> Finally found one I liked on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Thefan gives a nice amount of air and is fairly quiet.</li>
            <li> It has come in handy for when she needs a quick dry before going.</li>
            <li> This tool is handy with some quick dry spray.</li>
            <li> Great for the price though, no more smudged nails</li>
            <li> nail dry does work really nice on your nails</li>
            <li> My nails could probably dry faster with my own breath.</li>
            <li> This little gem sounded so good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently started painting my nails more and wanted to quicken the drying process for myself.  </li>
            <li> I love it especially for the price you cannot beat it.dries</li>
            <li> product did not work when we got it at first, my girlfriend smacked it on the coffee table and it started working somehow.</li>
            <li> first it takes me forever</li>
            <li> Sure enough the product didn&#x27;t even work!!</li>
            <li> Great device, slow shipping</li>
            <li> I thought this might be a professional light drying product</li>
            <li> Overall, satisfied with what I got for what I paid.</li>
            <li> It would be better if you didn&#x27;t have to push the button so hard, but it would be even better if you just flipped a switch</li>
            <li> After reading a bunch of positive reviews I decided to order it.</li>
            <li> I figured it was small and looked like a good deal.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this little invention very much, but with the force you have to use to operate it, it isn&#x27;t worth it unless you truly have hand muscles.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be better off using a hair dryer to dry your nails</li>
            <li> Better use use your home fan to dry your nails.</li>
            <li> It dries the nails really fast</li>
            <li> my nails fast</li>
            <li> Haha when I got this I was so Syked it works like butter</li>
            <li> THanks for the product</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t cost much</li>
            <li> You might be cautious about using ultraviolet dryers on a regular basis; there is some indirect evidence that chronic UV light exposure is connected to skin cancer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daugther, Although I paid close to nothing for the dryer, she said it works really well.</li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves the nail dryer.</li>
            <li> Was so surprised at how powerful the fan is.</li>
            <li> i havnt used it yet to know if it really dries your polish or not.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really found that it dries my nails any faster, but I am keeping and using it anyway.</li>
            <li> But other than that it worked very well. :)</li>
            <li> Its a good gift for a tween; thumb won&#x27;t go on the same surface with your other 4 fingers.</li>
            <li> other then that its ok..</li>
            <li> usually do a full manicure (clear coat, 2 coats of regular nail polish, and a final clear top coat).</li>
            <li> This device also comes in handy for drying glue on small items.</li>
            <li> Dried my nails fast and air blows very smooth and doesn&#x27;t cause bubbles.</li>
            <li> You do have to press and hold down on the top part to enable the flow of air.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer to see an on/off switch so that I so t have to hold down on the top to operate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The longer you hold down the button, the more your hand cramps.</li>
            <li> I wish it blew a little harder, but its great for nails on car trips or on the go.</li>
            <li> I feel it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a huge difference in dry time.</li>
            <li> But Who Ever Made This Unit Came Up With A Clever Idea.</li>
            <li> This product is too small, fingers can not put into it, but the fan works great dry</li>
            <li> not strong enough to do any good</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I can blow harder than the cheap fan in this product.  </li>
            <li> When the nail dryer came today I put new batteries in</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE TRIED BRAND NEW BATTERIES AND EVERYTHING,</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be brand new, but didn&#x27;t appear to be.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to a person who likes to dry their nails quickly, but also has hand muscles.</li>
            <li> Quick dry nails on steroids.  </li>
            <li> Look for another solution if you want your nail polish to dry quickly.</li>
            <li> But I am excited to use it to see how fast my nails dry with it than just letting them air dry.</li>
            <li> This is such a cute little gadget - works</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT ARRIVED LATE THEN ON TOP OF THAT</li>
            <li> This products didn&#x27;t seem to do anything near what it was supposed to.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The fan is so loud and annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Came only a very teeny bit banged up, but it was probably my postal service seeing as they dont care about anyone packages.</li>
            <li> Even while it is on, there isn&#x27;t enough air movement to make much difference.</li>
            <li> Cheap junk, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> ill find how good xmas day</li>
            <li> It is pretty good for the price, but it is a little weak.</li>
            <li> Blowing air onto your nails to dry them can be pretty risky because it can sometimes cause bubbles in your polish, but I&#x27;ve never had that problem with this dryer.</li>
            <li> Who wouldn&#x27;t want a simple device to dry their polish quickly?</li>
            <li> I received the item and put brand new batteries in it, only to find out it does not work.</li>
            <li> I stringly recommend for the people that want to do their nails and want them dry fast.</li>
            <li> when I painting my  nails, I use this nail dryer, it had cold air, and the nails dried faster, its perfect for manicure in the house.</li>
            <li> It smells like its overheating, but the product itself is still cool to the touch, which is odd, but it&#x27;s not enough for me to stop using it.</li>
            <li> This nail dryer is very cheaply made and there is hardly any air coming from it to dry the nails.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t realize it worked with batteries.. o_O</li>
            <li> This item barely creates a movement of air.  </li>
            <li> I really is what I expected</li>
            <li> I understand that it was a cheap investment to dry my nails, but i expect things I cheaply purchase to at least work for a little bit.</li>
            <li> The battery door did not fit quite right but works.</li>
            <li> Does not completely dry nails</li>
            <li> This little dryer is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Barely works but it works enough that it helps.</li>
            <li> Blows cool air not warm</li>
            <li> I have tried using this dryer for 10 min on each hand (20 min total) and my nails are still not dry fully.</li>
            <li> its more of a hassle to keep pressing down than to just buy a small fan!</li>
            <li> I think the fan blows a little high</li>
            <li> It is better than nothing, but is a little bit weak in my opinion.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t now how long it will last</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have the same result just by waving your hands in the air to dry your nails.</li>
            <li> My nails do dry a lot quicker with this product than they would air drying, but it still takes about ten or so minutes for them to be completely dry.</li>
            <li> Also, it took so long to receive it that I forget I had even ordered it.</li>
            <li> It was ordered long ago.....</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected and makes the nail polish dry quicker and smoother.</li>
            <li> It got broken right away.</li>
            <li> This System Still Takes A Long Time For Your Nails To Dry.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works enough for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Well I received this product for help dry my finger and toes after I polished them.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t like to wait for the nails to dry</li>
            <li> , I was hoping that it will dry faster</li>
            <li> but it did not,, it still leaves your nails dry</li>
            <li> I would have been quicker to just blow on my nails to dry them.  </li>
            <li> It takes quite a while to dry.</li>
            <li> She likes using this to dry her nails faster and to share this with her friends in school to get done faster</li>
            <li> It takes awhile to dry my nails.</li>
            <li> Will probably use it with a lift inserted raise the hand to dry a manicure.</li>
            <li> When i push down on it the fan somewhat seems to stop and turns back on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not high quality, but for the price it gets the task done.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You really have to press down on it hard to work</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a low powered fan and you have to press the button too firmly (and hold it continously) to activate it.</li>
            <li> Arrived 2 weeks before expected date</li>
            <li> The only thing I would say was wrong, is that it runs out of batteries a little bit fast; but that is not really a major issue to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised it didn&#x27;t fall to pieces when I put the batteries in (and there&#x27;s no battery installation guide, either, so it&#x27;s trial and error, not helped at all by the fact the two battery slots look IDENTICAL, but require one battery to be Positive/Negative and the other to be Negative</li>
            <li> Air is not strong and drying time is long but faster than air dry.</li>
            <li> You will need batteries and have to down with fingers to dry nails.</li>
            <li> The drying mechanism is SUPER weak and the way it&#x27;s made makes it hard to press down with fingers that have wet fingernails.</li>
            <li> I tried 3 different sets of batteries but was never able to get it to work.</li>
            <li> If you use for more than a few minutes it heats up in a bad way.</li>
            <li> The fan is weak, but my 13 year old niece was tickled to have one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the shipping to return it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I expected it to last at least a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> the only thing that sucks is that you have to hold it down to start the fan</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to use to dry your feet then hands, you have to apply so much pressure for it to stay on that your fingers go numb.</li>
            <li> What the picture DOESN&#x27;T show, and what I wish I&#x27;d known before I ordered it, is that in order for the fan to be operational you need to press down on a plastic switch inside the dryer.</li>
            <li> I didnt realize it needed batteries, also it requires you to PRESS DOWN with your finger while your hand is in there for the FAN to blow air...</li>
            <li> is if you put your foot into it and hold it down..</li>
            <li> It works by pressing your fingers down on the plate beneath the area where the fan blows.</li>
            <li> and I did not expect it to be a push down.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something small &amp; lightweight to help dry my nails after polishing.</li>
            <li> However the fan on the dryer is so weak that it barely makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Theres should be a way to write less words than these here</li>
            <li> It leaves them feeling sticky for some odd reason.</li>
            <li> It just kinda sucks that you have to keep pressing down on it to dry your nails.</li>
            <li> it seemed like it would be slow to dry your nails.</li>
            <li> A little slow to dry the nail polish.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a little girl who loves to do nails.  </li>
            <li> GOT THIS FOR MY LITTLE NIECES.</li>
            <li> I was amazed how well this little dryer worked.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> my toe nails an they where dried in know time .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I am incredibly impatient with my nails drying.  </li>
            <li> seems to still be working after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Works well, just takes a while for my nails to get dried.</li>
            <li> At least not what I expected.</li>
            <li> JUNK waste of money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s a little hard to press down and keep it going.</li>
            <li> It is SO HARD to press down on this nail dryer</li>
            <li> and it could mess your polish while trying to press down as hard as you can!</li>
            <li> Flimsy and puts out very little air.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that when used for longer periods of time, the product starts to smell a little weird.</li>
            <li> its a waste!</li>
            <li> It is however small you can not place all five fingers in at one time.</li>
            <li> Have not used on my feet, think it may be too small.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I have small hands and feet, but I feel the fan doesn&#x27;t quite blow in the correct direction.</li>
            <li> The problem with this is that you need to press down VERY hard on the plate in order to make it work.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way that in this case cheaper is not better.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use it, and was extremely disappointed!</li>
            <li> Makes some noise when on but not loud enough to be annoying.</li>
            <li> I found it was easiest to make it turn on when I held the thing between my thumb and fingers and squeezed as hard as I could.</li>
            <li> The pressing should be hard.</li>
            <li> You have to press so hard your fingers will hurt after a minute</li>
            <li> this does the job but sucks up battery.  </li>
            <li> Product was 2 weeks late because it came from Hong Kong.  </li>
            <li> The price on this one can&#x27;t be beat, however BE PREPARED that the shipping is slow.  </li>
            <li> Very useless tool, does not dry out nails at all</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY DONT BUY</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> It works but is not really good quality.</li>
            <li> wind is weak..</li>
            <li> Very hard to press the inside component that makes the air come on.</li>
            <li> so that can be exhausting,</li>
            <li> Came broken and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Not extremely loud or annoying.</li>
            <li> made of very weak plastic.</li>
            <li> ill buy here again soon</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> It was unfortunate</li>
            <li> I was so sorry this didn&#x27;t work as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> When it arrived I could tell immediately that it was very poor construction.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so mad.</li>
            <li> Really bad product.  </li>
            <li> So all in all not too bad.</li>
            <li> However, I was disappointed that the dryer wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t read the reviews but was shocked that it was just air blown, a plastic piece of crap that my daughter will never use.</li>
            <li> This stupid thing never worked.</li>
            <li> i hate it, it does not work</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> i got it i was broken!!!!</li>
            <li> It sounded like it was dying it was terrible.</li>
            <li> Awful!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible!!!!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works ok but air strength not do great</li>
            <li> IT ARRIVED USED:  FINGERNAIL POLISH ON,  AND THE BATTERY DEPARTMENT WAS CORRODED WITH ACID,  AS THOUGH THE BATTERYS HAD RUPTURED.</li>
            <li> Well I received this product for help dry my finger and toes after I polished them. When I first saw the product I ordered you could tell it was not a well made product, cheap looking product, not made in the USA. I have not used the product yet so I can not tell you about the use.</li>
            <li> THIS IS JUST WT ADD SAID IT WAS,MY GRANDDAUGHTERS AND I REALLY ENJOY HAVING THIS MAKES IT FUN FOR THEM</li>
            <li> It dries the nails really fast and it&#x27;s great for both hands and feet. I was very happy with the product. I received it before the estimated time. I will be doing business with them again.</li>
            <li> IT DIDNT EVEN WORK. It sounded like it was dying it was terrible. I threw it out. I&#x27;m so mad.</li>
            <li> Barely works but it works enough that it helps.</li>
            <li> My grandaughter loves it!  It works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This stupid thing never worked. I wish I had ordered another BUT NEVER AGAIN</li>
            <li> I found one of these in Walmart....only had one.  Liked it so well I ordered 6 more to give for Christmas gifts.  A great stocking stuffer.  Got one for granddaughter, daughter in law and several others.  Love them</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. If you&#x27;re looking for a nail dryer, don&#x27;t buy this. If you&#x27;re looking for a hunk of cheap plastic, then feel free to buy. It is truly a piece of junk. I&#x27;d say that you get what you pay for by the value, but it isn&#x27;t even worth the $4.</li>
            <li> Great nail dryer for the price. Works so well I ordered again just to have 2</li>
            <li> Awful!!! do not buy! its more of a hassle to keep pressing down than to just buy a small fan! and it could mess your polish while trying to press down as hard as you can! its a waste!</li>
            <li> Very useless tool, does not dry out nails at all</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. You&#x27;d be better off buying a mini fan. The drying mechanism is SUPER weak and the way it&#x27;s made makes it hard to press down with fingers that have wet fingernails. Would have been much better if it had an &amp;#34;on/off&amp;#34; button or switch.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a little girl who loves to do nails.  She loved it and it works very well.</li>
            <li> The picture shows a hand in the dryer, which you assume is just running. What the picture DOESN&#x27;T show, and what I wish I&#x27;d known before I ordered it, is that in order for the fan to be operational you need to press down on a plastic switch inside the dryer. The problem with this is that you need to press down VERY hard on the plate in order to make it work. I found it was easiest to make it turn on when I held the thing between my thumb and fingers and squeezed as hard as I could. Even then, if you slacken your grip the tiniest bit it&#x27;ll shut off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this thing. Even if I somehow managed to get the ONE non-functional unit they ever made and all the others are wonderful and perfect and work every time, you&#x27;ll be feeding it batteries forever. And it&#x27;s seriously cheap. I&#x27;m surprised it didn&#x27;t fall to pieces when I put the batteries in (and there&#x27;s no battery installation guide, either, so it&#x27;s trial and error, not helped at all by the fact the two battery slots look IDENTICAL, but require one battery to be Positive/Negative and the other to be Negative/Positive!). Avoid.</li>
            <li> My package got to me on time but when I received  it the box was all mashed  up when I got it...</li>
            <li> Still in working shape.</li>
            <li> It got broken right away. And the button which is inside should be pressed in order the fan to work. The pressing should be hard. Its better to use a hair dryer than this thing.</li>
            <li> A Great Gift !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t like to wait for the nails to dry this is great. Originally I bought one for my daughter-in-law&#x27;s birthday and then I bought one for myself.</li>
            <li> When the nail dryer came today I put new batteries in it did not work I don&#x27;t advice nobody to buy this product</li>
            <li> I had one of these when I was younger and was dying to get my hands on another one now!  I&#x27;ve recently started painting my nails more and wanted to quicken the drying process for myself.  The price on this one can&#x27;t be beat, however BE PREPARED that the shipping is slow.  It took about 3 weeks to a month to receive this one, but I didn&#x27;t mind.  Works great, dries my nails, what else can you ask for?</li>
            <li> I am very happy about this product. It came earlier than expected and makes the nail polish dry quicker and smoother. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I purchased this nail dryer for $4.39 eight months ago and I am impressed with it.  For the money spent, it does a great job.  You do have to press and hold down on the top part to enable the flow of air.  I use it about once or twice a month and have changed the battery twice since then. I do use nail polish that is quick drying.&lt;br /&gt;It is very light and somewhat cheaply made, but what can you expect for under $5.00.  I would prefer to see an on/off switch so that I so t have to hold down on the top to operate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall,  I like it.</li>
            <li> With the $3 price tag, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a high-quality product, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised when I saw the smeared logo stamped on the top of the dryer. However, I was disappointed that the dryer wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. I tried 3 different sets of batteries but was never able to get it to work.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT ARRIVED LATE THEN ON TOP OF THAT IT DOES NOT WORK. I WAS SO EXCITED TOUSETHIS BUT ITS DOES NOT WORK. I&#x27;VE TRIED BRAND NEW BATTERIES AND EVERYTHING, BUT YET THIS THIS STILL WONT WORK. I GUESS THATS WHAT I GET FOR BUYING CHEAP THINGS ONLINE. SERIOUSLY DONT BUY THIS IT DOES NOT WORK I WOULD SAY KEEP LOOKING FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE. THIS IS A POS!!</li>
            <li> Great nail dryer for the price. I love it!!!!! Dried my nails fast and air blows very smooth and doesn&#x27;t cause bubbles.</li>
            <li> This nail dryer is very cheaply made and there is hardly any air coming from it to dry the nails.</li>
            <li> I love it especially for the price you cannot beat it.dries my nails fast and it blows out good air.it fits four fingers</li>
            <li> The nail dryer works perfectly, I was hoping that it will dry faster but it did not,, it still leaves your nails dry so it good!!!! I stringly recommend for the people that want to do their nails and want them dry fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail for myself and one for a friend&lt;br /&gt;yes this works on 2 AA batteries .&lt;br /&gt;I did use this Leegoal White Nail Dryer Portable Drying&lt;br /&gt;on my toe nails an they where dried in know time .&lt;br /&gt;I also used this on my finger nails and yes they to where&lt;br /&gt;dried in know time at all ,&lt;br /&gt;This nail dry does work really nice on your nails</li>
            <li> Liked it got in time to give my mum as a gift an she told me she liked it .</li>
            <li> Haha when I got this I was so Syked it works like butter meaning it&#x27;s a awsome dryer so I might buy another one</li>
            <li> Works great actually has quite a bit of power!! My clients  like it as well. THanks for the product ill buy here again soon</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this little invention very much, but with the force you have to use to operate it, it isn&#x27;t worth it unless you truly have hand muscles. The longer you hold down the button, the more your hand cramps. It would be better if you didn&#x27;t have to push the button so hard, but it would be even better if you just flipped a switch and it ran continuously until turned back off. I would recommend this to a person who likes to dry their nails quickly, but also has hand muscles.</li>
            <li> I didnt realize it needed batteries, also it requires you to PRESS DOWN with your finger while your hand is in there for the FAN to blow air... so that can be exhausting, altho sure, it gets the job done</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a low powered fan and you have to press the button too firmly (and hold it continously) to activate it. You&#x27;ll have the same result just by waving your hands in the air to dry your nails.</li>
            <li> I like it, but I haven&#x27;t used this yet.  But I am excited to use it to see how fast my nails dry with it than just letting them air dry.</li>
            <li> I understand that it was a cheap investment to dry my nails, but i expect things I cheaply purchase to at least work for a little bit. I received the item and put brand new batteries in it, only to find out it does not work.</li>
            <li> this does the job but sucks up battery.  i paint my nails weekly and this lasted about 2 months before i had to replace the battery.  Great for the price though, no more smudged nails</li>
            <li> I would have been quicker to just blow on my nails to dry them.  This products didn&#x27;t seem to do anything near what it was supposed to.  Very disappointed but it didn&#x27;t cost much so I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I brought this for myself because I love doing nail. I figured it was small and looked like a good deal. WRONG. It is SO HARD to press down on this nail dryer it actually starts to hurt my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fan is so loud and annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> For the price, this dryer is pretty good! It did take a while to get to my house, but I didn&#x27;t pay for shipping so I&#x27;m not going to let that affect my rating for it. Blowing air onto your nails to dry them can be pretty risky because it can sometimes cause bubbles in your polish, but I&#x27;ve never had that problem with this dryer. My nails do dry a lot quicker with this product than they would air drying, but it still takes about ten or so minutes for them to be completely dry. My only complaint is that when used for longer periods of time, the product starts to smell a little weird. It smells like its overheating, but the product itself is still cool to the touch, which is odd, but it&#x27;s not enough for me to stop using it.</li>
            <li> Nice product will order another. I would tell my friends about this item and send as a gift Thank you</li>
            <li> The fan works and helps a lot. However it&#x27;s a little hard to press down and keep it going. Once it started going, it began to smell like the motor was burning. It still works but I don&#x27;t now how long it will last</li>
            <li> The nail dryer works great the only thing that sucks is that you have to hold it down to start the fan and it can hurt after awhile!  But it works good for the price I paid for it!</li>
            <li> The dryer is compact and lightweight but works great. It is easy to use and gets then job done with ease.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tiring for clients to press to activate.  Motion sensor would be a better option.  Adequate for battery operated dryer.</li>
            <li> It is pretty good for the price, but it is a little weak.</li>
            <li> Great lil gadget for the price. Really ideal for those of us who like to paint our nails right before bedtime.  Lol</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I am incredibly impatient with my nails drying.  It is better than nothing, but is a little bit weak in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Nice petite nail dryer.  It cute and it works!  I recommend it for price.  You will need batteries and have to down with fingers to dry nails.</li>
            <li> This nail dryer is a piece of junk. You&#x27;d be better off using a hair dryer to dry your nails</li>
            <li> WISH IT HAD AN AC/DC PLUG INSTEAD OF JUST BATTERIES.  IT WORKS GOOD THOUGH AND I&#x27;VE USED IT EACH TIME I DO MY NAILS.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting!! But it works ok!</li>
            <li> made of very weak plastic. product did not work when we got it at first, my girlfriend smacked it on the coffee table and it started working somehow. seems to still be working after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Works well, just takes a while for my nails to get dried. It just kinda sucks that you have to keep pressing down on it to dry your nails. Other than that, it works enough for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t realize it worked with batteries.. o_O</li>
            <li> GOT THIS FOR MY LITTLE NIECES. PERFECT FOR YOUNG GIRLS.&lt;br /&gt;Rec&#x27;d on time for the holidays. Thank you... .... .....</li>
            <li> No heat is generated because the power source is two AA batteries. You might use your hair dryer for faster results. You might be cautious about using ultraviolet dryers on a regular basis; there is some indirect evidence that chronic UV light exposure is connected to skin cancer.</li>
            <li> This System Still Takes A Long Time For Your Nails To Dry. But You Get What Pay For I Should Of Know That A System That Cost Only $3.99.Would Not Be The Best Of Quality Like Other System That Are Made Like This One.But I Will Try To Keep Using The System Maybe I Will Get Use To It.But Who Ever Made This Unit Came Up With A Clever Idea.</li>
            <li> Love it and will be ordering another one as a gift.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really have to press down on it hard to work</li>
            <li> I love it, when I painting my  nails, I use this nail dryer, it had cold air, and the nails dried faster, its perfect for manicure in the house.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Air is not strong and drying time is long but faster than air dry.</li>
            <li> My dryer broke after using it twice!  It was unfortunate bc I was so excited to use it, and was extremely disappointed!</li>
            <li> Ok. Does not have a strong fan.</li>
            <li> broke promptly after purchasing</li>
            <li> This is such a cute little gadget - works well - my daughter - in - law will love it for Christmas!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daugther, Although I paid close to nothing for the dryer, she said it works really well.</li>
            <li> Not good. This is like a toy. Better use use your home fan to dry your nails.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast and the product is in good condition. However the fan on the dryer is so weak that it barely makes a difference. My nails could probably dry faster with my own breath. It takes quite a while to dry. It wasn&#x27;t really worth buying.</li>
            <li> :) it was exactly what I needed, thanks. Theres should be a way to write less words than these here</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to use to dry your feet then hands, you have to apply so much pressure for it to stay on that your fingers go numb.</li>
            <li> Really bad product.  I hadn&#x27;t read the reviews but was shocked that it was just air blown, a plastic piece of crap that my daughter will never use.</li>
            <li> MY wife urged me to buy this for her. She said that she will love me good if I bought this cheap fan.</li>
            <li> This product is too small, fingers can not put into it, but the fan works great dry very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it is a good product</li>
            <li> Good product for the price. I really love using it. I paint my nails fairly often so I like having it. The only thing I would say was wrong, is that it runs out of batteries a little bit fast; but that is not really a major issue to me.</li>
            <li> not strong enough to do any good</li>
            <li> I LOVED THIS PRODUCT I WAS SUPPOSED GET THIS PRODUCT AT THE END OF DECEMBER  BUT I GOT IT ON NOVEMBER AND WHEN IT CAME I WAS SUPER EXITING I USED IT THE SECOND IT GOT HERE AND IT WORKES WELL AND ITS NOT THAT BIG TO FIT IN.I LOVED IT.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok if this is the type of nail dryer you are looking for. I bought it without looking it over. It is battery powered and does not come with any. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I did try it out it seemed like it would be slow to dry your nails.</li>
            <li> My grand daughters loved this. when ever they visit we have a tea party and do manicures. They love doing our nails together, and this was just what we needed to make it even more fun.</li>
            <li> actually i donn&#x27;t want it since it mail to my house. first it takes me forever then it isn&#x27;t useful.</li>
            <li> i hate it, it does not work</li>
            <li> Came broken and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Received promptly. Portable. I feel it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a huge difference in dry time. At least not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Great product!Very faster than blowing your gingers and toes.</li>
            <li> This came fully intact and ready to use, easy to use</li>
            <li> Super cheap so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but its a great product! Easy to use and works.</li>
            <li> Does not completely dry nails</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with this dryer at all...&lt;br /&gt;The wind is weak..</li>
            <li> ill find how good xmas day</li>
            <li> Stocking stuffer, no feedback yet.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in the hopes that it would get me by until I can afford one of the larger models.  I expected it to last at least a few weeks.  When it arrived I could tell immediately that it was very poor construction.  Sure enough the product didn&#x27;t even work!! I didn&#x27;t feel like dealing with the hassle of sending it back so I just threw it in the garbage where it belongs.  If you&#x27;re going to buy a nail dryer make sure you know that you are getting what you pay for.  I learned the hard way that in this case cheaper is not better.</li>
            <li> There was no literature with it and a hair was on the drying surface. This was supposed to be brand new, but didn&#x27;t appear to be. The dryer works properly. Also, it took so long to receive it that I forget I had even ordered it.</li>
            <li> Shipping was faster than estimated. Came only a very teeny bit banged up, but it was probably my postal service seeing as they dont care about anyone packages. Works great. Batteries werent included but thats fine! Makes some noise when on but not loud enough to be annoying. overall very pleased. thank you.</li>
            <li> I would love to review this item but I have not received it yet!  It was ordered long ago.....still waiting!!</li>
            <li> i wouldnt know well cuz wen i got it i was broken!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product! Arrived 2 weeks before expected date, very good condition and the dryer is small but very effective</li>
            <li> This was bought for my daughter who is into manicuring her own nails.  She absolutely loves the nail dryer. It has come in handy for when she needs a quick dry before going.</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> Felt like a toy something you would give to a child to play dress up and paint their nails</li>
            <li> Great device, slow shipping</li>
            <li> Best little dryer out there</li>
            <li> What can I say but I have a VERY happy granddaughter. She can now work more professional as she does her fave job</li>
            <li> Terrible!!!!!!!! It&#x27;s only a tiny fan that they pass of as a nail dryer!!!!!!</li>
            <li> A little slow to dry the nail polish. Just have to be patient with it.</li>
            <li> Blows cool air not warm</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted !  I had one like it and it broke and couldn&#x27;t find it in stores.  Thank you !!</li>
            <li> Quick dry nails on steroids.  Item works with ease &amp; quietness.  We like it!</li>
            <li> its very cheap looking and feeling</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work right out of the box, do not buy!! I tried tons of batterys, nothing!!</li>
            <li> Just got them in the mail. Was so surprised at how powerful the fan is. So happy I got this and so are all my friends.</li>
            <li> I wish it blew a little harder, but its great for nails on car trips or on the go. Fits in my purse and bookbag! Great for kids too! Not extremely loud or annoying.</li>
            <li> This was the best price I could find on a nail dryer for my daughter.  It came from hong kong? so it took awhile to get here but still made it before Christmas.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something small &amp; lightweight to help dry my nails after polishing. I tried looking in stores for something like this but to no avail. Finally found one I liked on Amazon. After reading a bunch of positive reviews I decided to order it. it came very quickly in the mail. Within a couple of days after ordering it. This device also comes in handy for drying glue on small items. I glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> So, when I ordered it, it didn&#x27;t come. So, I contacted them and they sent another one!&lt;br /&gt;they were very professional and nice about it. The drier is awesome, it dries my nails and client nails in no time.&lt;br /&gt;I even bought one from Avon but this one is way better.</li>
            <li> This little dryer is exactly what I was looking for. It is small and compact and perfect for its intended use at a child&#x27;s spa party. Thefan gives a nice amount of air and is fairly quiet. I can put my hands in ok and it does not take much effort to keep the fan on. A+</li>
            <li> I have used this many times now and love it - for the price that I paid. It is however small you can not place all five fingers in at one time.</li>
            <li> This item barely creates a movement of air.  I would not recommend purchasing this.  It is easy for kids to use, however.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. Works great and exactly what I wanted. Would recommend if you are looking for nail dryer. Have not used on my feet, think it may be too small. But bought it for my hands anyway</li>
            <li> Never worked bogus stuff don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> Stopped working the third th time I tried to use it. ... JUNK waste of money</li>
            <li> Love my new nail dryer. Works great. I can&#x27;t believe how well it works. Definitely a great buy. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap cause it&#x27;s a cheap product. It&#x27;s not worth the shipping to return it!&lt;br /&gt;I usually do a full manicure (clear coat, 2 coats of regular nail polish, and a final clear top coat). I have tried using this dryer for 10 min on each hand (20 min total) and my nails are still not dry fully. Not a good product.</li>
            <li> Came faster than they had said. It works but is not really good quality. The battery door did not fit quite right but works.</li>
            <li> She likes using this to dry her nails faster and to share this with her friends in school to get done faster</li>
            <li> have used others but for the price i  like it  it gets the job done. i would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I love it. Thanks very nice to do your nails and keep going, all should have one you love it to</li>
            <li> when i bought this i red everything they said about this and i thought that it woulda been alittle bigger and i thought it woulda came with batteries and the only way it works is if you put your foot into it and hold it down..i didnt know that..other then that its ok..i havnt used it yet to know if it really dries your polish or not.</li>
            <li> Not at all what was described!!!!!!  Product was 2 weeks late because it came from Hong Kong.  Please double double check where items are coming from.  My biggest mistake!!!  I can blow harder than the cheap fan in this product.  Was expecting an actual nail dryer...not a 1&amp;#34; fan .  Save your money!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was amazed how well this little dryer worked. I have 2 it didn&#x27;t have the name on the dryer but still it worked</li>
            <li> It takes awhile to dry my nails. It leaves them feeling sticky for some odd reason. When i push down on it the fan somewhat seems to stop and turns back on.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it, it works great!!!! I even used it so did my daughter in law. I would Recommend</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not high quality, but for the price it gets the task done. The two pieces come apart, but can easily be snapped abck together. I will probably have to duct tape it at some point. Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I had one of these that lasted for years,.  When i saw it online i had to get another one.  I use gel polish at home with the lamp but sometimes i like to use regular polish.  This tool is handy with some quick dry spray.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work wish I would  have saved my money</li>
            <li> It does its job. Very good for my nails</li>
            <li> The fan is weak, but my 13 year old niece was tickled to have one.  That works for me!</li>
            <li> Love these little portable nail dryers, great to take over to the girls for beauty night!</li>
            <li> I got it and it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> This works much better than drying them air dry.&lt;br /&gt;Thamks</li>
            <li> my wife loves it !!!!!</li>
            <li> I was so sorry this didn&#x27;t work as I thought it would. Who wouldn&#x27;t want a simple device to dry their polish quickly? This little gem sounded so good I couldn&#x27;t think of any reason why it wouldn&#x27;t work. If you can&#x27;t either, listen up. It works by pressing your fingers down on the plate beneath the area where the fan blows. You have to press so hard your fingers will hurt after a minute and you won&#x27;t be able to hold it on. Even while it is on, there isn&#x27;t enough air movement to make much difference. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Look for another solution if you want your nail polish to dry quickly.</li>
            <li> I thought this might be a professional light drying product and it is not, it&#x27;s a hand-held fan.  I haven&#x27;t really found that it dries my nails any faster, but I am keeping and using it anyway.</li>
            <li> Good for the price. Maybe it&#x27;s because I have small hands and feet, but I feel the fan doesn&#x27;t quite blow in the correct direction. Still usable though!</li>
            <li> It wasent all that i hoped for but it gets the job done and it was cheap. So all in all not too bad.</li>
            <li> If you use for more than a few minutes it heats up in a bad way.</li>
            <li> I do not look so good. Does not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> Just received this and it works well for a pedicure. I think the fan blows a little high (it hits your knuckles) for a manicure. Will probably use it with a lift inserted raise the hand to dry a manicure. Overall, satisfied with what I got for what I paid.</li>
            <li> Flimsy and puts out very little air.  Very hard to press the inside component that makes the air come on.</li>
            <li> I received this on time and I did not expect it to be a push down. I though you would it a on button and then it would work for you. But other than that it worked very well. :)</li>
            <li> Cheap junk, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I really is what I expected</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I ordered for my four grandaughters for a christmas gift and know they will enjoy them</li>
            <li> Came on time and in good condition. Its a good gift for a tween; thumb won&#x27;t go on the same surface with your other 4 fingers. Only works with batteries</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where this product went, but I never got it.  I advise you not to purchase this item, you will not get it in the mail ..</li>
