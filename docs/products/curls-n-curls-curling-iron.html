            <li>so it fits into my bag very easily.</li>
            <li>Rule of thumb: If you pick up any kind of electrical appliance and the price tag seems too good to be true, don&#x27;t buy it...</li>
            <li>The curling iron worked great and was priced right for the product.</li>
            <li>It works for her and is great since it doesnt get to hot</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too good to be true.</li>
            <li>It makes nice curls, and hair goes thru smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I love this curling iron.</li>
            <li>This iron took about 20 mins to get warm, yes i said warm, it never got hot.</li>
            <li>When I first opened it, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be any good.</li>
            <li>Excellent, as expected.</li>
            <li>nice and light and easy to take on a trip and such a great price.  </li>
            <li>The simple lever point is perfect, whether you like to use your thumb or a finger, and also super easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works great so far and curls my relaxed hair fine.</li>
            <li>The price was really good, and the product was brand new!  </li>
            <li>I like this curling iron because of the easy to push button.  </li>
            <li>Easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>grasps hair easily and securely</li>
            <li>It has a shorter barrel which is nice since I don&#x27;t have large hands.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to slide smoothly along the strand to the very ends.</li>
            <li>This curling iron has no off/on button and doesn&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
            <li>Fast warm-up time and easy size to handle.</li>
            <li>This is a great curling iron, the best I&#x27;ve found since my classic Clairol Crazy Locks finally gave up the ghost.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle looks white on the picture, but it&#x27;s actually very light lavender color.  </li>
            <li>the size was exactly what i was looking for though</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok should of gotten a bigger curling iron!!!!</li>
            <li>You have to plug them in to get hot, unplug to turn off.</li>
            <li>and I had difficulties with this iron gripping it tightly enough to curl.  </li>
            <li>I have very short, fine hair</li>
            <li>It actually does a really good job and it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as some of the other ones</li>
            <li>The barrel does not have a strong spring and therefore does not hold the hair that you are attempting to curl very tight, making for a poor curl at best onshort hair.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>i am a big fan of conair products i think their products are fantastic</li>
            <li>I had to be very careful with each curl to be sure the hair would stay in.</li>
            <li>But if your looking for something as a carry along it just doesnt heat hot enough for my hair to curl right with it.</li>
            <li>Funny, she likes the clip push down vs. the way this one is designed, she has fine hair and says it does not hold the hair as well.</li>
            <li>It might be a fitting purchase for a teen just starting out with curling irons.</li>
            <li>Good with a small lever to open and close the flap.</li>
            <li>I have a beauty shop and needed a new iron my supply house didn&#x27;t carry anymore.</li>
            <li>Does not get hot enough!</li>
            <li>I actually ordered a different one (belson), for same price and is 100%  better.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 8 year old.</li>
            <li>Very durable and simple!</li>
            <li>Finally I found this and at a reasonable price...</li>
            <li>i.e those that i have used until this on: wow</li>
            <li>I bought this curling iron to replace an old one.</li>
            <li>I had a hard time finding this size curling iron at all my local stores, but I was able to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>No matter how long you let this curling iron heat up, it never gets hot enough for the curl to set.</li>
            <li>It does not get hot enough to make LASTING curls which is key!</li>
            <li>And is not tight enough to hold your hair.</li>
            <li>It takes few minutes to heat up, and the temperature is not too hot which will not burn your hair.  </li>

            <li> but it does not open wide enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like it makes slight curls in the opposite direction of my natural waves and they cancel each other out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its a complete waste of money, period.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too long</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to heat up.  </li>
            <li> In addition, it isn&#x27;t really tight enough to hold the hair in the iron.</li>
            <li> The cord on this item is not has long as the others I previously ordered.</li>
            <li> However, does not come with a metal stand like other curlers</li>
            <li> , I once bought a Target-brand hand mixer for $10 and it was defeated the second time I used it by a particularly thick bowl of cookie dough.</li>
            <li> I wish the chord was a little longer</li>
            <li> thought about giving it only four stars, because I don&#x27;t know yet whether this one will last 35 years, too, like my Crazy Locks.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> Hard to get one&#x27;s hair in it and navigate one&#x27;s fingers with less room.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding 5/8 inch curling irons.  </li>
            <li> It is so hard to find this size curling iron!</li>
            <li> Too bad it does not come in pink!  </li>
            <li> But this thing is useless.</li>
            <li> so wont damage hair as badly as mine could.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> so very disappointed when i got it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Does not get hot enough! And is not tight enough to hold your hair. I actually ordered a different one (belson), for same price and is 100%  better. Has on off switch and two temperature settings.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding this size curling iron at all my local stores, but I was able to find it on Amazon.  The price was really good, and the product was brand new!  I would definatley buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This iron took about 20 mins to get warm, yes i said warm, it never got hot. Its a complete waste of money, period.</li>
            <li> This is a great curling iron, the best I&#x27;ve found since my classic Clairol Crazy Locks finally gave up the ghost.&lt;br /&gt;It grasps hair easily and securely but it&#x27;s easy to slide smoothly along the strand to the very ends. The simple lever point is perfect, whether you like to use your thumb or a finger, and also super easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I thought about giving it only four stars, because I don&#x27;t know yet whether this one will last 35 years, too, like my Crazy Locks.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after 3 days.</li>
            <li> Love this iron!!!! I use it every day. I wish the chord was a little longer but otherwise it&#x27;s great and it&#x27;s not too long so it fits into my bag very easily.</li>
            <li> When I first opened it, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be any good. I bought it for my 8 year old. It actually does a really good job and it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as some of the other ones so I&#x27;m not as worried about her burning herself.</li>
            <li> The iron works well.  My only issue is that it doesn&#x27;t have an on/off switch so you have to plug it in and out.  Obviously, it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic shut off either.</li>
            <li> I got this for a total of five dollars and 41 cents at walmart. It works great so far and curls my relaxed hair fine. The types of curls you get varies with the amount of hair that you curl at a time. I own the 3/4 inch as a reference.</li>
            <li> Disappointed! This curling iron has no off/on button and doesn&#x27;t get very hot. In addition, it isn&#x27;t really tight enough to hold the hair in the iron.</li>
            <li> I like this curling iron because of the easy to push button.  I don&#x27;t like the ones with \\&quot;lever\\&quot; open the rod.  It takes few minutes to heat up, and the temperature is not too hot which will not burn your hair.  5/8\\&quot; is a perfect size for me.  It makes nice curls, and hair goes thru smoothly.  The handle looks white on the picture, but it&#x27;s actually very light lavender color.  Too bad it does not come in pink!  Also, Conair should not discontinue this nice product.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> Very durable and simple! I can&#x27;t believe its so cheap because it works so well!! I am so happy I got it!</li>
            <li> Not like what I am used. To</li>
            <li> dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find this size curling iron! Finally I found this and at a reasonable price... you would swear they are rarer that a Praying Mantis!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding 5/8 inch curling irons.  This one if perfect.  Very lightweight.  Easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> The curling iron works--but the clip is short-plus is does not have a clip to stand on the counter!</li>
            <li> i am a big fan of conair products i think their products are fantastic i.e those that i have used until this on: wow this looks like a toy, feels like one too. so very disappointed when i got it. doesnt have different speeds, nothing. the size was exactly what i was looking for though but geez</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok should of gotten a bigger curling iron!!!!</li>
            <li> This curling iron works great and the price was good. I would recommend this product to others and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron it is my favorite easy to hold and works the best on fine hair with out burning your hair.  Great price as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron to replace an old one. I turned it on, left it to heat up for about 5 minutes, came back and nothing had happened. I didn&#x27;t even bother returning it, just threw it out.</li>
            <li> perfect for what I was looking for. No handle to get in the way of curling close to my scalp.</li>
            <li> It took a while to heat up and there is not a heat setting.</li>
            <li> No matter how long you let this curling iron heat up, it never gets hot enough for the curl to set.</li>
            <li> does not have an off/on switch</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron. It has a shorter barrel which is nice since I don&#x27;t have large hands. It makes a good curl.</li>
            <li> I bought for my mom and turns out she had the same one.  Funny, she likes the clip push down vs. the way this one is designed, she has fine hair and says it does not hold the hair as well.</li>
            <li> Wish it had heat control.</li>
            <li> nice and light and easy to take on a trip and such a great price.  Would definitely recommend to any one wanting this size of barrel</li>
            <li> It does not get hot enough to make LASTING curls which is key! It might be a fitting purchase for a teen just starting out with curling irons.</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to heat up.  I like the thumb opener...but it does not open wide enough. Hard to get one&#x27;s hair in it and navigate one&#x27;s fingers with less room. Maybe a spring situation.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter because my curling irons are to big for her to try and do her hair by herself. It works for her and is great since it doesnt get to hot so wont damage hair as badly as mine could. But if your looking for something as a carry along it just doesnt heat hot enough for my hair to curl right with it.</li>
            <li> Good with a small lever to open and close the flap. However, does not come with a metal stand like other curlers n does not heat up enough. Overall, I like it because of the size and the lever as I have arthritis in my hands.</li>
            <li> I have a beauty shop and needed a new iron my supply house didn&#x27;t carry anymore. I ordered 3 of these and found out when I got them, they don&#x27;t have on-off button. You have to plug them in to get hot, unplug to turn off.</li>
            <li> The cord on this item is not has long as the others I previously ordered.</li>
            <li> It will do for emergencies.  The barrel does not have a strong spring and therefore does not hold the hair that you are attempting to curl very tight, making for a poor curl at best onshort hair.</li>
            <li> I have very short, fine hair and I had difficulties with this iron gripping it tightly enough to curl.  I had to be very careful with each curl to be sure the hair would stay in.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have an on/off button, or temperature control.</li>
            <li> The curling iron worked great and was priced right for the product. I would recommed this item to anyone needing a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I bought this (actually I bought the 1&amp;#34; version) from CVS. I needed a curling iron and I was swayed by the price tag. But this thing is useless. I plug it in.... it heats up... But when I try to use it, my hair actually ends up straighter! It&#x27;s like it makes slight curls in the opposite direction of my natural waves and they cancel each other out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a similar vein, I once bought a Target-brand hand mixer for $10 and it was defeated the second time I used it by a particularly thick bowl of cookie dough. Rule of thumb: If you pick up any kind of electrical appliance and the price tag seems too good to be true, don&#x27;t buy it...it&#x27;s too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Excellent, as expected. Fast warm-up time and easy size to handle.</li>
