            <li>awesome doesn&#x27;t pull or tug on hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the best brush I have ever used!</li>
            <li>I find it perfect for drying my bob length hair.</li>
            <li>great brush great price</li>
            <li>This has been great.</li>
            <li>good brush</li>
            <li>Ordered 3 more for family members!</li>
            <li>He likes to brush his skin with it (another reason I got him his own).</li>
            <li>Makes my hair look nice and smooth after blowdrying.  </li>
            <li>If anything this brush caused MORE static in my hair.</li>
            <li>From moisturizing to static sheets to rubbing the brush on an iron hanger.</li>
            <li>This brush is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li>They are static free and I love that they&#x27;re one piece, instead of the handle being attached to the paddle.</li>
            <li>My stylist purchased a cricket static free brush for me about 2 years ago.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend loved my brush so much that I bought one for him.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and it&#x27;s really easy to use to style my hair during blowdrying.  </li>
            <li>I wish that the plastic bristles were taller which would hold more hair and would be easier to pull (clean) the hair off the brush</li>
            <li>Nice weight and best of all, NO STATIC!</li>
            <li>This is fine.</li>
            <li>This brush is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Light weight.  </li>
            <li>Does not pull or snag, and the handle is comfortable.</li>
            <li>on of these fantastic paddle brushes.  </li>
            <li>It looks classy, and feels good.</li>
            <li>Love this for my PomAPoo because he has curly and straight coat.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick too.</li>
            <li>I have short hair, but have started using this brush as well because it just feels so nice.  </li>
            <li>This is great because it brushes through without pulling and there is not static so his coat stays where it belongs.</li>
            <li>It was exactly the replacement brush I needed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had the static with my hair standing straight out, this brush is the only one that works for me</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t great for thick hair because the bristles are not thick enough, and I don&#x27;t find that it really prevents static.</li>
            <li>Dogs are not stupid and have trained many a human to do what they want the human to do.</li>
            <li>It still hurts her when I brush, but we get through brushing much faster than with the detangling brush.  </li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>and she is much cooler.  </li>
            <li>i expected this to work and threw it away because it didn&#x27;t help the static at all</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Have a Golden Retriever/Lab mix dog with the Golden Retriever long hair</li>
            <li>but it does a decent job.  </li>
            <li>This brush is a classic style.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for all hair types.</li>
            <li>I recently had to throw away my Cricket static free paddle brush that I had for at least 20 years!</li>
            <li>it places the same exact one I had lost</li>
            <li>For days I couldn&#x27;t get rid of the static no matter how hard i tried.</li>
            <li>My son even loves it because it&#x27;s soft on his head.</li>
            <li>Slides through wet or dry hair easily.  </li>
            <li>The first day I brushed her and started getting out the dead head that forms knots without pulling her hair and her betting me was a success.  </li>
            <li>Been using this exact brush style and brand for 15+ years and am a white kid with an enormous afro.</li>
            <li>Possibly good for long hair but not good on short hair.</li>
            <li>This one is a different style and a bit larger than my older one</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd time we bought it so that our daughter can now have her old one.</li>
            <li>I bought it because my 5 year old has long, curly hair</li>

            <li> great brush great price</li>
            <li> The wife loves this brush. This is the 2nd time we bought it so that our daughter can now have her old one.</li>

            <li> This is fine. It just squeaks every time you use it.</li>
            <li> One of the best brushes I&#x27;ve owned. My son even loves it because it&#x27;s soft on his head.</li>
            <li> awesome doesn&#x27;t pull or tug on hair.  Slides through wet or dry hair easily.  Light weight.  Ordered 3 more for family members!</li>

I hate buying products from Asia.</li>
            <li> I ordered this tool to help in drying my hair. It works very well and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a brush that could stand up to the heat of my Babyliss Hairdyer. This has been great. Does not pull or snag, and the handle is comfortable.</li>
            <li> Bought two of these. They are static free and I love that they&#x27;re one piece, instead of the handle being attached to the paddle. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Have a Golden Retriever/Lab mix dog with the Golden Retriever long hair and I bought this brush to comb her because she doesn&#x27;t not like to be brushed.  The first day I brushed her and started getting out the dead head that forms knots without pulling her hair and her betting me was a success.  She has actually gotten to where she likes to be brushed now that almost all the loose hair is off her and she is much cooler.  She comes to me when she sees me picking up the brush and backs up to me to brush her.  Dogs are not stupid and have trained many a human to do what they want the human to do.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush I have ever used! Nice weight and best of all, NO STATIC! I definitely recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush will give you a head massage every time you use it. Also keeps hair from falling out by circulating the blood. My boyfriend loved my brush so much that I bought one for him. He likes to brush his skin with it (another reason I got him his own). It looks classy, and feels good.</li>
            <li> If anything this brush caused MORE static in my hair. For days I couldn&#x27;t get rid of the static no matter how hard i tried. From moisturizing to static sheets to rubbing the brush on an iron hanger. i expected this to work and threw it away because it didn&#x27;t help the static at all</li>
            <li> My stylist purchased a cricket static free brush for me about 2 years ago.  Every brush I had found&lt;br /&gt;would pull half of my hair out, how frustrating is that...right?  After 2 years I decided to purchase&lt;br /&gt;another on of these fantastic paddle brushes.  I would recommend this brush for anyone who would&lt;br /&gt;prefer for their hair to remain on their head, rather than on the brush.</li>
            <li> good brush it places the same exact one I had lost</li>
            <li> It was exactly the replacement brush I needed.  Shipment was quicker than I expected.Thanks.</li>
            <li> Works well. Arrived on time</li>
            <li> Love this for my PomAPoo because he has curly and straight coat. This is great because it brushes through without pulling and there is not static so his coat stays where it belongs. Gentle and looks forward to being brushed.&lt;br /&gt;Great also for those (human&#x27;s) who have long, thick hair. My daughter in law has 2, one for herself and one for their Tibetan Terrier.</li>
            <li> Been using this exact brush style and brand for 15+ years and am a white kid with an enormous afro. Literally if i forget my brush i am turning around.</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic! I&#x27;ve always had the static with my hair standing straight out, this brush is the only one that works for me</li>
            <li> This brush is a classic style. I had one like this years ago and I used it until it disappeared (one of my kids lost it). I find it perfect for drying my bob length hair. I will not go without this brush again. The shipping was quick too.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be a softer touch for my aging hair.  Rips it.  I don&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t great for thick hair because the bristles are not thick enough, and I don&#x27;t find that it really prevents static.</li>
