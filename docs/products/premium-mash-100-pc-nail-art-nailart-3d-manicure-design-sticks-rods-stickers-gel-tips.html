            <li>The girls loved picking their sticks for me to cut decals for them.  </li>
            <li>but when I saw these nail stickers featured in Amazon I thought that they might be a good gift for a teenager for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a really good deal.  </li>
            <li>but they are good quality.</li>
            <li>Since this is a grab bag of sorts, there were some I loved (florals)</li>
            <li>Has Sought in Venezuela and can be sold at a good price</li>
            <li>quality product and good finishing recommend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other vendors and customers.</li>
            <li>good thing about this is they come wayyy faster then expect..</li>
            <li>My daughter loved these nail art pieces.</li>
            <li>There is a really good variety of these.  </li>
            <li>with good nail glue... they stay put..</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>

            <li>Good variety.</li>
            <li>There was a good variety of designs.  </li>
            <li>These canes are bright colored and of good quality.</li>
            <li>Theses are not as good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>

            <li>The price was great and the items was nice, a lot of sticker choices.</li>
            <li>so they look good on your nail</li>
            <li>The girls LOVED them though.</li>
            <li>You have to have good dexterity to cut fimo canes to a thinness that would look good on your nails, so if you can&#x27;t cut good, don&#x27;t bother! :)</li>
            <li>They cut nicely and look amazing on acrylic nails!</li>
            <li>I am delighted with the quality and design selection -- no duplicates -- very cute designs.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery, awesome product.  </li>
            <li>They work best with nail glue as opposed to top coat but the top coat works well too.</li>
            <li>I liked a lot because they had flowers, butterflies and fruits that were perfect for summer and spring season, my daughter is doing beautiful decorations to all her friends at high school too!</li>
            <li>but the rest are great and very detailed.</li>

            <li>Sending gifts to my friends, it would be nice to atleast know how to use the product.</li>
            <li>Great quality, bright colors, fun design.</li>
            <li>For the price I am not going to complain, but the pictures aren&#x27;t all that good on  lot of these but still cute</li>
            <li>Was just what I wanted to help me do my own nails.</li>
            <li>my attempts at creating my own designs weren&#x27;t that great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing I love frogs.</li>
            <li>Girls are loving these.  </li>
            <li>They are creating their own designs and people are asking for orders from them to make .</li>
            <li>I really liked these.  </li>
            <li>but I hope it&#x27;s as nice as it looks</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t know, gives it my own dimension based on how I cut it.</li>
            <li>I feel what worked best for me is to use nail glue when applying, they really dont fall off when using the nail glue.</li>
            <li>I like it makes my nails look nice</li>
            <li>But I did get ones that I liked and the razor that comes with</li>
            <li>in there own separate bags.</li>
            <li>I use a box cutter or a razor blade to cut the rods into my own desired thickness.</li>
            <li>Cute and good price</li>
            <li>/&gt;The canes were very well packaged and they were all perfect.</li>
            <li>I liked them</li>
            <li>I check how there were no doubles, but some of them were kind of deformed.</li>
            <li>Saving the fatter cuts for my toes and the thinner ones for a nice manicure.</li>
            <li>these are nice</li>
            <li>The end result is kind of tacky.  </li>
            <li>Would be nice if this came with a blade</li>
            <li>the variety is nice as is the price.</li>
            <li>Is nice but has to come sito</li>
            <li>Good for nails too :)</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I liked them a lot.  </li>
            <li>Loving it</li>
            <li>The have flowers stars even skulls which will come in handy on Halloween</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also interesting to note that, if sliced right, these seem to be reusable - which is completely awesome, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I got them fast, great quality, love them!!</li>
            <li>&gt; good quality, nice design, easy to use</li>
            <li>They came quickly and appear to be of great value.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re very easy to slice yourself.</li>
            <li>was very easy to order.</li>
            <li>yes i counted more than once to make sure!</li>
            <li>I am sure she will love this!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very cheap compared to the pre-sliced kind</li>
            <li>A very fun and easy way to create beautiful nails.  </li>
            <li>This are great takes some time to get the size you want som practice with the ones you don&#x27;t really like!!  </li>
            <li>I was looking for nail art for my 10 year old granddaughter&#x27;s birthday, and these were just perfect!  </li>
            <li>The fruit slices and smiley faces are nicely done and are cute</li>
            <li>so they will be smooth and look good.  </li>
            <li>As far as the images are, they are perfect.</li>
            <li>Instructions would have been nice but it doesn&#x27;t take a genius to google or youtube :)</li>
            <li>i would have liked more of a variety tho</li>
            <li>These a very cute and easy to apply to my nails.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE!</li>
            <li>Delivery was great not long at all, They are a GREAT BUY.</li>
            <li>wow lots of sticks, great graffics, so many uses, didnt expect that many for that great of price.</li>
            <li>but its a great product, very cute and colorful and not even one single repeat :D  </li>
            <li>Love these, they look great and are fun to use.</li>
            <li>I took the ones I liked the best and left them on the window sill on a sunny day to get them to soften up.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m pretty happy with them</li>
            <li>Very cute, huge variety</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s fine!</li>
            <li>The tips are pointy and very precise for placing the decals on.</li>
            <li>its very fun and very cute.</li>
            <li>You can make hundreds of cutest designs with these 100 rods of very detailed nail art. .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad Mash canes were my first experience with fimo because the others I have bought haven&#x27;t been so great.</li>
            <li>However, the quality of the pieces I did receive are nice as well as easy to cut.</li>
            <li>Because they&#x27;re so cheap and you get so many!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice value and great purchase for those who want to try something new for their nail art.</li>
            <li>my order was exactly as described easy to use and turned out beautiful</li>
            <li>AWESOME! got super fast and LOVE tem</li>
            <li>I really liked the fast shipping, nice packaging, and the many varieties!</li>
            <li>and also I ordered these because they had those cute hello kitty fimos</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind the repeats as they are really cute.</li>
            <li>and we BOTH love them.</li>
            <li>I love these sticks.  </li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>To adhere to the nail, just use your top coat.</li>
            <li>am quite sure that they just toss a handful from a &#x27;lot&#x27; into your order, so don&#x27;t rely on the stock image itself.</li>
            <li>-in-all, I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>My favorite are the fuit.  </li>
            <li>I think the thinner you slice them, the better they look.  </li>
            <li>Packaging was okay</li>
            <li>Some designs I wouldn&#x27;t use, but there are so many others to choose from.</li>
            <li>They look really cute on the nail.</li>
            <li>If she figures out a better way to make them work, I will let you know, but as of now I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li>I have more control on the thickness.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was a bit dissapointed that I didn&#x27;t get more dessert/fruit shapes.</li>
            <li>I got mostly designs.</li>
            <li>There are many designs and colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>I really love them.  </li>
            <li>I think these are the most adorable things you could put on your nails.</li>
            <li>but it was ok</li>
            <li>but if I do I&#x27;ll be sure to order from MASH again :)</li>
            <li>The nailart sticks arrived quickly, nicely packaged, and my granddaughter was thrilled with the assortment of colorful designs.</li>
            <li>There are some that I don&#x27;t recognize, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a use for them.</li>
            <li>(just make sure you&#x27;re using a razor blade).</li>
            <li>I have a ton of duplicates but they&#x27;re mostly the cuter designs</li>
            <li>I thought they were more like those push up erasers.</li>
            <li>I counted and was shorted more than 20 sticks.    </li>
            <li>But after receiving the design stick rods, my curiosity got the better of me</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift and will be glad to give it.</li>
            <li>came promptly, many cute selections.</li>
            <li>They love doing their nails.  </li>
            <li>but they love using them.  </li>
            <li>There are so many designs to choose from like butterflies, hearts, flags and much more.</li>
            <li>Dont use a top coat to attach these use Nail glue.</li>
            <li>I am happy with them and cant wait to put them on my childrens nails and one daughter had made me a list of the ones she wants on her nails.</li>
            <li>Wish me luck! :)</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase the one&#x27;s that are already pre sliced to see if that works better</li>
            <li>I really love thse</li>
            <li>How you guys have a better evening than I have.  </li>
            <li>-Vanessa! :)</li>
            <li>like most have said but</li>
            <li>all in all these are cute</li>
            <li>and I got some really cute ones.</li>
            <li>This selection was just okay for me ....</li>
            <li>It was okay for the price</li>
            <li>but I wish the selection would have been more varied.</li>
            <li>more than others (flags).  </li>
            <li>So, the products are OK, but I don&#x27;t know that I received the amount I had hoped.</li>
            <li>They have a bunch of cute designs in the pack.</li>
            <li>I just love everything I got :)  </li>
            <li>Figures are so cute, I love it.</li>
            <li>I love these and appreciate the price I got these for.</li>
            <li>There is not to many of these sticks I could imagine not using.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>So that was ok with me.  </li>
            <li>no hello kitty , Chanel, or any cute ones like that.</li>
            <li>all I will say 50% cute, 30% ok and 20%</li>
            <li>I received 100 pcs and they are really cute.  </li>
            <li>AND HAVE GOTTEN CREATIVE WITH IT</li>
            <li>Make sure you click to choose who you order from, and order from MASH.  </li>
            <li>And could not be more satisfied.</li>
            <li>also so that&#x27;s even better.</li>
            <li>They look really cute on my nails.</li>
            <li>I have searched many tutorials on Nail Art and there is nothing on what to do with these</li>
            <li>I ordered this canes more</li>
            <li>They are more intricate than they appear in the pictures.</li>
            <li>I received mostly fruits, hearts, and butterflies.</li>
            <li>so many to go through...</li>
            <li>There are so many of these.</li>
            <li>I will order more, I got alot of flowers and fruit.</li>
            <li>but im glad it came.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>love them thank you</li>
            <li>Just received these in the mail, their is no hello kitty in the bunch and a lot are not as shown but they are cute</li>
            <li>If I were a teenager, I would love to play with things like this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I&#x27;m sure that she did.</li>
            <li>These are so much fun, a good variety of images.  </li>
            <li>If anyone has ideas as to how to cut the images more efficiently, please let me know.  </li>
            <li>These are really really cute.  </li>
            <li>They love picking out what pictures to put on their nails</li>
            <li>My fruits were a bit deformed and did not look as cute which is what I was looking forward to besides the flowers</li>
            <li>but its ok</li>
            <li>I love fimo, I use it in acrylics</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Also i would use top coat every couple of days to keep them on too.</li>
            <li>Females of all ages love this kit once again</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Then a top coat.</li>
            <li>It was inexpensive and I was able to do up each of them within 30 minutes which was awsome since it used to take me 2 hours or more to do fancy nails on 7 girls.</li>
            <li>Not even sure how to use them and there were no instructions.</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t look like pencil stencils and most of all they also came with any DIRECTIONS</li>
            <li>I want more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase. :)</li>
            <li>but i have ended up using most of them.</li>
            <li>it also came with too many flowers and butterflies, about 20 flowers and 15 butterflies</li>
            <li>fruits :)  </li>
            <li>Ordered this product for christmas and have enjoyed it every time we use it.  </li>
            <li>Cute</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the purchase for the value.</li>
            <li>I just love it, it looks so cute</li>
            <li>60;3 Love it</li>
            <li>Love using these for my nail art.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure of the quality after reading some of the reviews here.</li>

            <li>I am pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>maybe you will be better at it.</li>
            <li>I received so many duplicates in my package</li>
            <li>and you get so many out of one stick.</li>
            <li>Would have been better</li>

            <li>I received a lot of duplicate designs and none were cute like the ones pictured.</li>
            <li>came in time as listed in the shipping info :)</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>But I can say that I didn&#x27;t get many duplicates.</li>
            <li>Wish there was a more variety of designs than the flowers and fruits.</li>
            <li>but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;re cute.</li>
            <li>Don’t order if there is one stick that you more than any of the others, since you probably won’t get it.</li>
            <li>but most were repeats and multiples</li>
            <li>i wish they had some hello kitty, more cute girly designs.</li>
            <li>my daughters love them...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be using them for years because each stick can be cut many times.</li>
            <li>All the images were cute and none were disfigured.  </li>
            <li>The packet I received was mostly fruit</li>
            <li>Love these nail art 3d...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>Once I finish slicing one, I&#x27;ll update with the count. :)</li>
            <li>Even at 50 per cane, that&#x27;s a lot of nail stickers. :)</li>

            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll let everyone know how it goes as well. :)</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s just an &amp;#34;operator&amp;#34; issue not the product.</li>

            <li>so I was even more excited!</li>
            <li>They are cute and fun!!</li>
            <li>in the end, I HIGHLY Suggest this Product, And the others I mentioned As they work great.</li>
            <li>Over all this product is a great buy I would highly recomend it for anyone who enjoys nail art:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super cute on toes in the summer!</li>
            <li>super cute!</li>
            <li>this are very awesome collection for my daughter art design, very curious to work with, variety of colors, good material, and never seen before, thanks love it!</li>
            <li>They slice very well and look amazing on nails!  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind the time you&#x27;ll have to put in slicing them, this is a terrific product and a great investment -- a lot more cost effective than buying a container of already pre-sliced ones.</li>
            <li>And sure, a lot of them are great and detailed, but I kind of expected more from what was portrayed!  </li>
            <li>These are so much fun!!</li>
            <li>these are great make sure that you have the patience to slice it with a good sharp razor blade.</li>
            <li>For those who are familiar with rod sticks: Do the purchase!</li>
            <li>The fimo sticks that came from this seller were nice, pretty uniform in size throughout the rod, and most of them were very detailed.</li>
            <li>The stamper is easy to use, both ends are rubber tips (at 1st i thought is sponge tips from the picture shown), it works miracle on my nails, but i think u need a more concerntrated nail polish to bring out the pattern.</li>
            <li>But, in a way I am kind of happy they are smaller.</li>
            <li>Great for a eight year old girl!</li>
            <li>Much fun will be had with these for sure!</li>
            <li>I love that they showed up so quickly too!</li>
            <li>I had received these yesterday, Very good packaging, They came in a Yellow envelope and None had cracked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m changing my review to be more accurate.  </li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so cheap for how many sticks you get.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure both recipients will enjoy them.</li>
            <li>My five year old daughter was so happy when she found out what are they for when she got them on Santa&#x27;s stocking.</li>
            <li>(like on a notebook) and using a box cutter or a razor blade for a more precise cut.</li>
            <li>I got my stick way early which was great.</li>
            <li>The best thing I can say about them is that the little designs are cute and you get soooooooooooooooooooooooo many that it makes it a great deal for the money, they could last you forever :)</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast - extremely satisfied!</li>
            <li>That being said, they are great fimo pieces, super easy to slice with my Irwin straight razor.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I love these, theyre perfect, even for her little nails.</li>
            <li>love it , made nail fun!</li>
            <li>I received about 28 unique designs - mostly fruits and flowers, otherwise the majority were duplicates (72 in fact).  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the sticks, they were all very cute and and I would say all different in someway.</li>
            <li>Adheres easily to nails.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>The sticks are so easy to cut and use.</li>
            <li>and myself ( :&lt;br /&gt;They cut easily with an exacto knife.</li>
            <li>THEY ARE EASY TO USE</li>
            <li>/&gt;Arrived very quick.</li>

            <li>They came in the mail very quick.</li>
            <li>Each time I apply them, they come off easily.</li>
            <li>So they fall off easily.</li>
            <li>but I would guess that I can easily get 60 slices from each cane.</li>
            <li>I recieved it very quickly and promptly.</li>
            <li>They even included a strong blade to cut these.</li>
            <li>The packaging was good, I received all 100, and it seems to be a decent variety.</li>
            <li>But they are very cute and there is a large variety.</li>
            <li>Overall I would say the designs are super cute, fun and an awesome price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, a lot of them are very cute, and for the price you really can&#x27;t beat them.</li>
            <li>Nor am I saying you&#x27;ll receive distorted images, I just ppl to be aware by giving my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>They are very easy to cut, if you have the right razer, xato knife or box cutter.</li>

            <li>At first i wasnt sure if i would use most of these fimo canes</li>
            <li>Some of the designs were strange and not something she would ever use, but that is okay, because they are great to practice with.</li>
            <li>Plus, there are some super cute ones in the pack.</li>

            <li>Most of the designs are very pretty and detailed.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed these with my kids, super cute and fun.  </li>
            <li>It wpuld be nice if we could put in a request for certain typeof fimo sticks we wanted.</li>

            <li>These are offered at a fantastic low price and includes a great variety.</li>
            <li>its a huge variety of sticks</li>
            <li>It was a huge hit.</li>
            <li>Mine came with a huge razor to help me cut these.</li>
            <li>We both enjoy the results.</li>
            <li>I like the *light</li>
            <li>You could also use them to decorate your cell phone, school binders just get crafty.</li>
            <li>Also there designs aren&#x27;t cheap looking like bundle monster.</li>
            <li>The package could fit in my hand, about 4\\&quot;x5\\&quot;</li>
            <li>One cane was so light</li>
            <li>I will enjoy decorated my nails with these.</li>
            <li>I would recommend getting these if you enjoy nail art.</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough how great these are......</li>
            <li>3 of the girls went home telling their mother they wanted to order some and would use their own money since didn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>you can buy things like this from hong kong sellers for really cheap</li>
            <li>Ok, I like doing fun stuff to my nails...</li>
            <li>Easier to fit on the nail I guess.</li>
            <li>overall these were great</li>
            <li>they are still cheap for what they are, and they work well.</li>
            <li>This bundle wascso cheap</li>
            <li>I will enjoy using them.</li>
            <li>i say to cut it on a notebook or even a stack of text books because it allows you to manuvere your hands around the piece to get the precise angle that you need.</li>
            <li>They are reusable so that&#x27;s a great big</li>
            <li>this was a gift to a 10 yr old girl, who loved them--needed mom to cut the slices</li>
            <li>For the most part, they were different and good quality.</li>
            <li>My nail canes come in a clear zip lock package in good shape.</li>
            <li>These are such a good price and look adorable on nails.</li>
            <li>But I really don&#x27;t mind because they are really cute designs that I love having extras of them.</li>
            <li>I love fimo canes they are very easy to use once you get the hang of it, however there are too many images that i would not use, and i would have loved it to have a lot more bows, it only has a blue one</li>
            <li>These were a bit challenging at first, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s a very quick process.</li>
            <li>and they fit very nice on my big toes nail</li>
            <li>/&gt;Things I like: Super cute designs, a whole bunch of differnent designs (almost 100), seasonal/festive designs, CHEAP!, and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would be better if there was a tool included to cut them to the right thickness.</li>
            <li>but thanks anyway!!!</li>
            <li>These were very very fun to do for my friends</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll run out any time soon, because you get so many, but if I do I&#x27;ll certainly purchase from MASH again!</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this order &amp; will order more from this vendor in the future.  </li>
            <li>super easy.</li>
            <li>The image plates work fantastic, they don&#x27;t need special nail polish.  </li>
            <li>They are super cute and fun.  </li>
            <li>The rhinestones are perfect accept it&#x27;s too small for my fingers to place it on my nails, need a tweezer to do the job.</li>
            <li>I received the item, and counted all pieces to make sure it came with exactly 100 pieces.  </li>
            <li>and they are so fun!  </li>
            <li>But the girls had so much fun as did I!  </li>
            <li>so I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I initially really only got them for the HELLO KITTY ones, but once they arrived I found ALOT of others that I really liked too!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Third, my daughter was so excited to receive these that she divided them into categories (fruits, shapes, food, characters, flowers, etc.)</li>
            <li>but after i was looking at them, i found out the are perfect for small nails like for children.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>but I am pretty sure it was a designer emblem.</li>
            <li>okay please be aware that these are miniature fimo sticks.  </li>
            <li>So excited to get started.</li>
            <li>This is a really fun way to do nails!</li>
            <li>they are all different images an real cute..</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t address whether she will like it or not, but they look pretty cute to me and there are tonz of them.</li>
            <li>Worth the wait in my opinion!</li>
            <li>I also used nail glue just because my first attempt with OPI top coat ended up smearing the purple nail polish.       </li>
            <li>These are the 100 sticks I received although they were in a plastic container originally.</li>
            <li>Honeslty I was excited to get this</li>
            <li>I originally got these to do nailart</li>
            <li>The up side first these are cute</li>
            <li>i was excited</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll post some pics when I do my nails next! :) Love them!</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>4 unique hearts&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li>I love these so much!</li>
            <li>Very cheap and nice quality overall!</li>
            <li>They are easy and are fun.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, fun and flirty.  </li>
            <li>Great / fun designs in terrific colors.  </li>
            <li>The canes are tiny but that&#x27;s good because the designs aren&#x27;t guady and will fit on all nail sizes.</li>
            <li>How they get these cool designs on these little canes is incredible.</li>
            <li>This was adorable and I had sooo much fun trimming and getting them all ready to put on my nails!</li>
            <li>They are pretty fun and better than any stickers they sell now.</li>
            <li>The shipping was faster than expected and the quality was great.</li>
            <li>I personally think they came out great for my first try.</li>
            <li>She is able to apply by herself and they stay on very well.  </li>
            <li>i thought but good overall</li>
            <li>This is such a good deal.  </li>
            <li>I counted the items and did not receive the full count of 100.</li>
            <li>I sliced one full cane.</li>
            <li>These were all almost a full inch.</li>
            <li>All in all worth the cheap price.</li>
            <li>anyway they are gorgeous and if I ever run out I will definitely order again.  </li>
            <li>No questions asked just apology straight across the table give them some more time</li>
            <li>I really thought they were cute</li>
            <li>Im not saying that you shouldn&#x27;t buy these products, cause they really are cute.</li>
            <li>she say everything straight she really love it  for her jobs</li>
            <li>and there was 100 cute designs but way to much flowers and fruits</li>
            <li>These arrived early and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>Thought these looked interesting but the description doesn&#x27;t really explain how they worked.  </li>
            <li>Designs look better in Real life</li>
            <li>but the designs are really cool.</li>
            <li>, i loved how i got 100 different designs.</li>
            <li>Overall, these seem like a good product but not at all what I had</li>
            <li>The only problem is that a good portion of them are unusable.  </li>
            <li>Some of the canes that i received were cut off and the full picture was not on them.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use a straight razor or ecacto knife to cut the stick rods.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old daughter bought these with her own money.  </li>
            <li>but overall there was a good variety.  </li>
            <li>Overall a really good buy</li>
            <li>there were definitely a cool idea i purchased them for a member of the family</li>
            <li>They are so cute and work really well.</li>
            <li>The graphics are very detailed and vibrant.  </li>
            <li>but they&#x27;ve been pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li>other than that great value.</li>
            <li>All my other orders came and I was happy with what I did recieve.</li>
            <li>Okay... so I am new to the nail art world!  </li>
            <li>:) i had one fall of yesterday, and all i have to do is cut a new piece and tada!</li>
            <li>I love these and hope to get more designs in the future, but I&#x27;m probably set for life with all the ones I have just from this package</li>
            <li>We do suggest painting a clear top coat of polish over the nail art to secure.</li>
            <li>These arrived quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>I am amateur at best, and I just really wanted to give these a try!  </li>
            <li>I did not get the hello kitty (or the similar version of the hello kitty rod), no flag, no fish, and did not get most of the cute bows they have on the pictures.  </li>
            <li>Great variety you get butterflies, fruit, Hello Kitty, flowers, biscuit, bows and more can&#x27;t go wrong love love them and this seller ships fast came in a plastic sealed bag inside a box</li>
            <li>Most likely buying more soon.&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li>and how she applied her artistic skills.</li>
            <li>Mostly, I got flowers and fruits, but most of the fruits were dragonfruit in different colors.</li>
            <li>Received it in the mail quick.</li>
            <li>but you will definitely fall in love with many of them.</li>
            <li>So many different designs and you can use things for so many things.  </li>
            <li>However, I did get mostly flowers which is cute enough for me!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using super glue to keep them on longer.</li>
            <li>but I did catch on quickly.</li>
            <li>It ends up peeling rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any repeats and they came really quick.</li>
            <li>Well worth spending a tad extra to ensure a good haul.  </li>
            <li>The designs are very cute and they have some similar designs</li>
            <li>, I got them quickly, and super fun</li>
            <li>My clients are happy now your nails look nicer with less effort</li>
            <li>/&gt;  fun and artistic value</li>
            <li>and I thought they were the long big ones, but they are still the perfect size for what I&#x27;m gonna use them for(:</li>
            <li>but you really need to cut them super fine with a blade.</li>
            <li>All kinds of fruit butterflies flowers and even the one I really wanted a hello kitty!!</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited when I read all the reviews and saw the pictures others posted about not having any duplicates with these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently wearing the cupcakes that came with it, and they are so cute!</li>
            <li>I wish the Hello Kitty was actually in the collection I received , But I will order more!</li>
            <li>it cause that means I can put them on my real nails &amp; acryllic!!</li>
            <li>and they are tiny and cute!</li>
            <li>I love those cute little rods, its easy to slice with a penknife.</li>
            <li>you get 100 different cute designs that go from flowers, bugs, hearts, food, kittys, all in the cutest colors.&lt;br /&gt;The sticks are easy to cut and you just use nail glue to stick it on your nail.</li>
            <li>There was a wide variety of designs and colors, my clients who enjoy bolder nail art love them!  </li>
            <li>i got them all only one was defective but other than that they are beautiful designs and you have to cut them :)</li>
            <li>These little canes are great</li>
            <li>let.me calm down,lol.</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>they are nice, the only  thing i cut them to thick,so i prefer the pre-cut</li>
            <li>I wish I could buy something to help me make thin &amp; perfect cuts each and every time.</li>
            <li>The most frequent design I got with my purchase was a butterfly.</li>
            <li>I love these and will most likely be ordering more for some birthday gifts in the future!</li>
            <li>you will need a blade, which can be found at hair stores like sally or weave places, but worth it.</li>
            <li>, I was truly amazed how much fun she had</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve recently gotten into doing my own nails.</li>
            <li>It is fun to experiment with on your nails.</li>
            <li>They are nice but some of them have same shapes</li>
            <li>They went on OK with clear polish over gel manicure.</li>
            <li>All in all, these are worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>so when these came in the mail I knew I wasn&#x27;t getting my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t worth returning since they took around 3-4 weeks to get to me</li>
            <li>I found that working with premade canes save a lot time and fun to do for kids and adults .</li>
            <li>I thought they would be a fun addition to just painting her nails.</li>
            <li>A lot of fun.  </li>
            <li>It was very helpful it gives it a pop design many different types of rods also many colors fruit and animal&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>These are a lot of fun for my kids.</li>
            <li>So worth the price.</li>
            <li>worth every penny</li>
            <li>So much fun.</li>
            <li>Plus its nice to have such a assortment of colors and designs and even holidays all in one package.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the buy</li>
            <li>I was able to get mine to stick on my nails over a coat of wet polish followed by top coat.</li>
            <li>Fun to work with.  </li>
            <li>It takes a while to cut them but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>then it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li>She likes to have nice nails and play around with different polishes and stuff</li>
            <li>If you like to do fun things for yourself or others</li>
            <li>They are worth every cent.</li>
            <li>Nice for anyone who needs tiny accents.  </li>
            <li>I do have duplicates but they are really cute and for the price, you can&#x27;t really complain too much.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m looking forward to creating fun designs with them.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend them to anyone who wants to be creative :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price if you do a lot of nail designs.</li>
            <li>Awesome product, just use a razor to cut them thin</li>
            <li>Once you learn how to slice these correctly they are a lot of fun to play around with.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fun to cut them...sharing some for my nieces...</li>
            <li>, the more often I cut a partial slice, but the more slices I get.</li>
            <li>It is all worth it</li>
            <li>They are un-cut sticks, so you will need your own good blade to slice these thinly</li>
            <li>These were fun to use and added an unexpected pop to an otherwise plain manicure.&lt;br /&gt;These are best cut to size with a razor blade.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice to have them in the roll so that you don&#x27;t lose a bunch of little pieces.  </li>
            <li>better than buying them separate, just make sure you have a sharp blade or a knife to cut them yourself.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li>I would definitley invest in these if you want to have fun with new nail designs, there incredibly easy to use.</li>
            <li>But other than that it is a good purchase for an affordable price.</li>
            <li>It is a very good price and the quality its not great but not bad at all.</li>
            <li>so she can get to work painting and applying right after dividing the categories.</li>
            <li>RIGHT.</li>
            <li>Arrived right on time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Worse, they are ALL Halloween designs, which isn&#x27;t in season at all right now.</li>
            <li>I just cut a cane and put it on right then.</li>
            <li>yes thats right 17,</li>
            <li>I caught right on as to how to cut them.</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>Very satisfied and arrived much sooner than final date</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Hello kitty and that was one of the main reasons why I ordered this one..</li>
            <li>while i did get my full 100 sticks, i got a lot of duplicates, not just 2 of certain sticks</li>
            <li>So I only gave these 4 stars because I like the ones from bundle monster more because the designs are more vivid.</li>
            <li>This product workks great and even though the rods are small they make a lot if you cut them right.</li>
            <li>usually that doesnt happen but everything was in great condition and on time.</li>
            <li>The idea is great but to cut these sticks into small even pieces need some skills &amp; time.</li>
            <li>It really looks like they just cut a full size cane in three.</li>
            <li>Some of them you can&#x27;t tell what is it for :/, but I&#x27;m happy with some of the shapes..</li>
            <li>I was able to give some of them (mostly the 20 different butterfly designs) to my room mate and the rest I gave to my 12yr old cousin</li>
            <li>I was happy with some of them but not most.</li>
            <li>Really good quality, seem to be lasting on my nail really well, and you get SO much for your money.</li>
            <li>I especially like the flower canes, very pretty and go with many nail polish colors.</li>
            <li>So many little sticks with the most adorible clay pictures.</li>
            <li>I love them, shipping was fast way better than the others over 30 days for the other ones.</li>
            <li>Not only did they ship incredibly fast, but the product quality is amazing.</li>
            <li>Looks great...got it super fast.  </li>
            <li>Great variety of designs and colors, but be prepared to do your own cutting.</li>
            <li>These are soft and easy to cut.  </li>
            <li>All the designs were very clear and detailed.</li>
            <li>Other than that they cut perfectly fine and are really cute.</li>
            <li>Also, some were harder to cut then others, but boy were they adorable!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying a nature theme on my left hand and summer fruit on my right.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>it came very fast and no doubles</li>
            <li>I tried slicing one with a scalpel (I had one I never used from an old Bio lab class) and that seemed to work fine.  </li>
            <li>Each stick is about two inches long, and are very easy to cut with a razor blade.</li>
            <li>They Are very Very easy to cut, They are about 7 cm long.</li>
            <li>All and all, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay very much for them and had I actually seen the product at the store, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it at this price.  </li>
            <li>I thought they were a little bigger when I bought them, but now after using them, I am happy they are smaller, they fit on the nail much better.  </li>
            <li>First off, I have never used any sort of fimo art before and have never cut up fimo sticks.</li>
            <li>I did not receive any duplicates and I received exactly 100 sticks.</li>
            <li>Many of them are flowers, butterflies, fruit, and food related.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>Product came in the exact condition as described.  </li>
            <li>Some design examples are fruit, butterflies, dragonfly (my favorite), flowers, stars, american flag, smilies, some abstract.  </li>
            <li>The canes are even all the way through, and the lengths are pretty consistent.</li>
            <li>but you can order about 10 fimo blades for 2 dollars on ebay so its not expensive.</li>
            <li>Designs were cute, but only lasted a day before they started falling off.  </li>
            <li>You will not get exactly the same canes pictured, but they are still cute.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have my heart set on getting exactly what&#x27;s in the picture.  </li>
            <li>The product was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>These sticks will last us a lifetime with so many designs.  </li>
            <li>I love this canes especially for the price!  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I got about 4 or 5 flags, and only one would I use.&lt;br /&gt;Not too many repeats.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I recommend you do that first, because you will invest some time on prepping before applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>count was exactly 100 which follows as:&lt;br /&gt;33 flowers, no doubles or damaged</li>
            <li>Better than going to your local store and trying to get this many sticks for the same price.  </li>
            <li>wish I had read more comments before I ordered and picked the ones actually sold by MASH.</li>
            <li>First they didn&#x27;t come in a mash package.</li>
            <li>TOO MANY OF THE SAME THING</li>
            <li>but Im glad I purchased them because theyre not as big as I thought or as the picture shows.</li>
            <li>many different fruits...</li>
            <li>I am going to share with my younger cousins who love to do their nails, too.</li>
            <li>I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t get a hello kitty, because I really wanted one, but I did!</li>
            <li>2 bows pink and red perfect for hello kitty designs for young girls.</li>
            <li>They are so cute and pretty simple</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>They also arrived pretty fast!</li>
            <li>Love the different designs ! .</li>
            <li>I recommend these fimo canes to anyone who wants to try slicing fimo themselves instead of buying those expensives pre cut ones!</li>
            <li>exactly what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Advertised exactly as you would get them.  </li>
            <li>These are very well made and what an assortment!  </li>
            <li>Overall, I would recommend this item and just hope they get 100pcs and the Hello Kitty stick :-)</li>
            <li>but this is my first time purchasing this</li>
            <li>Here is an exact list of which sticks I got in my package:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many different designs.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of different designs and most are things you would use on your nails.</li>
            <li>Gonna need some practice, thankfully there are more than enough of them to practice on considering some of them, I would never wear.</li>
            <li>That&#x27; the one I used first.</li>
            <li>so I had to cut them for her at first, no problem.</li>
            <li>I thought that they would of been longer and bigger for some reason, but it ok.</li>
            <li>but they fell of within the first 30 min.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more canes from Mash, and Mash only!</li>
            <li>These rods are very tiny but so cute.  </li>
            <li>I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THESE!!!  :-)</li>
            <li>I was expecting many different canes as shown in the photo, but what I got was 100 canes of Halloween designs?!</li>
            <li>This was the first time I&#x27;d ever gotten these</li>
            <li>i just got into doing nails and was looking at this, iffy at first</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t exactly do the prettiest job</li>
            <li>Please be aware they may only be 100 of the one inch canes although there were some cute designs I would not repurchase.</li>
            <li>They are exactly as described, and arrived unharmed in any way.</li>
            <li>Not angry birds and halloween...</li>
            <li>I put a picture in the pictures from customers showing exactly what I got.</li>
            <li>These were the first fimo sticks I bought.  </li>
            <li>I really hope so!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Keeping the three stars because first order was not what I ordered.</li>
            <li>I do however believe that fimo art is great and this are nice stick rods but next time I would order from another seller just to see how designs differ since I will only be using about half of these rods.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re okay with only getting a little over half of them in usable condition, then definitely go for it, they cut easy, stay on great, and look super cute.</li>
            <li>I thought it was pretty easy to apply the designs to my nails, the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that while I was doing laundry the designs would get stuck when I would try to turn socks inside right and pull at my nails.</li>
            <li>We did get a few sticks that were partially deformed in the middle, but most of them were perfect throughout the stick.  </li>
            <li>Would have been nice though since I&#x27;ve seen other people getting 3 or 4 of them.  </li>
            <li>The size was consistent, there were no doubles in color for any one design, the material is a nice quality as far as durability, and it seems to be lasting.</li>
            <li>A couple were strangely hard, and would not slice properly but it was maybe 4 out of 100 so still very good quality!</li>
            <li>smaller then I thought but it&#x27;s ok , fast shipping</li>
            <li>I love this product so much and will definitely buy again soon.</li>
            <li>desserts  and a ton of charming random ones :)</li>
            <li>At first I thought these were large plastic sticks,</li>
            <li>I finally decided to take another chance &amp; see if these would be better; when I recieved them, the first thing I noticed is that they are beautifully vibrant in color.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s obviously the right size to fit your nail</li>
            <li>Positive transaction.  </li>
            <li>I warmed them first in my hand for a minute or so, which made slicing them much easier.</li>
            <li>There are a few of them that i would never ever use, but other than those, it&#x27;s a wonderful collection of fimo rods.</li>
            <li>I was expecting them to be bigger, but other than that it was great.</li>
            <li>Pretty fast delivery too.</li>
            <li>They are 2 inches long and multiples of most of the designs.</li>
            <li>First of all, I ordered these straight from the Mash website which I found by shopping on Amazon, but couldn&#x27;t find a way to review on their website</li>
            <li>, I just wanted a few more unique sticks), I ended getting a $1 refund.  </li>
            <li>Little girls will really love them!</li>
            <li>Since most of the reviewers mentioned 2 inch long canes, that is really what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely not going to be easy to use for the beginners ..</li>
            <li>and they are easy to put on (I just use a pair of regular tweezers).</li>
            <li>liked then very much could use some different designs, maybe 5/100 were the same designs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using an x-acto knife for slicing, I&#x27;m able to get them into very thin slices, which is perfect for nails, as well as for a variety of other craft projects</li>
            <li>This set should last a good long time!</li>
            <li>AND it uses less clay which means more fun.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mixed bag of designs, which suits me fine.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s actually 100 different cute designs!</li>
            <li>I mainly ordered this for the frog that was shown in all three pictures right on top of all the other ones.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, and my little sister and my cousins had me put these all over there nails.</li>
            <li>They even include a little razor blade cutter which is nice.  </li>
            <li>I received quite a few fruits and lots of different flower designs, which was fine for me because I liked the ones I got</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure my 14 year old will be smart enough to figure them out, but never having used them, we have no idea</li>
            <li>This wouldn&#x27;t have been a huge issue if they had the package in a box that sealed entirely.  </li>
            <li>you get a huge variety of different shapes and designs including: animals -pigs, chickens, cats, butterflies, dragon flies, hello kitty, rabbits ducks...</li>
            <li>OK the designs are nice but difficult to use.  </li>
            <li>I really had no idea</li>
            <li>Will absolutely order these again.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Not 100 pieces but very close.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute on some of the designs, but is harder to do.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really review on that</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>All the pieces are small enough to fit on your nails, they are very cute.  </li>
            <li>Reasonable in price</li>
            <li>They are great and if you slice them thin you could get a lot of them.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t mind as much.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;d be but it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference.</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t really care</li>
            <li>I now have some pink stars on my toes and lots of cute decorations for all my art and crafts.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>you all are so zoomed up on these that it makes it seem like you are really getting something.</li>
            <li>you should really show a pic of what they look like when the package comes as well as the close ups to show the details.</li>
            <li>Fast and speedy shipping.</li>
            <li>This will please a very picky person.</li>
            <li>And it is very cheaper than i saw in a Mall.</li>
            <li>it never came the day I reported it and ask for assistance something else was mailed in the mail straight to me.</li>
            <li>She looked like she was having so much fun that my 12 year old</li>
            <li>/&gt;Warning: two came distorted, one some what broken but the rest were in great shape.</li>
            <li>I wish I could add a pic of my nails because I really like it.</li>
            <li>so are not something you&#x27;d really want to use.  </li>
            <li>A real rip off.</li>
            <li>I will def buy these from this seller again.. highly recommended!  </li>
            <li>This was totally worth the price, coming from a 14 year old.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping ......</li>
            <li>I ordered these not expecting much from it.</li>
            <li>I like the Nail Art set and thanks for the razor blade.</li>
            <li>Very well priced.</li>
            <li>There is so much.</li>
            <li>The fruit ones look like real fruit.</li>
            <li>, it makes it a whole lot easier.</li>
            <li>The product arrived fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>i dont use them as much as i thought i would</li>
            <li>Packaged well, shipped fast.</li>
            <li>They all really like the &amp;#34;stickers&amp;#34; I can put on them.</li>
            <li>I really think they should add a kiwi in it though.</li>
            <li>These shipped fairly fast and when they arrived I wanted to test them out.</li>
            <li>Much to my liking, almost all of the types of fimo shown was what I got.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using a razor blade to cut them works really well</li>
            <li>It took me the whole weekend to slice them all up, but now that it&#x27;s done, can&#x27;t wait to start using them.  </li>
            <li>Now i have a million of these things and can&#x27;t really use them.</li>
            <li>i dont even need that much.</li>
            <li>i had really been hoping for some bows and hello kitty, butterflies, hearts or animals.</li>
            <li>they are ready for me.</li>
            <li>and i can&#x27;t really use them because i don&#x27;t know what they are.</li>
            <li>I was to fast with the purchase and didn&#x27;t pay attention on how to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but i really like them and would buy them again.</li>
            <li>Just got these today, and I really like them.</li>
            <li>They were in great condition, none were broken or damaged</li>
            <li>harder to cut than I anticipated, but still cute designs.</li>
            <li>really am thankful for that whim because I adore these sticks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I can&#x27;t imagine that I&#x27;ll use all of these within my lifetime, I&#x27;m already looking for a completely different selection to add to my available choices.</li>
            <li>and they stay in place for lengths at a time depending on the over coat you use,how much you use, and</li>
            <li>SO I&#x27;d say this assortment really has something for everyone.</li>
            <li>I will reorder when needed, thanks again</li>
            <li>My girls also think it&#x27;s a cute decoration for French tips and clear coated nails.</li>
            <li>The designs are really cool and some of them were so small, but still so detailed, that I was amazed!</li>
            <li>Offers many different choices in nail art.</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying that they gave me a nice variety (with a few repeats) and they also included the slicing tool.</li>
            <li>I was very exited to get this product in the mail today, though the shipping took 5 more days than expected</li>
            <li>I will order the next set directly from MASH and hope for better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The designs are very cute and these will probably last her a very long time.</li>
            <li>Be the first to use this new nail art.</li>
            <li>It was all true to picture, they are tiny enough to fit on your nails and cheap enough to start practicing with.</li>
            <li>I ordered more canes from other vendors so I could get the ones I Really want.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use some of the designs like the Mexican flag or the Chinese flag, but they were still pretty cute.  </li>
            <li>the designs are a little bit more crisp.</li>
            <li>These designs are really cute, but you have to be VERY skilled with a razor to get the slices so thin and even that they are pliable enough to curve to the shape of your nail and stick.  </li>
            <li>In general i love fimo canes i have purchased them from amazon 3 x all from different sellers</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m happy with the product, and disappointed with the packaging......and somewhat satisfied with Amazon&#x27;s customer service.  </li>
            <li>: I recommend nail glue to keep this lil designs in place because my daughter said a topclear coat will not hold them in place more than a day for active kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sticks are pretty stiff, so she wasn&#x27;t able to cut them with an exact-o knife by herself.  </li>
            <li>Since i use these on my natural nails, i found it best to cut them as thin as possible.</li>
            <li>Someone should definitely create a full alphabet and numbers set from A-Z a-z and 0-9.</li>
            <li>It made about 40 full slices, but i messed up on 10 &#x3D; 50 total bc the messed up ones can be used on the corner of the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is true that these are smaller than 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, I prefer the Full sized canes over the pre-cut as, They only give you 10-15 Slices in pre-cut.</li>
            <li>While using full canes you can get 80-100 slices for the same or lower price!</li>
            <li>My first ones were a little uneven and chunky, but the more I cut the thinner and more</li>
            <li>i would much rather pay a little more money</li>
            <li>I received a good variety of canes with only a couple duplicates and one orange that did get a little mushed on one end.  </li>
            <li>Due to I love to try new things</li>
            <li>None the less I love each design.</li>
            <li>I have gotten WAY MORE for MUCH LESS on Ebay.</li>
            <li>More than half the \\&quot;dupes\\&quot; are okkk.  </li>
            <li>I was super stoked to see that they included two DIFFERENT designs of Hello Kitty.</li>
            <li>I expected it to be bigger and that&#x27;s honestly what I wanted but</li>
            <li>For somethig like this you would need a steady hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A lot of butterflies which I dont particularly like</li>
            <li>Only 3 stars because of getting too many of the same sticks.</li>
            <li>Overall, the quality was okay, and I only had a couple repeats.</li>
            <li>I quickly got a rythm and was using them the same day they arrived and got plenty of compliments.</li>
            <li>I have a few repeats but they are in different sizes, but I can&#x27;t complain the variety is really good.</li>
            <li>And a steady hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just ordered these nail sticks a few days ago,and they were shipped way faster than expected which was great.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more of these in the future for all of our hobbies.</li>
            <li>Vibrant colors and high detail.  </li>
            <li>The seller supplied me with a razor, which I thought was very considerate, and they arrived about a week early!</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy from this seller and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Ordering from Mash set the bar really high for me.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t look like MASH products but are a very good imitation to say the least.  </li>
            <li>Cute little rods.  </li>
            <li>I would pay a little more for that.</li>
            <li>and I do many manicures on little girls.</li>
            <li>the girls are having a hard time they dont know how to use them,no directions it would be nice if you had directions.</li>
            <li>These fimo canes are really amazing, they maybe tiny, but they really do the trick when you want to give your nails a little pop.</li>
            <li>They seemed kinda hard at first and I wasn&#x27;t sure they would cut</li>
            <li>they are all cute, but I expected at least some of the cute one pictured.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought these for my sister who is obsessed with nail polish, and I was decently happy with the quality of them.  </li>
            <li>There are too many childish designs.</li>
            <li>The canes are about 100 in total and one or two are distorted but still useful -- resulting in 30 slices instead of 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think we will have some fun with them maybe incorporating them into various craft projects and will try them out on a toenail or two.</li>
            <li>There were quite a few repeats, I was hoping for more of a variety.</li>
            <li>, thei are realy small and good for the nails, i dont think i will ever need to buy it again, but i would absolutly buy if needed, later i take a picture of it!</li>
            <li>I did use paint on nail glue to adhere them to my nails adding a glossy top coat every few days.</li>
            <li>I wish it had come with instructions and a few inspirational pictures.</li>
            <li>a few were shorter than the others but they are cute</li>
            <li>they shipped fast and are very easy to use but the reason i did not give it 5 stars is because they are very small and not all are cut even</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard and it saves a ton of money.</li>
            <li>It is not hard to cut, we  just used a razor (not included).  </li>
            <li>so I expected them to be made of soft rubber that would be easy to slice.</li>
            <li>- the range seems to be 50-100, depending on the cane and how brave I feel about slicing very thin --</li>
            <li>Depending on how thin you are able to cut them, and if its for your own personal use, these will probably last a lifetime, haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These included sticks with large holes in them, twists and warping throughout the product, and some that were stuck together (such as two dragonflies that were connected because they weren&#x27;t cut or something, and when I went to pull them apart (gently)</li>
            <li>I dont know about them because i bought it for another person live in another country</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still rather new to using fimo canes for nail art</li>
            <li>Live and learn</li>
            <li>Love these new little decorations I just found out about!</li>
            <li>There is such a huge combination of different fimos in this package.</li>
            <li>They were smaller than expected, but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind that there are a few sticks I don&#x27;t like, because there are far more that I do like a lot.</li>
            <li>Smaller than I expected from looking at the pics, but they are cute.</li>
            <li>I love these little things!</li>
            <li>Very clear.</li>
            <li>VERY FAST SHIPPING EARLIER THAN ESTIMATE</li>
            <li>I am New to doing Gel and Acrilic Nails, I recently purchased The IBD gel kit and Many other idems along with these.</li>
            <li>it is kind of hard to get them cut straight enough</li>
            <li>It is epic!</li>
            <li>I received a lot of repetitive rods.. many watermelons.  </li>
            <li>BUT... it&#x27;s all about my not so awesome cutting skills, and has NOTHING to do with the quality of the product!</li>
            <li>This size makes about 50 small slices for each stick, if sliced appropriately -- which takes some practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plan on coming back updating after I have had my first experience with them.</li>
            <li>They came in a small plastic bag, which I was satisfied with.</li>
            <li>This was my first time seeing or using fimo fruits and I almost never got them because I dont like big bulky things on my nails</li>
            <li>Bigger than most of the other, sticks that are out there</li>
            <li>I got 100 like advertised and only had 2 canes that were exact duplicates.</li>
            <li>Totally amazed how fast the shipping was from Hong Kong!</li>
            <li>There are too many repetitive designs as well.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend these for anyone interested in nail art.</li>
            <li>They were really cute and came way earlier than expected!</li>
            <li>Since there are so many I&#x27;m not sure I will ever use all of them and may share them.</li>
            <li>Will definitely come back here and get them  from here when I need more in the future.</li>
            <li>, i got 7 of the exact same orange slices sticks.</li>
            <li>there was 3 of and one there was 7 of the exact same cane.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get any canes that were damaged or deformed in any way, and they are all recognizable, if at times a bit quirky (I&#x27;m not sure when I might need or want a hardboiled egg or cupcakes, but they are awfully cute</li>
            <li>my 7 year old loves these on her nails!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re good quality, too, and I only got a few that are markedly similar to others in the group.</li>
            <li>Although the canes are \\&quot;unique\\&quot;, the colors were not vibrant and the designs were not clear and there were too many duplicates in the order I received.  </li>
            <li>They are much smaller than I expected, especially because my big fingernails, but they are still a good size to place on, and it leaves a lot of room.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I got these to use with my 11 year old little sister from Big Brothers Big Sisters and was very excited after reading some of the reviews on this page, however, after a long wait for them to arrive, many of the sticks were damaged and almost to completely unusable.</li>
            <li>Although, I did get repetitive rods, and missing the rods that I wanted, I am happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>They stayed on for more than a week, as long as I would have expected any polish to stand up.</li>
            <li>Wow I&#x27;m so surprised I got this item today wasn&#x27;t exspecting it till New Year&#x27;s Eve</li>
            <li>/&gt;Things I don&#x27;t like: loooong shipping time, odd chemical smell of the sticks, a few repeats and a few damaged sticks, and not the best packaging.</li>
            <li>so if you have little girls dont worry they will fit on their nails</li>
            <li>I LIKED THE VERY LEAST AND SLICED UNTIL I GOT IT</li>
            <li>but what they don&#x27;t tell you is that they cut the original cane in half.</li>
            <li>I will read the profile a little more carefully next time.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these along with other Mash products and they came quick and packaged</li>
            <li>but it was so hard since they are all so cute.</li>
            <li>And overal the colors of many of the sticks were washed out and dull.</li>
            <li>Cute, Not to hard to work with.</li>
            <li>To be honest I slice half of my canes to give to my friends, not the other way around.</li>
            <li>However, clear nail polish does not hold the design on longer then two days.</li>
            <li>And the clear baggie not saying MASH on it</li>
            <li>You will need clear nail polish and razor blade.</li>
            <li>And two coats of Seche clear</li>
            <li>But since the patterns are clear I can still use them for my cards.  </li>
            <li>I used clear cut under and over them.</li>
            <li>It was packaged in a MASH container, the canes were clear and the colors</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my 19 year old daughter</li>
            <li>My 11 yr old daughter loves them.</li>
            <li>I bought them for my 6yr old daughter who loves doing her nails.  </li>
            <li>There is something for everyone from pre school to adult.</li>
            <li>adult supervision recommended)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this, it is smaller than your pinky finger and very skinny.</li>
            <li>no directions this came in a week but does not work don&#x27;t waste your money they are cheap but not for something the girls wont use.</li>
            <li>Professional service.</li>
            <li>I had really wanted the strawberry, hello kitty, frog, and a different variety of fruits, but I didn&#x27;t get them.</li>
            <li>but geez they could have at least been all diffrent, most of them were repeated</li>
            <li>I bought these for my 14 year old who loves to do her nails.</li>
            <li>gift for young cousin</li>
            <li>I bought them for my 8 year old daughter</li>
            <li>I will be ordering this item again in the near furture, since my daughter and I change our nails once a week.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t like it when they stick really far off the nail) as I imagined</li>
            <li>(only takes a few seconds), then I paint over  it well with clear top coat.</li>
            <li>They came a day early</li>
            <li>So I have to think these are intended for tweens and young teens.  </li>
            <li>We will have an adult cut them</li>
            <li>Arrived early but not in time for Christmas which I knew.  </li>
            <li>As someone else said in another review, I would probably buy them directly from MASH if I was going to buy them again.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t completely sliced any of my canes</li>
            <li>I got mostly the same ones, just a few differences.</li>
            <li>Lots of cute patterns, bears, chococat, watermelons, strawberries, cherries, a few different styles of flowers.</li>
            <li>They all loved them, don&#x27;t get me wrong..</li>
            <li>Ok now this 3D nail art is annoying to Dads but for Moms and  Daughters they are LOVING the 3D art.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok as you don&#x27;t need to cut them thick as you are housing on your nails just for the design.</li>
            <li>There easy to use as long as u have a cutting board and some kind of razor.</li>
            <li>For some reason, I thought they were going to be as long as pencils, but it&#x27;s more like half..</li>
            <li>If you love nail art and buy almost everything in site... do not look past these!</li>
            <li>no instrutions,so no idea how to use and Im sure we needed some other part to use this product.not enough research about the  produce totally my fault.</li>
            <li>Even though they are small all of the patterns are easy to see.  </li>
            <li>I got 91 - almost a full 10% less than what&#x27;s claimed.</li>
            <li>So they are basically giving you half a product but making you pay full price.</li>
            <li>I bought these thinking that it would be cool to have little designs on my nails, but no matter what type of blade I use to cut them, they are never thin enough.  </li>
            <li>it is very handy for cutting them.</li>
            <li>They are very small, but they are cute.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have a hard time because I plan on getting a cigar cutter to see if that will work better than the single sided blade..</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get the cat, bow, ying yang, peace sign and several others, its cheap but its not worth a penny of my money or time.</li>
            <li>so im kinda upset since the blue bow is the main reason i bought the sticks anyway</li>
            <li>I got 4 exact watermelons (same color and same shape).  </li>
            <li>The only \\&quot;fault\\&quot; or issue I had was with my not so awesome cutting skills!</li>
            <li>They supply a razor blade and the sticks are very easy to shave off thin slices.</li>
            <li>I recommend a good sharp knife with a cutting board under it, and you better be ready to spend a few hours if you&#x27;re doing all of the sticks at once</li>
            <li>There is one little stick that is considerably smaller than the others, but overall they are better</li>
            <li>These are VERY cute, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but unless you have a really sharp razor blade and a bit of patience, these may not be right for you.</li>
            <li>long nosed tweezer can be very helpful for placement.  </li>
            <li>This is a great idea but they are very difficult to cut.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fourth, you really need a thin razor to get the precision you need to slice as many as possible.</li>
            <li>The order was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I try and slice them as thin as possible takes a little practice but not impossible and apply with clear top coat usually applying two coats to make sure they stick around my nail for a while.</li>
            <li>A few of the rods had large chunks out of them, and some of the pictures don&#x27;t come out straight.  </li>
            <li>you only live once.  </li>
            <li>Wow...these are so cute they are the size of a cigarette slightly smaller in length, small enough to fit even small nails</li>
            <li>also I just likely will start with my least favorite and practice, practice, practice.  </li>
            <li>If you cut them thicker they are too chunky and will fall off (and if they don&#x27;t fall off they look kind of weird sticking out that far off of your nail).</li>
            <li>They are pretty dense and hard to slice, so make sure you have a VERY VERY sharp tool!</li>
            <li>I only received one damaged stick, and it was only damaged in a small spot, so I&#x27;m not terribly worried about it.</li>
            <li>How would you feel if you payed for a full cup of coffee and only got half?</li>
            <li>I am new to these so the one that I was least impressed with I used for practice cutting.</li>
            <li>The canes are high quality because the whole canes is even unlike other where the cane is a a different size on each end.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m upset, everyone posted they got, the normal full size canes mine are tiny less then an inch long and it over two months before I got them.</li>
            <li>Fun little item for the price.</li>
            <li>I have a nice sharp razor blade that I use to slice them, and it helps to make them as paper thin as possible or they&#x27;ll look really bulky on your nails.</li>
            <li>and I ended up cutting them and fell in love with the cute little designs.  </li>
            <li>They are small enough that they even fit on my pinkie nail.</li>
            <li>The rods are exactly 2 inches long each, so don&#x27;t expect them to be as long as they look on the pictures.  </li>
            <li>Still trying to get the hang of cutting them without it looking like an axe murderer did it but for the most part they&#x27;re exactly as I thought they&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li>One caveat is that the sticks must be sliced paper-thin with a razor, so adult participation is necessary.</li>
            <li>Got these for my ten year old daughter for Christmas, as I thought they&#x27;d be easier to use than air brush nail design kits.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what I expected</li>
            <li>each and the diameter is barely 1/4&amp;#34; so beware of that.  </li>
            <li>Got them in and surprised to get 2 different bags inside my order.</li>
            <li>but when i received it i wuz like O_O</li>
            <li>ordered a second set of rods directly from MASH.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time trying out fimo sticks, so they were smaller than i expected when I received them.</li>
            <li>I used a x-acto knife to make sure to cut thin pieces.</li>
            <li>I was able to use an exacto-knife to get some thin slices to use for nails.  </li>
            <li>Need to be sure and cut the decals thin</li>
            <li>These are also just the right size to be put on a little girl&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li>Plus if you don&#x27;t slice them just right and really thin, they look funny on your nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m considering ordering more but what this set will probably last me at least 5 years!</li>
            <li>4 of another orange slice, 4 of the exact same leaf, and 2-3 duplicates of a bunch of other sticks.</li>
            <li>its cute on the nails but is way smaller then it appears and very hard to cut and slice up.</li>
            <li>i got a few duplicates but still have a very large selection for my clients</li>
            <li>I used a Tomato knife to cut them and it was very clean and thin.</li>
            <li>They were to many alike, to many ugly fruit, and the canes were not worth the wait or the money.</li>
            <li>They showed up much quicker than other purchases that I have made.</li>
            <li>These little stickers are really cute and they come in a lot of designs although there&#x27;re a few of them</li>
            <li>I ordered another pack from amazon, because these were taking forever to get here, and there were 200 of them and not a single repeat in them at all</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll be able to salvage the sticks and use them for arts and crafts projects, but as nail design we just couldn&#x27;t get it thin enough to work.</li>
            <li>Cool assortment, no repeats, but they are very very short, maybe an inch to an inch and a half long.</li>
            <li>My favorites were her, a little pig, a panda bear, and a really pretty flower.</li>
            <li>I got a bunch of different designs [not the same as pictured, but still really cool] and my little cousins loves when I do her nails with cupcakes or snowmen!</li>
            <li>really hard to cut and smaller than expected really cute designs</li>
            <li>The order is split into ten smaller bags, all of completely the same design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine an adult walking around with 3d monkey</li>
            <li>These were my first set of canes and I didn&#x27;t have any trouble slicing.</li>
            <li>I received 33 of the same exact black and white square checker board print, 14 lady</li>
            <li>I love them all, my only complaint is that the shipment came later then expected</li>
            <li>I think others have mentioned this, but in order to avoid tons of duplicates or bad sticks (i.e. messed up &amp;#34;images&amp;#34;) be sure to order these from MASH.  </li>
            <li>I do not mind the small size as much as the fact that I did not get ANY where near the selection shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>All the girls did each other&#x27;s nails and had endless fun.  </li>
            <li>They are really easy to cut as thin as you need them</li>
            <li>So beware to kids because my daughter thought she could slice a few more when I stepped away and she ended up with a small slice on her finger instead.</li>
            <li>it would be okay for older kids but not for younger children unless your going to do the cutting.</li>
            <li>And half the designs are really cute and the other half I have no idea what they even are.</li>
            <li>they come uncut so you could slice them thick or thin,so easy to use just slice them with a razor I bought a cheap razor holder too</li>
            <li>There were a couple that I thought were a bit ugly, and one or two of the sticks were slightly bent out of shape (still completely usable though), but overall, I&#x27;m really happy with the assortment I got.</li>
            <li>Most of the canes are very small (extra small) and the rest are regular sized (still normal for fimo canes) and are 2 inches long.</li>
            <li>Kinda disappointing, so I was glad I hadn&#x27;t spent too much on them.</li>

            <li> The variety is amazing!</li>
            <li> But, I was able to re-slice them into halves and they worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I really liked these!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it takes a bit of practice before you can slice them perfectly</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, variety of these designs are truly remarkable.</li>

            <li> They are perfect for my crafting needs and will order more.</li>
            <li> Okay so I love Fimo Canes, YYYAAYYYY!!!!!</li>

            <li> My daughter loved it when she saw all the colors and designs</li>
            <li> The girls loved picking their sticks for me to cut decals for them.  </li>
            <li> but when I saw these nail stickers featured in Amazon I thought that they might be a good gift for a teenager for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a really good deal.  </li>
            <li> but they are good quality.</li>
            <li> Since this is a grab bag of sorts, there were some I loved (florals)</li>
            <li> Has Sought in Venezuela and can be sold at a good price</li>
            <li> quality product and good finishing recommend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other vendors and customers.</li>
            <li> good thing about this is they come wayyy faster then expect..</li>
            <li> My daughter loved these nail art pieces.</li>
            <li> There is a really good variety of these.  </li>
            <li> with good nail glue... they stay put..</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> Good buy.</li>
            <li> thats good because my wife use it</li>

            <li> I loved the variety of the designs.</li>
            <li> Good for the price though</li>
            <li> Good variety.</li>
            <li> There was a good variety of designs.  </li>
            <li> These canes are bright colored and of good quality.</li>
            <li> Theses are not as good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> but after all this is a good buy and I will buy is again..</li>

            <li> Our daughter loved the idea of the stickers</li>
            <li> The price was great and the items was nice, a lot of sticker choices.</li>
            <li> so they look good on your nail</li>
            <li> The girls LOVED them though.</li>
            <li> You have to have good dexterity to cut fimo canes to a thinness that would look good on your nails, so if you can&#x27;t cut good, don&#x27;t bother! :)</li>
            <li> They cut nicely and look amazing on acrylic nails!</li>
            <li> I am delighted with the quality and design selection -- no duplicates -- very cute designs.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery, awesome product.  </li>
            <li> They work best with nail glue as opposed to top coat but the top coat works well too.</li>
            <li> I liked a lot because they had flowers, butterflies and fruits that were perfect for summer and spring season, my daughter is doing beautiful decorations to all her friends at high school too!</li>
            <li> but the rest are great and very detailed.</li>
            <li> I received a bag of very cute designs.</li>

            <li> they are so cute!</li>
            <li> Gift that was enjoyed!</li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t tell you what they are, but i&#x27;m sure I can figure something out with them!</li>
            <li> and I just love them!</li>
            <li> They are just so cute and well made!</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and look great on my nails.</li>
            <li> When I brought them to school, everyone was thrilled, and there were so many!</li>
            <li> Very nice item and easy to use.</li>
            <li> this is a very good purchase for a very good price, however the reason i have to give this 4 stars instead of 5, is because my order only came with 97 sticks not 100, and one of those stick was chipped.</li>
            <li> The detail on some of them is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing .</li>
            <li> This Product is Amazing.</li>
            <li> (I used a couple flowers to decorate a miniature frame for a gift and they looked amazing for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sending gifts to my friends, it would be nice to atleast know how to use the product.</li>
            <li> Great quality, bright colors, fun design.</li>
            <li> For the price I am not going to complain, but the pictures aren&#x27;t all that good on  lot of these but still cute</li>
            <li> Was just what I wanted to help me do my own nails.</li>
            <li> my attempts at creating my own designs weren&#x27;t that great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing I love frogs.</li>
            <li> Girls are loving these.  </li>
            <li> They are creating their own designs and people are asking for orders from them to make .</li>
            <li> I really liked these.  </li>
            <li> but I hope it&#x27;s as nice as it looks</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know, gives it my own dimension based on how I cut it.</li>
            <li> I feel what worked best for me is to use nail glue when applying, they really dont fall off when using the nail glue.</li>
            <li> I like it makes my nails look nice</li>
            <li> But I did get ones that I liked and the razor that comes with</li>
            <li> in there own separate bags.</li>
            <li> I use a box cutter or a razor blade to cut the rods into my own desired thickness.</li>
            <li> Cute and good price</li>
            <li> /&gt;The canes were very well packaged and they were all perfect.</li>
            <li> I liked them</li>
            <li> I check how there were no doubles, but some of them were kind of deformed.</li>
            <li> Saving the fatter cuts for my toes and the thinner ones for a nice manicure.</li>
            <li> these are nice</li>
            <li> The end result is kind of tacky.  </li>
            <li> Would be nice if this came with a blade</li>
            <li> the variety is nice as is the price.</li>
            <li> Is nice but has to come sito</li>
            <li> Good for nails too :)</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I liked them a lot.  </li>
            <li> Loving it</li>
            <li> The have flowers stars even skulls which will come in handy on Halloween</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also interesting to note that, if sliced right, these seem to be reusable - which is completely awesome, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I got them fast, great quality, love them!!</li>
            <li> &gt; good quality, nice design, easy to use</li>
            <li> They came quickly and appear to be of great value.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re very easy to slice yourself.</li>
            <li> was very easy to order.</li>
            <li> yes i counted more than once to make sure!</li>
            <li> I am sure she will love this!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very cheap compared to the pre-sliced kind</li>
            <li> A very fun and easy way to create beautiful nails.  </li>
            <li> This are great takes some time to get the size you want som practice with the ones you don&#x27;t really like!!  </li>
            <li> I was looking for nail art for my 10 year old granddaughter&#x27;s birthday, and these were just perfect!  </li>
            <li> The fruit slices and smiley faces are nicely done and are cute</li>
            <li> so they will be smooth and look good.  </li>
            <li> As far as the images are, they are perfect.</li>
            <li> Instructions would have been nice but it doesn&#x27;t take a genius to google or youtube :)</li>
            <li> i would have liked more of a variety tho</li>
            <li> These a very cute and easy to apply to my nails.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE!</li>
            <li> Delivery was great not long at all, They are a GREAT BUY.</li>
            <li> wow lots of sticks, great graffics, so many uses, didnt expect that many for that great of price.</li>
            <li> but its a great product, very cute and colorful and not even one single repeat :D  </li>
            <li> Love these, they look great and are fun to use.</li>
            <li> I took the ones I liked the best and left them on the window sill on a sunny day to get them to soften up.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m pretty happy with them</li>
            <li> Very cute, huge variety</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s fine!</li>
            <li> The tips are pointy and very precise for placing the decals on.</li>
            <li> its very fun and very cute.</li>
            <li> You can make hundreds of cutest designs with these 100 rods of very detailed nail art. .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad Mash canes were my first experience with fimo because the others I have bought haven&#x27;t been so great.</li>
            <li> However, the quality of the pieces I did receive are nice as well as easy to cut.</li>
            <li> Because they&#x27;re so cheap and you get so many!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice value and great purchase for those who want to try something new for their nail art.</li>
            <li> my order was exactly as described easy to use and turned out beautiful</li>
            <li> AWESOME! got super fast and LOVE tem</li>
            <li> I really liked the fast shipping, nice packaging, and the many varieties!</li>
            <li> and also I ordered these because they had those cute hello kitty fimos</li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the repeats as they are really cute.</li>
            <li> and we BOTH love them.</li>
            <li> I love these sticks.  </li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> To adhere to the nail, just use your top coat.</li>
            <li> am quite sure that they just toss a handful from a &#x27;lot&#x27; into your order, so don&#x27;t rely on the stock image itself.</li>
            <li> -in-all, I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> My favorite are the fuit.  </li>
            <li> I think the thinner you slice them, the better they look.  </li>
            <li> Packaging was okay</li>
            <li> Some designs I wouldn&#x27;t use, but there are so many others to choose from.</li>
            <li> They look really cute on the nail.</li>
            <li> If she figures out a better way to make them work, I will let you know, but as of now I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have more control on the thickness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a bit dissapointed that I didn&#x27;t get more dessert/fruit shapes.</li>
            <li> I got mostly designs.</li>
            <li> There are many designs and colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> I really love them.  </li>
            <li> I think these are the most adorable things you could put on your nails.</li>
            <li> but it was ok</li>
            <li> but if I do I&#x27;ll be sure to order from MASH again :)</li>
            <li> The nailart sticks arrived quickly, nicely packaged, and my granddaughter was thrilled with the assortment of colorful designs.</li>
            <li> There are some that I don&#x27;t recognize, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a use for them.</li>
            <li> (just make sure you&#x27;re using a razor blade).</li>
            <li> I have a ton of duplicates but they&#x27;re mostly the cuter designs</li>
            <li> I thought they were more like those push up erasers.</li>
            <li> I counted and was shorted more than 20 sticks.    </li>
            <li> But after receiving the design stick rods, my curiosity got the better of me</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and will be glad to give it.</li>
            <li> came promptly, many cute selections.</li>
            <li> They love doing their nails.  </li>
            <li> but they love using them.  </li>
            <li> There are so many designs to choose from like butterflies, hearts, flags and much more.</li>
            <li> Dont use a top coat to attach these use Nail glue.</li>
            <li> I am happy with them and cant wait to put them on my childrens nails and one daughter had made me a list of the ones she wants on her nails.</li>
            <li> Wish me luck! :)</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase the one&#x27;s that are already pre sliced to see if that works better</li>
            <li> I really love thse</li>
            <li> How you guys have a better evening than I have.  </li>
            <li> -Vanessa! :)</li>
            <li> like most have said but</li>
            <li> all in all these are cute</li>
            <li> and I got some really cute ones.</li>
            <li> This selection was just okay for me ....</li>
            <li> It was okay for the price</li>
            <li> but I wish the selection would have been more varied.</li>
            <li> more than others (flags).  </li>
            <li> So, the products are OK, but I don&#x27;t know that I received the amount I had hoped.</li>
            <li> They have a bunch of cute designs in the pack.</li>
            <li> I just love everything I got :)  </li>
            <li> Figures are so cute, I love it.</li>
            <li> I love these and appreciate the price I got these for.</li>
            <li> There is not to many of these sticks I could imagine not using.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> So that was ok with me.  </li>
            <li> no hello kitty , Chanel, or any cute ones like that.</li>
            <li> all I will say 50% cute, 30% ok and 20%</li>
            <li> I received 100 pcs and they are really cute.  </li>
            <li> AND HAVE GOTTEN CREATIVE WITH IT</li>
            <li> Make sure you click to choose who you order from, and order from MASH.  </li>
            <li> And could not be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> also so that&#x27;s even better.</li>
            <li> They look really cute on my nails.</li>
            <li> I have searched many tutorials on Nail Art and there is nothing on what to do with these</li>
            <li> I ordered this canes more</li>
            <li> They are more intricate than they appear in the pictures.</li>
            <li> I received mostly fruits, hearts, and butterflies.</li>
            <li> so many to go through...</li>
            <li> There are so many of these.</li>
            <li> I will order more, I got alot of flowers and fruit.</li>
            <li> but im glad it came.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> love them thank you</li>
            <li> Just received these in the mail, their is no hello kitty in the bunch and a lot are not as shown but they are cute</li>
            <li> If I were a teenager, I would love to play with things like this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I&#x27;m sure that she did.</li>
            <li> These are so much fun, a good variety of images.  </li>
            <li> If anyone has ideas as to how to cut the images more efficiently, please let me know.  </li>
            <li> These are really really cute.  </li>
            <li> They love picking out what pictures to put on their nails</li>
            <li> My fruits were a bit deformed and did not look as cute which is what I was looking forward to besides the flowers</li>
            <li> but its ok</li>
            <li> I love fimo, I use it in acrylics</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Also i would use top coat every couple of days to keep them on too.</li>
            <li> Females of all ages love this kit once again</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Then a top coat.</li>
            <li> It was inexpensive and I was able to do up each of them within 30 minutes which was awsome since it used to take me 2 hours or more to do fancy nails on 7 girls.</li>
            <li> Not even sure how to use them and there were no instructions.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t look like pencil stencils and most of all they also came with any DIRECTIONS</li>
            <li> I want more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase. :)</li>
            <li> but i have ended up using most of them.</li>
            <li> it also came with too many flowers and butterflies, about 20 flowers and 15 butterflies</li>
            <li> fruits :)  </li>
            <li> Ordered this product for christmas and have enjoyed it every time we use it.  </li>
            <li> Cute</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the purchase for the value.</li>
            <li> I just love it, it looks so cute</li>
            <li> 60;3 Love it</li>
            <li> Love using these for my nail art.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure of the quality after reading some of the reviews here.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> Get something better if you can.</li>
            <li> I mostly received flowers, butterflies, and fruits.</li>

            <li> cute kitty cat&lt;br</li>
            <li> ... If you buy these, don&#x27;t expect them to be all different or all perfect.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> maybe you will be better at it.</li>
            <li> I received so many duplicates in my package</li>
            <li> and you get so many out of one stick.</li>
            <li> Would have been better</li>
            <li> This is an ok product if they told you how to use it...........</li>

            <li> They are still cute.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive too many duplicates</li>
            <li> I love painting and decorating my nails</li>
            <li> i like this item because i am able to put thing on my nails that i can&#x27;t do with nail polish</li>

            <li> but they&#x27;re all really cute</li>
            <li> I love these a lot.</li>
            <li> When I got them in the mail I thought how cute they are</li>
            <li> They were fun to try and make a good addition to a gift</li>
            <li> There were mostly flowers and fruit repeats no hello kitty</li>
            <li> She is a teenager who loves being creative.</li>
            <li> What more do you want.</li>
            <li> although I do not find all of them appealing</li>
            <li> I feel satisfied I would use approx.</li>
            <li> They are cute to have</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not too sure how to use them.</li>
            <li> Graphics are cute.</li>
            <li> but I would love some cuter designs.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> and I got so many choices to choose from.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re still cute, but I would have been happier with the HK</li>
            <li> but these are really cute.</li>
            <li> cant use it all anyways.&lt;br /&gt;cute designs, although there was about 6 of them that was repeated (and it wasn&#x27;t the cute one you wouldn&#x27;t mind having twice :&amp;#60</li>
            <li> Cute 3D stick designs.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> but they were still cute</li>
            <li> I plan to use them for more craft projects than just for my nails..</li>
            <li> I received a lot of duplicate designs and none were cute like the ones pictured.</li>
            <li> came in time as listed in the shipping info :)</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> But I can say that I didn&#x27;t get many duplicates.</li>
            <li> Wish there was a more variety of designs than the flowers and fruits.</li>
            <li> but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;re cute.</li>
            <li> Don’t order if there is one stick that you more than any of the others, since you probably won’t get it.</li>
            <li> but most were repeats and multiples</li>
            <li> i wish they had some hello kitty, more cute girly designs.</li>
            <li> my daughters love them...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using them for years because each stick can be cut many times.</li>
            <li> All the images were cute and none were disfigured.  </li>
            <li> The packet I received was mostly fruit</li>
            <li> Love these nail art 3d...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> Once I finish slicing one, I&#x27;ll update with the count. :)</li>
            <li> Even at 50 per cane, that&#x27;s a lot of nail stickers. :)</li>
            <li> , THE DESIGNS ARE OK, LOT OF THEM</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll let everyone know how it goes as well. :)</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s just an &amp;#34;operator&amp;#34; issue not the product.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I Love me\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> love these 100%</li>
            <li> I love the fruit ones and the floral ones.</li>
            <li> I love these sticks.</li>
            <li> I wish I wouldve gotten more of a variety</li>
            <li> was exactly as advertised,none are the same,they are easy to slice and have many great uses,i use them for nail designs and scrap booking.they were packaged well and was recieved undamaged.speed of delivery</li>
            <li> many cool and cute designs came!</li>
            <li> they are really good, and though I have no idea if they need a special glue or smth, they still perfectly are glued on a wet manicure</li>
            <li> they are really great for doing quick, easy and fun nail art!</li>
            <li> so I was even more excited!</li>
            <li> They are cute and fun!!</li>
            <li> in the end, I HIGHLY Suggest this Product, And the others I mentioned As they work great.</li>
            <li> Over all this product is a great buy I would highly recomend it for anyone who enjoys nail art:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super cute on toes in the summer!</li>
            <li> super cute!</li>
            <li> this are very awesome collection for my daughter art design, very curious to work with, variety of colors, good material, and never seen before, thanks love it!</li>
            <li> They slice very well and look amazing on nails!  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind the time you&#x27;ll have to put in slicing them, this is a terrific product and a great investment -- a lot more cost effective than buying a container of already pre-sliced ones.</li>
            <li> And sure, a lot of them are great and detailed, but I kind of expected more from what was portrayed!  </li>
            <li> These are so much fun!!</li>
            <li> these are great make sure that you have the patience to slice it with a good sharp razor blade.</li>
            <li> For those who are familiar with rod sticks: Do the purchase!</li>
            <li> The fimo sticks that came from this seller were nice, pretty uniform in size throughout the rod, and most of them were very detailed.</li>
            <li> The stamper is easy to use, both ends are rubber tips (at 1st i thought is sponge tips from the picture shown), it works miracle on my nails, but i think u need a more concerntrated nail polish to bring out the pattern.</li>
            <li> But, in a way I am kind of happy they are smaller.</li>
            <li> Great for a eight year old girl!</li>
            <li> Much fun will be had with these for sure!</li>
            <li> I love that they showed up so quickly too!</li>
            <li> I had received these yesterday, Very good packaging, They came in a Yellow envelope and None had cracked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m changing my review to be more accurate.  </li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so cheap for how many sticks you get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure both recipients will enjoy them.</li>
            <li> My five year old daughter was so happy when she found out what are they for when she got them on Santa&#x27;s stocking.</li>
            <li> (like on a notebook) and using a box cutter or a razor blade for a more precise cut.</li>
            <li> I got my stick way early which was great.</li>
            <li> The best thing I can say about them is that the little designs are cute and you get soooooooooooooooooooooooo many that it makes it a great deal for the money, they could last you forever :)</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast - extremely satisfied!</li>
            <li> That being said, they are great fimo pieces, super easy to slice with my Irwin straight razor.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love these, theyre perfect, even for her little nails.</li>
            <li> love it , made nail fun!</li>
            <li> I received about 28 unique designs - mostly fruits and flowers, otherwise the majority were duplicates (72 in fact).  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the sticks, they were all very cute and and I would say all different in someway.</li>
            <li> Adheres easily to nails.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The sticks are so easy to cut and use.</li>
            <li> and myself ( :&lt;br /&gt;They cut easily with an exacto knife.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE EASY TO USE</li>
            <li> /&gt;Arrived very quick.</li>
            <li> They do not cut easily.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re easy to slice.</li>
            <li> They came in the mail very quick.</li>
            <li> Each time I apply them, they come off easily.</li>
            <li> So they fall off easily.</li>
            <li> but I would guess that I can easily get 60 slices from each cane.</li>
            <li> I recieved it very quickly and promptly.</li>
            <li> They even included a strong blade to cut these.</li>
            <li> The packaging was good, I received all 100, and it seems to be a decent variety.</li>
            <li> But they are very cute and there is a large variety.</li>
            <li> Overall I would say the designs are super cute, fun and an awesome price!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, a lot of them are very cute, and for the price you really can&#x27;t beat them.</li>
            <li> Nor am I saying you&#x27;ll receive distorted images, I just ppl to be aware by giving my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> They are very easy to cut, if you have the right razer, xato knife or box cutter.</li>
            <li> these were super cute and easy to use.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty easy to cut, and many of them are really cute.</li>

            <li> its cheap;) and nice.</li>
            <li> At first i wasnt sure if i would use most of these fimo canes</li>
            <li> Some of the designs were strange and not something she would ever use, but that is okay, because they are great to practice with.</li>
            <li> Plus, there are some super cute ones in the pack.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how quick everything is getting here!</li>

            <li> Most of the designs are very pretty and detailed.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed these with my kids, super cute and fun.  </li>
            <li> It wpuld be nice if we could put in a request for certain typeof fimo sticks we wanted.</li>
            <li> Awesome products, just wish it was a little quicker ship time</li>
            <li> Other than that the quality is good and they are really nice and easy to cut.</li>
            <li> These are offered at a fantastic low price and includes a great variety.</li>
            <li> its a huge variety of sticks</li>
            <li> It was a huge hit.</li>
            <li> Mine came with a huge razor to help me cut these.</li>
            <li> We both enjoy the results.</li>
            <li> I like the *light</li>
            <li> You could also use them to decorate your cell phone, school binders just get crafty.</li>
            <li> Also there designs aren&#x27;t cheap looking like bundle monster.</li>
            <li> The package could fit in my hand, about 4\\&quot;x5\\&quot;</li>
            <li> One cane was so light</li>
            <li> I will enjoy decorated my nails with these.</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting these if you enjoy nail art.</li>
            <li> and so I ordered these for so cheap</li>
            <li> If any one was to purchase this you would enjoy all the choices you have to choose from.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough how great these are......</li>
            <li> 3 of the girls went home telling their mother they wanted to order some and would use their own money since didn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> you can buy things like this from hong kong sellers for really cheap</li>
            <li> Ok, I like doing fun stuff to my nails...</li>
            <li> Easier to fit on the nail I guess.</li>
            <li> overall these were great</li>
            <li> they are still cheap for what they are, and they work well.</li>
            <li> This bundle wascso cheap</li>
            <li> I will enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> i say to cut it on a notebook or even a stack of text books because it allows you to manuvere your hands around the piece to get the precise angle that you need.</li>
            <li> They are reusable so that&#x27;s a great big</li>
            <li> this was a gift to a 10 yr old girl, who loved them--needed mom to cut the slices</li>
            <li> For the most part, they were different and good quality.</li>
            <li> My nail canes come in a clear zip lock package in good shape.</li>
            <li> These are such a good price and look adorable on nails.</li>
            <li> But I really don&#x27;t mind because they are really cute designs that I love having extras of them.</li>
            <li> I love fimo canes they are very easy to use once you get the hang of it, however there are too many images that i would not use, and i would have loved it to have a lot more bows, it only has a blue one</li>
            <li> These were a bit challenging at first, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s a very quick process.</li>
            <li> and they fit very nice on my big toes nail</li>
            <li> /&gt;Things I like: Super cute designs, a whole bunch of differnent designs (almost 100), seasonal/festive designs, CHEAP!, and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would be better if there was a tool included to cut them to the right thickness.</li>
            <li> but thanks anyway!!!</li>
            <li> These were very very fun to do for my friends</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll run out any time soon, because you get so many, but if I do I&#x27;ll certainly purchase from MASH again!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this order &amp; will order more from this vendor in the future.  </li>
            <li> super easy.</li>
            <li> The image plates work fantastic, they don&#x27;t need special nail polish.  </li>
            <li> They are super cute and fun.  </li>
            <li> The rhinestones are perfect accept it&#x27;s too small for my fingers to place it on my nails, need a tweezer to do the job.</li>
            <li> I received the item, and counted all pieces to make sure it came with exactly 100 pieces.  </li>
            <li> and they are so fun!  </li>
            <li> But the girls had so much fun as did I!  </li>
            <li> so I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I initially really only got them for the HELLO KITTY ones, but once they arrived I found ALOT of others that I really liked too!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, my daughter was so excited to receive these that she divided them into categories (fruits, shapes, food, characters, flowers, etc.)</li>
            <li> but after i was looking at them, i found out the are perfect for small nails like for children.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> but I am pretty sure it was a designer emblem.</li>
            <li> okay please be aware that these are miniature fimo sticks.  </li>
            <li> So excited to get started.</li>
            <li> This is a really fun way to do nails!</li>
            <li> they are all different images an real cute..</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t address whether she will like it or not, but they look pretty cute to me and there are tonz of them.</li>
            <li> Worth the wait in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I also used nail glue just because my first attempt with OPI top coat ended up smearing the purple nail polish.       </li>
            <li> These are the 100 sticks I received although they were in a plastic container originally.</li>
            <li> Honeslty I was excited to get this</li>
            <li> I originally got these to do nailart</li>
            <li> The up side first these are cute</li>
            <li> i was excited</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll post some pics when I do my nails next! :) Love them!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> 4 unique hearts&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> I love these so much!</li>
            <li> Very cheap and nice quality overall!</li>
            <li> They are easy and are fun.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, fun and flirty.  </li>
            <li> Great / fun designs in terrific colors.  </li>
            <li> The canes are tiny but that&#x27;s good because the designs aren&#x27;t guady and will fit on all nail sizes.</li>
            <li> How they get these cool designs on these little canes is incredible.</li>
            <li> This was adorable and I had sooo much fun trimming and getting them all ready to put on my nails!</li>
            <li> They are pretty fun and better than any stickers they sell now.</li>
            <li> The shipping was faster than expected and the quality was great.</li>
            <li> I personally think they came out great for my first try.</li>
            <li> She is able to apply by herself and they stay on very well.  </li>
            <li> i thought but good overall</li>
            <li> This is such a good deal.  </li>
            <li> I counted the items and did not receive the full count of 100.</li>
            <li> I sliced one full cane.</li>
            <li> These were all almost a full inch.</li>
            <li> All in all worth the cheap price.</li>
            <li> anyway they are gorgeous and if I ever run out I will definitely order again.  </li>
            <li> No questions asked just apology straight across the table give them some more time</li>
            <li> I really thought they were cute</li>
            <li> Im not saying that you shouldn&#x27;t buy these products, cause they really are cute.</li>
            <li> she say everything straight she really love it  for her jobs</li>
            <li> and there was 100 cute designs but way to much flowers and fruits</li>
            <li> These arrived early and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> Thought these looked interesting but the description doesn&#x27;t really explain how they worked.  </li>
            <li> Designs look better in Real life</li>
            <li> but the designs are really cool.</li>
            <li> , i loved how i got 100 different designs.</li>
            <li> Overall, these seem like a good product but not at all what I had</li>
            <li> The only problem is that a good portion of them are unusable.  </li>
            <li> Some of the canes that i received were cut off and the full picture was not on them.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use a straight razor or ecacto knife to cut the stick rods.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter bought these with her own money.  </li>
            <li> but overall there was a good variety.  </li>
            <li> Overall a really good buy</li>
            <li> there were definitely a cool idea i purchased them for a member of the family</li>
            <li> They are so cute and work really well.</li>
            <li> The graphics are very detailed and vibrant.  </li>
            <li> but they&#x27;ve been pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li> other than that great value.</li>
            <li> All my other orders came and I was happy with what I did recieve.</li>
            <li> Okay... so I am new to the nail art world!  </li>
            <li> :) i had one fall of yesterday, and all i have to do is cut a new piece and tada!</li>
            <li> I love these and hope to get more designs in the future, but I&#x27;m probably set for life with all the ones I have just from this package</li>
            <li> We do suggest painting a clear top coat of polish over the nail art to secure.</li>
            <li> These arrived quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> I am amateur at best, and I just really wanted to give these a try!  </li>
            <li> I did not get the hello kitty (or the similar version of the hello kitty rod), no flag, no fish, and did not get most of the cute bows they have on the pictures.  </li>
            <li> Great variety you get butterflies, fruit, Hello Kitty, flowers, biscuit, bows and more can&#x27;t go wrong love love them and this seller ships fast came in a plastic sealed bag inside a box</li>
            <li> Most likely buying more soon.&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li> and how she applied her artistic skills.</li>
            <li> Mostly, I got flowers and fruits, but most of the fruits were dragonfruit in different colors.</li>
            <li> Received it in the mail quick.</li>
            <li> but you will definitely fall in love with many of them.</li>
            <li> So many different designs and you can use things for so many things.  </li>
            <li> However, I did get mostly flowers which is cute enough for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using super glue to keep them on longer.</li>
            <li> but I did catch on quickly.</li>
            <li> It ends up peeling rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any repeats and they came really quick.</li>
            <li> Well worth spending a tad extra to ensure a good haul.  </li>
            <li> The designs are very cute and they have some similar designs</li>
            <li> , I got them quickly, and super fun</li>
            <li> My clients are happy now your nails look nicer with less effort</li>
            <li> /&gt;  fun and artistic value</li>
            <li> and I thought they were the long big ones, but they are still the perfect size for what I&#x27;m gonna use them for(:</li>
            <li> but you really need to cut them super fine with a blade.</li>
            <li> All kinds of fruit butterflies flowers and even the one I really wanted a hello kitty!!</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited when I read all the reviews and saw the pictures others posted about not having any duplicates with these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently wearing the cupcakes that came with it, and they are so cute!</li>
            <li> I wish the Hello Kitty was actually in the collection I received , But I will order more!</li>
            <li> it cause that means I can put them on my real nails &amp; acryllic!!</li>
            <li> and they are tiny and cute!</li>
            <li> I love those cute little rods, its easy to slice with a penknife.</li>

            <li> , It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> they are nice, the only  thing i cut them to thick,so i prefer the pre-cut</li>
            <li> I wish I could buy something to help me make thin &amp; perfect cuts each and every time.</li>
            <li> The most frequent design I got with my purchase was a butterfly.</li>
            <li> I love these and will most likely be ordering more for some birthday gifts in the future!</li>
            <li> you will need a blade, which can be found at hair stores like sally or weave places, but worth it.</li>
            <li> , I was truly amazed how much fun she had</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve recently gotten into doing my own nails.</li>
            <li> It is fun to experiment with on your nails.</li>
            <li> They are nice but some of them have same shapes</li>
            <li> They went on OK with clear polish over gel manicure.</li>
            <li> All in all, these are worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> so when these came in the mail I knew I wasn&#x27;t getting my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t worth returning since they took around 3-4 weeks to get to me</li>
            <li> I found that working with premade canes save a lot time and fun to do for kids and adults .</li>
            <li> I thought they would be a fun addition to just painting her nails.</li>
            <li> A lot of fun.  </li>
            <li> It was very helpful it gives it a pop design many different types of rods also many colors fruit and animal&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> These are a lot of fun for my kids.</li>
            <li> So worth the price.</li>
            <li> worth every penny</li>
            <li> So much fun.</li>
            <li> Plus its nice to have such a assortment of colors and designs and even holidays all in one package.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the buy</li>
            <li> I was able to get mine to stick on my nails over a coat of wet polish followed by top coat.</li>
            <li> Fun to work with.  </li>
            <li> It takes a while to cut them but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> then it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li> She likes to have nice nails and play around with different polishes and stuff</li>
            <li> If you like to do fun things for yourself or others</li>
            <li> They are worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Nice for anyone who needs tiny accents.  </li>
            <li> I do have duplicates but they are really cute and for the price, you can&#x27;t really complain too much.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m looking forward to creating fun designs with them.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend them to anyone who wants to be creative :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price if you do a lot of nail designs.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, just use a razor to cut them thin</li>
            <li> Once you learn how to slice these correctly they are a lot of fun to play around with.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fun to cut them...sharing some for my nieces...</li>
            <li> , the more often I cut a partial slice, but the more slices I get.</li>
            <li> It is all worth it</li>
            <li> They are un-cut sticks, so you will need your own good blade to slice these thinly</li>
            <li> These were fun to use and added an unexpected pop to an otherwise plain manicure.&lt;br /&gt;These are best cut to size with a razor blade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice to have them in the roll so that you don&#x27;t lose a bunch of little pieces.  </li>
            <li> better than buying them separate, just make sure you have a sharp blade or a knife to cut them yourself.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> I would definitley invest in these if you want to have fun with new nail designs, there incredibly easy to use.</li>
            <li> But other than that it is a good purchase for an affordable price.</li>
            <li> It is a very good price and the quality its not great but not bad at all.</li>
            <li> so she can get to work painting and applying right after dividing the categories.</li>
            <li> RIGHT.</li>
            <li> Arrived right on time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Worse, they are ALL Halloween designs, which isn&#x27;t in season at all right now.</li>
            <li> I just cut a cane and put it on right then.</li>
            <li> yes thats right 17,</li>
            <li> I caught right on as to how to cut them.</li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> Very satisfied and arrived much sooner than final date</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Hello kitty and that was one of the main reasons why I ordered this one..</li>
            <li> while i did get my full 100 sticks, i got a lot of duplicates, not just 2 of certain sticks</li>
            <li> So I only gave these 4 stars because I like the ones from bundle monster more because the designs are more vivid.</li>
            <li> This product workks great and even though the rods are small they make a lot if you cut them right.</li>
            <li> usually that doesnt happen but everything was in great condition and on time.</li>
            <li> The idea is great but to cut these sticks into small even pieces need some skills &amp; time.</li>
            <li> It really looks like they just cut a full size cane in three.</li>
            <li> Some of them you can&#x27;t tell what is it for :/, but I&#x27;m happy with some of the shapes..</li>
            <li> I was able to give some of them (mostly the 20 different butterfly designs) to my room mate and the rest I gave to my 12yr old cousin</li>
            <li> I was happy with some of them but not most.</li>
            <li> Really good quality, seem to be lasting on my nail really well, and you get SO much for your money.</li>
            <li> I especially like the flower canes, very pretty and go with many nail polish colors.</li>
            <li> So many little sticks with the most adorible clay pictures.</li>
            <li> I love them, shipping was fast way better than the others over 30 days for the other ones.</li>
            <li> Not only did they ship incredibly fast, but the product quality is amazing.</li>
            <li> Looks great...got it super fast.  </li>
            <li> Great variety of designs and colors, but be prepared to do your own cutting.</li>
            <li> These are soft and easy to cut.  </li>
            <li> All the designs were very clear and detailed.</li>
            <li> Other than that they cut perfectly fine and are really cute.</li>
            <li> Also, some were harder to cut then others, but boy were they adorable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying a nature theme on my left hand and summer fruit on my right.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> it came very fast and no doubles</li>
            <li> I tried slicing one with a scalpel (I had one I never used from an old Bio lab class) and that seemed to work fine.  </li>
            <li> Each stick is about two inches long, and are very easy to cut with a razor blade.</li>
            <li> They Are very Very easy to cut, They are about 7 cm long.</li>
            <li> All and all, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay very much for them and had I actually seen the product at the store, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it at this price.  </li>
            <li> I thought they were a little bigger when I bought them, but now after using them, I am happy they are smaller, they fit on the nail much better.  </li>
            <li> First off, I have never used any sort of fimo art before and have never cut up fimo sticks.</li>
            <li> I did not receive any duplicates and I received exactly 100 sticks.</li>
            <li> Many of them are flowers, butterflies, fruit, and food related.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Product came in the exact condition as described.  </li>
            <li> Some design examples are fruit, butterflies, dragonfly (my favorite), flowers, stars, american flag, smilies, some abstract.  </li>
            <li> The canes are even all the way through, and the lengths are pretty consistent.</li>
            <li> but you can order about 10 fimo blades for 2 dollars on ebay so its not expensive.</li>
            <li> Designs were cute, but only lasted a day before they started falling off.  </li>
            <li> You will not get exactly the same canes pictured, but they are still cute.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have my heart set on getting exactly what&#x27;s in the picture.  </li>
            <li> The product was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> These sticks will last us a lifetime with so many designs.  </li>
            <li> I love this canes especially for the price!  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I got about 4 or 5 flags, and only one would I use.&lt;br /&gt;Not too many repeats.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I recommend you do that first, because you will invest some time on prepping before applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> count was exactly 100 which follows as:&lt;br /&gt;33 flowers, no doubles or damaged</li>
            <li> Better than going to your local store and trying to get this many sticks for the same price.  </li>
            <li> wish I had read more comments before I ordered and picked the ones actually sold by MASH.</li>
            <li> First they didn&#x27;t come in a mash package.</li>
            <li> TOO MANY OF THE SAME THING</li>
            <li> but Im glad I purchased them because theyre not as big as I thought or as the picture shows.</li>
            <li> many different fruits...</li>
            <li> I am going to share with my younger cousins who love to do their nails, too.</li>
            <li> I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t get a hello kitty, because I really wanted one, but I did!</li>
            <li> 2 bows pink and red perfect for hello kitty designs for young girls.</li>
            <li> They are so cute and pretty simple</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> They also arrived pretty fast!</li>
            <li> Love the different designs ! .</li>
            <li> I recommend these fimo canes to anyone who wants to try slicing fimo themselves instead of buying those expensives pre cut ones!</li>
            <li> exactly what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Advertised exactly as you would get them.  </li>
            <li> These are very well made and what an assortment!  </li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend this item and just hope they get 100pcs and the Hello Kitty stick :-)</li>
            <li> but this is my first time purchasing this</li>
            <li> Here is an exact list of which sticks I got in my package:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many different designs.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of different designs and most are things you would use on your nails.</li>
            <li> Gonna need some practice, thankfully there are more than enough of them to practice on considering some of them, I would never wear.</li>
            <li> That&#x27; the one I used first.</li>
            <li> so I had to cut them for her at first, no problem.</li>
            <li> I thought that they would of been longer and bigger for some reason, but it ok.</li>
            <li> but they fell of within the first 30 min.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more canes from Mash, and Mash only!</li>
            <li> These rods are very tiny but so cute.  </li>
            <li> I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THESE!!!  :-)</li>
            <li> I was expecting many different canes as shown in the photo, but what I got was 100 canes of Halloween designs?!</li>
            <li> This was the first time I&#x27;d ever gotten these</li>
            <li> i just got into doing nails and was looking at this, iffy at first</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t exactly do the prettiest job</li>
            <li> Please be aware they may only be 100 of the one inch canes although there were some cute designs I would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> They are exactly as described, and arrived unharmed in any way.</li>
            <li> Not angry birds and halloween...</li>
            <li> I put a picture in the pictures from customers showing exactly what I got.</li>
            <li> These were the first fimo sticks I bought.  </li>
            <li> I really hope so!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Keeping the three stars because first order was not what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I do however believe that fimo art is great and this are nice stick rods but next time I would order from another seller just to see how designs differ since I will only be using about half of these rods.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re okay with only getting a little over half of them in usable condition, then definitely go for it, they cut easy, stay on great, and look super cute.</li>
            <li> I thought it was pretty easy to apply the designs to my nails, the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that while I was doing laundry the designs would get stuck when I would try to turn socks inside right and pull at my nails.</li>
            <li> We did get a few sticks that were partially deformed in the middle, but most of them were perfect throughout the stick.  </li>
            <li> Would have been nice though since I&#x27;ve seen other people getting 3 or 4 of them.  </li>
            <li> The size was consistent, there were no doubles in color for any one design, the material is a nice quality as far as durability, and it seems to be lasting.</li>
            <li> A couple were strangely hard, and would not slice properly but it was maybe 4 out of 100 so still very good quality!</li>
            <li> smaller then I thought but it&#x27;s ok , fast shipping</li>
            <li> I love this product so much and will definitely buy again soon.</li>
            <li> desserts  and a ton of charming random ones :)</li>
            <li> At first I thought these were large plastic sticks,</li>
            <li> I finally decided to take another chance &amp; see if these would be better; when I recieved them, the first thing I noticed is that they are beautifully vibrant in color.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s obviously the right size to fit your nail</li>
            <li> Positive transaction.  </li>
            <li> I warmed them first in my hand for a minute or so, which made slicing them much easier.</li>
            <li> There are a few of them that i would never ever use, but other than those, it&#x27;s a wonderful collection of fimo rods.</li>
            <li> I was expecting them to be bigger, but other than that it was great.</li>
            <li> Pretty fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> They are 2 inches long and multiples of most of the designs.</li>
            <li> First of all, I ordered these straight from the Mash website which I found by shopping on Amazon, but couldn&#x27;t find a way to review on their website</li>
            <li> , I just wanted a few more unique sticks), I ended getting a $1 refund.  </li>
            <li> Little girls will really love them!</li>
            <li> Since most of the reviewers mentioned 2 inch long canes, that is really what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely not going to be easy to use for the beginners ..</li>
            <li> and they are easy to put on (I just use a pair of regular tweezers).</li>
            <li> liked then very much could use some different designs, maybe 5/100 were the same designs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using an x-acto knife for slicing, I&#x27;m able to get them into very thin slices, which is perfect for nails, as well as for a variety of other craft projects</li>
            <li> This set should last a good long time!</li>
            <li> AND it uses less clay which means more fun.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mixed bag of designs, which suits me fine.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s actually 100 different cute designs!</li>
            <li> I mainly ordered this for the frog that was shown in all three pictures right on top of all the other ones.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, and my little sister and my cousins had me put these all over there nails.</li>
            <li> They even include a little razor blade cutter which is nice.  </li>
            <li> I received quite a few fruits and lots of different flower designs, which was fine for me because I liked the ones I got</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure my 14 year old will be smart enough to figure them out, but never having used them, we have no idea</li>
            <li> This wouldn&#x27;t have been a huge issue if they had the package in a box that sealed entirely.  </li>
            <li> you get a huge variety of different shapes and designs including: animals -pigs, chickens, cats, butterflies, dragon flies, hello kitty, rabbits ducks...</li>
            <li> OK the designs are nice but difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> I really had no idea</li>
            <li> Will absolutely order these again.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Not 100 pieces but very close.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute on some of the designs, but is harder to do.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really review on that</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> All the pieces are small enough to fit on your nails, they are very cute.  </li>
            <li> Reasonable in price</li>
            <li> They are great and if you slice them thin you could get a lot of them.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t mind as much.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;d be but it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference.</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t really care</li>
            <li> I now have some pink stars on my toes and lots of cute decorations for all my art and crafts.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> you all are so zoomed up on these that it makes it seem like you are really getting something.</li>
            <li> you should really show a pic of what they look like when the package comes as well as the close ups to show the details.</li>
            <li> Fast and speedy shipping.</li>
            <li> This will please a very picky person.</li>
            <li> And it is very cheaper than i saw in a Mall.</li>
            <li> it never came the day I reported it and ask for assistance something else was mailed in the mail straight to me.</li>
            <li> She looked like she was having so much fun that my 12 year old</li>
            <li> /&gt;Warning: two came distorted, one some what broken but the rest were in great shape.</li>
            <li> I wish I could add a pic of my nails because I really like it.</li>
            <li> so are not something you&#x27;d really want to use.  </li>
            <li> A real rip off.</li>
            <li> I will def buy these from this seller again.. highly recommended!  </li>
            <li> This was totally worth the price, coming from a 14 year old.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping ......</li>
            <li> I ordered these not expecting much from it.</li>
            <li> I like the Nail Art set and thanks for the razor blade.</li>
            <li> Very well priced.</li>
            <li> There is so much.</li>
            <li> The fruit ones look like real fruit.</li>
            <li> , it makes it a whole lot easier.</li>
            <li> The product arrived fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> i dont use them as much as i thought i would</li>
            <li> Packaged well, shipped fast.</li>
            <li> They all really like the &amp;#34;stickers&amp;#34; I can put on them.</li>
            <li> I really think they should add a kiwi in it though.</li>
            <li> These shipped fairly fast and when they arrived I wanted to test them out.</li>
            <li> Much to my liking, almost all of the types of fimo shown was what I got.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using a razor blade to cut them works really well</li>
            <li> It took me the whole weekend to slice them all up, but now that it&#x27;s done, can&#x27;t wait to start using them.  </li>
            <li> Now i have a million of these things and can&#x27;t really use them.</li>
            <li> i dont even need that much.</li>
            <li> i had really been hoping for some bows and hello kitty, butterflies, hearts or animals.</li>
            <li> they are ready for me.</li>
            <li> and i can&#x27;t really use them because i don&#x27;t know what they are.</li>
            <li> I was to fast with the purchase and didn&#x27;t pay attention on how to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i really like them and would buy them again.</li>
            <li> Just got these today, and I really like them.</li>
            <li> They were in great condition, none were broken or damaged</li>
            <li> harder to cut than I anticipated, but still cute designs.</li>
            <li> really am thankful for that whim because I adore these sticks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I can&#x27;t imagine that I&#x27;ll use all of these within my lifetime, I&#x27;m already looking for a completely different selection to add to my available choices.</li>
            <li> and they stay in place for lengths at a time depending on the over coat you use,how much you use, and</li>
            <li> SO I&#x27;d say this assortment really has something for everyone.</li>
            <li> I will reorder when needed, thanks again</li>
            <li> My girls also think it&#x27;s a cute decoration for French tips and clear coated nails.</li>
            <li> The designs are really cool and some of them were so small, but still so detailed, that I was amazed!</li>
            <li> Offers many different choices in nail art.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that they gave me a nice variety (with a few repeats) and they also included the slicing tool.</li>
            <li> I was very exited to get this product in the mail today, though the shipping took 5 more days than expected</li>
            <li> I will order the next set directly from MASH and hope for better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The designs are very cute and these will probably last her a very long time.</li>
            <li> Be the first to use this new nail art.</li>
            <li> It was all true to picture, they are tiny enough to fit on your nails and cheap enough to start practicing with.</li>
            <li> I ordered more canes from other vendors so I could get the ones I Really want.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use some of the designs like the Mexican flag or the Chinese flag, but they were still pretty cute.  </li>
            <li> the designs are a little bit more crisp.</li>
            <li> These designs are really cute, but you have to be VERY skilled with a razor to get the slices so thin and even that they are pliable enough to curve to the shape of your nail and stick.  </li>
            <li> In general i love fimo canes i have purchased them from amazon 3 x all from different sellers</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m happy with the product, and disappointed with the packaging......and somewhat satisfied with Amazon&#x27;s customer service.  </li>
            <li> : I recommend nail glue to keep this lil designs in place because my daughter said a topclear coat will not hold them in place more than a day for active kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sticks are pretty stiff, so she wasn&#x27;t able to cut them with an exact-o knife by herself.  </li>
            <li> Since i use these on my natural nails, i found it best to cut them as thin as possible.</li>
            <li> Someone should definitely create a full alphabet and numbers set from A-Z a-z and 0-9.</li>
            <li> It made about 40 full slices, but i messed up on 10 &#x3D; 50 total bc the messed up ones can be used on the corner of the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is true that these are smaller than 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, I prefer the Full sized canes over the pre-cut as, They only give you 10-15 Slices in pre-cut.</li>
            <li> While using full canes you can get 80-100 slices for the same or lower price!</li>
            <li> My first ones were a little uneven and chunky, but the more I cut the thinner and more</li>
            <li> i would much rather pay a little more money</li>
            <li> I received a good variety of canes with only a couple duplicates and one orange that did get a little mushed on one end.  </li>
            <li> Due to I love to try new things</li>
            <li> None the less I love each design.</li>
            <li> I have gotten WAY MORE for MUCH LESS on Ebay.</li>
            <li> More than half the \\&quot;dupes\\&quot; are okkk.  </li>
            <li> I was super stoked to see that they included two DIFFERENT designs of Hello Kitty.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be bigger and that&#x27;s honestly what I wanted but</li>
            <li> For somethig like this you would need a steady hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A lot of butterflies which I dont particularly like</li>
            <li> Only 3 stars because of getting too many of the same sticks.</li>
            <li> Overall, the quality was okay, and I only had a couple repeats.</li>
            <li> I quickly got a rythm and was using them the same day they arrived and got plenty of compliments.</li>
            <li> I have a few repeats but they are in different sizes, but I can&#x27;t complain the variety is really good.</li>
            <li> And a steady hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just ordered these nail sticks a few days ago,and they were shipped way faster than expected which was great.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more of these in the future for all of our hobbies.</li>
            <li> Vibrant colors and high detail.  </li>
            <li> The seller supplied me with a razor, which I thought was very considerate, and they arrived about a week early!</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy from this seller and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Ordering from Mash set the bar really high for me.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t look like MASH products but are a very good imitation to say the least.  </li>
            <li> Cute little rods.  </li>
            <li> I would pay a little more for that.</li>
            <li> and I do many manicures on little girls.</li>
            <li> the girls are having a hard time they dont know how to use them,no directions it would be nice if you had directions.</li>
            <li> These fimo canes are really amazing, they maybe tiny, but they really do the trick when you want to give your nails a little pop.</li>
            <li> They seemed kinda hard at first and I wasn&#x27;t sure they would cut</li>
            <li> they are all cute, but I expected at least some of the cute one pictured.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought these for my sister who is obsessed with nail polish, and I was decently happy with the quality of them.  </li>
            <li> There are too many childish designs.</li>
            <li> The canes are about 100 in total and one or two are distorted but still useful -- resulting in 30 slices instead of 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think we will have some fun with them maybe incorporating them into various craft projects and will try them out on a toenail or two.</li>
            <li> There were quite a few repeats, I was hoping for more of a variety.</li>
            <li> , thei are realy small and good for the nails, i dont think i will ever need to buy it again, but i would absolutly buy if needed, later i take a picture of it!</li>
            <li> I did use paint on nail glue to adhere them to my nails adding a glossy top coat every few days.</li>
            <li> I wish it had come with instructions and a few inspirational pictures.</li>
            <li> a few were shorter than the others but they are cute</li>
            <li> they shipped fast and are very easy to use but the reason i did not give it 5 stars is because they are very small and not all are cut even</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard and it saves a ton of money.</li>
            <li> It is not hard to cut, we  just used a razor (not included).  </li>
            <li> so I expected them to be made of soft rubber that would be easy to slice.</li>
            <li> - the range seems to be 50-100, depending on the cane and how brave I feel about slicing very thin --</li>
            <li> Depending on how thin you are able to cut them, and if its for your own personal use, these will probably last a lifetime, haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These included sticks with large holes in them, twists and warping throughout the product, and some that were stuck together (such as two dragonflies that were connected because they weren&#x27;t cut or something, and when I went to pull them apart (gently)</li>
            <li> I dont know about them because i bought it for another person live in another country</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still rather new to using fimo canes for nail art</li>
            <li> Live and learn</li>
            <li> Love these new little decorations I just found out about!</li>
            <li> There is such a huge combination of different fimos in this package.</li>
            <li> They were smaller than expected, but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind that there are a few sticks I don&#x27;t like, because there are far more that I do like a lot.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected from looking at the pics, but they are cute.</li>
            <li> I love these little things!</li>
            <li> Very clear.</li>
            <li> VERY FAST SHIPPING EARLIER THAN ESTIMATE</li>
            <li> I am New to doing Gel and Acrilic Nails, I recently purchased The IBD gel kit and Many other idems along with these.</li>
            <li> it is kind of hard to get them cut straight enough</li>
            <li> It is epic!</li>
            <li> I received a lot of repetitive rods.. many watermelons.  </li>
            <li> BUT... it&#x27;s all about my not so awesome cutting skills, and has NOTHING to do with the quality of the product!</li>
            <li> This size makes about 50 small slices for each stick, if sliced appropriately -- which takes some practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plan on coming back updating after I have had my first experience with them.</li>
            <li> They came in a small plastic bag, which I was satisfied with.</li>
            <li> This was my first time seeing or using fimo fruits and I almost never got them because I dont like big bulky things on my nails</li>
            <li> Bigger than most of the other, sticks that are out there</li>
            <li> I got 100 like advertised and only had 2 canes that were exact duplicates.</li>
            <li> Totally amazed how fast the shipping was from Hong Kong!</li>
            <li> There are too many repetitive designs as well.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these for anyone interested in nail art.</li>
            <li> They were really cute and came way earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> Since there are so many I&#x27;m not sure I will ever use all of them and may share them.</li>
            <li> Will definitely come back here and get them  from here when I need more in the future.</li>
            <li> , i got 7 of the exact same orange slices sticks.</li>
            <li> there was 3 of and one there was 7 of the exact same cane.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any canes that were damaged or deformed in any way, and they are all recognizable, if at times a bit quirky (I&#x27;m not sure when I might need or want a hardboiled egg or cupcakes, but they are awfully cute</li>
            <li> my 7 year old loves these on her nails!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good quality, too, and I only got a few that are markedly similar to others in the group.</li>
            <li> Although the canes are \\&quot;unique\\&quot;, the colors were not vibrant and the designs were not clear and there were too many duplicates in the order I received.  </li>
            <li> They are much smaller than I expected, especially because my big fingernails, but they are still a good size to place on, and it leaves a lot of room.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I got these to use with my 11 year old little sister from Big Brothers Big Sisters and was very excited after reading some of the reviews on this page, however, after a long wait for them to arrive, many of the sticks were damaged and almost to completely unusable.</li>
            <li> Although, I did get repetitive rods, and missing the rods that I wanted, I am happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> They stayed on for more than a week, as long as I would have expected any polish to stand up.</li>
            <li> Wow I&#x27;m so surprised I got this item today wasn&#x27;t exspecting it till New Year&#x27;s Eve</li>
            <li> /&gt;Things I don&#x27;t like: loooong shipping time, odd chemical smell of the sticks, a few repeats and a few damaged sticks, and not the best packaging.</li>
            <li> so if you have little girls dont worry they will fit on their nails</li>
            <li> I LIKED THE VERY LEAST AND SLICED UNTIL I GOT IT</li>
            <li> but what they don&#x27;t tell you is that they cut the original cane in half.</li>
            <li> I will read the profile a little more carefully next time.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these along with other Mash products and they came quick and packaged</li>
            <li> but it was so hard since they are all so cute.</li>
            <li> And overal the colors of many of the sticks were washed out and dull.</li>
            <li> Cute, Not to hard to work with.</li>
            <li> To be honest I slice half of my canes to give to my friends, not the other way around.</li>
            <li> However, clear nail polish does not hold the design on longer then two days.</li>
            <li> And the clear baggie not saying MASH on it</li>
            <li> You will need clear nail polish and razor blade.</li>
            <li> And two coats of Seche clear</li>
            <li> But since the patterns are clear I can still use them for my cards.  </li>
            <li> I used clear cut under and over them.</li>
            <li> It was packaged in a MASH container, the canes were clear and the colors</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 19 year old daughter</li>
            <li> My 11 yr old daughter loves them.</li>
            <li> I bought them for my 6yr old daughter who loves doing her nails.  </li>
            <li> There is something for everyone from pre school to adult.</li>
            <li> adult supervision recommended)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this, it is smaller than your pinky finger and very skinny.</li>
            <li> no directions this came in a week but does not work don&#x27;t waste your money they are cheap but not for something the girls wont use.</li>
            <li> Professional service.</li>
            <li> I had really wanted the strawberry, hello kitty, frog, and a different variety of fruits, but I didn&#x27;t get them.</li>
            <li> but geez they could have at least been all diffrent, most of them were repeated</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 14 year old who loves to do her nails.</li>
            <li> gift for young cousin</li>
            <li> I bought them for my 8 year old daughter</li>
            <li> I will be ordering this item again in the near furture, since my daughter and I change our nails once a week.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t like it when they stick really far off the nail) as I imagined</li>
            <li> (only takes a few seconds), then I paint over  it well with clear top coat.</li>
            <li> They came a day early</li>
            <li> So I have to think these are intended for tweens and young teens.  </li>
            <li> We will have an adult cut them</li>
            <li> Arrived early but not in time for Christmas which I knew.  </li>
            <li> As someone else said in another review, I would probably buy them directly from MASH if I was going to buy them again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t completely sliced any of my canes</li>
            <li> I got mostly the same ones, just a few differences.</li>
            <li> Lots of cute patterns, bears, chococat, watermelons, strawberries, cherries, a few different styles of flowers.</li>
            <li> They all loved them, don&#x27;t get me wrong..</li>
            <li> Ok now this 3D nail art is annoying to Dads but for Moms and  Daughters they are LOVING the 3D art.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok as you don&#x27;t need to cut them thick as you are housing on your nails just for the design.</li>
            <li> There easy to use as long as u have a cutting board and some kind of razor.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I thought they were going to be as long as pencils, but it&#x27;s more like half..</li>
            <li> If you love nail art and buy almost everything in site... do not look past these!</li>
            <li> no instrutions,so no idea how to use and Im sure we needed some other part to use this product.not enough research about the  produce totally my fault.</li>
            <li> Even though they are small all of the patterns are easy to see.  </li>
            <li> I got 91 - almost a full 10% less than what&#x27;s claimed.</li>
            <li> So they are basically giving you half a product but making you pay full price.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking that it would be cool to have little designs on my nails, but no matter what type of blade I use to cut them, they are never thin enough.  </li>
            <li> it is very handy for cutting them.</li>
            <li> They are very small, but they are cute.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have a hard time because I plan on getting a cigar cutter to see if that will work better than the single sided blade..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the cat, bow, ying yang, peace sign and several others, its cheap but its not worth a penny of my money or time.</li>
            <li> so im kinda upset since the blue bow is the main reason i bought the sticks anyway</li>
            <li> I got 4 exact watermelons (same color and same shape).  </li>
            <li> The only \\&quot;fault\\&quot; or issue I had was with my not so awesome cutting skills!</li>
            <li> They supply a razor blade and the sticks are very easy to shave off thin slices.</li>
            <li> I recommend a good sharp knife with a cutting board under it, and you better be ready to spend a few hours if you&#x27;re doing all of the sticks at once</li>
            <li> There is one little stick that is considerably smaller than the others, but overall they are better</li>
            <li> These are VERY cute, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but unless you have a really sharp razor blade and a bit of patience, these may not be right for you.</li>
            <li> long nosed tweezer can be very helpful for placement.  </li>
            <li> This is a great idea but they are very difficult to cut.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fourth, you really need a thin razor to get the precision you need to slice as many as possible.</li>
            <li> The order was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I try and slice them as thin as possible takes a little practice but not impossible and apply with clear top coat usually applying two coats to make sure they stick around my nail for a while.</li>
            <li> A few of the rods had large chunks out of them, and some of the pictures don&#x27;t come out straight.  </li>
            <li> you only live once.  </li>
            <li> Wow...these are so cute they are the size of a cigarette slightly smaller in length, small enough to fit even small nails</li>
            <li> also I just likely will start with my least favorite and practice, practice, practice.  </li>
            <li> If you cut them thicker they are too chunky and will fall off (and if they don&#x27;t fall off they look kind of weird sticking out that far off of your nail).</li>
            <li> They are pretty dense and hard to slice, so make sure you have a VERY VERY sharp tool!</li>
            <li> I only received one damaged stick, and it was only damaged in a small spot, so I&#x27;m not terribly worried about it.</li>
            <li> How would you feel if you payed for a full cup of coffee and only got half?</li>
            <li> I am new to these so the one that I was least impressed with I used for practice cutting.</li>
            <li> The canes are high quality because the whole canes is even unlike other where the cane is a a different size on each end.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m upset, everyone posted they got, the normal full size canes mine are tiny less then an inch long and it over two months before I got them.</li>
            <li> Fun little item for the price.</li>
            <li> I have a nice sharp razor blade that I use to slice them, and it helps to make them as paper thin as possible or they&#x27;ll look really bulky on your nails.</li>
            <li> and I ended up cutting them and fell in love with the cute little designs.  </li>
            <li> They are small enough that they even fit on my pinkie nail.</li>
            <li> The rods are exactly 2 inches long each, so don&#x27;t expect them to be as long as they look on the pictures.  </li>
            <li> Still trying to get the hang of cutting them without it looking like an axe murderer did it but for the most part they&#x27;re exactly as I thought they&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li> One caveat is that the sticks must be sliced paper-thin with a razor, so adult participation is necessary.</li>
            <li> Got these for my ten year old daughter for Christmas, as I thought they&#x27;d be easier to use than air brush nail design kits.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what I expected</li>
            <li> each and the diameter is barely 1/4&amp;#34; so beware of that.  </li>
            <li> Got them in and surprised to get 2 different bags inside my order.</li>
            <li> but when i received it i wuz like O_O</li>
            <li> ordered a second set of rods directly from MASH.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time trying out fimo sticks, so they were smaller than i expected when I received them.</li>
            <li> I used a x-acto knife to make sure to cut thin pieces.</li>
            <li> I was able to use an exacto-knife to get some thin slices to use for nails.  </li>
            <li> Need to be sure and cut the decals thin</li>
            <li> These are also just the right size to be put on a little girl&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li> Plus if you don&#x27;t slice them just right and really thin, they look funny on your nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering ordering more but what this set will probably last me at least 5 years!</li>
            <li> 4 of another orange slice, 4 of the exact same leaf, and 2-3 duplicates of a bunch of other sticks.</li>
            <li> its cute on the nails but is way smaller then it appears and very hard to cut and slice up.</li>
            <li> i got a few duplicates but still have a very large selection for my clients</li>
            <li> I used a Tomato knife to cut them and it was very clean and thin.</li>
            <li> They were to many alike, to many ugly fruit, and the canes were not worth the wait or the money.</li>
            <li> They showed up much quicker than other purchases that I have made.</li>
            <li> These little stickers are really cute and they come in a lot of designs although there&#x27;re a few of them</li>
            <li> I ordered another pack from amazon, because these were taking forever to get here, and there were 200 of them and not a single repeat in them at all</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll be able to salvage the sticks and use them for arts and crafts projects, but as nail design we just couldn&#x27;t get it thin enough to work.</li>
            <li> Cool assortment, no repeats, but they are very very short, maybe an inch to an inch and a half long.</li>
            <li> My favorites were her, a little pig, a panda bear, and a really pretty flower.</li>
            <li> I got a bunch of different designs [not the same as pictured, but still really cool] and my little cousins loves when I do her nails with cupcakes or snowmen!</li>
            <li> really hard to cut and smaller than expected really cute designs</li>
            <li> The order is split into ten smaller bags, all of completely the same design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine an adult walking around with 3d monkey</li>
            <li> These were my first set of canes and I didn&#x27;t have any trouble slicing.</li>
            <li> I received 33 of the same exact black and white square checker board print, 14 lady</li>
            <li> I love them all, my only complaint is that the shipment came later then expected</li>
            <li> I think others have mentioned this, but in order to avoid tons of duplicates or bad sticks (i.e. messed up &amp;#34;images&amp;#34;) be sure to order these from MASH.  </li>
            <li> I do not mind the small size as much as the fact that I did not get ANY where near the selection shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> All the girls did each other&#x27;s nails and had endless fun.  </li>
            <li> They are really easy to cut as thin as you need them</li>
            <li> So beware to kids because my daughter thought she could slice a few more when I stepped away and she ended up with a small slice on her finger instead.</li>
            <li> it would be okay for older kids but not for younger children unless your going to do the cutting.</li>
            <li> And half the designs are really cute and the other half I have no idea what they even are.</li>
            <li> they come uncut so you could slice them thick or thin,so easy to use just slice them with a razor I bought a cheap razor holder too</li>
            <li> There were a couple that I thought were a bit ugly, and one or two of the sticks were slightly bent out of shape (still completely usable though), but overall, I&#x27;m really happy with the assortment I got.</li>
            <li> Most of the canes are very small (extra small) and the rest are regular sized (still normal for fimo canes) and are 2 inches long.</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointing, so I was glad I hadn&#x27;t spent too much on them.</li>
            <li> My fimo canes came in the mail nearly 2 weeks earlier than the expected date which is nov. 17 to dec. 4!  </li>
            <li> but they slice it off very thin and use it under the top coat.</li>
            <li> The trick to using them is to slice them very, very thin, and then apply a top coat over them.</li>
            <li> Not very long, but long enough that a lot will come out of one stick.</li>
            <li> Cute but hard to use, I need lots more practice cutting them even!  </li>
            <li> Purchased for my 11 year old granddaughter for Christmas along with other Mash products.  </li>
            <li> plus you will need something sharp to cut them if you want it to look professional.</li>
            <li> the ones that are cut thin enough, don&#x27;t stay on your nails for very long, and when they fall off there&#x27;s a huge naked spot on your nail.</li>
            <li> they are cute little sticks, very hard to cut until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Got here fast, the are the small ones</li>
            <li> They are each only 1 inch long.  </li>
            <li> The sticks are only about 2 inches long.</li>
            <li> do feel this will last a long time, tho</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but for some reason I was expecting the rods to be about as long as regular pencils.  </li>
            <li> It actually looks like long erasers but you have to slice the end off to apply.  </li>
            <li> it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> 1 INCH long and MULTIPLE repeats.  </li>
            <li> Good variety and comes with a little blade for cutting.</li>
            <li> They were a lot shorter than I thought they would be, but it&#x27;s still gonna last me a really long time!  </li>
            <li> You should, They do cost alot, But they will last for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading this!</li>
            <li> They will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> I can also see these lasting a VERY long time.</li>
            <li> I think these will last for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I received these a week and a half early which is a plus.</li>
            <li> so got them after  about 3 weeks which is still a bout a week and a half early for the shipping date because they ship from china, but opened the envelope they came in all they were in was a zipploc bag</li>
            <li> * translucent appearance from a super thin slice.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s super thin.</li>
            <li> am also kind of disappointed over a few of the designs, letters should not be in there unless you specifically ask for certain ones.</li>
            <li> Not very clear on what to do with them.</li>
            <li> , they are hard to cut, be smart if you are buying this for your kids you need to help them.</li>
            <li> there was 100 of them, I did get some Of the designs advertised, a few that I really wanted and some unexpected surprises also a cutting blade was enclosed which made them worth buying for me.  </li>
            <li> These rods will last you a very long time!</li>
            <li> and you get many other random designs.</li>
            <li> they were really cute and had a vivid color, unfortunatly my pack didnt come with any hello kitty :(</li>
            <li> to use- slice thin with a sharp razor &amp; apply with clear coat.&lt;br /&gt;Lot of variety &amp; pretty things.</li>
            <li> Much easier for people who have very flat nails, but even the least bit of curve to your nail</li>
            <li> Some are a little cheesy or better for kids, but everyone has different tastes</li>
            <li> Came with very cute designs but they didn&#x27;t stick onto my nail :(</li>
            <li> there were also some not so nice or some just ugly...</li>
            <li> Cutting them gets easier the more you do it.</li>
            <li> I received these and was surprised at how small they were (which is what I was hoping for because I have tiny nails).</li>
            <li> I thought these would be the size of a pencil, but they areabout 2 inches long.  </li>
            <li> Each stick is about 2 inches long.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll be using them for a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a stupendous product however the rods are a lot smaller the expected.</li>
            <li> They are around an inch long (makes around 25-50 slithers).</li>
            <li> but I think they are about 2-3 inches long each</li>
            <li> They show the long  sticks I am used to receiving.</li>
            <li> Then they send you junk thats one inch long</li>
            <li> but I did receive a few near duplicates of fruits (like cherries and starberries).</li>
            <li> Complete waste off mone.  </li>
            <li> took a really long time to receive.</li>
            <li> This took sooooooooo long to come.</li>
            <li> Although in the picture above it shows hello kitty, I got a pink one instead.</li>
            <li> It took so long to get these I forgot about them.</li>
            <li> Smaller than what expected and not all shown were in package.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to receive and was not even what I thought it was.</li>
            <li> I expected 100 different designs.</li>
            <li> When I purchased the product, the item was described as being 5 cm long and the rods will come in a variety.</li>
            <li> None of them were broken, none of mine were exact dupes--for instance, I have 3 dragonflies, but they&#x27;re all different colors.  </li>
            <li> Fun to use but get an exactlo knife to cut them thinly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before you get too excited and cut like crazy, I recommend taking out your least favorite and do a few test runs!</li>
            <li> My 5 year old found another use for them, as well, getting me to cut some slices for him to place on his pictures; a little glue and the extra design is there to enhance his drawings and give them a little extra pizzazz.  </li>
            <li> The rods half the length describe, 1 inch, and I only receive 10 different types of rods.</li>
            <li> but then you also get things like stripes and letters that are useless unless you&#x27;re lucky enough to get one that relates to your monogram or whatever.  </li>
            <li> Just a plain old Ziplock.  </li>
            <li> They are very small, but I guess they need to be small to fit on your nails.</li>
            <li> how long you allow them to dry.</li>
            <li> they are like little eraser noodles and are only like 1 in long and very tiny</li>
            <li> Every other design is different in some way.</li>
            <li> While they were smaller than expected, the person that they were a gift for loves them!</li>
            <li> It lacks only a sharp tool to prepare.</li>
            <li> definitely not what i expected!</li>
            <li> The blade that comes with them is certainly sharp enough</li>
            <li> Other sites sells it for cheaper but gives you 3 of the same design..</li>
            <li> I hope they send me the other 2 or at list give my money back.</li>
            <li> Received today she likes the designs but not the fact that they are smaller than the other ones she had ordered  before .</li>
            <li> At first I was making the slices too thick!  </li>
            <li> I also have a few that have breaks in the outside of the design, hopefully that won&#x27;t cause issues when I get that far down those sticks.</li>
            <li> Some of them are very strange</li>
            <li> I hold it in place until the polish is dry</li>
            <li> What I got was many of the same figures and they were quite ugly, not all the ones that are shown in the picture..</li>
            <li> and I can never get them thin enough or straight.</li>
            <li> Also, I got quite a few duplicates, including like 5 or 6 of the same stick, which is some red, fruit-like triangle that I will probably never use.&lt;br /&gt;Also, not all of the sticks i got are even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like being able to make them as thick or thin that I want.</li>
            <li> I received this set and was excited it came early, but shortly after opening it I was disappointed to find the Hello Kiity stick was not in the mix of the 97 not 100pcs I did received.</li>
            <li> they will also last a long time, i was able to slice one stick into 34 thick pieces and another one into like 74 thin slices!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not a single one of the designs is repeated in the package..</li>
            <li> the description was limited.  </li>
            <li> so I can only assume these were long pieces cut in half or three sections.</li>
            <li> The LENGTH of the actual stick its self is the size of an average NEEDILE.</li>
            <li> I recommend cutting the sticks on a flat surface that is lightly elevated from your table/desk</li>
            <li> I used an Exacto knife pen and ended up getting them pretty thin.</li>
            <li> cute/wierd pink monkey</li>
            <li> I was kind of disappointed that I did not receive the hello kitty fimo stick.</li>
            <li> ; that was the only down</li>
            <li> But I figured they package these at random, and at least the ones that were repeats are cute (blue bows, pink cupcakes, cherries)</li>
            <li> but it takes a little practice to do them very properly and to the point they look decent, well at least for me.</li>
            <li> I could barely understand the gentleman I was speaking with, he was breathing hard like he had been running and had enough accent that between the two I struggled to follow what he was telling me.</li>
            <li> I actually only received 98 of them and had no repeats and one of the ones I got were slightly imperfect.</li>
            <li> only need to use half a drop of glue, and it doesn&#x27;t even have to be nail glue, I used modeling glue.</li>
            <li> I bought them only for the Puerto rican flag I seen in previous reviews...</li>
            <li> I actually bought these to add some 3D interest to craft projects, but not sure if that will actually work.  </li>
            <li> Cut it in half or make a different design.  </li>
            <li> so you pay double for half of what you expect to get.</li>
            <li> my home has turned into a nail polar.</li>
            <li> They are smaller than half your pinky hahah.</li>
            <li> Based on the pictures, it looks like the sets differ slightly because I saw some in the pics that I definitely didn&#x27;t get in my set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly half of what MASH is selling but for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> New beginning at a little trouble receiving my order</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if they&#x27;re good or bad because I don&#x27;t know how to use them!</li>
            <li> For some reason some of my stix go from big to tiny like a cone effect and 3 of my stix have a small chunk missing on the side in the middle of the stick.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I thought</li>
            <li> They were a little smaller than I had imagined.</li>
            <li> The images on the design rods are clear--even the little mustache on the white rod.  </li>
            <li> HAS LITTLE LIKE THE KEY OF THE DOOR!</li>
            <li> I used a simple straight edge blade to shave thin pieces off and that was a little time consuming</li>
            <li> but I have to find our exacto knife to get the slice thin enough to keep the picture of the thing but also to stay on the finger nail with clear polish....</li>
            <li> You really want to get these cut almost paper thin, or they will catch on your clothing and fall off.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> than I expected given some of the reviews that I read.</li>
            <li> I got a ton of canes though, which are well formed, none arrived broken, and they were shipped fast.  </li>
            <li> I am not much of a manicure person</li>
            <li> And they stay on really well when cut thin.</li>
            <li> with only a few duplicates.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a youtube  video on a girl using these tools to cut with minimal</li>
            <li> The shipping took me 2 weeks(14 days) to arrive even though the expected shipping was 1 month and 1 week.</li>
            <li> Careful dont cut yourself</li>
            <li> just be careful of the razor blade stuffed in there.</li>
            <li> One smiley face, three bows, four Christmas decorations,  one dragonfly, three teddy bears, alot of butterflies, one flag (unknown origin), one ice cream cone, two desserts,  one pizza and some unknown designs.</li>
            <li> i.e. you can not really tell what design they are supposed to be, and some of them are quite distorted</li>
            <li> Took a while to arrive which I expected so no problems.</li>
            <li> Have to cut really thin and straight</li>
            <li> I got these before I expected them to arrive..</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Hold well with wet</li>
            <li> received sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I have 19 duplicates &amp; 3 unknown.</li>
            <li> Came on time and had a wide sampling of canes to work with.</li>
            <li> these are a much harder</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t as I expected at all</li>
            <li> Arrived way before the expected date (Jan. 34-Feb. 11).</li>
            <li> I think the product arrived well, but it was not what I had expected.  </li>
            <li> I filed a claim with Amazon&#x27;s A-to-z Guarantee service and after a few back and forth emails (buypretty just wanted to refund me $1</li>
            <li> So I was actually surprised when I opened this because it was so small!</li>
            <li> These fimo sticks are LESS THAN half the size of regular sticks.  </li>
            <li> I was a little confused at first</li>
            <li> did get 2 or 3 with small dents in them, but it was hardly anything.&lt;br /&gt;They came fast, and I didn&#x27;t get any</li>
            <li> They feel and look like little long erasers.  </li>
            <li> Some of the canes came half sized, but only a few.</li>
            <li> The only doubles I receive were of the orange, other than that each one is at least in a different color, if not unique to the pack.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s EXTREMELY hard to slice the whole icon and get it thin enough to mold to your finger shape.</li>
            <li> I like these to go with my other fimo canes that are about 3 to 5mm in diameter</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is their way of increasing their profits by shorting the order, or if it was accidental, but either way I ended up on the short end of the deal.</li>
            <li> Although some are repetitive they come in different colors.</li>
            <li> After figuring out there was a sharp edge covered by paper, and that the nail polish wasn&#x27;t smoothed out with that</li>
            <li> This is not exactly what I was expecting.....</li>
            <li> and it is little bitty tiny little rods and a razor.</li>
            <li> bears like I&#x27;ve seen other people get.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about baking these in the LED with the regular gel...  </li>
            <li> When I received I thought it was so small (5 cm), but then I thought it was enough, because every one can get about fifty or eighty stickers ...</li>
            <li> I use them for nails, but I can see how my daughter will probably use them for other craft things as well.</li>
            <li> when I rec, I am surprise to see the size is too small, according to pic its seems to big.</li>
            <li> There were no exact duplicates</li>
            <li> /&gt;Adult supervision is needed to do the slicing as it involves the use of sharp knifes and blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend trying these for other art projects and not just your nails....</li>
            <li> And there was no Hello Kitty, but I don&#x27;t care because, with all due respect, I am not one of her fans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the only thing i woud say is a little off about them is that they r a little costy.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 17 yo daughter, she had no experience with anything sharp</li>
            <li> It allows to even cut the pieces with a scissor, knife, or other sharp</li>
            <li> My daughter has had a blast and all her friends want to come over and give each other manicures.</li>
            <li> and some went from big to small.</li>
            <li> The down side  are that these are very small rods about an inch long and the designs are also small with less details than I expected, the colors are not as vibrant as they are pictured.  </li>
            <li> A little too hard for a young one like her.</li>
            <li> However, be aware, they do not come with the razor and they are very tough to cut.</li>
            <li> i was not very happy with the % dollars i spent to get this as a Christmas present for a friend.</li>
            <li> I did get some cool flags nada two colors of skulls and three that look like angry birds!  </li>
            <li> The ( 4 )  that were extra were hard to identify my assumption</li>
            <li> But once I do actually get the slice, it&#x27;s too hard to bend to the curvature of the nail and breaks or just won&#x27;t stick to the nail, even with nail glue.</li>
            <li> The key is to cut them as thin as possible which will take a little practice.</li>
            <li> As I notice from the OTHER buyer pictures, they&#x27;re close to the size of half an average pen.  </li>
            <li> 12yr old daughter loves all the different pictures on these, but hard to cut thin slices and keep on nails.  </li>
            <li> I felt like they were very hard to cut super thin</li>
            <li> you really have to say WTF</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these before and they are usually about 3 inches long..</li>
            <li> The set has several (at least 15) sets of duplicates.</li>
            <li> Not worth the cuts on fingers.</li>
            <li> You can glue them on with nail glue or use a thin coat of clear polish to make it stick to your nails.  </li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to get the hang of slicing them</li>
            <li> Down side was the packaging.  </li>
            <li> The sticks themselves were in a plastic thing like what you would see on store shelves, and at some point during shipping this packaging broke down one side.  </li>
            <li> 15% of them are repeat, that mean I have 15 of the same design twice..</li>
            <li> Came with a really sharp little razor too</li>
            <li> They are so hard that it&#x27;s extremely difficult to cut them, and I waste a lot of the rod trying to get a full slice</li>
            <li> I use a very sharp exacto knife (again not for kids) and cut a bunch.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a tool that will slice them thin enough to stick to my nails longer than a day or thin enough to lay flatly on my nails.</li>
            <li> but when they came they were 1 and a half , some were damadged and some had designs i would NEVER use .</li>
            <li> and one of them looked like it had been half way used before (</li>
            <li> Even the slightly imperfect ones would yield hundreds of decals</li>
            <li> And for less than 10$</li>
            <li> so I believe that they just took 50 canes and cut them in half to be 100.</li>
            <li> oddly cut and the picture advertised is not what i received.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- not very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I simply slice a thin slice, paint my nail, then put the slice in place while the polish is wet.</li>
            <li> odd heart with wings?&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> Odd item.  </li>
            <li> The designs are nice but cutting them is difficult.</li>
            <li> and it took them less then a week to get here.</li>
            <li> I asked the seller to put a disclaimer under their product description saying that the sticks are randomly selected and that multiple duplicates are possible.  </li>
            <li> They are hard to get thin enough though, but that is only a fault of mine.</li>
            <li> These sticks are supposed to be at least 2 inches long.</li>
            <li> Even if you mess up, try to cut it in a way</li>
            <li> these are kinda hard to use and they didnt stay on my nails very long.</li>
            <li> If you slice them thinly, they will last for a few days, but if you slice them thick, they will chip off in only one or two days.</li>
            <li> I am not familiar with these and ordered them to see how they work, but there are no directions.</li>
            <li> these came in a little baggie</li>
            <li> little bows</li>
            <li> I had some canes that had little cracks</li>
            <li> They sent me a ton of these little things.  </li>
            <li> cover a vase or what ever your little heart desires</li>
            <li> and I have little plastic dishes to separate them into.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be a little thicker</li>
            <li> At first, it was difficult to use these, but after lots of practice, I&#x27;ve become a pro!</li>
            <li> IT WOULD BE SO LITTLE,</li>
            <li> If you slice them too thick, it cannot bend to follow the curves of your nails&amp;#60; If cut too thin, they curl up and you have to press them until the polish is dry and sticky enough for them to stay in place.</li>
            <li> You get 100 sticks and with proper cutting they could last forever.  </li>
            <li> I recomand to use the very tip when cutting</li>
            <li> bugs,8 flowers, 9 strawberries,12 presents and a few others.</li>
            <li> There are a few sticks I&#x27;ll never use (Hello Kitty, eggs, etc.)</li>
            <li> Looking at beauty stores around I soon realized to buy a few pre-cut nail art \\&quot;thingys\\</li>
            <li> With some tweezers I had 13 on my nails and dried in 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For a reference check out my photo with the green nail tips.</li>
            <li> but she cannot seem to get it thin enough to stay on her nails.  </li>
            <li> I did have a few repeats and a few</li>
            <li> and I think I might change my nails everyday with these.</li>
            <li> I was missing one cane out of 100</li>
            <li> She asked me to slice a few from 3 sticks</li>
            <li> because I ordered 2 sets.&lt;br /&gt;Although the patterns are nice, you cannot begin to imagine how disgusting it is!</li>
            <li> I got a few repeats</li>
            <li> There are a few character pieces</li>
            <li> There are also a few interesting-looking butterflies and geometric shapes.  </li>
            <li> Also, a couple of them had some damage where chunks were missing (at the ends).</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t waste it.  </li>
            <li> but quite a few duplicates.  </li>
            <li> everyday uses.great</li>
            <li> ( except for a few i have no idea what they are)</li>
            <li> Word of advice; cut them as thin as possible.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had time to try them yet do to my foot surgery but plan on setting up an cut a few..</li>
            <li> If you slice them thin with a buck knife and glue them on they will last 3-5 days.</li>
            <li> [...]    Mine came a few days ago and I just tried using them.</li>
            <li> I used a razor blade to cut them and practiced on a few of the uglier sticks.</li>
            <li> Considering how thinly you can slice these sticks, they&#x27;ll probably last me a life time.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of trouble with them staying on.</li>
            <li> I just got my design canes and it was missing one cane.</li>
            <li> and you MUST use a razor blade to slice them thin enough to put on your nails.</li>
            <li> I expected at least twice the size, if not 2.5&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> There is no way to slice these thin enough to stay on my nail longer than a day.</li>
            <li> dont waste time on the others.</li>
            <li> A few tips though</li>
            <li> I use the razor blade to cut these off in strips that are as thin as I can possibly get them.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t get a few i was hoping I would</li>
            <li> everyday i change my nail arts</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and she used them a few times.</li>
            <li> I have fairly small hands--women&#x27;s size 4 ring--with a high curve to all my nails, so unless very thinly sliced</li>
            <li> I cut mine with a small exacto blade which I normally use for crafting and it gets very thin slices.</li>
            <li> Look at your pinki it is half of that!</li>
            <li> I got several duplicates, like 4 frogs, 4 of another weird spiral, some other but those were the highest numbers.</li>
            <li> They are so small you can barely see what the decoration is on most.&lt;br /&gt;Because they are so small and you have to cut them so thin, be prepared to cut your fingers.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time cutting them to the thickness that I wanted at first</li>
            <li> They shipped from China, and were packaged in plain plastic bags (I ordered 2 sets) rather than MASH bags.</li>
            <li> Late delivery, repetitive designs, didn&#x27;t find some of the designs that I expected.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she likes it, its a little hard to cut the pieces thin enough to put on your nails though.</li>
            <li> idea behind them was very cool, and my little sister loves the ones she can use, however, I&#x27;m over-all disappointed with the quality of the product and am unsure if I will order them again from this company.</li>
            <li> but I find it hard to cut down to slices.</li>
            <li> out of all the canes that i received maybe 10 were pretty ugly.</li>
            <li> Each cane is approximately 1/8-1/4\\&quot; diameter, and 2\\&quot; long.  </li>
            <li> Then I got these random sticks of religious icons; NOT COOL.</li>
            <li> As for repeats, there were a few, but very few.</li>
            <li> It was really hard to get them sliced thin enough, took quite a bit of practice... ended up giving them to a friends daughter.</li>
            <li> they are too hard to cut thin enough.</li>
            <li> If you are new to using these, I recommend you practice on a rod that you aren&#x27;t so crazy about the design just to get used to slicing them.</li>
            <li> Cutting them is tricky if ur new to this but check out videos on youtube.</li>
            <li> Cutting them thin enough to lay on fingertip is difficult and good luck cutting them evenly.</li>
            <li> Not just fruit, butterflies, flowers, and random shapes on less than half the expected size.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m set for a few years!</li>
            <li> yes they canes are small</li>
            <li> not sure if i&#x27;d by anymore</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want it to be small</li>
            <li> I ordered 100, and I&#x27;m not satisfied at all...</li>
            <li> No more than that.</li>
            <li> I found out that the sticks are really small..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think they were so small</li>
            <li> but they were just soo difficult to cut them into small enough pieces to ensure they stayed on the nails.  </li>
            <li> They are really small they said they would be the size of A ciggerete</li>
            <li> Sticks measure roughly 2 inches and are not bent or broken.</li>
            <li> They even come with a small razor to shave the rod</li>
            <li> THESE THINGS ARE SO SMALL</li>
            <li> so I will probably wont buy from you no more</li>
            <li> There were only a couple duplicates in the package along with a couple weird ones.</li>
            <li> The was one that looked like an egg yoke and a couple I am not sure what they are.</li>
            <li> there were no instructions and we were not sure how to use these&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I had no idea it would be so small.</li>
            <li> then I expected and you cant slice them paper thin.</li>
            <li> not more than a couple hours</li>
            <li> that I know i will use alot) and only three wtf&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> Certainly not for children to use!&lt;br /&gt;Lots of repeats and broken ones, like someone already cut them in half.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> They only problem that I had with this was that the blade they supply with it, thank you, was a little small and after spending time working and cutting these</li>
            <li> There were a few repeats, a few of them with blurry images, a few \\&quot;wtf are these??\\&quot; and some of the ones pictured do not come with the set I received.</li>
            <li> even some I haven&#x27;t the slightly idea what they are.&lt;br /&gt;there&#x27;s a lot, and slice thin</li>
            <li> they are very small and I have to say I&#x27;m not really sure how to use them.</li>
            <li> So i started using nail glue to hold them on, and the problem with that is when i want to change nail polish its hard to get them off.</li>
            <li> hard to cut evenly, kids use for beading</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hardly use them, ever</li>
            <li> They are hard to cut.  </li>
            <li> and you could hardly tell i used any.</li>
            <li> it is a bit hard to cut</li>
            <li> and it is also hard to cut.</li>
            <li> Its really hard to see in the picture</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re extremely hard to cut off and don&#x27;t stay on your nail.</li>
            <li> I do find it hard to cut them if you dont have a type of razor that will cut them evenly.</li>
            <li> really hard to slice...</li>
            <li> Im sorry about my bad english, im not american!</li>
            <li> Sadly there was a few warped and cracked, contacted the seller immediately and within a few hours they replied with a satisfactory resolution.</li>
            <li> I thought the sticks were at least 6 inches .</li>
            <li> Also this comes with the cutting blade so don&#x27;t buy extra blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only issue i had was the razor blade that came in the box was haphazardly stuffed in the box and it did not have a sleeve or guard on it...</li>
            <li> I did&#x27;nt take negative reviews to heart.</li>
            <li> Well at least mine did.</li>
            <li> At least it wasnt the ones I would use.</li>
            <li> pre-cut slice them too thick, making it appear bulky on the nail.</li>
            <li> Also the circular designs are easier to cut thinly compared to some of the shapes so you may want to use round ones to get started.  </li>
            <li> Slow shipping.</li>
            <li> Too thick for nails</li>
            <li> so im forced to use kitchen knives</li>
            <li> Real waste of money to me.</li>
            <li> but when I got them I was shocked there smaller than a  cigarette and not easy to slice</li>
            <li> If you cut them very thin they curl and don&#x27;t stick to your wet nail polish.</li>
            <li> The four rating is due to how difficult they are to slice.</li>
            <li> but I would like diff canes other then 23 canes of angry birds</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people would have problems cutting them thin enough unless they are impatient or have poor eye sight or something.</li>
            <li> , i did however had i hard time cutting them thin enough</li>
            <li> Very small</li>
            <li> The sticks were very small.</li>
            <li> very bad product ,is not good at all.comes in a cheao and small sandwich bag with nothing ,no instruction no nothing very disapointed</li>
            <li> an Angry Bird (black crow), Sponge Bob (yuck), a frog, a teddy bear, and a Santa-esque.  </li>
            <li> it was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> is ridiculous because of the selection you get.</li>
            <li> I am not having any luck with cutting these thin enough to stay on my nails.  </li>
            <li> Hard to cut thin.</li>
            <li> However, it wasn&#x27;t nearly as hard to get really thin slices</li>
            <li> few repeats but ill probably use them all someday for something.</li>
            <li> Not good for nails...</li>
            <li> no duplicates and a few that are WTF is that</li>
            <li> Too much trouble to return it since it wasn’t that expensive.</li>
            <li> No matter how thin she cuts it, it is too thick.</li>
            <li> I cut them with an exacto knive some thin and some thick can&#x27;t wait to use.</li>
            <li> You can choose how thick or thin you want to cut the designs and mix and match to your heart&#x27;s content.  </li>
            <li> That gets back to the cutting them with a razor as thin as possible which depending on the age of the person cutting can be difficult.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed how tiny they were</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a bit creepy, not sure when someone would want that on their nails.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled!</li>
            <li> do Not buy this product I did and they don&#x27;t stay on your nail, they are very hard to put on</li>
            <li> Very hard to use.</li>
            <li> When I placed order it said the canes would be 2 inches, I was not very happy when I found they were 1 inch!</li>
            <li> It is very hard to cut them thin.  </li>
            <li> Very hard to cut as thinly as needed.</li>
            <li> I got alot of weird , hard to tell what they are designs,&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have a hard time cutting them so that they are thin, so they are not to thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very easy to cut, and some of the designs are ridiculous and unneeded but for the price, I guess it isn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy because there&#x27;s no hello kitty, the picture shows  hello kitty</li>
            <li> I have one stick broken</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t thinly slice them then they won&#x27;t stay on tour nail.</li>
            <li> and they provide you with a razor to cut the sticks into thin strips.  </li>
            <li> but you you have to slice them really thin if you do</li>
            <li> and i can cut it thin as i wanted</li>
            <li> a thin, even slice</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t get them to be as thin.</li>
            <li> The idea is you cut them thin and glue them on your nail.  </li>
            <li> you need to slice these paper thin yourself and its quite difficult.</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> got a bunch of fruits, flags, round canes with flowers inside, not shaped :-( and tear drops.</li>
            <li> Sent them back, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t feel bad if you mess up while cutting them.</li>
            <li> Completely random selection</li>
            <li> They were much smaller than I anticipated, but the worst part was that the package had been opened and retaped on the end.</li>
            <li> With these being a random assortment</li>
            <li> I imagine it would be difficult to place them, but I&#x27;ve had a lot of experience with Fimo clay, so that wasn&#x27;t a problem for me.  </li>
            <li> I got alot of flowers, fruit, hello kitty &amp; her friends, random animals, &amp;</li>
            <li> duplicates, 20 flowers, 20 fruits, 20 smiley faces and WTF are those, 20 butterflies, and 19 animals.&lt;br</li>
            <li> there not the worst but definitely not what I was expecting...</li>
            <li> You have to get used to cutting them thinly.</li>
            <li> I think they just pick a handful of random ones before they ship it to you.</li>
            <li> You will need to slice these thin, but you can apply them to anything!  </li>
            <li> I know they are totally random</li>
            <li> but I know they&#x27;re random so not complaining j/s</li>
            <li> had you gotten to choose the designs received but just randomly receiving the designs</li>
            <li> : Its difficult 2 cut them</li>
            <li> Cutting the sticks into wafer thin slices is made easier using a razor (I use a window scraper device from the hardware store).</li>
            <li> then the product is useless.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I did not get the reindeer,or the hello kitty fimo.</li>
            <li> The Santa was unable to be distinguished, it was almost microscopic.</li>
            <li> get me wrong.</li>
            <li> was not mash all random</li>
            <li> They are bulgy and stick out and any wrong move they will snap off.</li>
            <li> what it was, and used that as my test one, cutting as thin as I could before I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Dont get me wrong</li>
            <li> using a razor blade to slice these evenly and paper-thin is quite difficult, requiring a lot of patience.</li>
            <li> When I ordered these I was skeptical on these bc of the reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M SOO ANGRY.</li>
            <li> They are difficult to cut, I used a razor so i would say not for kids.</li>
            <li> Some smiley faces, hearts, fruits, angry birds, etc.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> I like angry birds</li>
            <li> KNOW WTF WAS</li>
            <li> I read that these come at random sometimes?</li>
            <li> angry birds (2</li>
            <li> It did take a bit of a learning curve to cut the decals very thin without losing part of the picture.  </li>
            <li> You have to slice with razor very thin.</li>
            <li> , u need some very thin to do it</li>
            <li> u have to slice them very thin to get them to stay on your fingernail</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s almost impossible to slice them perfectly thin and even.</li>
            <li> I ordered other fimo canes before these ones &amp; they were just awful.</li>
            <li> I practiced cutting on duplicate designs and once I perfected my cut, I used topcoat to attach to my nail.</li>
            <li> , I began cutting my fimo for my nails immediately.</li>
            <li> ease of use (cutting) &#x3D;</li>
            <li> That was disappointing considering I&#x27;ll never use these at all.</li>
            <li> My suggestions is practice cutting on the ones you don&#x27;t think you will use, I received a couple where you look at it and are like &amp;#</li>
            <li> I need to practice my cutting techniques.  </li>
            <li> I tried to pick one that I didn&#x27;t like so I can practice cutting it</li>
            <li> but if u dont have the cutting skills to get</li>
            <li> so i recomend trying to practice cutting the sticks you will never use.</li>
            <li> but my problem was cutting them, it got tiring after a while.</li>
            <li> I ended up just cutting like 3 of each design.</li>
            <li> It  is just plain awful and does not work at all!!</li>
            <li> I will need to practice cutting them on an ugly one</li>
            <li> i guess not so bad</li>
            <li> its not that bad ..</li>
            <li> cause it was kinda ugly</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I felt like they were very hard to cut super thin</li>
            <li> My fimo canes came in the mail nearly 2 weeks earlier than the expected date which is nov. 17 to dec. 4!  I was disappointed how tiny they were and also I ordered these because they had those cute hello kitty fimos I didn&#x27;t get any.</li>
            <li> It was really hard to get them sliced thin enough, took quite a bit of practice... ended up giving them to a friends daughter.</li>
            <li> These work great! Just what I wanted for my nail art and the product was in perfect shape.I will defiantly order from them again.</li>
            <li> do Not buy this product I did and they don&#x27;t stay on your nail, they are very hard to put on and you don&#x27;t get all of the ones in the picture I didn&#x27;t get the cat, bow, ying yang, peace sign and several others, its cheap but its not worth a penny of my money or time.</li>
            <li> I really had no idea what they were besides you cut them and apply them to your nail, ordered them. I love them they are cute little sticks, very hard to cut until you get used to it. All kinds of fruit butterflies flowers and even the one I really wanted a hello kitty!! Very satisfied and arrived much sooner than final date</li>
            <li> Premium MASH 100 Pc Nail Art Nailart 3d Manicure Design Sticks Rods&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; good quality, nice design, easy to use, It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I received a bag of very cute designs. 16 designs were repeated with one of those containing five of the same. I didn&#x27;t mind the repeats as they are really cute. Sadly there was a few warped and cracked, contacted the seller immediately and within a few hours they replied with a satisfactory resolution. Will absolutely order these again.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my granddaughter it is to be used with acrilic nails. i didn&#x27;t know that. but they slice it off very thin and use it under the top coat. looks great so it works .......</li>
            <li> I just received my order. Instead of all the different designs shown. I only received 12 different designs. I received 33 of the same exact black and white square checker board print, 14 lady bugs,8 flowers, 9 strawberries,12 presents and a few others. They are also a lot smaller than I was expecting. They are each only 1 inch long.  I do not mind the small size as much as the fact that I did not get ANY where near the selection shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> First off, I have never used any sort of fimo art before and have never cut up fimo sticks. These were a bit challenging at first, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s a very quick process. I only recieved two doubles, but those two sticks were actually two extra sticks (they had sent me 102). Every other design is different in some way. I was super stoked to see that they included two DIFFERENT designs of Hello Kitty. Really good quality, seem to be lasting on my nail really well, and you get SO much for your money. I love these and hope to get more designs in the future, but I&#x27;m probably set for life with all the ones I have just from this package haha. Really good buym, I got them quickly, and super fun if you&#x27;re into nail art</li>
            <li> I was looking for nail art for my 10 year old granddaughter&#x27;s birthday, and these were just perfect!  She is able to apply by herself and they stay on very well.  She has come up with all kinds of combos and designs that are very creative.  She had a sleepover on her birthday and these were the hit of the party!  All the girls did each other&#x27;s nails and had endless fun.  One caveat is that the sticks must be sliced paper-thin with a razor, so adult participation is necessary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought these! Not only did they ship incredibly fast, but the product quality is amazing. Some places that sell the fimo canes pre-cut slice them too thick, making it appear bulky on the nail. So I&#x27;m glad I can slice these myself! The designs are great and really popular with my clientele. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll run out any time soon, because you get so many, but if I do I&#x27;ll certainly purchase from MASH again!</li>
            <li> You must buy the slicer separate, so that&#x27;s a con.  But they were very cute!  There were maybe 115 canes in all, and there were about 10-20 repeat canes.  The quality is great, and some of the canes have incredible detail!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 19 year old daughter and we BOTH love them. They are easy and are fun. We both enjoy the results. We do suggest painting a clear top coat of polish over the nail art to secure. We are very pleased with this product and will order again.</li>
            <li> These arrived quickly and packaged well. They are small enough that they even fit on my pinkie nail. I did not receive any duplicates and I received exactly 100 sticks. There are a few sticks I&#x27;ll never use (Hello Kitty, eggs, etc.) but I will use 90% of them. Many of them are flowers, butterflies, fruit, and food related. Slicing the sticks took some getting used to, so I practiced on the ones I wouldn&#x27;t use anyways. I used an Exacto knife pen and ended up getting them pretty thin. I warmed them first in my hand for a minute or so, which made slicing them much easier. I used nail glue to place them on my nail and they lasted well over a week. I would definitely recommend these! They are cute and I received tons of compliments!</li>
            <li> I love these sticks.  They are about 2 inches in length, however, that is plenty to last.  I bought some razor blades to slice them, which does take some practice.  But they are very cute and there is a large variety.</li>
            <li> I love these. The price is amazing! On etsy you could get a batch of 20 for like $15 bucks! Once I saw this I was like OH HELL YEAH! Because they&#x27;re so cheap and you get so many! It is epic! The detail on some of them is amazing. There were exactly 100 and the packaging was perfect! I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> After seeing this trend around, I knew I wanted to try it! Looking at beauty stores around I soon realized to buy a few pre-cut nail art \\&quot;thingys\\&quot; was going to be pricey... but then I found these!!! Awesome buy... I don&#x27;t think I will ever  have to purchase again. You get 100 sticks with out repeats (I actually got 104). Each stick is about two inches long, and are very easy to cut with a razor blade. To adhere to the nail, just use your top coat. If you love nail art and buy almost everything in site... do not look past these! They are great!</li>
            <li> These are VERY cute, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but unless you have a really sharp razor blade and a bit of patience, these may not be right for you. I practiced cutting on duplicate designs and once I perfected my cut, I used topcoat to attach to my nail. I recommend nail glue for best results.  You really want to get these cut almost paper thin, or they will catch on your clothing and fall off.&lt;br /&gt;I am quite sure that they just toss a handful from a &#x27;lot&#x27; into your order, so don&#x27;t rely on the stock image itself. You may or may not get any or all of the designs you want.&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I am a satisfied customer. I would probably buy these again, but with 100 pcs I think I&#x27;m set for a few years!</li>
            <li> Not 100 pieces but very close. They even included a strong blade to cut these. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy because there&#x27;s no hello kitty, the picture shows  hello kitty but when I received  the backed  there was no hello kitty</li>
            <li> they are nice, the only  thing i cut them to thick,so i prefer the pre-cut</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the sticks, they were all very cute and and I would say all different in someway. It was all true to picture, they are tiny enough to fit on your nails and cheap enough to start practicing with. These were a great buy!  I would buy them again!</li>
            <li> Great selection of canes.  They were a lot shorter than I thought they would be, but it&#x27;s still gonna last me a really long time!  Can&#x27;t wait to get started on some designs with these!</li>
            <li> product is great--can&#x27;t wait to give it to my daughter!  Product came in the exact condition as described.  Very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> they are great love them you need to get your own blad though so bye a good shard one. package well and smaller den i thought but good overall</li>
            <li> Completely random selection i got a few duplicates but still have a very large selection for my clients</li>
            <li> This is such a good deal.  You get 100 sticks and with proper cutting they could last forever.  The designs are very cute and they have some similar designs but I haven&#x27;t seen any duplicates. Vibrant colors and high detail.  Some design examples are fruit, butterflies, dragonfly (my favorite), flowers, stars, american flag, smilies, some abstract.  If you are new to using these, I recommend you practice on a rod that you aren&#x27;t so crazy about the design just to get used to slicing them. Also the circular designs are easier to cut thinly compared to some of the shapes so you may want to use round ones to get started.  I cut mine with a small exacto blade which I normally use for crafting and it gets very thin slices.</li>
            <li> I received the product in a timely manner. There were a lot of repeats of ones I didn&#x27;t want but there were also repeats of the ones that I did so I cant complain.</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my daughter and she loves them.  I am glad that I purchased them and they are of great quality.  Came in time as promised.</li>
            <li> Okay... so I am new to the nail art world!  I am amateur at best, and I just really wanted to give these a try!  There are a lot of great designs here and some I have no idea what to do with! lol  My favorite are the fuit.  :)  Like the title says, I am (or was) a virgin to using these!  You will need a razor for this.  At first I was making the slices too thick!  But, I was able to re-slice them into halves and they worked perfectly.  I think the thinner you slice them, the better they look.  I like the *light* translucent appearance from a super thin slice.  I actually tried using a serated kitchen knife to make some of the slices.  It came out with a neat waved pattern!  It&#x27;s cute on some of the designs, but is harder to do.</li>
            <li> These are offered at a fantastic low price and includes a great variety. The canes are even all the way through, and the lengths are pretty consistent. I would happily ordered these again!</li>
            <li> I ordered these along with other Mash products and they came quick and packaged well yes they canes are small they are about 0.3-0.5mm but fimo canes come in a variety of diameters I like these to go with my other fimo canes that are about 3 to 5mm in diameter they look great yes you do have to cut them yourself but you can order about 10 fimo blades for 2 dollars on ebay so its not expensive.</li>
            <li> Got these for my ten year old daughter for Christmas, as I thought they&#x27;d be easier to use than air brush nail design kits.  Sticks are pretty stiff, so she wasn&#x27;t able to cut them with an exact-o knife by herself.  Designs were cute, but only lasted a day before they started falling off.  Kinda disappointing, so I was glad I hadn&#x27;t spent too much on them.</li>
            <li> My daugther purchased these and was very pleased. She is a big fan of nail art. The designs are very cute and these will probably last her a very long time.</li>
            <li> Para mi a sido expectacular, me enviaron rapido, los disenos son muy lindos y d cada uno  Se pueden sacar muchos 3d!!!</li>
            <li> didnt get the blue bow so im kinda upset since the blue bow is the main reason i bought the sticks anyway the sticks r great and deserve 5stars</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item and it came with no instructions on how to use it or if I needed something else to use with it. Sending gifts to my friends, it would be nice to atleast know how to use the product.</li>
            <li> So I was actually surprised when I opened this because it was so small! I expected it to be bigger and that&#x27;s honestly what I wanted but whatever. I haven&#x27;t actually used them yet so I can&#x27;t really review on that but I did try to cut one and all. I actually only received 98 of them and had no repeats and one of the ones I got were slightly imperfect. I got a lot of butterflies but surprisingly enough I only got 4 hearts and 3 or 4 stars. Packaging was okay but the only reason I&#x27;m giving only 3 stars is because I didn&#x27;t get all of the sticks and one was imperfect.</li>
            <li> You can make a TON of 3D nail art with these sticks. Some places around here sell the sliced pieces for something like $5 for only about 20 slices. All you gotta do is get a razor blade and slice them off. It&#x27;s not hard and it saves a ton of money. Plus, there are some super cute ones in the pack.</li>
            <li> Bought mine else where, was looking for a selection of nothing but fruit slices.&lt;br /&gt;With me being a Produce Manager and having my nails done once a month with acrylic powder, I was looking for something else to add some extra color but was wanting something to do with fruit. I saw these fimo canes and just had to buy them.&lt;br /&gt;You only need to use half a drop of glue, and it doesn&#x27;t even have to be nail glue, I used modeling glue. With some tweezers I had 13 on my nails and dried in 15 minutes. For somethig like this you would need a steady hand.&lt;br /&gt;For a reference check out my photo with the green nail tips.</li>
            <li> These canes are very cute and nice for the price. They&#x27;re very cheap compared to the pre-sliced kind and they&#x27;re very easy to slice yourself. You will not get exactly the same canes pictured, but they are still cute. I got mostly the same ones, just a few differences. However, I agree with how someone else mentioned that there are a lot of butterflies. Some designs I wouldn&#x27;t use, but there are so many others to choose from.</li>
            <li> Received my stick rods, stamper and rhinestone in perfect good condition. I love those cute little rods, its easy to slice with a penknife. It looks good on my nails and my friends all compliment on it. The stamper is easy to use, both ends are rubber tips (at 1st i thought is sponge tips from the picture shown), it works miracle on my nails, but i think u need a more concerntrated nail polish to bring out the pattern. The rhinestones are perfect accept it&#x27;s too small for my fingers to place it on my nails, need a tweezer to do the job.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great designs. I wish I could buy something to help me make thin &amp; perfect cuts each and every time.</li>
            <li> Looks great...got it super fast.  There is one little stick that is considerably smaller than the others, but overall they are better than I expected given some of the reviews that I read.</li>
            <li> they are really good, and though I have no idea if they need a special glue or smth, they still perfectly are glued on a wet manicure</li>
            <li> I received the item, and counted all pieces to make sure it came with exactly 100 pieces.  I was happy to see that it did.  All the pieces are small enough to fit on your nails, they are very cute.  The rods are exactly 2 inches long each, so don&#x27;t expect them to be as long as they look on the pictures.  The only 2 things that I did not like are 1) I received a lot of repetitive rods.. many watermelons.  I got 4 exact watermelons (same color and same shape).  2) I did not get the hello kitty (or the similar version of the hello kitty rod), no flag, no fish, and did not get most of the cute bows they have on the pictures.  Another thing I did notice was that the packaging was different than on the picture. Although, I did get repetitive rods, and missing the rods that I wanted, I am happy with the product.  They are very cute.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, awesome product.  While they were smaller than expected, the person that they were a gift for loves them! They look really cute on the nail.</li>
            <li> I thought the sticks were at least 6 inches . but when they came they were 1 and a half , some were damadged and some had designs i would NEVER use . i used the ones that a didn&#x27;t like to practice on . heads  up your going to need a razor to cut the sticks</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed in this product.  I purchased it because the raves were so great.  My daughter loved it when she saw all the colors and designs but she cannot seem to get it thin enough to stay on her nails.  No matter how thin she cuts it, it is too thick. If she figures out a better way to make them work, I will let you know, but as of now I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Wow...these are so cute they are the size of a cigarette slightly smaller in length, small enough to fit even small nails so if you have little girls dont worry they will fit on their nails they come uncut so you could slice them thick or thin,so easy to use just slice them with a razor I bought a cheap razor holder too makes it easier to hold makes a difference I have more control on the thickness. I try and slice them as thin as possible takes a little practice but not impossible and apply with clear top coat usually applying two coats to make sure they stick around my nail for a while. You could also use them to decorate your cell phone, school binders just get crafty. Reasonable in price so you don&#x27;t feel bad if you mess up while cutting them. Great variety you get butterflies, fruit, Hello Kitty, flowers, biscuit, bows and more can&#x27;t go wrong love love them and this seller ships fast came in a plastic sealed bag inside a box so it was well packaged would buy again.</li>
            <li> I thought they were stamps! Not cut off and glue on nail things.</li>
            <li> These were fun to use and added an unexpected pop to an otherwise plain manicure.&lt;br /&gt;These are best cut to size with a razor blade. Seche Vite does well when applying it to the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit dissapointed that I didn&#x27;t get more dessert/fruit shapes. I got mostly designs.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to getting this item and was very disappointed when I took it out of the package. They were much smaller than I anticipated, but the worst part was that the package had been opened and retaped on the end. I counted the items and did not receive the full count of 100. Not sure if this is their way of increasing their profits by shorting the order, or if it was accidental, but either way I ended up on the short end of the deal.</li>
            <li> All the sticks came in the same size. There are many designs and colors to choose from. Although some are repetitive they come in different colors. The most frequent design I got with my purchase was a butterfly. None the less I love each design. I used a x-acto knife to make sure to cut thin pieces.</li>
            <li> These fimo sticks are LESS THAN half the size of regular sticks.  This is a TERRIBLE price to pay for the size of them.  I have gotten WAY MORE for MUCH LESS on Ebay.</li>
            <li> smaller then I thought but it&#x27;s ok , fast shipping</li>
            <li> With these being a random assortment I didn&#x27;t have my heart set on getting exactly what&#x27;s in the picture.  I got a ton of canes though, which are well formed, none arrived broken, and they were shipped fast.  They&#x27;re good quality, too, and I only got a few that are markedly similar to others in the group.</li>
            <li> I really love them.  I&#x27;ve never bought anything like them before and they are so fun!  I love that they showed up so quickly too!</li>
            <li> I thought these would be the size of a pencil, but they areabout 2 inches long.  They are great and if you slice them thin you could get a lot of them.  I am enjying them, just thought they were bigger.  The assortmennt is great!!</li>
            <li> This was a wonderful purchase. I think these are the most adorable things you could put on your nails. I did have a few repeats and a few \\&quot;what is this?\\&quot; sticks, but I&#x27;d say 90 out of the 100 were perfect. These are also just the right size to be put on a little girl&#x27;s hand. I love these and will most likely be ordering more for some birthday gifts in the future!</li>
            <li> everything was in great condition. i recieved the package on the same day they said i would. usually that doesnt happen but everything was in great condition and on time. i was veryy happy</li>
            <li> I have to say that I absolutley LOVE these!!! I got about 4 doubles and I actually got 1 tripple! and one of them looked like it had been half way used before (but it was ok cause it was kinda ugly looking)and it delivered in 3 days!!! i dont think I&#x27;ll ever finish all of them but if I do I&#x27;ll be sure to order from MASH again :)</li>
            <li> The nailart sticks arrived quickly, nicely packaged, and my granddaughter was thrilled with the assortment of colorful designs. This set should last a good long time!</li>
            <li> There are too many childish designs.</li>
            <li> Each cane is approximately 1/8-1/4\\&quot; diameter, and 2\\&quot; long.  None of them were broken, none of mine were exact dupes--for instance, I have 3 dragonflies, but they&#x27;re all different colors.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the detail and variety of patterns.  There are some that I don&#x27;t recognize, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a use for them. I have fairly small hands--women&#x27;s size 4 ring--with a high curve to all my nails, so unless very thinly sliced I imagine it would be difficult to place them, but I&#x27;ve had a lot of experience with Fimo clay, so that wasn&#x27;t a problem for me.  I do suggest practicing on the ones you don&#x27;t like if you&#x27;ve never sliced before.</li>
            <li> These are so awesome! I just got mine and I think I might change my nails everyday with these. They work best with nail glue as opposed to top coat but the top coat works well too. They are really easy to cut as thin as you need them (just make sure you&#x27;re using a razor blade). LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE! I would buy a million of them.</li>
            <li> So I started doing my nails at home, and thought this would be great. However, clear nail polish does not hold the design on longer then two days. So i started using nail glue to hold them on, and the problem with that is when i want to change nail polish its hard to get them off. not sure if i&#x27;d by anymore</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.  I wish there were directions on how to use the designs sticks.  I am not familiar with these and ordered them to see how they work, but there are no directions.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as described.  I am so happy with it and am considering ordering a couple more!  The shipping was very fast - extremely satisfied!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Mash nail art design sticks and tweezer for my daughter&#x27;s 5th birthday party.  They were a big hit!  The girls loved picking their sticks for me to cut decals for them.  It did take a bit of a learning curve to cut the decals very thin without losing part of the picture.  But the girls had so much fun as did I!  These sticks will last us a lifetime with so many designs.  We did get a few sticks that were partially deformed in the middle, but most of them were perfect throughout the stick.  Even the slightly imperfect ones would yield hundreds of decals so I was not disappointed.  The tweezers were great too.  The tips are pointy and very precise for placing the decals on.</li>
            <li> these were super cute and easy to use. I ended up setting them in the acrylic and looked great. Would buy  again, great price for amount you get.</li>
            <li> you will need a blade, which can be found at hair stores like sally or weave places, but worth it. beautiful!!</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited when I read all the reviews and saw the pictures others posted about not having any duplicates with these. I have a ton of duplicates but they&#x27;re mostly the cuter designs so I don&#x27;t mind as much. Still trying to get the hang of cutting them without it looking like an axe murderer did it but for the most part they&#x27;re exactly as I thought they&#x27;d be. The canes are much smaller than I imagined they&#x27;d be but it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference. Ive been playing around with them since yesterday and even with the botch up job Ive done on them there&#x27;s still plenty of each one to go around!</li>
            <li> They are much much smaller than I imagined from the picture. Each stick is about 2 inches long. I thought they were more like those push up erasers. I got several duplicates, like 4 frogs, 4 of another weird spiral, some other but those were the highest numbers. I think next time I will just order the packages of the pre-cut, type specific..like the flower pages, or the butterflies, etc.</li>
            <li> At first I thought these were large plastic sticks, that you paint over with and stamp the design onto your finger. Once I figured out that they weren&#x27;t indented, I Googled my product and discovered that they were Fimo Canes. After figuring out there was a sharp edge covered by paper, and that the nail polish wasn&#x27;t smoothed out with that, I began cutting my fimo for my nails immediately. I&#x27;m currently wearing the cupcakes that came with it, and they are so cute! I love this product so much and will definitely buy again soon. My girls also think it&#x27;s a cute decoration for French tips and clear coated nails. Someone should definitely create a full alphabet and numbers set from A-Z a-z and 0-9.</li>
            <li> i got them all only one was defective but other than that they are beautiful designs and you have to cut them :)</li>
            <li> Received these nail art rods way before the estimated ship date.  They are super cute and fun.  My 11 yr old daughter loves them. We&#x27;ll be using them for a long time.</li>
            <li> In general i love fimo canes i have purchased them from amazon 3 x all from different sellers and i must say Mash has the highest quality fimo canes, the cheapest and fastest deliver with amazon prime.  The canes are high quality because the whole canes is even unlike other where the cane is a a different size on each end. Also there designs aren&#x27;t cheap looking like bundle monster. The bundle monster canes are tacky and some of the designs were messed up like if there were smudged during the hardening process . Also mash comes with almost no doubles. I love this canes especially for the price!  I was missing one cane out of 100 Haha but i don&#x27;t really care cuz i saved 2$ just from buying them from this seller.</li>
            <li> Great price&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use- slice thin with a sharp razor &amp; apply with clear coat.&lt;br /&gt;Lot of variety &amp; pretty things. I got alot of flowers, fruit, hello kitty &amp; her friends, random animals, &amp; butterflys.&lt;br /&gt;A few repeats but ill probably use them all someday for something. Most likely buying more soon.&lt;br /&gt;Came a week earlier then estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> Wow I really liked the product, good price and beautiful figures, I would buy I am very happy, I&#x27;m from Costa Rica and now I am recommending to my friends. Excellent.  My clients are happy now your nails look nicer with less effort</li>
            <li> Came in 3 days. have all the sticks, no doubles. There are a few of them that i would never ever use, but other than those, it&#x27;s a wonderful collection of fimo rods. It doesn&#x27;t come with the razor... so if you dont have one already, order one.</li>
            <li> I ordered these fimo sticks (I&#x27;m a nail technician) and have been very pleased with the product.  They slice very well and look amazing on nails!  There was a wide variety of designs and colors, my clients who enjoy bolder nail art love them!  Down side was the packaging.  The sticks themselves were in a plastic thing like what you would see on store shelves, and at some point during shipping this packaging broke down one side.  Meaning the sticks were everywhere.  This wouldn&#x27;t have been a huge issue if they had the package in a box that sealed entirely.  Instead, my items were shipping in what I would call a &#x27;book box&#x27;, which has holes/gaps on the sides.  Meaning I was picking up rods from my porch and yard.  I counted and was shorted more than 20 sticks.    I called Amazon and was refunded a portion of my cost to reflect the amount of product that had been lost.  So, I&#x27;m happy with the product, and disappointed with the packaging......and somewhat satisfied with Amazon&#x27;s customer service.  I could barely understand the gentleman I was speaking with, he was breathing hard like he had been running and had enough accent that between the two I struggled to follow what he was telling me.</li>
            <li> Amazing . A little smaller than I thought but I didn&#x27;t want it to be small so they are perfect I can&#x27;t wait to play with these</li>
            <li> Package arrived ahead of schedule.  Included 100 beautiful designs.  Very satisfied with this order &amp; will order more from this vendor in the future.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great for a eight year old girl! Great quality, bright colors, fun design. Adheres easily to nails. It lacks only a sharp tool to prepare.</li>
            <li> I am not much of a manicure person but when I saw these nail stickers featured in Amazon I thought that they might be a good gift for a teenager for Christmas.  But after receiving the design stick rods, my curiosity got the better of me and I ended up cutting them and fell in love with the cute little designs.  I now have some pink stars on my toes and lots of cute decorations for all my art and crafts.</li>
            <li> I really liked these! The only \\&quot;fault\\&quot; or issue I had was with my not so awesome cutting skills! They are pretty dense and hard to slice, so make sure you have a VERY VERY sharp tool! But after doing several slices I kinda got the hang of it. In the beginning mine were all lopsided and looked horrid! (I practiced on the ones I probably won&#x27;t ever use.) ;) BUT... it&#x27;s all about my not so awesome cutting skills, and has NOTHING to do with the quality of the product! The designs are really cool and some of them were so small, but still so detailed, that I was amazed! I initially really only got them for the HELLO KITTY ones, but once they arrived I found ALOT of others that I really liked too! Well worth the money! I would recommend these to everyone... they are really great for doing quick, easy and fun nail art!</li>
            <li> I had never even seen these before I looked for nail art on amazon. I bought them for my 6yr old daughter who loves doing her nails.  I&#x27;m sure it takes a bit of practice before you can slice them perfectly but they&#x27;ve been pretty easy to use. I was impressed with the variation of images. My daughter loves the amount of flowers, butterfly&#x27;s, hello kitty and &#x27;girly&#x27; ones.</li>
            <li> hard to cut evenly, kids use for beading</li>
            <li> For the price I am not going to complain, but the pictures aren&#x27;t all that good on  lot of these but still cute and my daughter likes them</li>
            <li> These are quality fimo sticks. None of the images in mine are all smudged or anything. Very clear. The sticks are only about 2 inches long. But I will get lots of slices from each stick. I recommend these sticks!</li>
            <li> Product arrive in great shape. Fast delivery. Offers many different choices in nail art. There is something for everyone from pre school to adult. Bought this as a gift and will be glad to give it.</li>
            <li> The LENGTH of the actual stick its self is the size of an average NEEDILE. I did receive more than a hundred ( 104 ) Very nice quality. Some were Repeat&#x27;s. I did send a message to the sender before placing my order requesting the Hello Kitty one &amp; got 2.  The ( 4 )  that were extra were hard to identify my assumption is that they are sushi rolls</li>
            <li> came promptly, many cute selections. this was a gift to a 10 yr old girl, who loved them--needed mom to cut the slices but that&#x27;s no problem</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my granddaughters.  They love doing their nails.  These nail art sticks are perfect for them.  I have to cut them for them but they love using them.  There are so many designs to choose from like butterflies, hearts, flags and much more. And they stay on really well when cut thin.</li>
            <li> I got 100  2 inch canes.  Didn&#x27;t get but maybe 4 repeats but they were in a different color so I didn&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> I am realizing now, you get ripped off. These sticks are supposed to be at least 2 inches long. All of mine were only about 1 inch.&lt;br /&gt;I am also kind of disappointed over a few of the designs, letters should not be in there unless you specifically ask for certain ones. And flags... I got about 4 or 5 flags, and only one would I use.&lt;br /&gt;Not too many repeats.&lt;br /&gt;I think for what I paid, I am not upset. I just wish I could have chosen some of them. I see others got cats and paw prints, Hell Kitty. All of these would have been perfect for me, and I did not get any.</li>
            <li> its cheap;) and nice. I have one stick broken</li>
            <li> the girls are having a hard time they dont know how to use them,no directions it would be nice if you had directions.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get 100. I got 91 - almost a full 10% less than what&#x27;s claimed. I also have a few that have breaks in the outside of the design, hopefully that won&#x27;t cause issues when I get that far down those sticks. Most of the designs are very pretty and detailed. I did receive one that is a bust of a woman and it&#x27;s a bit creepy, not sure when someone would want that on their nails. The only doubles I receive were of the orange, other than that each one is at least in a different color, if not unique to the pack.</li>
            <li> So i&#x27;m going to be as helpful as I can as I wish I would have read some of the reviews on the size of the canes and watched the youtube videos on how to cut these. I recommend you do that first, because you will invest some time on prepping before applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the size was a bit deceptive as I remember a pencil size cane on one of the pics and it seems like they removed this pic.  Each one is only a lil bit larger than one inch (1\\&quot;). This size makes about 50 small slices for each stick, if sliced appropriately -- which takes some practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, variety of these designs are truly remarkable. How they get these cool designs on these little canes is incredible. The canes are about 100 in total and one or two are distorted but still useful -- resulting in 30 slices instead of 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, my daughter was so excited to receive these that she divided them into categories (fruits, shapes, food, characters, flowers, etc.) with only a few duplicates. She asked me to slice a few from 3 sticks so she can get to work painting and applying right after dividing the categories. I sliced one full cane. It made about 40 full slices, but i messed up on 10 &#x3D; 50 total bc the messed up ones can be used on the corner of the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, you really need a thin razor to get the precision you need to slice as many as possible. *** So beware to kids because my daughter thought she could slice a few more when I stepped away and she ended up with a small slice on her finger instead.*** I would recommend an x-acto knife and tweezers if the kids want to help slice. There&#x27;s a youtube  video on a girl using these tools to cut with minimal difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I have to admit after we sliced and diced and my daughter got to work, I was truly amazed how much fun she had and how she applied her artistic skills. Her nails looked remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I recommend nail glue to keep this lil designs in place because my daughter said a topclear coat will not hold them in place more than a day for active kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To recap...&lt;br /&gt;  size &#x3D; 1 star&lt;br /&gt;  ease of use (cutting) &#x3D; 2 stars (adult supervision recommended)&lt;br /&gt;  ease of use (application) &#x3D; 3 stars&lt;br /&gt;  variety &#x3D; 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;  fun and artistic value &#x3D; 5 stars</li>
            <li> Was just what I wanted to help me do my own nails. They are easy to use and look great on my nails.</li>
            <li> This is not exactly what I was expecting..... they are very small and I have to say I&#x27;m not really sure how to use them.</li>
            <li> This Product is Amazing. I am New to doing Gel and Acrilic Nails, I recently purchased The IBD gel kit and Many other idems along with these. They Are very Very easy to cut, They are about 7 cm long.I used a Tomato knife to cut them and it was very clean and thin. Dont use a top coat to attach these use Nail glue. I also recomend using these with gel or acrilic. I would Recoment these to everyone in the nail buissiness.</li>
            <li> you all are so zoomed up on these that it makes it seem like you are really getting something. i get it and it is little bitty tiny little rods and a razor. no directions on how to use them or anything. i was not very happy with the % dollars i spent to get this as a Christmas present for a friend. you should really show a pic of what they look like when the package comes as well as the close ups to show the details. and directions would really be a nice touch!!!</li>
            <li> Only reason i gave 4 stars cause the picture made them look larger then what they are. The measurement are 3/8\\&quot;x2\\&quot;. The package could fit in my hand, about 4\\&quot;x5\\&quot; but after i was looking at them, i found out the are perfect for small nails like for children.&lt;br /&gt;My count was exactly 100 which follows as:&lt;br /&gt;33 flowers, no doubles or damaged&lt;br /&gt;5 leaf, no doubles or damaged&lt;br /&gt;6 Yin&amp;Yang, no doubles or damaged&lt;br /&gt;6 butterflies, no doubles or damged&lt;br /&gt;5 bows, 1 double( red) no damaged&lt;br /&gt;6 holidays, 1 double( snowmans, which i will use up) no damage&lt;br /&gt;6 animals and characters, no doubles but 1 damage( white face Minnie mouse, i think)&lt;br /&gt;19 fruits, 4 doubles, no damaged&lt;br /&gt;14 randoms, no doubles or damaged&lt;br /&gt;  Including&lt;br /&gt;  6 Channel logo&lt;br /&gt;  1 BMW logo&lt;br /&gt;  1 deck of Ace cards&lt;br /&gt;  1 cupcake&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do feel this will last a long time, tho i think i would buy another set of them but from another maker so i can get different designs. I am happy with them and cant wait to put them on my childrens nails and one daughter had made me a list of the ones she wants on her nails. I do wish i got a orange slice and a frog in my kit but happy for what i got tho i wouldnt pay for a $1 for each roll. $3.99 was a perfect price for 100 mix match rolls. Buy them cause they are wonderful way to add color to your nails.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No duplicates, 20 flowers, 20 fruits, 20 smiley faces and WTF are those, 20 butterflies, and 19 animals.&lt;br /&gt;Sticks are smaller but LONGER than others I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;None were deformed, chipped, cracked, and/or broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received 99 Sticks total.  Someone needs to go back to 4th grade again and learn to count.&lt;br /&gt;No bears like I&#x27;ve seen other people get.  (that&#x27;s a personal con though)&lt;br /&gt;Nowhere on my plastic storage bag was the MASH logo.  Just a plain old Ziplock.  (Screams knock-off)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although my CONS are listed I do not believe that warrants you to not purchase these.  You may get all 100.  And for less than 10$ it&#x27;s a really good deal.  Better than going to your local store and trying to get this many sticks for the same price.  The not getting teddy bears was a personal issue.  Would have been nice though since I&#x27;ve seen other people getting 3 or 4 of them.  And the clear baggie not saying MASH on it is the only reason I took off a star.  These don&#x27;t look like MASH products but are a very good imitation to say the least.  I hope you get the ones you&#x27;re looking for and I hope you get all 100!  I may try and order one more set in the hopes of getting some teddy bear ones! Wish me luck! :)</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed about the size of this product. It is nothing at all like the pictures. I measured it and each cane is 2cm. Really horrible and I ordered 2 sets which came in 1 package. The shipping came on time, but the canes are a disaster. Don&#x27;t buy this, it is smaller than your pinky finger and very skinny. Each slice is about the size of a tiny stud/ earring. I HATE IT- This is smaller than an eraser. It is similar, close to the size of a coin. This came in 2 ziploc bags, because I ordered 2 sets.&lt;br /&gt;Although the patterns are nice, you cannot begin to imagine how disgusting it is! Very small</li>
            <li> no directions this came in a week but does not work don&#x27;t waste your money they are cheap but not for something the girls wont use.</li>
            <li> I got them fast, great quality, love them!! im very happy and I will buy every time. I just think they should offer the blades to cut them</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this at all. If you don&#x27;t thinly slice them then they won&#x27;t stay on tour nail. I plan to purchase the one&#x27;s that are already pre sliced to see if that works better</li>
            <li> I really love thse but I have a hard time cutting them so that they are thin, so they are not to thick.</li>
            <li> very nice look, the nails come out looking really beautiful and it does not cost much, I will be getting more!</li>
            <li> Plan on coming back updating after I have had my first experience with them. I plan on it taking a while to get the learning curve also I just likely will start with my least favorite and practice, practice, practice.  How you guys have a better evening than I have.  Toodles</li>
            <li> Very cute graphics. Love them !!!!! Fast and speedy shipping. Professional service. Easy to use, fun and flirty.  Be the first to use this new nail art.</li>
            <li> They came quickly and appear to be of great value. All the designs were very clear and detailed. A razor is needed to cut or slice the sticks into the 3D images to glue onto the nail. Little girls will really love them!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve recently gotten into doing my own nails. my attempts at creating my own designs weren&#x27;t that great.&lt;br /&gt;searching for nail art i stumbled upon the MAsh  Sticks and immediately got some!&lt;br /&gt;Not a single one of the designs is repeated in the package..you get 100 different cute designs that go from flowers, bugs, hearts, food, kittys, all in the cutest colors.&lt;br /&gt;The sticks are easy to cut and you just use nail glue to stick it on your nail. the longest i&#x27;ve had mine on was 1 week :) this is perfect for keeping me entertained with my nails.</li>
            <li> I hope that this helps but if it doesn&#x27;t please disregard:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a stupendous product however the rods are a lot smaller the expected. They are around an inch long (makes around 25-50 slithers). The shipping took me 2 weeks(14 days) to arrive even though the expected shipping was 1 month and 1 week. This product workks great and even though the rods are small they make a lot if you cut them right. Also this comes with the cutting blade so don&#x27;t buy extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  -Vanessa! :)</li>
            <li> I agree that this is a great bargain but I did get 7 frog sticks, which I doubt I would even use one!  I did get some cool flags nada two colors of skulls and three that look like angry birds!  Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I got a few repeats like most have said but all in all these are cute and I got some really cute ones. A lot of butterflies which I dont particularly like but they are perfect for my nails and for projects.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hardly use them, ever but they are good quality. I gave them to my kids to play with.</li>
            <li> This selection was just okay for me ....wish I had read more comments before I ordered and picked the ones actually sold by MASH. I received quite a few fruits and lots of different flower designs, which was fine for me because I liked the ones I got and now I have plenty to last. However, when it came to the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; category, my selection was nothing like the picture. I know not to expect that I would but all I got were the &#x27;designer emblem&#x27; canes in several different colors....no animals, no flags ,nothing else.That was disappointing considering I&#x27;ll never use these at all. One cane was so light I couldn&#x27;t tell what it was suppose to be but I am pretty sure it was a designer emblem. All in all, I will only get real use out of the fruits and flowers and the few others(one or two leaves and butterflies)that I received.It was okay for the price but I wish the selection would have been more varied. You should probably keep looking for canes actually sold by MASH.</li>
            <li> I love this!!! It is fun to experiment with on your nails. Product is as described, arrived in a timely manner. Very happy with my purchase!!!</li>
            <li> I bought them only for the Puerto rican flag I seen in previous reviews...&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t get the ONLY one I wanted :(&lt;br /&gt;Even with that being . I ordered 100, and I&#x27;m not satisfied at all... there not the worst but definitely not what I was expecting...l won&#x27;t be using them....</li>
            <li> They are nice but some of them have same shapes&lt;br /&gt;I like them</li>
            <li> Only 3 stars because of getting too many of the same sticks. I know the selection is random, but 6 sticks of the frog face!?! It&#x27;s a good thing I love frogs.</li>
            <li> Since most of the reviewers mentioned 2 inch long canes, that is really what I was expecting.  These were all almost a full inch. No more than that. Since this is a grab bag of sorts, there were some I loved (florals) more than others (flags).  No Hello Kitty, but, being over 40, that is probably for the best.  There are a few character pieces an Angry Bird (black crow), Sponge Bob (yuck), a frog, a teddy bear, and a Santa-esque.  There are also a few interesting-looking butterflies and geometric shapes.  I was able to use an exacto-knife to get some thin slices to use for nails.  They went on OK with clear polish over gel manicure. Not sure about baking these in the LED with the regular gel...  I have ideas about what to do next, maybe nail glue... I actually bought these to add some 3D interest to craft projects, but not sure if that will actually work.  So, the products are OK, but I don&#x27;t know that I received the amount I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this purchase :). The packaging was good, I received all 100, and it seems to be a decent variety. I&#x27;m not a fan of butterflies, and this set includes a lot. Also, a couple of them had some damage where chunks were missing (at the ends). I received everything that&#x27;s in the pictures above. I also put an image above for your folks to see what you&#x27;re getting. For some reason, I thought they were going to be as long as pencils, but it&#x27;s more like half..I compared it to a pen for you guys. Depending on how thin you are able to cut them, and if its for your own personal use, these will probably last a lifetime, haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you get too excited and cut like crazy, I recommend taking out your least favorite and do a few test runs!</li>
            <li> These designs are really cute, but you have to be VERY skilled with a razor to get the slices so thin and even that they are pliable enough to curve to the shape of your nail and stick.  Much easier for people who have very flat nails, but even the least bit of curve to your nail and it&#x27;s almost impossible to slice them perfectly thin and even. We&#x27;ll be able to salvage the sticks and use them for arts and crafts projects, but as nail design we just couldn&#x27;t get it thin enough to work.</li>
            <li> Love these, they look great and are fun to use. The four rating is due to how difficult they are to slice. You have to get used to cutting them thinly. They have a bunch of cute designs in the pack. It&#x27;s a nice value and great purchase for those who want to try something new for their nail art. I&#x27;m completely happy with them and so is my daughter.</li>
            <li> I just love everything I got :)  The image plates work fantastic, they don&#x27;t need special nail polish.  The brushes are great. I&#x27;m stating to learn how to use them.  The fimo canes are really beautiful  I&#x27;m really happy!!!!!</li>
            <li> Good variety and comes with a little blade for cutting. Lots of cute patterns, bears, chococat, watermelons, strawberries, cherries, a few different styles of flowers. All in all worth the cheap price.</li>
            <li> They came in a small plastic bag, which I was satisfied with. I found out that the sticks are really small..only an inch in length! For the designs, I didn&#x27;t get all the ones in the picture. I think they just pick a handful of random ones before they ship it to you. Mostly, I got flowers and fruits, but most of the fruits were dragonfruit in different colors. I had really wanted the strawberry, hello kitty, frog, and a different variety of fruits, but I didn&#x27;t get them. Overall, the quality was okay, and I only had a couple repeats.</li>
            <li> better than buying them separate, just make sure you have a sharp blade or a knife to cut them yourself.</li>
            <li> how cute are these sticks?! I used a simple straight edge blade to shave thin pieces off and that was a little time consuming but I could deal with that. I have received several compliments when wearing them! Super cute on toes in the summer!</li>
            <li> I bought these and was expecting a great product. I went on you tube and saw a review for fimo canes from mash. They looked awesome and I decided to buy them. When I got them it was the opposite. I feel ripped off. First they didn&#x27;t come in a mash package. And second, the length of them are so tiny. I was expecting them to be like the size of a cigarette but mine are the size of a THIRD OF A CIGARETTE. And I got double of each so I believe that they just took 50 canes and cut them in half to be 100. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> They are very small, but they are cute. I will enjoy decorated my nails with these. I will need to practice cutting them on an ugly one</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this product! It  is just plain awful and does not work at all!! It&#x27;s a bunch of junk!! Do not buy unless you collect junk!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting these if you enjoy nail art. The fimo sticks that came from this seller were nice, pretty uniform in size throughout the rod, and most of them were very detailed. There were a few repeats, a few of them with blurry images, a few \\&quot;wtf are these??\\&quot; and some of the ones pictured do not come with the set I received. But I figured they package these at random, and at least the ones that were repeats are cute (blue bows, pink cupcakes, cherries) so I won&#x27;t mind having extras of those. All in all, these are worth the purchase. You will need to slice these thin, but you can apply them to anything!  Nails, cellphones, keychains, etc. They will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> I ordered two packages. When I received I thought it was so small (5 cm), but then I thought it was enough, because every one can get about fifty or eighty stickers ... Figures are so cute, I love it.</li>
            <li> Has Sought in Venezuela and can be sold at a good price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good quality product and good finishing recommend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other vendors and customers. excellent product</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking that it would be cool to have little designs on my nails, but no matter what type of blade I use to cut them, they are never thin enough.  the ones that are cut thin enough, don&#x27;t stay on your nails for very long, and when they fall off there&#x27;s a huge naked spot on your nail.</li>
            <li> I love these and appreciate the price I got these for. They are perfect for my crafting needs and will order more.</li>
            <li> There is not to many of these sticks I could imagine not using. I am new to these so the one that I was least impressed with I used for practice cutting. I quickly got a rythm and was using them the same day they arrived and got plenty of compliments.</li>
            <li> Cute little rods.  They were smaller than expected, but that&#x27;s ok.  I wouldn&#x27;t use some of the designs like the Mexican flag or the Chinese flag, but they were still pretty cute.  My daughter liked the Minions and the Panda best.  :)  Fun little item for the price.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that they gave me a nice variety (with a few repeats) and they also included the slicing tool. Moving on to what I don&#x27;t like and find inexcusable. These people say you get a 100 fimos but what they don&#x27;t tell you is that they cut the original cane in half. So they are basically giving you half a product but making you pay full price. I buy fimos from both amazon and eBay and know what the canes should look like so when these came in the mail I knew I wasn&#x27;t getting my money&#x27;s worth. Need proof? I&#x27;m uploading pictures of fimos I&#x27;ve bought from both amazon and ebay and showing you how they should look but don&#x27;t. To be honest I slice half of my canes to give to my friends, not the other way around. How would you feel if you payed for a full cup of coffee and only got half? This isn&#x27;t worth returning since they took around 3-4 weeks to get to me but I won&#x27;t be doing business with people who do this to their customers.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I got these from the seller \\&quot;Good&amp;Idea\\&quot; and they came in a zip lock bag without the \\&quot;Mash\\&quot; logo.</li>
            <li> Another Christmas gift that arrived in a timely manner and in perfect condition. I can&#x27;t believe how quick everything is getting here! (I almost jinxed myself.) MASH, thank you so very much for a wonderful and perfect gift. This will please a very picky person.</li>
            <li> Girls are loving these.  They are creating their own designs and people are asking for orders from them to make .</li>
            <li> I really liked these.  I received duplicates, but they were same design different color.  So that was ok with me.  It is not hard to cut, we  just used a razor (not included).  My suggestions is practice cutting on the ones you don&#x27;t think you will use, I received a couple where you look at it and are like &amp;#34;What is that?&amp;#34;.  Even if you mess up, try to cut it in a way so you don&#x27;t waste it.  Cut it in half or make a different design.  Also use nail glue.  Stays on longer.  I enjoyed these with my kids, super cute and fun.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I like it. It is great and have a lot of image on it. And it is very cheaper than i saw in a Mall.</li>
            <li> very bad product ,is not good at all.comes in a cheao and small sandwich bag with nothing ,no instruction no nothing very disapointed</li>
            <li> definitely not what i expected! they are so tiny like the length of 10 pennies put together. oddly cut and the picture advertised is not what i received. no hello kitty , Chanel, or any cute ones like that. i wont order these again!!!</li>
            <li> I got alot of weird , hard to tell what they are designs,&lt;br /&gt; Now I had realized before ordering ,it&#x27;s a luck of the draw, with what you get&lt;br /&gt; but mine are horrible designs, in you cant even tell what it is.&lt;br /&gt;The hello kitty one i got looked nothing like her. Same for the one  my melody.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed of the stick I got. 15% of them are repeat, that mean I have 15 of the same design twice..&lt;br /&gt;Over all I will say 50% cute, 30% ok and 20% you really have to say WTF I wish I can post picture review so you can see and judge it yourself..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if I buy again I am going to buy from another buyer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One good thing about this is they come wayyy faster then expect.. it took them a week but I expect a month.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because not only were they not the same  designs as the pic which I could understand but geez they could have at least been all diffrent, most of them were repeated and I did not get 100 pieces. Other than that the quality is good and they are really nice and easy to cut.</li>
            <li> I ordered other fimo canes before these ones &amp; they were just awful. I finally decided to take another chance &amp; see if these would be better; when I recieved them, the first thing I noticed is that they are beautifully vibrant in color. There are no repeats of the same design. Plus, they come neatly packaged.</li>
            <li> okay please be aware that these are miniature fimo sticks.  I really don&#x27;t know what I expected but I think they are about 2-3 inches long each and they provide you with a razor to cut the sticks into thin strips.  I guess if you cut them properly you can actually get a ton of them from one stick.  I received 100 pcs and they are really cute.  you can look on youtube or pinterest for fimo stick tutorials.  I can&#x27;t wait to use mine.  its a huge variety of sticks so ive separated them by category of fruit, plant, flower, animals ets.  anyway they are gorgeous and if I ever run out I will definitely order again.  I promise you it would probably take me over a year to use all these.  they are great</li>
            <li> The best. Would recommend</li>
            <li> TOO MANY OF THE SAME THING BUT DO LIKE WHAT I RECEIVED AND HAVE GOTTEN CREATIVE WITH IT ONCE I FIGURED OUT HOW TO PROPERLY SLICE THEM. I USED A RAZOR BLADE BUT IT STILL TAKES PRACTICE SO I USED ONE OF THE STICKS I LIKED THE VERY LEAST AND SLICED UNTIL I GOT IT RIGHT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m upset, everyone posted they got, the normal full size canes mine are tiny less then an inch long and it over two months before I got them.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love these, theyre perfect, even for her little nails. There is such a huge combination of different fimos in this package. This was my first time seeing or using fimo fruits and I almost never got them because I dont like big bulky things on my nails but Im glad I purchased them because theyre not as big as I thought or as the picture shows. will buy from this company again! (MASH that is)</li>
            <li> Make sure you click to choose who you order from, and order from MASH.  Got here in two days, all 100 sticks, no duplicates.  Wrapped in stacks of 50, in a MASH bag, all inside another ziploc bag.  So excited to get started.</li>
            <li> New beginning at a little trouble receiving my order it never came the day I reported it and ask for assistance something else was mailed in the mail straight to me. No questions asked just apology straight across the table give them some more time and I&#x27;ll take care of the issue. Received it in the mail quick. And could not be more satisfied. Great product great price. Bigger than most of the other, sticks that are out there also so that&#x27;s even better.</li>
            <li> Careful dont cut yourself</li>
            <li> They are hard to cut.  If you don&#x27;t want to cut these yourself I would recommend buying the ones that are already cut.</li>
            <li> I got these to use with my 11 year old little sister from Big Brothers Big Sisters and was very excited after reading some of the reviews on this page, however, after a long wait for them to arrive, many of the sticks were damaged and almost to completely unusable. These included sticks with large holes in them, twists and warping throughout the product, and some that were stuck together (such as two dragonflies that were connected because they weren&#x27;t cut or something, and when I went to pull them apart (gently) both sticks became ruined), out of the 100 received I probably ended up with 60 or 70 usable products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea behind them was very cool, and my little sister loves the ones she can use, however, I&#x27;m over-all disappointed with the quality of the product and am unsure if I will order them again from this company. If you&#x27;re okay with only getting a little over half of them in usable condition, then definitely go for it, they cut easy, stay on great, and look super cute.</li>
            <li> They look really cute on my nails. I use a razor blade to slice pieces of the end and then glue them on with nail glue.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how to use these.  I have searched many tutorials on Nail Art and there is nothing on what to do with these and they came with no instructions.  Very disappointed they took forever to get here, again no way of knowing when products are shipping from overseas.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1ZKAN6JS6XNIZ]]I use this canes for making craft . I am working with polymer clay about 10 years . I know how to make canes , its take time . I found that working with premade canes save a lot time and fun to do for kids and adults . I ordered this canes more</li>
            <li> This set has a great assortment of items, I had no repeats! They are more intricate than they appear in the pictures. I received mostly fruits, hearts, and butterflies. If you&#x27;re looking for cutesy Hello Kitty rods, these are not the ones you want. I wasn&#x27;t looking for that, so it turned out great for me! The designs I received are different and (I think) a lot cooler than those pictured.</li>
            <li> I had seen a video online that was doing a nail tutorial on the nail art decor sticks. I really thought they were cute and so I ordered these for so cheap but it takes a little practice to do them very properly and to the point they look decent, well at least for me. They only problem that I had with this was that the blade they supply with it, thank you, was a little small and after spending time working and cutting these it started to hurt my hand...</li>
            <li> Great product! Arrived right on time. Great quality works awesome. The blade is included even though it doesnt say in the description.</li>
            <li> Hi my name is Barbara I ordered Premium mash 100 pc nail art nail 3d manicure  design sticks rods and all are there but One received my product today 6-18-2014 thank you</li>
            <li> Wow I&#x27;m so surprised I got this item today wasn&#x27;t exspecting it till New Year&#x27;s Eve I didn&#x27;t think they were so small but it&#x27;s obviously the right size to fit your nail haven&#x27;t used it yet but I&#x27;ll let u know gave u 5 stars for speedy delivery but I hope it&#x27;s as nice as it looks let u know soon</li>
            <li> These were very very fun to do for my friends daughters birthday, but they were just soo difficult to cut them into small enough pieces to ensure they stayed on the nails.  They all loved them, don&#x27;t get me wrong.. Just wish they were easier to cut.</li>
            <li> I wish the Hello Kitty was actually in the collection I received , But I will order more! This was adorable and I had sooo much fun trimming and getting them all ready to put on my nails! Thank you!</li>
            <li> These were to be a gift, and when they arrived what I received was 10 like packages of Halloween designs.  Sent them back, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> this is the ultra mix of designs! you get a huge variety of different shapes and designs including: animals -pigs, chickens, cats, butterflies, dragon flies, hello kitty, rabbits ducks...also some holiday ones.  Varies flowers....flags.....many different fruits...a bunch of different food items like pizza and cupcakes....just a really great variety. there isn&#x27;t alot more you could need!  The only issue i had was the razor blade that came in the box was haphazardly stuffed in the box and it did not have a sleeve or guard on it...so if i wasn&#x27;t paying close attention i definitely would have got cut.....other than that great value. just be careful of the razor blade stuffed in there.</li>
            <li> The idea is great but to cut these sticks into small even pieces need some skills &amp; time. Maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so cheap for how many sticks you get.</li>
            <li> OK the designs are nice but difficult to use.  Would not recommend this product that did not come with instructions</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 14 year old who loves to do her nails. I thought they would be a fun addition to just painting her nails. She LOVES them! The sticks are so easy to cut and use. My 14 year has used these every day since she got them! She looked like she was having so much fun that my 12 year old and I also decided to do our nails with them. I thought it was pretty easy to apply the designs to my nails, the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that while I was doing laundry the designs would get stuck when I would try to turn socks inside right and pull at my nails. Overall I would say the designs are super cute, fun and an awesome price!</li>
            <li> so many to go through... I am sure i will get great use out of these Design Stick Rods. If any one was to purchase this you would enjoy all the choices you have to choose from.</li>
            <li> no instrutions,so no idea how to use and Im sure we needed some other part to use this product.not enough research about the  produce totally my fault.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved these nail art pieces. It is just as pictured and as described. Perfect for all ages even teens.</li>
            <li> There are so many of these. I am going to share with my younger cousins who love to do their nails, too. My favorites are the bow and the flowers.</li>
            <li> There is a really good variety of these.  I thought they were a little bigger when I bought them, but now after using them, I am happy they are smaller, they fit on the nail much better.  A lot of fun.  I use them for nails, but I can see how my daughter will probably use them for other craft things as well.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she likes it, its a little hard to cut the pieces thin enough to put on your nails though.</li>
            <li> These are soooooo cute! I will order more, I got alot of flowers and fruit. One smiley face, three bows, four Christmas decorations,  one dragonfly, three teddy bears, alot of butterflies, one flag (unknown origin), one ice cream cone, two desserts,  one pizza and some unknown designs. I love them all, my only complaint is that the shipment came later then expected but im glad it came.&lt;br /&gt;Warning: two came distorted, one some what broken but the rest were in great shape. Im not saying that you shouldn&#x27;t buy these products, cause they really are cute. Nor am I saying you&#x27;ll receive distorted images, I just ppl to be aware by giving my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a really fun way to do nails! I recommend it if you like doing nails. I wish I could add a pic of my nails because I really like it.</li>
            <li> these came in a little baggie and i know i will be using them allot.. deffinetlya great buy because they have these for $1 each stick at the 99 cents store (:</li>
            <li> I was expecting them to be bigger, but other than that it was great. I got 100 like advertised and only had 2 canes that were exact duplicates. I cut them with an exacto knive some thin and some thick can&#x27;t wait to use. I&#x27;m glad I did&#x27;nt take negative reviews to heart.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have found them I love them... them r awesome.. with good nail glue... they stay put.. love them thank you I have been telling everyone I know about your product..</li>
            <li> These are so much fun!! I actually got the Hello Kitty one. I know they are totally random but you will definitely fall in love with many of them.</li>
            <li> It was very helpful it gives it a pop design many different types of rods also many colors fruit and animal&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Just received these in the mail, their is no hello kitty in the bunch and a lot are not as shown but they are cute can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
            <li> These were a gift for a great niece for Christmas of 2012. If I were a teenager, I would love to play with things like this.&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m sure that she did.</li>
            <li> I did not notice (until after I put my order in) that these are being shipped from China so when I saw the delivery date, I was astonished.  I had wanted these to add to a Christmas gift but of course, I didn&#x27;t get it in time.  It is true that these are smaller than 2&amp;#34; each and the diameter is barely 1/4&amp;#34; so beware of that.  Some of them are very strange i.e. you can not really tell what design they are supposed to be, and some of them are quite distorted so are not something you&#x27;d really want to use.  The fruit slices and smiley faces are nicely done and are cute but then you also get things like stripes and letters that are useless unless you&#x27;re lucky enough to get one that relates to your monogram or whatever.  You do get a blade so that&#x27;s good and I got 101 in my pkg. but quite a few duplicates.  All and all, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay very much for them and had I actually seen the product at the store, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it at this price.  I think we will have some fun with them maybe incorporating them into various craft projects and will try them out on a toenail or two.</li>
            <li> Not very long, but long enough that a lot will come out of one stick. I only received one damaged stick, and it was only damaged in a small spot, so I&#x27;m not terribly worried about it. Good buy.</li>
            <li> thats good because my wife use it she say everything straight she really love it  for her jobs thank you</li>
            <li> their good for nails tip @ everyday uses.great for kids.if my children where here i would love to do their nails!</li>
            <li> On the site this product was big when I saw it ,when I got it 10 times smaller not what I thought it was</li>
            <li> Price is great. However I was DISappointed upon receiving it because I assumed they were longer. I would though recommend them</li>
            <li> They are really small they said they would be the size of A ciggerete but they r not! Look at your pinki it is half of that! I sitted and counted every one and there was 100 cute designs but way to much flowers and fruits so if u want a selection of different ones I don&#x27;t recommend these</li>
            <li> These are so much fun, a good variety of images.  They even include a little razor blade cutter which is nice.  I need to practice my cutting techniques.  If anyone has ideas as to how to cut the images more efficiently, please let me know.  Good product, and as advertised.</li>
            <li> They show the long  sticks I am used to receiving. Then they send you junk thats one inch long so you pay double for half of what you expect to get. A real rip off. I&#x27;ve ordered these before and they are usually about 3 inches long..so basically I got 1/3 for twice the price.</li>
            <li> I did not get a lot of use out of this product. Definitely need to watch some YT vids to apply like a pro.</li>
            <li> These are really really cute.  whoever made them is very talented.  So many different designs and you can use things for so many things.  I will def buy these from this seller again.. highly recommended!  Pretty fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> I love these little things! I was expecting them to be a bit bigger (they are really tiny), but they are going to last me forever! The seller supplied me with a razor, which I thought was very considerate, and they arrived about a week early! Some of the designs took me a while to figure out, and there were 4 or 5 that I&#x27;ll never use. Also, some were harder to cut then others, but boy were they adorable! I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t get a hello kitty, because I really wanted one, but I did! I also got 2 different bows! My favorites were her, a little pig, a panda bear, and a really pretty flower. I got a lot of hearts, flowers, oranges, and apples. When I brought them to school, everyone was thrilled, and there were so many! This was totally worth the price, coming from a 14 year old.</li>
            <li> I received all 100 pieces, and I had maybe one or two duplicates (I am not counting the same one with recolors). Sticks measure roughly 2 inches and are not bent or broken.</li>
            <li> this are very awesome collection for my daughter art design, very curious to work with, variety of colors, good material, and never seen before, thanks love it!</li>
            <li> These are a lot of fun for my kids. They love picking out what pictures to put on their nails</li>
            <li> I liked a lot because they had flowers, butterflies and fruits that were perfect for summer and spring season, my daughter is doing beautiful decorations to all her friends at high school too!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but for some reason I was expecting the rods to be about as long as regular pencils.  They are the size of the pencils you use while golfing.  I got a bunch of different designs [not the same as pictured, but still really cool] and my little cousins loves when I do her nails with cupcakes or snowmen! They even come with a small razor to shave the rod</li>
            <li> I did not get the designs in the picture maybe like a couple. However, I did get mostly flowers which is cute enough for me! 2 bows pink and red perfect for hello kitty designs for young girls. My fruits were a bit deformed and did not look as cute which is what I was looking forward to besides the flowers and you get many other random designs. I do however believe that fimo art is great and this are nice stick rods but next time I would order from another seller just to see how designs differ since I will only be using about half of these rods.</li>
            <li> when I rec, I am surprise to see the size is too small, according to pic its seems to big. but its ok</li>
            <li> Would have been 4-5 stars but these are tiny canes. Lots of different ones in the pack but just so short. I will not be recording. It really looks like they just cut a full size cane in three.</li>
            <li> never figured out how to get them to work...............don&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li> gift for young cousin - hope she loves them!</li>
            <li> This are great takes some time to get the size you want som practice with the ones you don&#x27;t really like!!  The price is also great ..</li>
            <li> There were no exact duplicates but I did receive a few near duplicates of fruits (like cherries and starberries). And some of the canes were shorter than 2 inches. Otherwise, great product!</li>
            <li> These little canes are great and I&#x27;ve bought lots of them! They cut nicely and look amazing on acrylic nails! They are a must have if you like having funky nails!</li>
            <li> I love fimo, I use it in acrylics and I like the fact that I get to cut it, I don&#x27;t know, gives it my own dimension based on how I cut it.</li>
            <li> Those sticks are very tiny. Slow shipping.</li>
            <li> These are amazing! I loved all of my designs. ( except for a few i have no idea what they are) There easy to use as long as u have a cutting board and some kind of razor. I feel what worked best for me is to use nail glue when applying, they really dont fall off when using the nail glue. :) i had one fall of yesterday, and all i have to do is cut a new piece and tada! :) Also i would use top coat every couple of days to keep them on too. So worth the price. They got here within 4 days!</li>
            <li> I dont know about them because i bought it for another person live in another country and i didnt send them yet</li>
            <li> I like it makes my nails look nice but you you have to slice them really thin if you don&#x27;t they will stick out of of your nail and and fall off.  They are very cute</li>
            <li> OMGGG how great are these fimo sticks...... They are wonderful colorful and just in Time . Fast shipping ......omgggg I can&#x27;t say enough how great these are...... They even sent me and Easter egg stick yaaayyyyyyyyyyyy</li>
            <li> It has been two months. still don&#x27;t have them.</li>
            <li> I ordered these not expecting much from it. There were a lot of duplicates and the rolls were pretty small. But I did get ones that I liked and the razor that comes with it is very handy for cutting them. I like being able to make them as thick or thin that I want.</li>
            <li> perfect loved it! worth every penny</li>
            <li> Ok now this 3D nail art is annoying to Dads but for Moms and  Daughters they are LOVING the 3D art. Females of all ages love this kit once again my home has turned into a nail polar.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed because it&#x27;s been 3 months and I guess I should stop looking in my mailbox for them. All my other orders came and I was happy with what I did recieve.</li>
            <li> Totally amazed how fast the shipping was from Hong Kong! I order a lot from London and Hong Kong and recently it just seems as though the speed has tripled! I love it. I like the Nail Art set and thanks for the razor blade. I wasn&#x27;t expecting that. Great job, nice variety of designs and colors. Time to be creative!</li>
            <li> THESE THINGS ARE SO SMALL YOU CAN BARLY HOLD THEM IN YOUR HANDS</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if they&#x27;re good or bad because I don&#x27;t know how to use them! Please advise! I need help!</li>
            <li> Very nice item and easy to use. They supply a razor blade and the sticks are very easy to shave off thin slices. You get a variety of designs. Flowers, butterflies, flags, etc. Took a while to arrive which I expected so no problems. Very well priced.</li>
            <li> Just used a bunch on a party of 9 year olds... and myself ( :&lt;br /&gt;They cut easily with an exacto knife. I&#x27;m using super glue to keep them on longer. Then a top coat. It was a huge hit. It was inexpensive and I was able to do up each of them within 30 minutes which was awsome since it used to take me 2 hours or more to do fancy nails on 7 girls. I&#x27;m enjoying a nature theme on my left hand and summer fruit on my right. 3 of the girls went home telling their mother they wanted to order some and would use their own money since didn&#x27;t cost much. I did a LOT of nails and used a LOT of decals this weekend and you could hardly tell i used any. There is so much. Didn&#x27;t get any duplicates. Word of advice; cut them as thin as possible. Doing so will make them form ealier to your curved nail, it will last longer because it doesn&#x27;t catch on stuff AND it uses less clay which means more fun. Enjoy. I&#x27;m going to use them for decorating plastic headbands, baretts and bangles with my daughters later. So much fun. super easy. no brainer. buy it.</li>
            <li> These are horrible. Not even sure how to use them and there were no instructions. Complete waste off mone.  I do not recommend</li>
            <li> Love these new little decorations I just found out about! They are so cute and pretty simple once you get the hang of them. I did recieved a few repeats and was really hoping for the chanel design but I know they&#x27;re random so not complaining j/s ;) I am very happy with the product! They also arrived pretty fast! Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> Have to cut really thin and straight or else it doesn&#x27;t stay on nail. Love the different designs ! .</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t look like pencil stencils and most of all they also came with any DIRECTIONS so I will probably wont buy from you no more</li>
            <li> FBA. Lots of flower designs in mine but not one duplicate at all! i was very impressed.I only got 98/100 canes though.. yes i counted more than once to make sure! (im obsest like that) I will upload a picture of all the fimo canes i got, they&#x27;re so adorable! some canes are a &#x27;&#x27;wth is that?&#x27;&#x27; lol I recommend these fimo canes to anyone who wants to try slicing fimo themselves instead of buying those expensives pre cut ones! its very fun and very cute.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s EXTREMELY hard to slice the whole icon and get it thin enough to mold to your finger shape. There are too many repetitive designs as well.</li>
            <li> I loved the variety of the designs. I want more. Lol. The fruit ones look like real fruit. I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase. :)</li>
            <li> liked then very much could use some different designs, maybe 5/100 were the same designs. Maybe designs that are not so kiddish.&lt;br /&gt;But exactly what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The size are perfect. It not too big for my nails and i can cut it thin as i wanted</li>
            <li> Positive transaction.  Purchased for my 11 year old granddaughter for Christmas along with other Mash products.  I am sure she will love this!</li>
            <li> Ordered two sets of these sticks for Christmas gifts.  I am delighted with the quality and design selection -- no duplicates -- very cute designs.  I&#x27;m sure both recipients will enjoy them.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, and my little sister and my cousins had me put these all over there nails. At first i wasnt sure if i would use most of these fimo canes but i have ended up using most of them. Plus its nice to have such a assortment of colors and designs and even holidays all in one package. I would definitley invest in these if you want to have fun with new nail designs, there incredibly easy to use. I use a exacto knife and nail glue and im all set. Plus its a awesome price.</li>
            <li> You will need clear nail polish and razor blade. You can make hundreds of cutest designs with these 100 rods of very detailed nail art. . My five year old daughter was so happy when she found out what are they for when she got them on Santa&#x27;s stocking. I showed her the online videos and the images.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adult supervision is needed to do the slicing as it involves the use of sharp knifes and blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- not very easy to apply. If you slice them too thick, it cannot bend to follow the curves of your nails&amp;#60; If cut too thin, they curl up and you have to press them until the polish is dry and sticky enough for them to stay in place.</li>
            <li> the description was limited.  It actually looks like long erasers but you have to slice the end off to apply.  I bought them for my 8 year old daughter but I have to find our exacto knife to get the slice thin enough to keep the picture of the thing but also to stay on the finger nail with clear polish.... A little too hard for a young one like her.</li>
            <li> they were really cute and had a vivid color, unfortunatly my pack didnt come with any hello kitty :( so i guess its all in chances. it also came with too many flowers and butterflies, about 20 flowers and 15 butterflies but i guess thats a plus if those are the desingns you want, i wanted the fruits and the hello kitty ( i didnt get :( ) but its a great product, very cute and colorful and not even one single repeat :D  they will also last a long time, i was able to slice one stick into 34 thick pieces and another one into like 74 thin slices!  this is a list of what i got  -20 flowers  -15 butterflies  -17 fruits :)  -6 leaves  -2 of hello kitty&#x27;s friend melody  -3 stars  -7 hearts  -9 desserts  and a ton of charming random ones :)</li>
            <li> Ordered this product for christmas and have enjoyed it every time we use it.  Takes awhile getting used to the texture on the nail but looks very cute!</li>
            <li> They are smaller than half your pinky hahah. Good for the price though, awesome designs</li>
            <li> I got these before I expected them to arrive..they are a lot shorter than they looked in the picture but then again they always tell you to expect that...I haven&#x27;t had time to try them yet do to my foot surgery but plan on setting up an cut a few..I really don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have a hard time because I plan on getting a cigar cutter to see if that will work better than the single sided blade..they are all different images an real cute..I&#x27;m happy with my order...I recommend trying these for other art projects and not just your nails....</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. I got my order before the estimated time for delivery.  I got 33 duplicates. Good variety. Didn&#x27;t get the one I wanted but not a big deal. If you slice them thin with a buck knife and glue them on they will last 3-5 days. Well at least mine did.</li>
            <li> A couple were strangely hard, and would not slice properly but it was maybe 4 out of 100 so still very good quality!</li>
            <li> Cute but wish they came pre cut. Hard to cut thin. Takes a lot of practice!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my granddaughter  - Christmas - so she doesn&#x27;t have it yet and I can&#x27;t address whether she will like it or not, but they look pretty cute to me and there are tonz of them.</li>
            <li> Need to be sure and cut the decals thin so they will be smooth and look good.  There was a good variety of designs.  Advertised exactly as you would get them.  I am satisfied with the purchase for the value.</li>
            <li> Cool assortment, no repeats, but they are very very short, maybe an inch to an inch and a half long.</li>
            <li> These are very well made and what an assortment!  However, be aware, they do not come with the razor and they are very tough to cut.</li>
            <li> Not good for nails...they are too hard to cut thin enough. Wish I had not bought them</li>
            <li> These fimo canes are really amazing, they maybe tiny, but they really do the trick when you want to give your nails a little pop. They are very easy to cut, if you have the right razer, xato knife or box cutter. I recomand to use the very tip when cutting, it makes it a whole lot easier. I will be ordering this item again in the near furture, since my daughter and I change our nails once a week.</li>
            <li> I just love it, it looks so cute and i got almost every shape and of course i got 100 pc &amp;#60;3 Love it</li>
            <li> Only 3 duplicates. Fun to use but get an exactlo knife to cut them thinly.</li>
            <li> took a really long time to receive. the product was alright.</li>
            <li> Love using these for my nail art. I love the arrangements I got! Takes a while to get here though. Worth the wait in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought these because I wasn&#x27;t sure which sticks I would receive and I wasn&#x27;t sure of the quality after reading some of the reviews here. But they arrived this morning and are AMAZING! It took me a few tries to get the hang of slicing them but I did catch on quickly. The variety is amazing! I have some for each holiday now with the exception of Christmas. I&#x27;m considering ordering more but what this set will probably last me at least 5 years!</li>
            <li> These canes are bright colored and of good quality. I tried to pick one that I didn&#x27;t like so I can practice cutting it but it was so hard since they are all so cute. Love the product. I especially like the flower canes, very pretty and go with many nail polish colors. The product arrived fast. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> this is a very good purchase for a very good price, however the reason i have to give this 4 stars instead of 5, is because my order only came with 97 sticks not 100, and one of those stick was chipped. But other than that it is a good purchase for an affordable price. over all im content with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great Product, variety and cute designs. I received them 50 a package, both packaged inside of another package. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> You get a lot, but they are a pain in the ass to deal with.  Get something better if you can.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the sticks when they arrived in the mail. There was a nice amount of variety and the quality of the sticks is really great for the most part. There were a couple that I thought were a bit ugly, and one or two of the sticks were slightly bent out of shape (still completely usable though), but overall, I&#x27;m really happy with the assortment I got. I don&#x27;t mind that there are a few sticks I don&#x27;t like, because there are far more that I do like a lot. I was also expecting these to be more difficult to slice than they actually were (never used fimo sticks before this purchase). However, it wasn&#x27;t nearly as hard to get really thin slices (I don&#x27;t like it when they stick really far off the nail) as I imagined it would be. I can also see these lasting a VERY long time. It&#x27;s also interesting to note that, if sliced right, these seem to be reusable - which is completely awesome, in my opinion. I would definitely recommend these for anyone interested in nail art.</li>
            <li> I received this set and was excited it came early, but shortly after opening it I was disappointed to find the Hello Kiity stick was not in the mix of the 97 not 100pcs I did received. However, the quality of the pieces I did receive are nice as well as easy to cut. I mostly received flowers, butterflies, and fruits. Overall, I would recommend this item and just hope they get 100pcs and the Hello Kitty stick :-)</li>
            <li> I love it it is a bit hard to cut but this is my first time purchasing this so i belie it is supposed to be that way so over all theres so much i love it all go get it!</li>
            <li> Toooooo cute.. Must have item</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of purchasing this nail art set to give as a Christmas gift, and I wish I hadn&#x27;t. The order is split into ten smaller bags, all of completely the same design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse, they are ALL Halloween designs, which isn&#x27;t in season at all right now. This is NOT what the seller is representing or what is shown in the photos. Buyer beware :(</li>
            <li> [...]    Mine came a few days ago and I just tried using them. I used a razor blade to cut them and practiced on a few of the uglier sticks. I used the Hello Kitty stick and the blue bow stick in the picture above. I also used nail glue just because my first attempt with OPI top coat ended up smearing the purple nail polish.       [...]    These are the 100 sticks I received although they were in a plastic container originally. I had 1 deformed stick and about 10 sticks I will probably never use but the rest are great and very detailed. As you can tell by the picture, I had ZERO repeats! Considering how thinly you can slice these sticks, they&#x27;ll probably last me a life time. It&#x27;s definitely worth the buy and the designs are really cute!</li>
            <li> Okay so I love Fimo Canes, YYYAAYYYY!!!!! Okay let.me calm down,lol. Delivery was great not long at all, They are a GREAT BUY. I only wish they could of separated them by category such as smiley faces,fruits,flowers etc in there own separate bags.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. They are very small, but I guess they need to be small to fit on your nails. Be prepared to get a razor blade out to cut them and have a place to sort and store them. But there is a great assortment so I can&#x27;t wait to try them out.</li>
            <li> These arrived early and nicely packaged. We had one repeat but it was a cute repeat so it didn&#x27;t matter. I ordered razor blades at the same time as recommended. I had them cut and on my daughter&#x27;s nails within an hour. She loves all the designs. They will last quite a while, but when she runs out, we will order this brand again.</li>
            <li> It is what I ordered. There were a lot of duplicates. Mine came with a huge razor to help me cut these. They were a little smaller than I had imagined.</li>
            <li> These rods will last you a very long time! I use a box cutter or a razor blade to cut the rods into my own desired thickness. Since i use these on my natural nails, i found it best to cut them as thin as possible. The pack comes with many great designs and practical for any occasion.</li>
            <li> Late delivery, repetitive designs, didn&#x27;t find some of the designs that I expected. Some of them you can&#x27;t tell what is it for :/, but I&#x27;m happy with some of the shapes..</li>
            <li> They were really cute and came way earlier than expected! Love them all! They have the cutest ones too! Can&#x27;t wait to use them</li>
            <li> Theses are not as good as I had hoped. The set has several (at least 15) sets of duplicates. And overal the colors of many of the sticks were washed out and dull.</li>
            <li> I love them, shipping was fast way better than the others over 30 days for the other ones. no duplicates and a few that are WTF is that lol... cant wait to use them !</li>
            <li> Got here fast, the are the small ones and I thought they were the long big ones, but they are still the perfect size for what I&#x27;m gonna use them for(:</li>
            <li> I really like this product. The trick to using them is to slice them very, very thin, and then apply a top coat over them. I simply slice a thin slice, paint my nail, then put the slice in place while the polish is wet. I hold it in place until the polish is dry (only takes a few seconds), then I paint over  it well with clear top coat. If you slice them thinly, they will last for a few days, but if you slice them thick, they will chip off in only one or two days. Here is an exact list of which sticks I got in my package:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;34 flowers, (3 designs repeated once, and 1 repeated twice)&lt;br /&gt;15 butterflies (2 repeated once, 1 repeated twice)&lt;br /&gt;8 fruits (5 lemons!! 1 apple, 1 kiwi, 1 strawberry)&lt;br /&gt;5 little bows&lt;br /&gt;4 hearts (1 repeat)&lt;br /&gt;4 leaves (1 repeat)&lt;br /&gt;3 dragonflies (1 repeated once but in a bigger size)&lt;br /&gt;3 American flags (1 repeat)&lt;br /&gt;3 birthday presents (all a repeat)&lt;br /&gt;2 jack-o-lanterns (a repeat)&lt;br /&gt;2 cartoon cows (a repeat, but one is bigger)&lt;br /&gt;2 stars&lt;br /&gt;2 ladybugs (a reapeat)&lt;br /&gt;2 yin-yang symbols&lt;br /&gt;2 cute geometric/sushi-looking things?&lt;br /&gt;1 feather&lt;br /&gt;1 rectangular giraffe pattern&lt;br /&gt;1 unidentifiable thing that likes a tiny bit like an orange slice?&lt;br /&gt;1 odd heart with wings?&lt;br /&gt;1 santa&lt;br /&gt;1 snowman&lt;br /&gt;1 cute pig&lt;br /&gt;1 cute kitty cat&lt;br /&gt;1 cute/wierd pink monkey&lt;br /&gt;1 cartoon frog&lt;br /&gt;1 odd/ugly Betty Boop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That equals 102 !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 are damaged, but still partly usable. 6 or 7 I will never use. And there was no Hello Kitty, but I don&#x27;t care because, with all due respect, I am not one of her fans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... If you buy these, don&#x27;t expect them to be all different or all perfect. For the most part, they were different and good quality. I am pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I like: Super cute designs, a whole bunch of differnent designs (almost 100), seasonal/festive designs, CHEAP!, and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I don&#x27;t like: loooong shipping time, odd chemical smell of the sticks, a few repeats and a few damaged sticks, and not the best packaging.</li>
            <li> There were only a couple duplicates in the package along with a couple weird ones. The was one that looked like an egg yoke and a couple I am not sure what they are. I was able to get mine to stick on my nails over a coat of wet polish followed by top coat. 90% of them stayed on. The key is to cut them as thin as possible which will take a little practice. Over all I am very happy and I hope my son&#x27;s girlfriend will be too when she receives them for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Got just what i payed 4</li>
            <li> out of all the canes that i received maybe 10 were pretty ugly. i guess not so bad, i did however had i hard time cutting them thin enough but thats just me maybe you will be better at it. i dont use them as much as i thought i would</li>
            <li> I got these two days ago and ever since i opened the package ive been cutting away! I got some duplicates but nothing like the horror stories off all one halloween theme. It wpuld be nice if we could put in a request for certain typeof fimo sticks we wanted. I would pay a little more for that. Cutting them is tricky if ur new to this but check out videos on youtube. Great product</li>
            <li> i got mine in the mail today and i love them!!! the shipping time it great! it says 3-5 biz days and i got it on the 3rd. this is the 2ed time that i ordered from them and it came the 1st day that that it says it would! the only thing i woud say is a little off about them is that they r a little costy. you can buy things like this from hong kong sellers for really cheap but you have to wait like 18-28 day for them to get to you. so its like your paying for faster shipping. i would much rather pay a little more money so i can get it in the mail faster. overall i give this a 5 out of 5. im very happy with my fimos. thank you MASH!!!</li>
            <li> Fun to work with.  You&#x27;ll need an Exacto type knife or be comfortable with a razor blade to get these thin enough.  Hold well with wet polish.&lt;br /&gt;A long nosed tweezer can be very helpful for placement.  Store well.  Great / fun designs in terrific colors.  Match what you&#x27;re wearing or&lt;br /&gt;your theme decor.</li>
            <li> You have to slice with razor very thin. Very hard to use. I won&#x27;t let my teenager use them unless I slice all the pieces for her. Not worth the cuts on fingers.</li>
            <li> Many different designs. Packaged well, shipped fast. They are the length of about 3 quarters of a tooth pick. The size roundness is bout three tooth picks. Could be longer but that&#x27;s ok as you don&#x27;t need to cut them thick as you are housing on your nails just for the design.</li>
            <li> Great variety of designs and colors, but be prepared to do your own cutting. They are un-cut sticks, so you will need your own good blade to slice these thinly</li>
            <li> I received so many duplicates in my package it was ridiculous. Duplicates that I won&#x27;t even get to use because it&#x27;s the same damn thing and you get so many out of one stick. Would have been better had you gotten to choose the designs received but just randomly receiving the designs is ridiculous because of the selection you get. Not thrilled!</li>
            <li> no instructions, no idea like to use, just the package in the bag I hope I can find some information and then I will use it.</li>
            <li> This is an ok product if they told you how to use it........... there were no instructions and we were not sure how to use these&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this unless you already know how to use them if not do not purchase until they put instructions in there</li>
            <li> Pros: It came with a lot of desings, the material is also soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Its difficult 2 cut them, u need some very thin to do it</li>
            <li> i love all the designs that i got but i did not receive a lot of the ones on the picture actually a majority of the ones on the picture. i did get 100 but alot were the same and of course were the not so cute ones. i would still recommend just wish i would have gotten what is in the picture.</li>
            <li> received sooner than expected. never have I found anything like these in the stores without having to pay a lot of money</li>
            <li> I received these and was surprised at how small they were (which is what I was hoping for because I have tiny nails). Although I had about 15 repeats and even up to four of one design, I still am very happy with this purchase. There are only about 30 that I will actually use but it is still a great deal. I was able to give some of them (mostly the 20 different butterfly designs) to my room mate and the rest I gave to my 12yr old cousin (after I cut them for her) and she absolutely loved them! I don&#x27;t know why people would have problems cutting them thin enough unless they are impatient or have poor eye sight or something. It takes a while to cut them but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Would be better if there was a tool included to cut them to the right thickness.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE STICK RODS THEY ARE EASY TO USE AND THEY LOOK GREAT WITH ACRYLIC NAILS I WILL ORDER MORE</li>
            <li> Cute, Not to hard to work with. Some weird designs but mostly cute ones. The ones I won&#x27;t use my daughter will.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected from looking at the pics, but they are cute. They are 2 inches long and multiples of most of the designs. Now I will have to get at an exacto blade; that&#x27;s the only thing I wish is that these would come pre-cut in a wheel.</li>
            <li> These are really cute nail art rods. There are a lot of different designs and most are things you would use on your nails. I had a lot of trouble with them staying on. If you cut them very thin they curl and don&#x27;t stick to your wet nail polish. If you cut them thicker they are too chunky and will fall off (and if they don&#x27;t fall off they look kind of weird sticking out that far off of your nail). I will be putting these to use for a different arts and crafts project.</li>
            <li> Thought these looked interesting but the description doesn&#x27;t really explain how they worked.  I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten them had I known you had to slice them up to put them on your nails.  I bought these for my daughter and it&#x27;s just alot of work.  Plus if you don&#x27;t slice them just right and really thin, they look funny on your nails. Like I said, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have gotten these had I known.  Maybe if she was WAY into nail art then it would be worth it.  She likes to have nice nails and play around with different polishes and stuff but I doubt she will ever use these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mixed bag of designs, which suits me fine.  Cutting the sticks into wafer thin slices is made easier using a razor (I use a window scraper device from the hardware store).</li>
            <li> AWESOME! got super fast and LOVE tem</li>
            <li> love it , made nail fun!</li>
            <li> Not very clear on what to do with them. No directions!</li>
            <li> Good product but I find it hard to cut down to slices. I would just buy them precut next time-</li>
            <li> It is a very good price and the quality its not great but not bad at all. It is definitely not going to be easy to use for the beginners .. It requires some practices but after all this is a good buy and I will buy is again..</li>
            <li> I received these a week and a half early which is a plus. I like most of the designs... a lot of canes that were in the picture werent in my package... still ok. I have 19 duplicates &amp; 3 unknown. More than half the \\&quot;dupes\\&quot; are okkk.  I ordered more canes from other vendors so I could get the ones I Really want. For 5 bucks I got what I paid for. MAY ORDER again in future... if they include a blade. Ohh and I recieved a total of 102 fimo canes....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAPPY SHOPPING!!!!</li>
            <li> My canes arrived today and I am so happy I purchased them. Most of the canes are very small (extra small) and the rest are regular sized (still normal for fimo canes) and are 2 inches long. I have a few repeats but they are in different sizes, but I can&#x27;t complain the variety is really good. I like the fact that these were on the smaller side but the price is unbeatable and the variety like I already said is really good! I will continue to buy from this seller and highly recommend them. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that they don&#x27;t come with a cutter/blade but that is good for me as I already own one for the canes already.</li>
            <li> I am a manicurist and I do many manicures on little girls. They all really like the &amp;#34;stickers&amp;#34; I can put on them. They are hard to get thin enough though, but that is only a fault of mine. Some of the canes came half sized, but only a few. There were quite a few repeats, I was hoping for more of a variety.</li>
            <li> I am not having any luck with cutting these thin enough to stay on my nails.  We are going to use these for beads instead I guess.</li>
            <li> Came on time and had a wide sampling of canes to work with.</li>
            <li> This took sooooooooo long to come. Then I got these random sticks of religious icons; NOT COOL. One ven was the devil.</li>
            <li> Honeslty I was excited to get this but it does have reapting designs which I dislike and it is also hard to cut. Some where broke which sucked.</li>
            <li> these are great make sure that you have the patience to slice it with a good sharp razor blade. cheaper that sliced</li>
            <li> I really liked the fast shipping, nice packaging, and the many varieties! Although in the picture above it shows hello kitty, I got a pink one instead. But that&#x27;s fine! I really think they should add a kiwi in it though. Very cheap and nice quality overall! I had some canes that had little cracks but it&#x27;s okay. At least it wasnt the ones I would use. Also, I thought that it was very cute that they included an easter egg fimo cane! I reccommend this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> These shipped fairly fast and when they arrived I wanted to test them out. Cutting them thin enough to lay on fingertip is difficult and good luck cutting them evenly. The blade that comes with them is certainly sharp enough but if u dont have the cutting skills to get a thin, even slice then the product is useless. Gonna need some practice, thankfully there are more than enough of them to practice on considering some of them, I would never wear.</li>
            <li> Ok, I like doing fun stuff to my nails...colors stripes dots you name it. My sister is a nail tech and loves to be artist on my nails. So I got these for a really good price and thought..why not...you only live once.  Got them in and surprised to get 2 different bags inside my order. So many little sticks with the most adorible clay pictures. Cats, dogs, frogs, flowers and 3 different watermellons. That&#x27; the one I used first. If you like to do fun things for yourself or others nails...these are the ticket.</li>
            <li> I had received these yesterday, Very good packaging, They came in a Yellow envelope and None had cracked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I prefer the Full sized canes over the pre-cut as, They only give you 10-15 Slices in pre-cut. While using full canes you can get 80-100 slices for the same or lower price! Just make sure you have a Box opener, Safety blade, Clay blade or a xacto Knife And a steady hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for Attaching them, I use Kiss nail glue And two coats of Seche clear, They stay on for about a week to five days or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Designs look better in Real life then they do in the picture, There are alot of cute ones too :3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in the end, I HIGHLY Suggest this Product, And the others I mentioned As they work great. And If you are thinking of Purchasing them. You should, They do cost alot, But they will last for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase!! They came a day early so I was even more excited! There are no doubles.. there&#x27;s actually 100 different cute designs! There smaller than I thought but I love it cause that means I can put them on my real nails &amp; acryllic!! I&#x27;m just really happy with what I got!! I would definitely recommend!! Loooooove them!!</li>
            <li> Its really hard to see in the picture but the designs are really cool. My nieces are going to use the on their nails and in craft projects. I will definetly buy again.</li>
            <li> I just got my design canes and it was missing one cane. I have yet to find a tool that will slice them thin enough to stick to my nails longer than a day or thin enough to lay flatly on my nails. But they were good for the price and the amount. The size was consistent, there were no doubles in color for any one design, the material is a nice quality as far as durability, and it seems to be lasting.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 17 yo daughter, she had no experience with anything sharp so I had to cut them for her at first, no problem. All I have to say is \\&quot;The things women go thru for beauty and style\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I thought they were going to be longer. Came with very cute designs but they didn&#x27;t stick onto my nail :(</li>
            <li> Cute and good price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived very quick. I would advise the vendor post some picture how to cut and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again and recommend for a friend.</li>
            <li> I just ordered these nail sticks a few days ago,and they were shipped way faster than expected which was great. Most of the designs are veryy cute I have a cute pile and a pile i will never use so i recomend trying to practice cutting the sticks you will never use. Over all this product is a great buy I would highly recomend it for anyone who enjoys nail art:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reson for 4 stars insted of 5 is it should include something to cut the sticks with.</li>
            <li> There were so many! I cant wait to use them!! Came in 2 days cute packaging! Great deal! Buy now!</li>
            <li> I recieved this item on time. Much to my liking, almost all of the types of fimo shown was what I got. Sadly, I did not get the reindeer,or the hello kitty fimo. However, I am disappointed on some of the sizes. The Santa was unable to be distinguished, it was almost microscopic. Keep in mind pictures may be zoomed in, and the actual product may be much smaller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very easy to cut, and some of the designs are ridiculous and unneeded but for the price, I guess it isn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> although the birthday and something different for freinds and family, this makes gifting uniqe.scrapbooking also.. i could also send to my sister and brothers .</li>
            <li> in the picture there are more cuter designs and variety than what I received.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong. they are all cute, but I expected at least some of the cute one pictured.&lt;br /&gt;I did not get: butterflies, skull, frog, happy face, leaf, or petal flowers.&lt;br /&gt;I got a bunch of fruits, flags, round canes with flowers inside, not shaped :-( and tear drops. even some I haven&#x27;t the slightly idea what they are.&lt;br /&gt;there&#x27;s a lot, and slice thin it will last a long time. and look cute, no matter your age.</li>
            <li> I love it! I don&#x27;t know what would do without it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was a little confused at first but, I think it&#x27;s going to be ok.  Due to I love to try new things</li>
            <li> I love them!! I thought that they would of been longer and bigger for some reason, but it ok. They are still cute.</li>
            <li> They do not cut easily. Too thick for nails</li>
            <li> A great set! Came with a really sharp little razor too</li>
            <li> It took so long to get these I forgot about them. The canes suck. They were to many alike, to many ugly fruit, and the canes were not worth the wait or the money. I would tell others to skip buying this set of Mash canes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive too many duplicates and they are tiny and cute! The set I got also came with two blades which I thought was very nice!</li>
            <li> I originally got these to do nailart and they work fantastically.  You can choose how thick or thin you want to cut the designs and mix and match to your heart&#x27;s content.  My 5 year old found another use for them, as well, getting me to cut some slices for him to place on his pictures; a little glue and the extra design is there to enhance his drawings and give them a little extra pizzazz.  I will definitely order more of these in the future for all of our hobbies.</li>
            <li> Odd item.  It comes with no instructions whatsoever and you MUST use a razor blade to slice them thin enough to put on your nails. You can glue them on with nail glue or use a thin coat of clear polish to make it stick to your nails.  The best thing I can say about them is that the little designs are cute and you get soooooooooooooooooooooooo many that it makes it a great deal for the money, they could last you forever :)</li>
            <li> love them, excellent value, lots of designs to add to my nails. They showed up much quicker than other purchases that I have made.</li>
            <li> I love painting and decorating my nails so i thought this would be perfect, but they didn&#x27;t turn out so great. They&#x27;re extremely hard to cut off and don&#x27;t stay on your nail. I even tried nail glue but they fell of within the first 30 min.</li>
            <li> was not mash all random you don&#x27;t get all you see</li>
            <li> Smaller than what expected and not all shown were in package. Disappointed</li>
            <li> super cute! awesome deal! would purchase again</li>
            <li> As I notice from the OTHER buyer pictures, they&#x27;re close to the size of half an average pen.  Mine?  1 INCH long and MULTIPLE repeats.  I expected at least twice the size, if not 2.5&amp;#34;.  And sure, a lot of them are great and detailed, but I kind of expected more from what was portrayed!  Not just fruit, butterflies, flowers, and random shapes on less than half the expected size.  I&#x27;m posting pictures.  PLUS I only received 86!!! WHAT IS THE DEAL?  Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> i like this item because i am able to put thing on my nails that i can&#x27;t do with nail polish</li>
            <li> I thought that they would be pre cut, my fault I did not fully read the description...  but very cute!</li>
            <li> 12yr old daughter loves all the different pictures on these, but hard to cut thin slices and keep on nails.  Have used&lt;br /&gt;to decorate school boxes, etc.</li>
            <li> was exactly as advertised,none are the same,they are easy to slice and have many great uses,i use them for nail designs and scrap booking.they were packaged well and was recieved undamaged.speed of delivery was ok.</li>
            <li> This are realy cute! it came very fast and no doubles, thei are realy small and good for the nails, i dont think i will ever need to buy it again, but i would absolutly buy if needed, later i take a picture of it! Im sorry about my bad english, im not american!</li>
            <li> First of all, I ordered these straight from the Mash website which I found by shopping on Amazon, but couldn&#x27;t find a way to review on their website and I just had to review it because these are flippin&#x27; awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The canes were very well packaged and they were all perfect. I got 2 duplicates but they&#x27;re all really cute so I didn&#x27;t mind. I&#x27;ve had these for over a month and have ordered from another seller since then. Ordering from Mash set the bar really high for me. I&#x27;m glad Mash canes were my first experience with fimo because the others I have bought haven&#x27;t been so great. I will be ordering more canes from Mash, and Mash only! The design are great, the sizes are consistent, they&#x27;re great quality (the best in my opinion)and they&#x27;re easy to slice. I use an X-acto craft knife and get 100+ slices per cane. These were my first set of canes and I didn&#x27;t have any trouble slicing. They are worth every cent.</li>
            <li> I love these a lot. Based on the pictures, it looks like the sets differ slightly because I saw some in the pics that I definitely didn&#x27;t get in my set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the sticks were intact and you can tell what most of them are supposed to be though some are just weird...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a razor blade to cut them works really well and they are easy to put on (I just use a pair of regular tweezers). Much fun will be had with these for sure!</li>
            <li> When I got them in the mail I thought how cute they are and they fit very nice on my big toes nail but I can&#x27;t wait I just cut a cane and put it on right then. But now I&#x27;m planning on doing my hands and feet the same design. My nail canes come in a clear zip lock package in good shape. There great.</li>
            <li> These were smaller than I thought.  It took me the whole weekend to slice them all up, but now that it&#x27;s done, can&#x27;t wait to start using them.  Great variety in this set, no repeats!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like them. You have to slice the design off with a razor and I can never get them thin enough or straight. Then they fall off within 2 hours. And half the designs are really cute and the other half I have no idea what they even are. Figured out they might be pieces of sushi. They were fun to try and make a good addition to a gift but they are a pain.</li>
            <li> These rods are very tiny but so cute.  Even though they are small all of the patterns are easy to see.  Especially like the variety of flowers.  I bought them with card making in mind and at first thought they would be too small for that.  But since the patterns are clear I can still use them for my cards.  Nice for anyone who needs tiny accents.  Since there are so many I&#x27;m not sure I will ever use all of them and may share them.</li>
            <li> The up side first these are cute there was 100 of them, I did get some Of the designs advertised, a few that I really wanted and some unexpected surprises also a cutting blade was enclosed which made them worth buying for me.  The down side  are that these are very small rods about an inch long and the designs are also small with less details than I expected, the colors are not as vibrant as they are pictured.  There were mostly flowers and fruit repeats no hello kitty, some I don&#x27;t recognize and some I probably will never use.</li>
            <li> There is no way to slice these thin enough to stay on my nail longer than a day. They are bulgy and stick out and any wrong move they will snap off. Now i have a million of these things and can&#x27;t really use them.</li>
            <li> Gift for niece for her birthday. She is a teenager who loves being creative.</li>
            <li> THESE NAIL DECAL STICKS ARE AWESOME!!! I liked them so well I came back and bought another one cud the 1st one I bought was for my niece for xmas. I was shocked that there aren&#x27;t any doubles. Will only but these from this company. Will definitely come back here and get them  from here when I need more in the future. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THESE!!!  :-)</li>
            <li> I ordered these thinking they were alot bigger. But, in a way I am kind of happy they are smaller. Easier to fit on the nail I guess. Overall, they arrived on time, and even came with a tool to slice them with. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> These are the size of a licorice goodie or the length of a nib but 1/4 in diameter. They are so small you can barely see what the decoration is on most.&lt;br /&gt;Because they are so small and you have to cut them so thin, be prepared to cut your fingers. Certainly not for children to use!&lt;br /&gt;Lots of repeats and broken ones, like someone already cut them in half.&lt;br /&gt;Just an AWFUL PRODUCT AND WASTE OF MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li> Friggin I bought 4 such packs. 2 from MASH and 2 from CHINA/HK sellers. The 2 packets MASH sent are 2&amp;#34;+. The ones I got from CHINA/HK sellers is 1&amp;#34;. Exactly half of what MASH is selling but for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a US buyer buy here dont waste time on the others. Same price / FASTER shipping (5 to 6 days) / double to size of sticks. What more do you want.</li>
            <li> They came in the mail very quick. I check how there were no doubles, but some of them were kind of deformed. one was squished to one side and the end one flower cane was sort of cut off. overall these were great, i loved how i got 100 different designs. Other sites sells it for cheaper but gives you 3 of the same design.. i dont even need that much.</li>
            <li> while i did get my full 100 sticks, i got a lot of duplicates, not just 2 of certain sticks, i got 7 of the exact same orange slices sticks. 4 of another orange slice, 4 of the exact same leaf, and 2-3 duplicates of a bunch of other sticks. total duplicate sticks being 37. that was over a 1/3 of the sticks. other wise, they are nice, i just with i had some more of them. they are pretty repetitive. i had really been hoping for some bows and hello kitty, butterflies, hearts or animals. oh well. they are still cheap for what they are, and they work well.</li>
            <li> This is a good buy if you do your own nails. A few tips though, they are hard to cut, be smart if you are buying this for your kids you need to help them. I took the ones I liked the best and left them on the window sill on a sunny day to get them to soften up. I use a very sharp exacto knife (again not for kids) and cut a bunch. Saving the fatter cuts for my toes and the thinner ones for a nice manicure. I bagged them so when I want to do my nails they are ready for me. I did get 100 sticks (which will slice up to hundreds of applications) although I do not find all of them appealing I feel satisfied I would use approx. 80 of the designs. Flowers, fruits, butterflies, dragonflies, hearts, cupcakes, etc... I did not get any duplicates either. I started with a design I have no idea what it was, and used that as my test one, cutting as thin as I could before I got the hang of it. I did use paint on nail glue to adhere them to my nails adding a glossy top coat every few days. They stayed on for more than a week, as long as I would have expected any polish to stand up. They are pretty fun and better than any stickers they sell now.</li>
            <li> I brought this as one of my teenagers Christmas gift but I had no idea it would be so small. It&#x27;s for this reason I don&#x27;t believe she will be too happy about it.</li>
            <li> I was very exited to get this product in the mail today, though the shipping took 5 more days than expected and when I finally recived the product, I hadnt gotten the ones shown in the picture, but ones surrounding a halloween theme including spider webs and pumkins. Overall, these seem like a good product but not at all what I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Lilians Daughter</li>
            <li> I was expecting many different canes as shown in the photo, but what I got was 100 canes of Halloween designs?! Ten packs with ten canes in each, ALL the same set of 10 canes.Skulls, pumpkins, ghosts, etc....</li>
            <li> The designs are nice but cutting them is difficult. They are cute to have but I&#x27;m not too sure how to use them. Each time I apply them, they come off easily. I was expecting them to be like the stickers but I can&#x27;t get them to be as thin. It ends up peeling rather quickly. As far as the images are, they are perfect.</li>
            <li> This is the cutest idea.  The graphics are very detailed and vibrant.  It&#x27;s very nice to have them in the roll so that you don&#x27;t lose a bunch of little pieces.  Graphics are cute.</li>
            <li> They sent me a ton of these little things.  The only problem is that a good portion of them are unusable.  I can&#x27;t even tell what some of them are.  The ones I do like are the hearts, flowers, and fruits.  Good deal for the price but I would love some cuter designs.</li>
            <li> Some of the canes that i received were cut off and the full picture was not on them. I also didn&#x27;t know what some of them were and i can&#x27;t really use them because i don&#x27;t know what they are. I was happy with some of them but not most.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it cause I assumed it were stamps. I was to fast with the purchase and didn&#x27;t pay attention on how to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a 5 star anyway because: It feels like good quality. It allows to even cut the pieces with a scissor, knife, or other sharp things.&lt;br /&gt;And, there are 100 different pieces in the bag. Some are the same, but have a different color. For those who are familiar with rod sticks: Do the purchase! You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with these. I thought I was going to get what was in t he picture, but I was wrong. What I got was many of the same figures and they were quite ugly, not all the ones that are shown in the picture..</li>
            <li> Did not meet my expectation!I thougt it would work but did not do anything will not purchase this item agian, Don&#x27;t  recommend  it...</li>
            <li> This bundle wascso cheap and I got so many choices to choose from. Make sure you use a straight razor or ecacto knife to cut the stick rods. Then you use nail glue to put them on your nails. Everyone thougt I went to the salon.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying out fimo sticks, so they were smaller than i expected when I received them. I did not count them, but it does look like a received the 100 pcs. None of mine were doubled. They were all different. I was kind of disappointed that I did not receive the hello kitty fimo stick. I am a huge fan of Hello kitty and that was one of the main reasons why I ordered this one.. They&#x27;re still cute, but I would have been happier with the HK</li>
            <li> Just like the nail tape strips, these came without any paperwork or instructions. I&#x27;m sure my 14 year old will be smart enough to figure them out, but never having used them, we have no idea how to, so some illustration and direction would have made them a lot easier to use.</li>
            <li> its cute on the nails but is way smaller then it appears and very hard to cut and slice up.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast! I do have duplicates but they are really cute and for the price, you can&#x27;t really complain too much.  Instructions would have been nice but it doesn&#x27;t take a genius to google or youtube :)&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried them yet as I just got them today but I&#x27;m looking forward to creating fun designs with them.  I would definitely recommend them to anyone who wants to be creative :)</li>
            <li> I luv the designs but there is some that i will never use but helps to practice on them. I do find it hard to cut them if you dont have a type of razor that will cut them evenly.</li>
            <li> So I only gave these 4 stars because I like the ones from bundle monster more because the designs are more vivid. Dont get me wrong these are nice and I only got 2 doubles but the ones from bundle monster are made with brighter colores and the designs are a little bit more crisp. For some reason some of my stix go from big to tiny like a cone effect and 3 of my stix have a small chunk missing on the side in the middle of the stick. So I got 98 designs and about 7 are messed up.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter bought these with her own money.  She watched videos on youtube and loves nail art so she had to have these.  They feel and look like little long erasers.  The idea is you cut them thin and glue them on your nail.  The idea of her slicing them with a razor causes me some anxiety.  It is very hard to cut them thin.  The end result is kind of tacky.  I can&#x27;t imagine an adult walking around with 3d monkey face eraser pieces on their fingers.  So I have to think these are intended for tweens and young teens.  That gets back to the cutting them with a razor as thin as possible which depending on the age of the person cutting can be difficult.  They also come with no instructions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still rather new to using fimo canes for nail art but these are really cute. I had a hard time cutting them to the thickness that I wanted at first but after some practice, it&#x27;s gotten a lot easier.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I&#x27;d ever gotten these so I expected them to be made of soft rubber that would be easy to slice. WRONG!! these are a much harder rubber then I expected and you cant slice them paper thin. I recommend a good sharp knife with a cutting board under it, and you better be ready to spend a few hours if you&#x27;re doing all of the sticks at once, frankly I just cut off 5 or so of each and dropped the stick in the bottle with the slices.</li>
            <li> i just got into doing nails and was looking at this, iffy at first but i&#x27;m glade i got it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you do have to cut it but it&#x27;s all good, cant use it all anyways.&lt;br /&gt;cute designs, although there was about 6 of them that was repeated (and it wasn&#x27;t the cute one you wouldn&#x27;t mind having twice :&amp;#60; that was the only down fall)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;over all very nicely package, quick shipment, would buy again!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t as I expected at all they are like little eraser noodles and are only like 1 in long and very tiny</li>
            <li> I use the razor blade to cut these off in strips that are as thin as I can possibly get them. They are so hard that it&#x27;s extremely difficult to cut them, and I waste a lot of the rod trying to get a full slice that&#x27;s super thin. But once I do actually get the slice, it&#x27;s too hard to bend to the curvature of the nail and breaks or just won&#x27;t stick to the nail, even with nail glue.</li>
            <li> Would be nice if this came with a blade but it doesn&#x27;t so im forced to use kitchen knives and they don&#x27;t exactly do the prettiest job</li>
            <li> Cute 3D stick designs. It&#x27;s worth the price if you do a lot of nail designs. You have to have good dexterity to cut fimo canes to a thinness that would look good on your nails, so if you can&#x27;t cut good, don&#x27;t bother! :)</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever purchased here, is exactly what they offered me. Are happy with this.</li>
            <li> Im a nail student and this product was just the perfect choice for I was looking for my class and its so affordable</li>
            <li> The images on the design rods are clear--even the little mustache on the white rod.  I was pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter has been wanting to learn how to use these for nail art.  They are great.  They have a lot of food-type, animal, and butterfly designs.  Some of the designs were strange and not something she would ever use, but that is okay, because they are great to practice with.</li>
            <li> you need to slice these paper thin yourself and its quite difficult. using a razor blade to slice these evenly and paper-thin is quite difficult, requiring a lot of patience. the variety is nice as is the price.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of doubles but they were still cute i didn&#x27;t get a few i was hoping I would but i&#x27;m pretty happy with them if only&lt;br /&gt;I could cut them thinner still got to work on that.</li>
            <li> When I ordered these I was skeptical on these bc of the reviews but when I got them I was shocked there smaller than a  cigarette and not easy to slice but once u get a hang of it its not that bad ..u have to slice them very thin to get them to stay on your fingernail they arrived b4 they should have and i didnt get any repeats this is a awesome buy bc if u dont want to use them for your nail u can put them on your cell Phone book cover a vase or what ever your little heart desires</li>
            <li> Is nice but has to come sito the cutter be cause is so dificult to cut it  but the designs aren ice</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T TRUST IN THAT PICTURE. IT DOESN&#x27;T COME WHEN YOU ORDER!!!! IT&#x27;S A ...LIE. U.U SO I&#x27;M SOO ANGRY. i was excited but when i received it i wuz like O_O SOO DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> I super love it... since i got this one... everyday i change my nail arts.. lol...</li>
            <li> Very cute.  These are soft and easy to cut.  I plan to use them for more craft projects than just for my nails..</li>
            <li> When I placed order it said the canes would be 2 inches, I was not very happy when I found they were 1 inch! Please be aware they may only be 100 of the one inch canes although there were some cute designs I would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> these are rods with no direction on how to use them. they do not come apart as you would think they would.</li>
            <li> they shipped fast and are very easy to use but the reason i did not give it 5 stars is because they are very small and not all are cut even but i really like them and would buy them again.</li>
            <li> The sticks were very small. I received a lot of duplicate designs and none were cute like the ones pictured.</li>
            <li> Not enough variety in design also no instructions. They are difficult to cut, I used a razor so i would say not for kids.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy.  I think these will last for a very long time.  We will have an adult cut them and I have little plastic dishes to separate them into.</li>
            <li> Arrived early but not in time for Christmas which I knew.  I&#x27;ve passed along to my granddaughter but haven&#x27;t heard how she likes it.  I wish it had come with instructions and a few inspirational pictures.</li>
            <li> No directions came with these so we have idea how to use them.  It was a waste of money. Next customer send directions</li>
            <li> i love it! many cool and cute designs came! there were also some not so nice or some just ugly...lol but it is still nice! came in time as listed in the shipping info :)</li>
            <li> These are such a good price and look adorable on nails. I&#x27;ll post some pics when I do my nails next! :) Love them! Also, omg they have a DORAEMON STICK!? Yes.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try these out because i had never heard of such thing, I&#x27;m sooo looking forward to actually using them, these are a nail enthusiast dream !!!</li>
            <li> I got this and only have 2 or 3 duplicates. I received 99 canes, instead of 100 but i will not complain. they are so cute! I love them!!!! The shipping was faster than expected and the quality was great. will purchase again!!</li>
            <li> I love these. They are perfect!</li>
            <li> Not MASH at all... But I can say that I didn&#x27;t get many duplicates. Wish there was a more variety of designs than the flowers and fruits. Other than that they cut perfectly fine and are really cute.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 I just got 1. I hope they send me the other 2 or at list give my money back. Another thing, they are a lot shorter now and keeps with the same price, must be a joke otherwise I don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness these are going to last me forever</li>
            <li> I love the variety and the size were perfect for decoing some of my phone cases. Good for nails too :)</li>
            <li> Beautiful, thank you!</li>
            <li> Took a long time to receive and was not even what I thought it was. Live and learn</li>
            <li> Great lots of variety</li>
            <li> I bought these for my sister who is obsessed with nail polish, and I was decently happy with the quality of them.  A few of the rods had large chunks out of them, and some of the pictures don&#x27;t come out straight.  Otherwise, I liked them a lot.  They&#x27;re pretty easy to cut, and many of them are really cute.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m pretty sure I got the knock off version rather than the actual ones from MASH themselves. They shipped from China, and were packaged in plain plastic bags (I ordered 2 sets) rather than MASH bags. Also, I got quite a few duplicates, including like 5 or 6 of the same stick, which is some red, fruit-like triangle that I will probably never use.&lt;br /&gt;Also, not all of the sticks i got are even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, a lot of them are very cute, and for the price you really can&#x27;t beat them. I tried slicing one with a scalpel (I had one I never used from an old Bio lab class) and that seemed to work fine.  I&#x27;ll update when I start using them. As someone else said in another review, I would probably buy them directly from MASH if I was going to buy them again.</li>
            <li> Gift that was enjoyed!</li>
            <li> I thought they would be a little thicker but I absolutely love it. There&#x27;re cute. I will enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> Just got these today, and I really like them. They are much smaller than I expected, especially because my big fingernails, but they are still a good size to place on, and it leaves a lot of room.&lt;br /&gt;I did get 2 or 3 with small dents in them, but it was hardly anything.&lt;br /&gt;They came fast, and I didn&#x27;t get any duplicates.&lt;br /&gt;Just waiting for the nail glue to arrive so I can stick them on!</li>
            <li> these are kinda hard to use and they didnt stay on my nails very long. not more than a couple hours</li>
            <li> Look really good but you really need to cut them super fine with a blade. I used clear cut under and over them.</li>
            <li> I mainly ordered this for the frog that was shown in all three pictures right on top of all the other ones. I didn’t get the frog at all!!  Don’t order if there is one stick that you more than any of the others, since you probably won’t get it. I was very disappointed. Plus the price has gone up now.  Very hard to cut as thinly as needed. So they fall off easily. I used one on my granddaughter and put 2 coats of nail protection and they still fell of in her sleep.  Real waste of money to me. Too much trouble to return it since it wasn’t that expensive.</li>
            <li> I only received 97 but that is still plenty enough for me. They were in great condition, none were broken or damaged and i got a great assortment of designs, no doubles at all.</li>
            <li> Arrived way before the expected date (Jan. 34-Feb. 11). I received them today (Jan. 14). They are exactly as described, and arrived unharmed in any way. I started counting them and looking for repeats as soon as I opened them. There are 100+. I stopped counting after 100 because anything after that was a plus. As for repeats, there were a few, but very few. But I really don&#x27;t mind because they are really cute designs that I love having extras of them. Some smiley faces, hearts, fruits, angry birds, etc. The list just goes on and on. I love them! I just couldn&#x27;t wait to use them. I did my mom&#x27;s nails to test them out. I personally think they came out great for my first try. Cutting them gets easier the more you do it. My first ones were a little uneven and chunky, but the more I cut the thinner and more even they came out. Would DEFINITELY recommend! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I assumed \\&quot;100 PC\\&quot; meant there were 100 pieces. There were physically 100 pieces but most were repeats and multiples so I can only assume these were long pieces cut in half or three sections. I expected 100 different designs. That being said, they are great fimo pieces, super easy to slice with my Irwin straight razor. Arrived promptly, considering it was shipped from overseas. I haven&#x27;t tried them on my nails yet but I expect they will be wonderful.</li>
            <li> my order was exactly as described easy to use and turned out beautiful</li>
            <li> This is a great idea but they are very difficult to cut. I think I&#x27;d rather spend the extra money and buy them precut at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> very cute nail art.....really hard to slice...i wish they had some hello kitty, more cute girly designs. Not angry birds and halloween... my daughters love them...</li>
            <li> a few were shorter than the others but they are cute i would have liked more of a variety tho</li>
            <li> A very fun and easy way to create beautiful nails.  My daughter has had a blast and all her friends want to come over and give each other manicures.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, just use a razor to cut them thin</li>
            <li> really hard to cut and smaller than expected really cute designs just need tons of practice</li>
            <li> These a very cute and easy to apply to my nails. I&#x27;ll be using them for years because each stick can be cut many times.</li>
            <li> I think the product arrived well, but it was not what I had expected.  I will read the profile a little more carefully next time.  They will make great craft project items for sure.</li>
            <li> At first, it was difficult to use these, but after lots of practice, I&#x27;ve become a pro! I recommend cutting the sticks on a flat surface that is lightly elevated from your table/desk (like on a notebook) and using a box cutter or a razor blade for a more precise cut. i say to cut it on a notebook or even a stack of text books because it allows you to manuvere your hands around the piece to get the precise angle that you need. All in all, I think i got one or two doubles (of sticks that I know i will use alot) and only three wtf&#x27;s...lol...i couldn&#x27;t tell you what they are, but i&#x27;m sure I can figure something out with them! I also used them to practice my cutting before i started dicing up my favs!</li>
            <li> They are cute and fun!! Easy to cut!!! Mine was all different ones!!! I recomend!! I dont use any glue just nail polish and they stay untill i take them off!!! Loving it</li>
            <li> wow lots of sticks, great graffics, so many uses, didnt expect that many for that great of price. one order is enough for over a year</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any duplicates in my bundle. All the images were cute and none were disfigured.  I only had one rod that I can&#x27;t tell what it is...the rest are awesome!</li>
            <li> I got my stick way early which was great. But I didn&#x27;t get all the stick shown. I put a picture in the pictures from customers showing exactly what I got. I did get a great variety and do love the ones I got but I go no Hello Kitty, I did get some cats though. I got lots of flowers and lots of things shown and lots a fruit so I am happy with the purchase. They seemed kinda hard at first and I wasn&#x27;t sure they would cut but they cut beautifully and I just love them!</li>
            <li> I am upset with this order. When I purchased the product, the item was described as being 5 cm long and the rods will come in a variety. The rods half the length describe, 1 inch, and I only receive 10 different types of rods. Only 10! I am very disappointed and will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> the only thing was way to many angry bird canes. don&#x27;t get me wrong I like angry birds but I would like diff canes other then 23 canes of angry birds</li>
            <li> harder to cut than I anticipated, but still cute designs.</li>
            <li> so got them after  about 3 weeks which is still a bout a week and a half early for the shipping date because they ship from china, but opened the envelope they came in all they were in was a zipploc bag basically and they were all different sizes and some went from big to small. I looked at all of them and i had 17, yes thats right 17, doubles one there was 4 of, one there was 3 of and one there was 7 of the exact same cane. I ordered another pack from amazon, because these were taking forever to get here, and there were 200 of them and not a single repeat in them at all and it took them less then a week to get here. I will not be getting these Mash  sticks again.</li>
            <li> The item was what I was expecting..... convinient package, no problems are all. I will recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> Only received in my pack. Shipped as promised.</li>
            <li> These were the first fimo sticks I bought.  The packet I received was mostly fruit but overall there was a good variety.  Once you learn how to slice these correctly they are a lot of fun to play around with.</li>
            <li> Love these nail art 3d...it&#x27;s fun to cut them...sharing some for my nieces...</li>
            <li> I got these on a whim because I&#x27;ve been into doing cutesy things and playing with my fingernails lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really am thankful for that whim because I adore these sticks. There are no repeats at all in my selection -- I have butterflies, a variety of hearts, various holiday-type canes, some dragonflies, a selection of fruits and vegetables, faces -- The list could go on and on. I didn&#x27;t get any canes that were damaged or deformed in any way, and they are all recognizable, if at times a bit quirky (I&#x27;m not sure when I might need or want a hardboiled egg or cupcakes, but they are awfully cute and I&#x27;m going to come up with a reason.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using an x-acto knife for slicing, I&#x27;m able to get them into very thin slices, which is perfect for nails, as well as for a variety of other craft projects (I used a couple flowers to decorate a miniature frame for a gift and they looked amazing for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I can&#x27;t imagine that I&#x27;ll use all of these within my lifetime, I&#x27;m already looking for a completely different selection to add to my available choices. I absolutely love them. If you don&#x27;t mind the time you&#x27;ll have to put in slicing them, this is a terrific product and a great investment -- a lot more cost effective than buying a container of already pre-sliced ones. I haven&#x27;t completely sliced any of my canes but I would guess that I can easily get 60 slices from each cane. Once I finish slicing one, I&#x27;ll update with the count. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - the range seems to be 50-100, depending on the cane and how brave I feel about slicing very thin -- the thinner I slice, the more often I cut a partial slice, but the more slices I get. Even at 50 per cane, that&#x27;s a lot of nail stickers. :)</li>
            <li> Great product arrived on time</li>
            <li> These little stickers are really cute and they come in a lot of designs although there&#x27;re a few of them I won&#x27;t be using but I used them for practicing.The have flowers stars even skulls which will come in handy on Halloween and they stay in place for lengths at a time depending on the over coat you use,how much you use, and how long you allow them to dry.They are reusable so that&#x27;s a great big plus you will need something sharp to cut them if you want it to look professional.</li>
            <li> VERY FAST SHIPPING EARLIER THAN ESTIMATE, THEY ARE VERY PRETTY AND CUTE, BUT I HAD NO IDEA IT WOULD BE SO LITTLE, HAS LITTLE LIKE THE KEY OF THE DOOR!, I GOT A LOT OF DUPLICATES FROM THE SAME COLOR AND SOME WITH THE SAME SHAPE BUT DIFFERENT COLOR, THE DESIGNS ARE OK, LOT OF THEM I DIDN&#x27;T KNOW WTF WAS, I RECEIVE JUST ONE HAPPY FACE, NO KIWI AND JUST 1 ICE CREAM THOSE ARE THE REASON WHY I AM GIVING THIS 2 STAR!.</li>
            <li> I read that these come at random sometimes? I bought these thinking I would get them in the picture. I really hope so! I couldn&#x27;t find a way to contact seller to ask so please seller of this product make sure my order you&#x27;re about to ship has HELLO KITTY and all the nail pictures!! My name is under teganxox0@gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll let everyone know how it goes as well. :)</li>
            <li> Cute but hard to use, I need lots more practice cutting them even!  Probably would not buy something like this again.</li>
            <li> this is a gift that i bought for my daughter.  I recieved it very quickly and promptly. was very easy to order.</li>
            <li> Our daughter loved the idea of the stickers but it requires the use of a razor blade to shave off a sticker. it would be okay for older kids but not for younger children unless your going to do the cutting. The price was great and the items was nice, a lot of sticker choices. Overall a really good buy</li>
            <li> I Don&#x27;t know how it works - can you tell me how to do the design? Do you cut it ?</li>
            <li> these are super cute. my 7 year old loves these on her nails!</li>
            <li> there were definitely a cool idea i purchased them for a member of the family and she used them a few times. it is kind of hard to get them cut straight enough so they look good on your nail but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s just an &amp;#34;operator&amp;#34; issue not the product.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend had picked this out because she likes them so I ordered them for her . Received today she likes the designs but not the fact that they are smaller than the other ones she had ordered  before .</li>
            <li> Although the canes are \\&quot;unique\\&quot;, the colors were not vibrant and the designs were not clear and there were too many duplicates in the order I received.  They did not come in the \\&quot;MASH\\&quot; packaging.  Instead, they were just in a plastic baggie.  . I received the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;16 fruit&lt;br /&gt;  --&gt; 3 lime slices&lt;br /&gt;  --&gt; 5 orange slices&lt;br /&gt;  --&gt;  1 \\&quot;unknown\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;  --&gt;  2 identical \\&quot;unknown\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;  --&gt;  1 orange slice&lt;br /&gt;  --&gt;  1 strawberry&lt;br /&gt;  --&gt;  1 grape&lt;br /&gt;  --&gt;  2 apple (identical, but different sizes)&lt;br /&gt;2 flags&lt;br /&gt;6 cupcakes (5 identical)&lt;br /&gt;12 butterflies&lt;br /&gt;1 teddy bear&lt;br /&gt;18 flowers (7 unique)&lt;br /&gt;15 hearts&lt;br /&gt;  --&gt;  5 duplicate white (with a bat inside - maybe)&lt;br /&gt;  --&gt;  4 duplicate purple (with a peace sign - maybe)&lt;br /&gt;  --&gt;  2 identical white outlined in blue&lt;br /&gt;  --&gt;  4 unique hearts&lt;br /&gt;2 \\&quot;I Love me\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;1 smiley face&lt;br /&gt;6 angry birds (2 duplicates)&lt;br /&gt;1 leaf&lt;br /&gt;1 Christmas present&lt;br /&gt;1 ying-yang&lt;br /&gt;18 (I can&#x27;t describe)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give the duplicates to my children and grandchildren.  I will order the next set directly from MASH and hope for better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a second set of rods directly from MASH.  The order was exactly what I expected.  It was packaged in a MASH container, the canes were clear and the colors vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping the three stars because first order was not what I ordered.</li>
            <li> They are just so cute and well made! They came all packaged up and are perfect for crafts and nails.</li>
            <li> I love fimo canes they are very easy to use once you get the hang of it, however there are too many images that i would not use, and i would have loved it to have a lot more bows, it only has a blue one</li>
            <li> I love these so much! They are so cute and work really well. I caught right on as to how to cut them. I didn&#x27;t have any repeats and they came really quick. love these 100%</li>
            <li> Great selection of designs. I love the fruit ones and the floral ones. Some are a little cheesy or better for kids, but everyone has different tastes, right? SO I&#x27;d say this assortment really has something for everyone. I have a nice sharp razor blade that I use to slice them, and it helps to make them as paper thin as possible or they&#x27;ll look really bulky on your nails. The canes are tiny but that&#x27;s good because the designs aren&#x27;t guady and will fit on all nail sizes.</li>
            <li> I love these sticks. I got a lot of them(maybe 40). I wish I wouldve gotten more of a variety</li>
            <li> Awesome products, just wish it was a little quicker ship time but thanks anyway!!! I will reorder when needed, thanks again</li>
            <li> I purchased these for a nail station for preteens at a bday party. These were very cute but my problem was cutting them, it got tiring after a while. I ended up just cutting like 3 of each design. The girls LOVED them though.</li>
            <li> I am so amazed with the quality of this product and especially the price!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is all worth it and the designs are darling.</li>
            <li> Very cute, huge variety</li>
            <li> EDIT: I&#x27;m changing my review to be more accurate.  I received about 28 unique designs - mostly fruits and flowers, otherwise the majority were duplicates (72 in fact).  I was hoping to get some pirate themed items and the red heart within the white heart like what is shown in the preview pictures, but nope, only 28 design for me.  I filed a claim with Amazon&#x27;s A-to-z Guarantee service and after a few back and forth emails (buypretty just wanted to refund me $1, I just wanted a few more unique sticks), I ended getting a $1 refund.  I asked the seller to put a disclaimer under their product description saying that the sticks are randomly selected and that multiple duplicates are possible.  Haven&#x27;t seen that change, so I dropped a star from this review.</li>
            <li> I think others have mentioned this, but in order to avoid tons of duplicates or bad sticks (i.e. messed up &amp;#34;images&amp;#34;) be sure to order these from MASH.  As in, the SELLER will be MASH - not just the brand in the product title.  I received a good variety of canes with only a couple duplicates and one orange that did get a little mushed on one end.  Well worth spending a tad extra to ensure a good haul.  Hope this helps!</li>
