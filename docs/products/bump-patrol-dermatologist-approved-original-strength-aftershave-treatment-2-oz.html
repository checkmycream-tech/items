            <li>It is true that is works.</li>

            <li>also like to use it a couple days after a fresh shave.</li>
            <li>also have made sure to completely follow instructions</li>
            <li>Bald and smooth, not raw and bumpy...</li>
            <li>I will warn you this stuff does sting when it hits the skin first.  </li>
            <li>, the shipment arrived within a reasonable time frame to save me from my misery!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>you use it after a fresh shave it will sting a bit, but that is normal, it also gets kinda sticky too.</li>
            <li>a working professional, being clean shaven for every work day is an absolute must.</li>
            <li>Amazon has it on here for a decent price!</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t help much after a Brazilian wax.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like it smells..</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need a whole lot of moisturizer afterwards, sometimes I don&#x27;t use it all after applying bump patrol.</li>
            <li>My head has already gotten used to the razor, so buying was kind of a waste of money.</li>
            <li>Brand new bottles!</li>
            <li>The product is decent, but I&#x27;ve found that I perhaps didn&#x27;t need it after all.</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good investment, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>As an African American male with highly sensitive lighter skin I have had to custom tailor my facial treatment and bump patrol is an great compliment to that.</li>
            <li>My husband has very sensitive skin and has used this product for years.</li>
            <li>The stuff really does work and it only takes a few drops making sure</li>
            <li>bought my first bottle 5 years ago and finally ran out</li>
            <li>After using this stuff for less than a week, I got my sexy back.</li>
            <li>Fortunately it is sold on Amazon because we have had a lot of trouble finding it in stores near our home.</li>
            <li>I am a 21 year old guy who has to shave about three times a week.</li>
            <li>do not think that this can completely eliminate razor bumps</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping it would combat my sensitive &amp;#34;intimate&amp;#34; skin and it reduced my breakouts by tenfold.</li>
            <li>I am a Caucasian man with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Using this product everyday reduces them significantly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works but subtle.</li>
            <li>and I got exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>There is a bit of a \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; smell when first applying, but it goes away in less than a minute.</li>
            <li>there was a positive result noticeable in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>was a little afraid to use it at first, but I am very pleased with this</li>
            <li>usually use it right after washing my face, after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> usually use it right after washing my face, after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing I did not like is that I got an email from the seller asking me to give a positive review... sounded as if they did not want any negative reviews to be made public..</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s normal, give it a few minutes to absorb into your skin.</li>
            <li> Found out, as long as you use it after every shower, it keeps all three conditions from occurring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely feeling confident looking like Shame (see movie A Low Down Dirty Shame) after he cleaned himself up.</li>
            <li> So just make sure you let it dry on your skin and check yourself out on the mirror before heading out to avoid awkward conversations at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> dry skin is a deal breaker for me.</li>
            <li> Now this stuff doesn&#x27;t dry me out</li>
            <li> but it definitely brings them down and reduced redness.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Previously, I used different products but none of them worked.</li>
            <li> I typically race upstairs from the shower while my pores are still open and slather this on.</li>
            <li> It took me years and years of suffering from little bumps I use to get a day after shaving (I did try several brand and kinds)&lt;br</li>
            <li> One problem about this product is that it may leave a little blue film on your skin when you use it.</li>
            <li> Oh and also, it cover of the bottle gets a little gross when the product dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Applying two times daily is recommended if your redness is stubborn (have thick hair prone to curling back into the hair follicle).</li>
            <li> One bottle, even with heavy use, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It is true that is stinks.</li>
            <li> I usually shave every other day but use the stuff daily (with lighter use on off days).</li>
            <li> I shave completely down there</li>
            <li> ; has used down there and on his face as well.  </li>
            <li> The little bumps are almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I admit I was a little hesitant to try Bump Patrol</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does burn very slightly</li>
            <li> I usually apply for 2 days after I shave.  </li>
            <li> I bottle last for up to a month, so it&#x27;s not too expensive.  </li>
            <li> When used with a bump fighter razor, razor bumps are a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li> The one thing I always hated with Tend Skin is it would dry out my skin too much,</li>
            <li> apply a very small amount every few days and it has helped a lot.</li>
            <li> I mean it worked but</li>
            <li> used to put after shave on over the area that I applied the Bump Patrol to, but I noticed that it makes the film look worse, so I would suggest applying after shave, if you use it, below the areas that you applied the bump patrol to.</li>
            <li> I used to DESPISE shaving as it left me irritated with big red nasty bumps and tons of vicious ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> and I put a very small amount on, but it works!</li>
            <li> Those bumps make life a bit uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> If you know its coming its not that bad but no warning it can catch you off guard.</li>
            <li> I have never been a fan of shaving because of the ugly bumps that appear afterwards.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product really works. I noticed the difference with my skin when I stopped using it. It has prevented me from experiencing razor burns and bumps.</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive skin and has used this product for years. Fortunately it is sold on Amazon because we have had a lot of trouble finding it in stores near our home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dealt bumps and razor burn around the neck for years having tried product after product. From blade razors, electric razors, shave creams, aftershaves, and shave techniques-- they all came up short. After buying yet another $80 electric razor and having no different result, I bought a container of Bump Patrol at Target as a last ditch effort. Within two weeks of using Bump Patrol, the redness was gone. The stuff really does work and it only takes a few drops making sure the bottle will last 1-2 months. It smells like rubbing alcohol and it can sometimes burn on application, but you can&#x27;t argue with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a working professional, being clean shaven for every work day is an absolute must. Bump Patrol lets me shave every day or take a break over the weekend and not have to worry about redness no matter how I choose to shave or when. I use Bump Patrol two times a day, once immediately after I shower &amp; shave and second just before going to bed. Applying two times daily is recommended if your redness is stubborn (have thick hair prone to curling back into the hair follicle). After trying so many alternatives, Bump Patrol has earned a permanent spot in my cabinet.</li>
            <li> Helps prevent ingrown hairs and bumps</li>
            <li> I have been satisfied with Bump Patrol for over 10 years. Previously, I used different products but none of them worked. The original works better than the sensitive bump treatment.</li>
            <li> I get ingrown easily on my throat after shaving. Using this product everyday reduces them significantly. I will only get one or two ingrown with it, compared to about 10.</li>
            <li> Best aftershave ever. I had suffered with razor burn, bumps and acne for 28 years. I found this at Target or Wally World or someplace and bought it on a whim. Found out, as long as you use it after every shower, it keeps all three conditions from occurring. I typically race upstairs from the shower while my pores are still open and slather this on. One bottle, even with heavy use, lasts a long time. Hurts Macaulay Culkin-style, but works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> I had not used any bump control in years until this summer I seemed to be having an irritation.  I bought this because of someone else&#x27;s review.  WOW!! It is amazing.  I shave completely down there and after my shower apply this and no bumps. I usually apply for 2 days after I shave.  My fianc&amp;eacute; has used down there and on his face as well.  I will warn you this stuff does sting when it hits the skin first.  If you know its coming its not that bad but no warning it can catch you off guard.</li>
            <li> this stuff works for razor bumps end of story if you shave and are prone to bumps you need this no matter where you shave its soo clutch just buy it worth every penny..&lt;br /&gt;tested&lt;br /&gt;approved!</li>
            <li> The product is decent, but I&#x27;ve found that I perhaps didn&#x27;t need it after all. My head has already gotten used to the razor, so buying was kind of a waste of money. Having said that, I guess people who continue to have problems with razor bumps could benefit from it.</li>
            <li> I have never been a fan of shaving because of the ugly bumps that appear afterwards. Those bumps make life a bit uncomfortable.  Having been using this for a week now, the bumps have shrank and my face is getting cleaner.  I will likely continue to use this product for the foreseeable future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the shipment arrived within a reasonable time frame to save me from my misery!</li>
            <li> I have moderate foliculitus, and bump patrol works pretty good for me.  I bottle last for up to a month, so it&#x27;s not too expensive.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use this on my neck because I get some ingrown hairs there. It has a pretty intense smell, but my neck is much more smooth.</li>
            <li> It took me years and years of suffering from little bumps I use to get a day after shaving (I did try several brand and kinds)&lt;br /&gt;Nothing works as well as what this does.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but not the price.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  It&#x27;s the only one that I found that works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 years now, I always get razor burn when I run out, so I try to keep myself constantly supplied. Amazon has it on here for a decent price! One problem about this product is that it may leave a little blue film on your skin when you use it. So just make sure you let it dry on your skin and check yourself out on the mirror before heading out to avoid awkward conversations at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use it right after washing my face, after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, shave, wash face, use product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use it after a fresh shave it will sting a bit, but that is normal, it also gets kinda sticky too. I have also noticed that if you don&#x27;t wipe off the excess gel from the cap, it will prevent the cap from closing all the way over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like to use it a couple days after a fresh shave. Some of my co-workers can tell when I run out of this product, because when I have it, I have model skin, but when I am out, I look like I am going through my teen acne faze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to put after shave on over the area that I applied the Bump Patrol to, but I noticed that it makes the film look worse, so I would suggest applying after shave, if you use it, below the areas that you applied the bump patrol to. Best Razor Burn treatment ever!</li>
            <li> Great product for men with curly hair and ingrown hair challenges. Great for black men. I can easily recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. bought my first bottle 5 years ago and finally ran out so I thought why not online? keeps my neck from getting razor burned as easily.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders! I don&#x27;t shave without it. Shipment came on time and I got exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Good product, timely delivery</li>
            <li> Goes on easy.  Didn&#x27;t notice the face improvement, but it felt good going on.  I&#x27;m sure it works but subtle.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best bump treatment product I have ever used.  When used with a bump fighter razor, razor bumps are a thing of the past.  I just wish I had discovered this product years ago!</li>
            <li> I am a 21 year old guy who has to shave about three times a week. I used to DESPISE shaving as it left me irritated with big red nasty bumps and tons of vicious ingrown hairs. This product has stopped ALL OF IT! And is so easy to use. Best thing I&#x27;ve ever done for my skin. Try it!!!!</li>
            <li> LADIES, you won&#x27;t believe how well this product works!! Use it everywhere you shave and no uncomfortable razor bumps!!!  Beauticians should also use it after they rip out your eyebrows - suggest you take it with you. :) Ok guys, it works for you as well.</li>
            <li> Brand new bottles! Thanks! Just what my boys use and need at a good price! Will order when we run out!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my husband.  He is extremely pleased, say&#x27;s it really works and would recommend it to anyone who has ingrown hair problems from shaving</li>
            <li> There is NO!!! one stop solution to stave of Razor burn, ingrown hairs, and facial bumps. My brother gave me this product after a product I formerly used ran out. This worked great in conjunction to the system of after shave balm and rubbing alcohol that I use daily on my face. As an African American male with highly sensitive lighter skin I have had to custom tailor my facial treatment and bump patrol is an great compliment to that.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will be ordering more! I think its much better than traveling to Wal-mart all the time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who has alot of shave bumps. there was a positive result noticeable in less than 2 weeks. We are really happy with this</li>
            <li> My neck used to look like the bottom of a Nestle crunch candy bar. After using this stuff for less than a week, I got my sexy back.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help much after a Brazilian wax. No improvement in redness from prior ingrowen hairs either . Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Recently, more than ever for what reason I have no idea, I have been getting razor bumps on my bikini line. And no one likes that.&lt;br /&gt;So I found this and have used it multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little afraid to use it at first, but I am very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;It does burn very slightly and I put a very small amount on, but it works! The little bumps are almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;I do not think that this can completely eliminate razor bumps but it definitely brings them down and reduced redness.&lt;br /&gt;I apply a very small amount every few days and it has helped a lot. I haven&#x27;t had one ingrown hair since I&#x27;ve been using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I also have made sure to completely follow instructions and I am happy I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Works well.&lt;br /&gt;Strong odor.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well and you don&#x27;t need alot</li>
            <li> Well, all they say about it is true:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It is true that is works. I waited about two weeks before posting.. just to make sure. applied right after shaving, it keep the skin nice and deals with the burns.&lt;br /&gt;- It is true that is stinks. I really don&#x27;t like it smells.. but smells does not last long.&lt;br /&gt;- SO choose your battles wisely: Smell Vs efficiency :) hahah&lt;br /&gt;- The only thing I did not like is that I got an email from the seller asking me to give a positive review... sounded as if they did not want any negative reviews to be made public.. did not like that AT ALL! Oh and also, it cover of the bottle gets a little gross when the product dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But yes, good product!</li>
            <li> Best razor bump prevention shaving product out there.</li>
            <li> As the title indicates I use to use Tend Skin after a homegirl recommended it for me for my face years ago. The one thing I always hated with Tend Skin is it would dry out my skin too much, I mean it worked but dry skin is a deal breaker for me. I admit I was a little hesitant to try Bump Patrol but since I started shaving my head I figured why not try it out, after all it&#x27;s designed for my needs. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff. I usually shave every other day but use the stuff daily (with lighter use on off days). One thing I will say is give the stuff some time. When you first apply it you might notice the place where applied feels a bit filmy (not sure how to describe it). That&#x27;s normal, give it a few minutes to absorb into your skin. Now this stuff doesn&#x27;t dry me out so I don&#x27;t need a whole lot of moisturizer afterwards, sometimes I don&#x27;t use it all after applying bump patrol. I&#x27;m definitely feeling confident looking like Shame (see movie A Low Down Dirty Shame) after he cleaned himself up. Bald and smooth, not raw and bumpy...that&#x27;s what makes the ladies dance (lol).</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would combat my sensitive &amp;#34;intimate&amp;#34; skin and it reduced my breakouts by tenfold. It&#x27;s a good investment, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am a Caucasian man with sensitive skin. I have searched around for something to help prevent ingrown hairs, with no luck till I found this stuff! I apply this after a shave and no longer get ingrown hairs. There is a bit of a \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; smell when first applying, but it goes away in less than a minute.</li>
