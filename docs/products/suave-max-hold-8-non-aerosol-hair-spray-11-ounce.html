            <li>Wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say this is the best spray in the market</li>
            <li>The best price for a good size bottle.</li>
            <li>This product is great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great value and holds your style.</li>
            <li>Product is great for my hair, yet leaves a filmy residue on my bathroom countertops.  </li>
            <li>The best thing about this hair spray is that it does not have an overpowering scent, it&#x27;s a very nice light scent.</li>
            <li>It holds my hair for a good 6 - 8 hours without issue.</li>
            <li>plus, the price is good).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li>so I need a good hold.</li>
            <li>I used to use this exclusively as a substitute for gel and it worked good for the price.</li>
            <li>Good hairspray for the money.</li>
            <li>Suave meets those criteria, and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It has a LOT of spray for a nice price.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a strong, odorless product, this is a good one (</li>
            <li>Excellent product with a more than reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Many of the hair sprays</li>
            <li>Also get via Subscribe and Save so never run out and get a better price than Walmart.</li>
            <li>It sure does it&#x27;s job</li>
            <li>and I love how cheap it was!</li>
            <li>Once I finish this product, I believe I will be moving to more of a gel-like substance.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I look for price, but I also want something that&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t have an odor, and will hold most of the day.</li>
            <li>This spray really does a good job at holding you hair.  </li>
            <li>It also brushes out easy.</li>
            <li>but I can say as far as a pump hair spray is concerned, this is a good one.</li>
            <li>I will be throwing this almost full bottle out.</li>
            <li>Always liked this hair spray, now get it on my favorite place to shop ( amazon ) and one less purchase from Wal-mart.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as good as any other product and the cost makes it a no-brainer.  </li>
            <li>I have used many different hairsprays, and I will often choose Suave.</li>
            <li>and you certainly don&#x27;t want your significant other touching your hair.</li>
            <li>This hairspray is clumpy and very sticky.</li>
            <li>This product gives decent hold, but VERY Flaky and sticky.</li>
            <li>I have been using the older version of this for years.</li>
            <li>Really keeps my hair in place and looks natural.</li>
            <li>It looks like I have major dandruff where I&#x27;ve sprayed.</li>
            <li>This is one of the few that holds my fine hair in place without that heavy perfume smells.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is great.  The best price for a good size bottle. I like the smell and my husband uses it also.  I do recommend suave as I have used this product for years.</li>
            <li> I have used many different hairsprays, and I will often choose Suave. I look for price, but I also want something that&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t have an odor, and will hold most of the day. Suave meets those criteria, and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this hair spray is that it does not have an overpowering scent, it&#x27;s a very nice light scent. It&#x27;s also a great value and holds your style. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I like this hairspray because it works. It holds all day and you can control the spray. It does not over-spray all around your room and leave a coating on your floor.</li>
            <li> Works well without any flakes or white debris.  It holds my hair for a good 6 - 8 hours without issue.</li>
            <li> This is serious hairspray when you need your hair to just stay where you put it and be done with it. With one pass I know my thick hair will not come undone in wind or while riding horses or on a breezy beach. On a regular day I can spray it and not have to touch up again all day. My one star deduction is because the strength of the hold in the Suave Max Hold means you can&#x27;t run a brush through your hair after you spray it and you certainly don&#x27;t want your significant other touching your hair. It&#x27;s like feeling a shellac helmet.</li>
            <li> Always liked this hair spray, now get it on my favorite place to shop ( amazon ) and one less purchase from Wal-mart.</li>
            <li> Many of the hair sprays w/max hold have a smell that lingers...not this. Also get via Subscribe and Save so never run out and get a better price than Walmart.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hairspray, but I do prefer the non aerosol packaging! It sure does it&#x27;s job and I love how cheap it was!</li>
            <li> I have nothing really bad to say about this product. It holds well (although if you overdo it your hair will get hard), and has no real distinct smell. If you are looking for a strong, odorless product, this is a good one (plus, the price is good).</li>
            <li> I have used this hair spray for a long time.  Have tried others but they do not work as well.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Really keeps my hair in place and looks natural.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this is the best spray in the market but I can say as far as a pump hair spray is concerned, this is a good one. Keeps the hair in place. No issues. No stickiness. It&#x27;s a good buy. No cons for me.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few that holds my fine hair in place without that heavy perfume smells. It was cheaper that local unless you like running around and happen to catch it on sale.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and a lot of short hairs around my face so I need a good hold. This product gives decent hold, but VERY Flaky and sticky. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks. It looks like I have major dandruff where I&#x27;ve sprayed. Plus, I&#x27;ve noticed the short hairs around my face have started to fall out! I&#x27;ve been using non-aerosol hairspray for 15 years and this has never happened. I will be throwing this almost full bottle out.</li>
            <li> Product is great for my hair, yet leaves a filmy residue on my bathroom countertops.  Once I finish this product, I believe I will be moving to more of a gel-like substance.</li>
            <li> This spray really does a good job at holding you hair.  It dose not leave any smell. It has a LOT of spray for a nice price.  It also brushes out easy. I def will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now on my long, curly hair. I used to use this exclusively as a substitute for gel and it worked good for the price.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is clumpy and very sticky. Your hair feels the same way after using this spray.&lt;br /&gt;I bought two bottles and both have the same effect.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this product again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good as any other product and the cost makes it a no-brainer.  Excellent product with a more than reasonable price.  This is what I&#x27;ll be ordering from now on.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in the stores so I found it here. I love it. I have been using the older version of this for years. This holds my hair well. It doesn&#x27;t have any irritating smell to it. Will repurchase it.</li>
            <li> Good hairspray for the money.</li>
