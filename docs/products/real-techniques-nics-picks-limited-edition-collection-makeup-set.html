            <li>I love Real Techniques brushes, and I recommend them to everyone I know.</li>
            <li>I really like duofiber brushes for light application.  </li>
            <li>I could tell the difference right away when applying the eye shadow with this brush.</li>
            <li>first thought when I got these brushes that I would try them out and maybe give them to my niece as a gift.</li>

            <li> I really like this set, especially the brow brush, but the powder brush is useless.</li>

            <li> I am a brush junkie. I really like duofiber brushes for light application.  I have a heavy hand sometimes.  My favorite in this set is the angled shadow brush.  It&#x27;s good for blending.</li>
            <li> I recieved a pink set instead of the silver one&lt;br /&gt;Knowing that no option was there to choose from&lt;br /&gt;I was disapponted to recieve a color which dosnt resembel the display pucture and im wondering wether its genuion or not</li>
            <li> I really like this set, especially the brow brush, but the powder brush is useless. If you are buying with emphasis on the powder brush, I would go with a different set. If you need a basic variety of eye brushes, then it is great, with a bonus nice blush brush.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. I have had real techniques brushes before and liked them but these just feel cheap.</li>
            <li> Love this brush set! Would definitely recommend!</li>

            <li> My daughter had these on her wish list. They were sold out everywhere else I looked. Was glad to find them here, and at a great price. She adores these makeup brushes.</li>

I thought it was time to call on my niece who happens to be a cosmetologist. I needed to get some pointers on how to use these awesome brushes and keep them nice. She was happy to show me her expertise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing we noticed was how beautifully made they were. They are of good quality and very chic.

It is designed to fit the crease of the eye and add depth. I could tell the difference right away when applying the eye shadow with this brush. The dense bristles helped blend color. The eyeliner brush (also an exclusive) is softly angled for just the right applications too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first thought when I got these brushes that I would try them out and maybe give them to my niece as a gift.
