            <li>Very nice and works well.</li>
            <li>Would benefit from more detail in a user guide, but otherwise excellent product.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this device.</li>
            <li>It amazingly helps with pain relieve.</li>
            <li>This product is good and does help in my neck pain for sure.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want that kind of unit and instead purchased the Comfortrac Cervical Traction Unit.</li>
            <li>but  I would not spend this kind of money on a device like this again</li>
            <li>Nice design for home traction unit and effective.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and comes in a very handy duffel bag for easy transportation and storage.</li>
            <li>My neck always feels much better after a traction treatment and the traction is keeping me from having to receive more invasive procedures.</li>
            <li>I chose between this product and another almost identical product, that was $100.00 more.  </li>
            <li>It is very well made and gives great graduated traction of the cervical spine.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the &amp;#34;hang over the door&amp;#34; type.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Pleased with purchase</li>
            <li>use this unit more then a month now 2 times a day 15 min each time</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>BUT that said, the unit was easy to set up and use.</li>
            <li>well worth the money and easy to use, comfortable as well.</li>
            <li>Returned for full refund.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I think the cost was worth it.</li>
            <li>i borrowed one of these from my physical therapist a few years ago and was so impressed, I found one for myself to keep after therapy ended.  </li>
            <li>It has helped my neck, however, i went to PT first, when using the hold the neck pull for 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It really helped me!</li>
            <li>What helped the most when I was going to physical therapy was cervical traction.</li>
            <li>Adjustable angles for being able to apply traction to different parts of the neck.  </li>
            <li>Made very well.</li>
            <li>It is very helpful and I use it every day.</li>
            <li>this is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Fast Ship.</li>
            <li>When used under medical supervision, it is effective for decompression and seems safer than traditional &amp;#34;towel pull&amp;#34; method.</li>
            <li>My therapist wanted me to have the same kind of unit that they used but my insurance company would only pay for an &#x27;over-the-door model.</li>
            <li>I feel like I was able to continue my therapy at home for much less cost.</li>
            <li>Similar, but better, than traction units I have used at physical therapy.</li>
            <li>I highly doubt that the more expensive one can do a better job than this one.  </li>
            <li>Unit arrived brand new and came with convenient carry bag.</li>
            <li>First introduced to this product while in physical therapy.</li>
            <li>There is only one thing I can complain about and that is that it isn&#x27;t very smooth when moving up and down.</li>
            <li>Professional quality.</li>
            <li>So far I have no regrets.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for use in conjunction with regular physical therapy sessions.</li>

            <li> I use this every night and my neck pain has decreased significantly.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my physical therapist had me use hers for awhile to see if it would help my neck pain due to a bulging disk.  </li>
            <li> I have used it four times over the past month and so far it seems to be working.  </li>
            <li> This product is as expected . . .</li>
            <li> I want to give this device 5 stars for the quality of traction it provides but am only giving it 4 stars because of the missing manual and the &#x27;mystery pieces.&#x27;</li>
            <li> and he carefully explained and show me how to use it properly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> May take a week or two to get the correct hhead angle usage pattern......important to start at 10 PSI or less.</li>
            <li> Helped me a lot with stiff neck issues.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> am exercising a lot at gym and although i stretch a lot nothing helped to release stiff neck like this device.</li>
            <li> It still has 2 parts which I&#x27;m not sure about their purpose, and they&#x27;re not mentioned in the instruction manual</li>
            <li> No more steroid shots!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have spinal stenosis in my cervical area between C5 and C6 where osteophyte + bulging disk in complex create a nerve compression.</li>
            <li> reason I gave this unit 4 stars but not 5 is it arrived in regular bag that is inconvenient when you travel.</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;formula&amp;#34; which helps me with my condition and slowly improve it day by day.</li>
            <li> The portion that holds your neck is too shallow.</li>
            <li> Now I am trying to find a bag on wheels to take my traction machine with me when travel and I can&#x27;t so have to pack it in regular suitcase:(</li>
            <li> it provides proper traction to the neck without resorting to stupid tricks that hurt the jaw, etc.  </li>
            <li> &gt; Expensive, but if it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Needless to say that as soon as I get it</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Was painful to use as it applied pressure at the bottom of my neck and between my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> throw away all those awful inflatable neck balloon pillows and hangman-like door pulleys.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First introduced to this product while in physical therapy. When used under medical supervision, it is effective for decompression and seems safer than traditional &amp;#34;towel pull&amp;#34; method. Unit arrived brand new and came with convenient carry bag. Highly recommended for use in conjunction with regular physical therapy sessions.</li>
            <li> this is a great machine, does what it suppose to do.  Made very well. It has helped my neck, however, i went to PT first, when using the hold the neck pull for 20 minutes.  DO NOT RELEASE IT. When you pull &amp; resease it does not help your neck, Bring it to a Dr. before using, so you can use it correctly.</li>
            <li> I use this every night and my neck pain has decreased significantly.</li>
            <li> Similar, but better, than traction units I have used at physical therapy.</li>
            <li> This product is as expected . . . wonderful! It has helped in the rehabilitation of my neck. I am very satisfied with this device. Thank you, Jason</li>
            <li> My physical therapist recommended that I use a cervical traction home unit. It really helped me! I feel like I was able to continue my therapy at home for much less cost. Therefore, I think the cost was worth it.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped timely.  I have used it four times over the past month and so far it seems to be working.  Easy to use.  If it continues to keep me happy I will raise my review to five stars.</li>
            <li> This product was selling cheaper on the sellers&#x27; website than Amazon and they did not adjust the price for me.  This product is good and does help in my neck pain for sure.</li>
            <li> May take a week or two to get the correct hhead angle usage pattern......important to start at 10 PSI or less.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my physical therapist had me use hers for awhile to see if it would help my neck pain due to a bulging disk.  I had been getting some decompression from my chiropractor and decided that this would be cheaper and I wouldn&#x27;t have to drive 20 miles to do it. It is very helpful and I use it every day. There is only one thing I can complain about and that is that it isn&#x27;t very smooth when moving up and down.</li>
            <li> Helped me a lot with stiff neck issues.&lt;br /&gt;I am exercising a lot at gym and although i stretch a lot nothing helped to release stiff neck like this device.</li>
            <li> Works well- great tool to support your PT rehab plan at home- well worth the money and easy to use, comfortable as well.</li>
            <li> Very nice and works well.</li>
            <li> I have 2 hierniated discs in my neck and cervical stenosis. What helped the most when I was going to physical therapy was cervical traction. My therapist wanted me to have the same kind of unit that they used but my insurance company would only pay for an &#x27;over-the-door model.&#x27; I didn&#x27;t want that kind of unit and instead purchased the Comfortrac Cervical Traction Unit. It works every bit as well as the unit at my physical therapist&#x27;s office. My unit did not contain an instruction manuel so I downloaded one from the internet. It still has 2 parts which I&#x27;m not sure about their purpose, and they&#x27;re not mentioned in the instruction manual BUT that said, the unit was easy to set up and use. My neck always feels much better after a traction treatment and the traction is keeping me from having to receive more invasive procedures. I want to give this device 5 stars for the quality of traction it provides but am only giving it 4 stars because of the missing manual and the &#x27;mystery pieces.&#x27; Despite this, the traction unit os definitely a keeper!!!</li>
            <li> Professional quality. Don&#x27;t know what we did before we got this unit.</li>
            <li> I chose between this product and another almost identical product, that was $100.00 more.  I highly doubt that the more expensive one can do a better job than this one.  It is very well made and gives great graduated traction of the cervical spine.  It is very easy to use and comes in a very handy duffel bag for easy transportation and storage.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me.  Was painful to use as it applied pressure at the bottom of my neck and between my shoulders.  Very uncomfortable.  Returned for full refund.</li>
            <li> well made, helps my neck and shoulder pain but  I would not spend this kind of money on a device like this again</li>
            <li> i borrowed one of these from my physical therapist a few years ago and was so impressed, I found one for myself to keep after therapy ended.  this is the real thing.  it provides proper traction to the neck without resorting to stupid tricks that hurt the jaw, etc.  throw away all those awful inflatable neck balloon pillows and hangman-like door pulleys.</li>
            <li> Nice design for home traction unit and effective. Would benefit from more detail in a user guide, but otherwise excellent product. Adjustable angles for being able to apply traction to different parts of the neck.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Much better than the &amp;#34;hang over the door&amp;#34; type.&lt;br /&gt; Expensive, but if it works as advertised. So far I have no regrets. Fast Ship.</li>
            <li> The portion that holds your neck is too shallow.</li>
            <li> Pleased with purchase</li>
            <li> I have spinal stenosis in my cervical area between C5 and C6 where osteophyte + bulging disk in complex create a nerve compression. I bought this unit by recommendation of my physical therapist. Needless to say that as soon as I get it I let him adjust it for me and he carefully explained and show me how to use it properly.&lt;br /&gt;I use this unit more then a month now 2 times a day 15 min each time 20-22 lbs strength as my physical therapist said. It amazingly helps with pain relieve. Besides that I am having massage on weekly basis and every day stretching exercises(30-45min). This is my &amp;#34;formula&amp;#34; which helps me with my condition and slowly improve it day by day. No more steroid shots!!!&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave this unit 4 stars but not 5 is it arrived in regular bag that is inconvenient when you travel. Now I am trying to find a bag on wheels to take my traction machine with me when travel and I can&#x27;t so have to pack it in regular suitcase:(</li>
