            <li>or I should buy that UV light dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The nail polish itself goes really smooth too.</li>
            <li>Even with my discount at the nail supply stores I couldn&#x27;t have received such a great value.  </li>
            <li>The application of the gel was smooth, no lumps.</li>
            <li>The Grape Fit color doesn&#x27;t look like the picture shown here.</li>
            <li>The color was good once I got enough on</li>
            <li>I love this purple gel polish and it&#x27;s staying very shiny and no chips after a week.  </li>
            <li>These new nail products truly last 2 to 3 weeks, looking beautiful until they grow out.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty grape color, a tad lighter than the bottle shows.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s what makes it fun.  </li>
            <li>This color was worth it i guess.</li>
            <li>Its not a dark purple more of a lighter purple.</li>
            <li>I did have it put on by a professional that had the \\&quot;baking oven\\&quot; available.  </li>
            <li>One \\&quot;little\\&quot; thing is that it&#x27;s pretty neon out in the sunlight</li>
            <li>I love the brand, but the color would be a spring Easter color only, for me.</li>
            <li>This is the first color I got and ever tried from OPI&#x27;s gel collection.</li>
            <li>Seems like the color really migrates and i had to flash cure two nails at a time.</li>
            <li>It is very close in color to Sephora&#x27;s &amp;#34;Iris</li>
            <li>It does not have sparkle and is more pink than purple in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Made a very pretty french mani.</li>
            <li>Maybe I had to research about gel color first and maybe its my mistake but in order to use this polish, you HAVE TO have that UV light dryer, otherwise this polish can&#x27;t be dried</li>
            <li>Also typical wear time for gel, 2 weeks easy.  </li>
            <li>&amp; it is currently the only one that cures under an LED light, making it super fast to cure the color to a hard, wearable surface.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it for 7 days so far and zero chips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more OPI gel polish including the OPI top and base coat.</li>
            <li>I used Gelish Top and Base coat, the OPI gel polish cured just fine.</li>

            <li> I love this color.  Makes me think of summer flowers.  Lot&#x27;s of compliments. Can&#x27;t ever go wrong with OPI gel polish.  Application is smooth and even.</li>
            <li> i love this purple it is a cream. Its not a dark purple more of a lighter purple. Application is perfect no shrinking</li>
            <li> The polish didn&#x27;t go on well. It was thin and ran on my nail. Very difficult to use.  The color was good once I got enough on but then it was too thick.</li>
            <li> Maybe I had to research about gel color first and maybe its my mistake but in order to use this polish, you HAVE TO have that UV light dryer, otherwise this polish can&#x27;t be dried and it will become a real mess.... I dont know if I should just give up this poish or I should buy that UV light dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word: If you dont have the dryer then this wont work!!!!!! It will never get dry unless you use the uv light dryer!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Runny and the plastic cover to the lids comes off every time you try to open in unlike the others.. Not sure if its the real thing.</li>
            <li> I love this purple gel polish and it&#x27;s staying very shiny and no chips after a week.  I did have it put on by a professional that had the \\&quot;baking oven\\&quot; available.  She also had the matching regular nail polish for my toes (not gel nail color like this is).  I&#x27;m not sure if the name of the regular polish was \\&quot;Grape Fit\\&quot; also or not.  Will have to check that out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OPI is awesome for making matching colors for the toes!  One \\&quot;little\\&quot; thing is that it&#x27;s pretty neon out in the sunlight but that&#x27;s what makes it fun.  I&#x27;ve had several compliments on it when seen by girlfriends in restaurant lighting where it&#x27;s shiny but not neon!</li>
            <li> Be sure to tap the plus signs to get the full info.  Then, if you still don&#x27;t fully understand what&#x27;s being said, hop over to manufacturer&#x27;s website, where they proudly explain in more detail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t diss an excellent product for being exactly what it is supposed to be.  OPI is, to my mind, the very best of the new gel nail colors.  These new nail products truly last 2 to 3 weeks, looking beautiful until they grow out.  OPI wears the best for me.  I like its colors best.  &amp; it is currently the only one that cures under an LED light, making it super fast to cure the color to a hard, wearable surface.  If you aren&#x27;t familiar with this sort of nail color (NOT nail polish), there are many, many nail salons who do gel nails.  Call around.  Ask for someone who uses OPI colorgel for this process.  They&#x27;ll have samples of all the colors, &amp; you&#x27;ll see how different the process is from nail polish.  Once you see how it&#x27;s done, you can decide if you want to invest in trying it on your own.  I love it.  But traditional nail polish it ain&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful shade of purple. Perfect for spring or summer. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for 7 days so far and zero chips.</li>
            <li> OPI makes a really great gel color and this is no exception. Great consistency, great coverage. I would not call this color grape, though. It&#x27;s an easter-egg purple that seems to have a lot of blue undertones, versus pink (that I was hoping for).  A great color, just not for someone with fair skin, in my opinion.  Would probably look great on someone that is tan or has olive skin tone.</li>
            <li> I have received so many compliments on this color!  It is the perfect grape color but is not too bright.  I have normally used Gelish, but I have to say OPI is superior, I just wish there were more color choices.</li>
            <li> I really love this color, it&#x27;s a bit lighter than shown on the picture. The nail polish itself goes really smooth too.</li>
            <li> I have lots of gelish colors but this is my only opi gel. Lots of pooling at the sides and very difficult to cap the free edge.  Seems like the color really migrates and i had to flash cure two nails at a time. Very pretty grape color, a tad lighter than the bottle shows. Also typical wear time for gel, 2 weeks easy.  Will stick with gelish unless i really love an opi color. This color was worth it i guess. Made a very pretty french mani.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite color purple and it came as pictured. Color is a little darker than pictured. I will order again</li>
            <li> Color is a bit too &amp;#34;barbie&amp;#34; for me.  It is very close in color to Sephora&#x27;s &amp;#34;Iris I were thinner&amp;#34;.  It does not have sparkle and is more pink than purple in my opinion. I love the brand, but the color would be a spring Easter color only, for me.</li>
            <li> I love this gel polish by OPI!!! This is the first color I got and ever tried from OPI&#x27;s gel collection. I&#x27;m a Nail Tech and the price of this product was great!  Even with my discount at the nail supply stores I couldn&#x27;t have received such a great value.  The application of the gel was smooth, no lumps. I used Gelish Top and Base coat, the OPI gel polish cured just fine. I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more OPI gel polish including the OPI top and base coat. The Grape Fit color doesn&#x27;t look like the picture shown here. The color is a little darker.  My clients loved this color too!! GelColor by OPI last up to 14 days, no chipping , no peeling. I do dishes, change diapers, wash my dog and gel polish still looks shiney !!!</li>
            <li> This color is very versatile and looks good in every occasion. I don&#x27;t get tired of it and do not have to worry about it not complementing my wardrobe. It is also nice with all seasons.</li>
