            <li>If the handle was 6 inches longer, this would be perfect.  </li>

            <li>Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>for now I&#x27;m very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right length and has the perfect contour.  </li>
            <li>They all love them and they were very nice.  </li>
            <li>It was wonderful to be able to scrub my back without having to strain it was perfect</li>
            <li>This was exactly as advertised, in a nice color to match our shower, and best of all, arrived just TWO DAYS after I placed my order!&lt;br</li>
            <li>great price and light weight.</li>
            <li>The color is nice, also.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not the kind of guy who needs something fancy or designer made.</li>
            <li>I would give this brush more stars, because it is a good brush, but it does not have the massage nubs shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>this is nice, it&#x27;s inexpensive</li>
            <li>The handle is nice</li>
            <li>There is nothing spectacular about it.  </li>
            <li>Its effective and does what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li>It holds up quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>It works, nice price.</li>
            <li>great basic bath brush buts needs about 1 or two more inches in length to be perfect.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and great price.</li>
            <li>Works fine, feels good...</li>
            <li>Fortunately, that&#x27;s good for me.</li>
            <li>Good for exfoliation, a good value, and exactly the size/measurements advertised.</li>
            <li>It is a great value - durable and comes in pretty colors.</li>
            <li>The grip is surprisingly good if you have soap on your hand, too -- you have to squeeze a bit, but given the price, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>have very fair and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Bought it about 6 months or more ago, Buy it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but it&#x27;s not a home-run.</li>
            <li>A bit more pricey than buying at Walmart</li>
            <li>let&#x27;s just say my kids love when I have to apologize to them.</li>
            <li>I needed a back scrubber, and this is perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect to wash your back.</li>
            <li>I should have known better but thought it might be okay</li>
            <li>Satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I think the material could have been much, much better.</li>
            <li>really Love this brush.</li>
            <li>Too many of these third-party sellers use shipping costs as a way of gouging customers.</li>
            <li>I am 100% pleased with this brush.</li>
            <li>Husband very happy with this item...wished the string hadn&#x27;t unraveled, next time will burn the end to prevent that.</li>
            <li>They love it.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered/bought so many.</li>
            <li>I may use it as a non-metallic BBQ grill brush  :)</li>
            <li>I would love another one at no cost, as perhaps the one I had was a faulty product.</li>
            <li>A couple more inches in length</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I imagine you could put some kind of tape on the grip, if you really weren&#x27;t able to hang onto it, but I haven&#x27;t found that to be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it will also break easily, and not that it matters</li>
            <li>This an easy to use brush.  </li>
            <li>Bought this so that I could clean the top of my feet and in between the toes.</li>
            <li>but the product works perfectly and it kind of makes me laugh to see my pink brush hanging in my marble shower!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for the price.</li>
            <li>Fine for what it does, but</li>
            <li>Built fine, doesn&#x27;t feel like it will break any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush part is fine.</li>
            <li>The plastic is in good condition and as of this review, the bristles clean, white color is still nice.</li>
            <li>Also the shipping for this was quick!</li>
            <li>and I think I have to get some more for quick for gifts</li>
            <li>Super satisfied</li>
            <li>great for the price, but a little softer would have been nice,</li>
            <li>Almost too soft for some scrubbing, but perfect for a child&#x27;s soft skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Specifically this is a plastic product and thus seems rather cheap in construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great back scrubber brush.</li>
            <li>It feels cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Maybe because the wood was really cheap however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also the handle was so smooth and slippery that once you got soap on it you could not hold onto the brush.</li>
            <li>Cheap, Made in China feel.</li>
            <li>Great for ur back.</li>
            <li>Price is as cheap as the product itself.</li>
            <li>Not as smooth feeling as I anticipated it would be.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for washing your back.  </li>
            <li>It feels real nice to be able to scrub your whole back.  </li>
            <li>The brush is easy for me to hold and use, and it rinses off and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>Priced economically, sturdy and functional!</li>
            <li>I am using it to clean the tires of my car.</li>
            <li>It may take a couple of times to clean up the feet</li>
            <li>detest of those bath brushes seem scrub brushes for clean the floor.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>more so i didnt have to stretch my armpit so much.</li>
            <li>you get what you pay for holds true.</li>
            <li>good for scrubbing back and wont come apart.</li>
            <li>and this one looked the most promising.</li>
            <li>Brush is not bad.</li>
            <li>Bristles are not harsh/stiff - rather just right for light scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li>kind of a cheap overall feel to it.</li>
            <li>This was a lucky find.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll soak it in a mild bleach solution?  </li>
            <li>I love the long handle and it&#x27;s easy to grip!</li>
            <li>colors are bright, I think the handle is plenty long.</li>
            <li>This brush is exactly what I wanted/expected it to be!  </li>
            <li>Purchased for arthritic elderly Mother, the design was easy for her to handle, color was complimentary and restored her ability to be more self sufficient in personal care.  </li>
            <li>Great little brush.</li>
            <li>So I REALLY appreciated the free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Bristles are rough but works good and feels amazing when your back itches</li>
            <li>but well worth the difference for the longer handle.</li>
            <li>just buy another one of these when they break as they are worth it.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice back</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>For the price the item is worth it.</li>
            <li>Nice back scrubber with softer bristles</li>
            <li>i liked them but they dont last.</li>
            <li>This scrubber doesn&#x27;t have as many bristles as my old one plus, it&#x27;s softer.  </li>
            <li>I liked the Back Scrub Brush very much.  </li>
            <li>Price was right and</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just right for me</li>
            <li>Mine broke right away.</li>
            <li>The handle on this is just the right length and the bristles are just the right toughness.  </li>
            <li>Durable product and the bristles feel just right.  </li>
            <li>The size and softness of the bristles are just right for me.</li>
            <li>The length of the handle is just about right.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited they shipped me my favorite color, blue, then when I went to use the product for the first time it snapped in the shower...</li>
            <li>The handle is nice and long, Seems to be sturdy..</li>
            <li>It has really been helping with my mild back-ne.</li>
            <li>The product arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>I love this brush and would highly recommend it to anyone at Amazon.com who obviously knows where to buy great stuff for less.  </li>
            <li>When I began to use it every day I saw a huge improvement in the skin on my back - it&#x27;s a bit more radiant and clear</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it should and is well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for feet, but it scratches my back rather than scrubs it.</li>
            <li>I really love this back scrubber.  </li>
            <li>Seems ok on legs but find it a bit scratchy to use on my back.</li>
            <li>got my back scrubber some weeks ago, love it</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Hey, it&#x27;s an inexpensive back scrubber, what more do you want, racing stripes?  </li>
            <li>Next time I will pay more and get a higher quality brush.</li>
            <li>I was going to give this product fewer stars, but it was exactly what was described in the product description.</li>
            <li>I had a similar brush for many years.  </li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t take off the first layer of skin either.</li>
            <li>the \\&quot;hook\\&quot; on the end of the handle keeps it from slipping out of your hand, which is nice.</li>
            <li>and she really loves it!</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Exactly like the one I purchased from target for $1.99.  </li>
            <li>Just like a review that i read from another guy who liked the scrubber, but ended up getting the pink one.  </li>
            <li>It is always hard to scrub my back in the shower and this is so wonderful and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>fun color, decent quality.  </li>
            <li>Good brush as described especially at the low price.  </li>
            <li>The random color I received was the light blue, which perfectly matched my bathroom!</li>
            <li>The rope broke apart pretty much immediately</li>
            <li>The brush is also much too soft to clean your skin.  </li>
            <li>It feels like it&#x27;ll last a good long time.</li>
            <li>but it is just fine for cleaning one&#x27;s back or even scratching.</li>
            <li>Overall I think this brush will serve it&#x27;s purpose just fine.</li>
            <li>Would be nice to have a brush like this a little longer with stiffer bristles.</li>
            <li>For $5 I didn&#x27;t expect much, and I didn&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li>I paid way to much for this scrub brush.</li>
            <li>It really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>This brush is very scratchy.  </li>
            <li>Just be prepared for a very bracing experience.</li>
            <li>For the price it is really replaceable.</li>
            <li>I really like it and have had it for about a year and no mold, no discoloration, no breakage.</li>
            <li>Smooth on the back.</li>
            <li>A cheap back scrubber.  </li>
            <li>this might be a bit much.  </li>
            <li>The handle was slippery; it really needed a gripper handle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap back scrubber, the price is right, but what I don&#x27;t like is that the bristles are sparse and spaced too far apart for what I like.  </li>
            <li>Nice weight and long handled back scrubber.</li>
            <li>Would have liked if they came in different colors, arrived all the same (clear) color.</li>
            <li>However, it is a good length, has a nice brush on the end that is not too soft or too hard and is very usefull in cleaning areas hard to reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it was a decent price.</li>
            <li>Only upset that I didn&#x27;t get to choose my own color (I got pink).</li>
            <li>This brush has great firmness without being too stiff and rough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s waterproof, high definition, 3D, and wireless.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this brush to others.</li>
            <li>Maybe once I use it more it will soften up a little</li>
            <li>Love it wish the brush was a little bit  longer</li>
            <li>Medium brush that isn&#x27;t too rough but not annoyingly soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Spend a few more dollars and get the Swissco scrubber.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s long enough for most people</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking the wooden natural ones are built to last better than this Plasticrap.</li>
            <li>good stiff brush, which is fine, in general, but a bit too stiff for the face.  </li>
            <li>bristles not hard enough;better suited for a woman.</li>
            <li>Its works fine and after using it twice on one foot can tell the difference from the other non scrubbed foot.</li>
            <li>If I had it to do over again, I would have waited and then bought the one that I found at Big Lots yesterday for less and could have picked my own color.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are nice a little stiff at first but if run under hot water they soften temporarily.</li>
            <li>you must reach higher than normal, bend in ways you&#x27;ve only seen in movies.</li>
            <li>No back massager, is definitely not the one that they have pictured on Amazon, Cheap plastic handle.</li>
            <li>Got sent a very different and cheap back brush.</li>
            <li>Brush is too soft to be useful as a back scrubber --guess</li>
            <li>handle too short and not curved enough to be comfortable</li>
            <li>It is a little to stiff and scratchy for my taste, great for the price.</li>
            <li>brush is very soft and is a pleasure to take a shower with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I got a clear one, so I guess it goes with everything!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure what more you can say about this product.</li>
            <li>The brush I received was exactly the same as the one described and pictured here.</li>
            <li>Works so well at removing dead skin cells, also a lovely back scratcher hahaha.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product through the Global Depot vendor, and I received a moderately hard bristle brush that was densely packed, which worked comfortable with liquid soap.</li>
            <li>I am still getting used to the rough bristles, but they are softening quickly.  </li>
            <li>these ones are firm and strong.</li>
            <li>I have not found any other brush that comes close to being as use full as this brush is for cleaning in the shower.</li>
            <li>It has a nice long reach can get the center of my back with no problem.</li>
            <li>Its too short and kind of hard to hold.</li>
            <li>The bristles are just right for me - soft enough to lather up well and be gentle on my skin, and stiff enough to provide a mildly invigorating scrub.</li>
            <li>O l gets 4 Stars because we received 2 clear colored brushes.</li>
            <li>Wish you could pick the color - we received clear -</li>
            <li>this brush works well, only weakness is in handle that tends to break if you apply too much pressure over time - weeks or months.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bristles are soft, yet also give a bit of a scrub (w/o taking off your skin!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re not all soft and smooshy like a doll hair brush</li>
            <li>Soft.</li>
            <li>The acrylic stem is also much thinner and with a larger angle of bend that</li>
            <li>Bristles were svery soft and not at the &amp;#34;back scrubber&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; brush stated in the description.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not for someone looking for a soft brush.</li>
            <li>Hopefully will last longer than the wood one that cost 3x as much but fell apart.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying a replica of my old one at Walgreens.</li>
            <li>the bristles are just a tad bit too soft.</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft but sufficient to do the job.  </li>
            <li>It also cleared her back up right away as she had a bit of back acne.</li>
            <li>it scrubs and massages, plus gives me a clean, new feeling I don&#x27;t get from other brushes because THEY DON&#x27;T LAST!!!  </li>
            <li>Not hot or lobster red like most brushed</li>
            <li>The one I got has a good enough brush, but I&#x27;d have to be a very small, and flexible, person to use it on my back.</li>
            <li>I am a senior who has trouble bending over to clean my feet in the shower and diabetic</li>
            <li>This brush is exactly what I needed to reach my back and feet without further twisting of my arthritic joints.</li>
            <li>Great for scrubbing your feet from a comfortable, rough and painful on the skin of one&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li>I would recommend spending a little more money if you are looking for a brush to use regularly on your back.</li>
            <li>I also wish that both sides of the handle had finger ridges as once the smooth plastic gets soapy it also gets slick.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>handle certainly too short to reach back areas.</li>
            <li>after I had this for a couple of weeks, I found the exact same back brush at the local dollar store, for $1.</li>
            <li>assorted colors, reasonable price and long lasting soft bristles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but handle curves (so not as long a reach as expected), and found EXACT same brushes for less at my local supermarket.</li>
            <li>Nice firm bristles that won&#x27;t break down too quickly, but are soft enough when wet.&lt;br /&gt;Not especially long, could be a inch or two longer, but is long enough.  </li>
            <li>Too stiff (ouch), too soft (irratating), but this one is just right for me.</li>
            <li>The brush is just the right size, and the bristles are tight together</li>
            <li>Mine is a clear blue.</li>
            <li>I ordered two and got one blue and one clear.  </li>
            <li>The picture showed the back of the brush having some massaging nubs but mine was smooth - not entirely truthful, but not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>it left my skin soft</li>
            <li>Shorter than expected and very flimsy, I would not purchase again</li>
            <li>The brush is too soft on this and the handle is way too short.</li>
            <li>Bristles feel soft on hands, but rather scratchy on back.  </li>
            <li>Nothing fancy, medium size, not too hard but strong enough to hurt your face if you try to scrub it.</li>
            <li>wish the bristles were a little more firm and the handle was just a tad</li>
            <li>I would have been fine with a blue or green one, but of course i get the pink one.  </li>
            <li>It works but the handle is not long enough.</li>
            <li>The handle on the brush was not long enough.  </li>
            <li>What I received this time was a soft bristle brush that is loosely packed, which causes the liquid soap to drip somewhat.</li>

            <li> Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> for now I&#x27;m very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right length and has the perfect contour.  </li>
            <li> They all love them and they were very nice.  </li>
            <li> It was wonderful to be able to scrub my back without having to strain it was perfect</li>
            <li> This was exactly as advertised, in a nice color to match our shower, and best of all, arrived just TWO DAYS after I placed my order!&lt;br</li>
            <li> great price and light weight.</li>
            <li> The color is nice, also.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not the kind of guy who needs something fancy or designer made.</li>
            <li> I would give this brush more stars, because it is a good brush, but it does not have the massage nubs shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> this is nice, it&#x27;s inexpensive</li>
            <li> The handle is nice</li>
            <li> There is nothing spectacular about it.  </li>
            <li> Its effective and does what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> It holds up quite nicely.  </li>
            <li> It works, nice price.</li>
            <li> great basic bath brush buts needs about 1 or two more inches in length to be perfect.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and great price.</li>
            <li> Works fine, feels good...</li>
            <li> Fortunately, that&#x27;s good for me.</li>
            <li> Good for exfoliation, a good value, and exactly the size/measurements advertised.</li>
            <li> It is a great value - durable and comes in pretty colors.</li>
            <li> The grip is surprisingly good if you have soap on your hand, too -- you have to squeeze a bit, but given the price, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> have very fair and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Bought it about 6 months or more ago, Buy it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but it&#x27;s not a home-run.</li>
            <li> A bit more pricey than buying at Walmart</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s just say my kids love when I have to apologize to them.</li>
            <li> I needed a back scrubber, and this is perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect to wash your back.</li>
            <li> I should have known better but thought it might be okay</li>
            <li> Satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I think the material could have been much, much better.</li>
            <li> really Love this brush.</li>
            <li> Too many of these third-party sellers use shipping costs as a way of gouging customers.</li>
            <li> I am 100% pleased with this brush.</li>
            <li> Husband very happy with this item...wished the string hadn&#x27;t unraveled, next time will burn the end to prevent that.</li>
            <li> They love it.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered/bought so many.</li>
            <li> I may use it as a non-metallic BBQ grill brush  :)</li>
            <li> I would love another one at no cost, as perhaps the one I had was a faulty product.</li>
            <li> A couple more inches in length</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I imagine you could put some kind of tape on the grip, if you really weren&#x27;t able to hang onto it, but I haven&#x27;t found that to be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it will also break easily, and not that it matters</li>
            <li> This an easy to use brush.  </li>
            <li> Bought this so that I could clean the top of my feet and in between the toes.</li>
            <li> but the product works perfectly and it kind of makes me laugh to see my pink brush hanging in my marble shower!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine for the price.</li>
            <li> Fine for what it does, but</li>
            <li> Built fine, doesn&#x27;t feel like it will break any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush part is fine.</li>
            <li> The plastic is in good condition and as of this review, the bristles clean, white color is still nice.</li>
            <li> Also the shipping for this was quick!</li>
            <li> and I think I have to get some more for quick for gifts</li>
            <li> Super satisfied</li>
            <li> great for the price, but a little softer would have been nice,</li>
            <li> Almost too soft for some scrubbing, but perfect for a child&#x27;s soft skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Specifically this is a plastic product and thus seems rather cheap in construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great back scrubber brush.</li>
            <li> It feels cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Maybe because the wood was really cheap however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also the handle was so smooth and slippery that once you got soap on it you could not hold onto the brush.</li>
            <li> Cheap, Made in China feel.</li>
            <li> Great for ur back.</li>
            <li> Price is as cheap as the product itself.</li>
            <li> Not as smooth feeling as I anticipated it would be.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for washing your back.  </li>
            <li> It feels real nice to be able to scrub your whole back.  </li>
            <li> The brush is easy for me to hold and use, and it rinses off and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> Priced economically, sturdy and functional!</li>
            <li> I am using it to clean the tires of my car.</li>
            <li> It may take a couple of times to clean up the feet</li>
            <li> detest of those bath brushes seem scrub brushes for clean the floor.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> more so i didnt have to stretch my armpit so much.</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for holds true.</li>
            <li> good for scrubbing back and wont come apart.</li>
            <li> and this one looked the most promising.</li>
            <li> Brush is not bad.</li>
            <li> Bristles are not harsh/stiff - rather just right for light scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> kind of a cheap overall feel to it.</li>
            <li> This was a lucky find.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll soak it in a mild bleach solution?  </li>
            <li> I love the long handle and it&#x27;s easy to grip!</li>
            <li> colors are bright, I think the handle is plenty long.</li>
            <li> This brush is exactly what I wanted/expected it to be!  </li>
            <li> Purchased for arthritic elderly Mother, the design was easy for her to handle, color was complimentary and restored her ability to be more self sufficient in personal care.  </li>
            <li> Great little brush.</li>
            <li> So I REALLY appreciated the free shipping.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are rough but works good and feels amazing when your back itches</li>
            <li> but well worth the difference for the longer handle.</li>
            <li> just buy another one of these when they break as they are worth it.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice back</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> For the price the item is worth it.</li>
            <li> Nice back scrubber with softer bristles</li>
            <li> i liked them but they dont last.</li>
            <li> This scrubber doesn&#x27;t have as many bristles as my old one plus, it&#x27;s softer.  </li>
            <li> I liked the Back Scrub Brush very much.  </li>
            <li> Price was right and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just right for me</li>
            <li> Mine broke right away.</li>
            <li> The handle on this is just the right length and the bristles are just the right toughness.  </li>
            <li> Durable product and the bristles feel just right.  </li>
            <li> The size and softness of the bristles are just right for me.</li>
            <li> The length of the handle is just about right.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited they shipped me my favorite color, blue, then when I went to use the product for the first time it snapped in the shower...</li>
            <li> The handle is nice and long, Seems to be sturdy..</li>
            <li> It has really been helping with my mild back-ne.</li>
            <li> The product arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and would highly recommend it to anyone at Amazon.com who obviously knows where to buy great stuff for less.  </li>
            <li> When I began to use it every day I saw a huge improvement in the skin on my back - it&#x27;s a bit more radiant and clear</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it should and is well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for feet, but it scratches my back rather than scrubs it.</li>
            <li> I really love this back scrubber.  </li>
            <li> Seems ok on legs but find it a bit scratchy to use on my back.</li>
            <li> got my back scrubber some weeks ago, love it</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Hey, it&#x27;s an inexpensive back scrubber, what more do you want, racing stripes?  </li>
            <li> Next time I will pay more and get a higher quality brush.</li>
            <li> I was going to give this product fewer stars, but it was exactly what was described in the product description.</li>
            <li> I had a similar brush for many years.  </li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t take off the first layer of skin either.</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;hook\\&quot; on the end of the handle keeps it from slipping out of your hand, which is nice.</li>
            <li> and she really loves it!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> Exactly like the one I purchased from target for $1.99.  </li>
            <li> Just like a review that i read from another guy who liked the scrubber, but ended up getting the pink one.  </li>
            <li> It is always hard to scrub my back in the shower and this is so wonderful and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> fun color, decent quality.  </li>
            <li> Good brush as described especially at the low price.  </li>
            <li> The random color I received was the light blue, which perfectly matched my bathroom!</li>
            <li> The rope broke apart pretty much immediately</li>
            <li> The brush is also much too soft to clean your skin.  </li>
            <li> It feels like it&#x27;ll last a good long time.</li>
            <li> but it is just fine for cleaning one&#x27;s back or even scratching.</li>
            <li> Overall I think this brush will serve it&#x27;s purpose just fine.</li>
            <li> Would be nice to have a brush like this a little longer with stiffer bristles.</li>
            <li> For $5 I didn&#x27;t expect much, and I didn&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> I paid way to much for this scrub brush.</li>
            <li> It really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> This brush is very scratchy.  </li>
            <li> Just be prepared for a very bracing experience.</li>
            <li> For the price it is really replaceable.</li>
            <li> I really like it and have had it for about a year and no mold, no discoloration, no breakage.</li>
            <li> Smooth on the back.</li>
            <li> A cheap back scrubber.  </li>
            <li> this might be a bit much.  </li>
            <li> The handle was slippery; it really needed a gripper handle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap back scrubber, the price is right, but what I don&#x27;t like is that the bristles are sparse and spaced too far apart for what I like.  </li>
            <li> Nice weight and long handled back scrubber.</li>
            <li> Would have liked if they came in different colors, arrived all the same (clear) color.</li>
            <li> However, it is a good length, has a nice brush on the end that is not too soft or too hard and is very usefull in cleaning areas hard to reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it was a decent price.</li>
            <li> Only upset that I didn&#x27;t get to choose my own color (I got pink).</li>
            <li> This brush has great firmness without being too stiff and rough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s waterproof, high definition, 3D, and wireless.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this brush to others.</li>
            <li> Maybe once I use it more it will soften up a little</li>
            <li> Love it wish the brush was a little bit  longer</li>
            <li> Medium brush that isn&#x27;t too rough but not annoyingly soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Spend a few more dollars and get the Swissco scrubber.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s long enough for most people</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking the wooden natural ones are built to last better than this Plasticrap.</li>
            <li> good stiff brush, which is fine, in general, but a bit too stiff for the face.  </li>
            <li> bristles not hard enough;better suited for a woman.</li>
            <li> Its works fine and after using it twice on one foot can tell the difference from the other non scrubbed foot.</li>
            <li> If I had it to do over again, I would have waited and then bought the one that I found at Big Lots yesterday for less and could have picked my own color.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are nice a little stiff at first but if run under hot water they soften temporarily.</li>
            <li> you must reach higher than normal, bend in ways you&#x27;ve only seen in movies.</li>
            <li> No back massager, is definitely not the one that they have pictured on Amazon, Cheap plastic handle.</li>
            <li> Got sent a very different and cheap back brush.</li>
            <li> Brush is too soft to be useful as a back scrubber --guess</li>
            <li> handle too short and not curved enough to be comfortable</li>
            <li> It is a little to stiff and scratchy for my taste, great for the price.</li>
            <li> brush is very soft and is a pleasure to take a shower with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I got a clear one, so I guess it goes with everything!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what more you can say about this product.</li>
            <li> The brush I received was exactly the same as the one described and pictured here.</li>
            <li> Works so well at removing dead skin cells, also a lovely back scratcher hahaha.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product through the Global Depot vendor, and I received a moderately hard bristle brush that was densely packed, which worked comfortable with liquid soap.</li>
            <li> I am still getting used to the rough bristles, but they are softening quickly.  </li>
            <li> these ones are firm and strong.</li>
            <li> I have not found any other brush that comes close to being as use full as this brush is for cleaning in the shower.</li>
            <li> It has a nice long reach can get the center of my back with no problem.</li>
            <li> Its too short and kind of hard to hold.</li>
            <li> The bristles are just right for me - soft enough to lather up well and be gentle on my skin, and stiff enough to provide a mildly invigorating scrub.</li>
            <li> O l gets 4 Stars because we received 2 clear colored brushes.</li>
            <li> Wish you could pick the color - we received clear -</li>
            <li> this brush works well, only weakness is in handle that tends to break if you apply too much pressure over time - weeks or months.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bristles are soft, yet also give a bit of a scrub (w/o taking off your skin!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re not all soft and smooshy like a doll hair brush</li>
            <li> Soft.</li>
            <li> The acrylic stem is also much thinner and with a larger angle of bend that</li>
            <li> Bristles were svery soft and not at the &amp;#34;back scrubber&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; brush stated in the description.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not for someone looking for a soft brush.</li>
            <li> Hopefully will last longer than the wood one that cost 3x as much but fell apart.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a replica of my old one at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> the bristles are just a tad bit too soft.</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft but sufficient to do the job.  </li>
            <li> It also cleared her back up right away as she had a bit of back acne.</li>
            <li> it scrubs and massages, plus gives me a clean, new feeling I don&#x27;t get from other brushes because THEY DON&#x27;T LAST!!!  </li>
            <li> Not hot or lobster red like most brushed</li>
            <li> The one I got has a good enough brush, but I&#x27;d have to be a very small, and flexible, person to use it on my back.</li>
            <li> I am a senior who has trouble bending over to clean my feet in the shower and diabetic</li>
            <li> This brush is exactly what I needed to reach my back and feet without further twisting of my arthritic joints.</li>
            <li> Great for scrubbing your feet from a comfortable, rough and painful on the skin of one&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li> I would recommend spending a little more money if you are looking for a brush to use regularly on your back.</li>
            <li> I also wish that both sides of the handle had finger ridges as once the smooth plastic gets soapy it also gets slick.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> handle certainly too short to reach back areas.</li>
            <li> after I had this for a couple of weeks, I found the exact same back brush at the local dollar store, for $1.</li>
            <li> assorted colors, reasonable price and long lasting soft bristles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but handle curves (so not as long a reach as expected), and found EXACT same brushes for less at my local supermarket.</li>
            <li> Nice firm bristles that won&#x27;t break down too quickly, but are soft enough when wet.&lt;br /&gt;Not especially long, could be a inch or two longer, but is long enough.  </li>
            <li> Too stiff (ouch), too soft (irratating), but this one is just right for me.</li>
            <li> The brush is just the right size, and the bristles are tight together</li>
            <li> Mine is a clear blue.</li>
            <li> I ordered two and got one blue and one clear.  </li>
            <li> The picture showed the back of the brush having some massaging nubs but mine was smooth - not entirely truthful, but not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> it left my skin soft</li>
            <li> Shorter than expected and very flimsy, I would not purchase again</li>
            <li> The brush is too soft on this and the handle is way too short.</li>
            <li> Bristles feel soft on hands, but rather scratchy on back.  </li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, medium size, not too hard but strong enough to hurt your face if you try to scrub it.</li>
            <li> wish the bristles were a little more firm and the handle was just a tad</li>
            <li> I would have been fine with a blue or green one, but of course i get the pink one.  </li>
            <li> It works but the handle is not long enough.</li>
            <li> The handle on the brush was not long enough.  </li>
            <li> What I received this time was a soft bristle brush that is loosely packed, which causes the liquid soap to drip somewhat.</li>
            <li> The brush is a little rough at first</li>
            <li> However I do think that the bristles are a little too rough, so just be aware of that when purchasing.</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy weight brush, long enough for me to scrub my entire back, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> and I use it for every shower, the bristles were kinda hard at first</li>
            <li> Hard brussels at first.</li>
            <li> After he used it for the first time he complained that it hurt to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Handle length seems long enough to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scrubber I received does not have the massager side, it&#x27;s flat.  </li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s long enough, it&#x27;s a scrubbing brush..</li>
            <li> It probably won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The handle is flat, not rounded.</li>
            <li> Not soft enough.</li>
            <li> Supposed to be 14 1/2 inches long was only 13 inches.</li>
            <li> First of all, the bristles are too stiff and rough!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The bristles can be a bit harsh, so if you have very sensitive skin or plan to use it for children</li>
            <li> This brush is 1/5th of the cost of an expensive brush and still works fine.</li>
            <li> Eventually I know the desire to put it into the dishwasher will be too much, and I will find out the hard way if the bristles melt or not....</li>
            <li> Ultimately the low cost is great as I won&#x27;t feel awful if I have to replace it every so often.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s called a &amp;#34;long-handle&amp;#34; bath brush, the handle isn&#x27;t that long.  </li>
            <li> somewhat smaller than expected</li>
            <li> A minor problem, though.</li>
            <li> This was something I needed for a long time.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion the bristles on this brush were too rough to use on human skin.  </li>
            <li> Personally I like the rough feeling</li>
            <li> Gave this rating because the handle is about 2&amp;#34; smaller than I expected as well as the rope to hang it.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t the same as advertised, there were supposed to be two sides one for brushing and the other is to massaging</li>
            <li> which I wish was a little bigger, but I can replace that no big deal.  </li>
            <li> I gets those hard to reach place in the back and the bristles are medium to soft....</li>
            <li> The bristles crushed down, and I just use them now to apply lotion with the back of the brush, to my back.</li>
            <li> They did not hold up to use very long.</li>
            <li> , they started carrying the wooden back brushes that rot within a few months time.</li>
            <li> Who would think that it&#x27;s so difficult to find the right back scrubber.</li>
            <li> The handle is slightly curved and long enough to reach all over.</li>
            <li> not as long as I expected it to be</li>
            <li> , I imagine it&#x27;s all down to personal preference.</li>
            <li> When the bristles wore down, I tried a fancy wooden one and a fancy detachable brush type.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to use those types because I knew I could wash them easily, but they just weren&#x27;t cutting it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could have likely purchased this from a dollar store and paid less.</li>
            <li> bristles are firm &amp; long lasting.  </li>
            <li> The handle broke in half on my second shower.  </li>
            <li> But its a little less soft than I would have preferred.  </li>
            <li> My initial impression is that it is a little &amp;#34;sharper&amp;#34; than medium-soft.  </li>
            <li> it is just a little too short.</li>
            <li> It does feel flimsy at the base of the brush head; but, so far it has held up fine.</li>
            <li> Some say too hard, some say too soft</li>
            <li> Also, not too soft and not too hard.</li>
            <li> Not too hard and not too soft.</li>
            <li> This brush says &amp;#34;long handle&amp;#34; yet I&#x27;m only 5&#x27; 9&amp;#34; and have hard time scrubbing my back.  </li>
            <li> and I got pink</li>
            <li> This item works as expected.</li>
            <li> The pink goes well with my bathroom.</li>
            <li> no really i wish the head was angled in</li>
            <li> I got pink.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still partial to pink.</li>
            <li> Not at all the quality of brush I expected from the descripton.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Way to rough for the skin.  </li>
            <li> It was as firm as I desired, but yet did not scratch or irate my back.</li>
            <li> handle shorter than expected but decided to keep</li>
            <li> The difference in the overall feeling of your skin after using it is undeniable.&lt;br /&gt;Leaving behind skin that is so soft.</li>
            <li> Came in pink, would have preferred green or blue.</li>
            <li> The bristles are really stiff and my daughter complains that it hurts her back.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other varieties, the cloth type that you hold like a log saw and move back and forth using both hands.  </li>
            <li> Bristles seem to be lasting a long time, although they aren&#x27;t real stiff.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what i predicted it should without fail.</li>
            <li> Other than that it does what it is suppose to be doing</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some other people talk about the bristles.</li>
            <li> I use it as a foot brush now because it&#x27;s so rough!</li>
            <li> I bought two and are both holding up extremely well.</li>
            <li> Has small marble sized balls on the back which can be used like a massager.</li>
            <li> I checked out other brushes online</li>
            <li> , I was a little disappointed that they were both clear, but a little bit of nail polish and clear acrylic spray fixed that problem.</li>
            <li> It may feel like the bristle is too hard at first, but it will soften up to an extent to give you a moderately tough feel of scrub on the body.</li>
            <li> Loofahs hate it, soaps love it, wash cloths want to be it.</li>
            <li> The bristles are hair thin and extremely soft.</li>
            <li> Also, the bristles have begun to mat down even after a month or two.  </li>
            <li> Maybe as I get used to it or the brush gets a little use the bristles won&#x27;t feel quite as sharp.  </li>
            <li> But be careful, the bristles are rather stiff.</li>
            <li> I just wish the handle was a little longer, because I have a frozen shoulder and have a hard time reaching back.</li>
            <li> If you consume less than 6000 calories a day, this bad-boy will reach all of your parts.  </li>
            <li> It contributed to a noticeable improvement in the condition of my skin in less than a week.</li>
            <li> Now I can reach those spots that were previously unreachable.</li>
            <li> This brush is cheaper in quality, and seems a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> The bristles of the brush are a little stiff/harsh, but I think after some use they will soften up.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are firm without being too rigid.</li>
            <li> It has firm bristles and the handle doesn&#x27;t slip out your hands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m disabled and don&#x27;t have time to chase around to retail stores to look for things like this.</li>
            <li> Both cracked or broke in a few months.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The bristles were too stiff and the head on it broke when I was using</li>
            <li> The bristles are REALLY stiff</li>
            <li> The bristles are REALLY STIFF.</li>
            <li> Too stiff for me.  </li>
            <li> It scrubs really hard, unlike our previous bath brush.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are VERY stiff and firm.</li>
            <li> but it is a little to hard for my taste.  </li>
            <li> Unable to reach back because of an accident &amp; these do the trick.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it will soften up</li>
            <li> I guess the only weird part is that you cannot pick the color you want.</li>
            <li> dual wielding back scrubbers cutting my shower time in half.</li>
            <li> I often make faces at it and call it dirty names, but this back scrubber just doesn&#x27;t care.  </li>
            <li> The way it is designed is quite inconvenient when you are trying to reach your back.  </li>
            <li> The plastic handle is thick and durable.</li>
            <li> The handle is thin and the bristles are stiff.</li>
            <li> but when I got mine the massaging side is completely flat which is misleading compared to the pictures they posted, FAKE!</li>
            <li> Bought this to wash legs and back after a bike accident that made bending over painful.</li>
            <li> I think I was thinking about rating this a five or a four at one time, but it is simply not as good as a Swissco</li>
            <li> brizzles are tough.</li>
            <li> The handle is really thin and flexes somewhat.</li>
            <li> Maybe I purchased the wrong brush because I am disappointed at how short the handle it.  </li>
            <li> but they are not so bad nemore and the color I got is the green.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed</li>
            <li> There was rust after a few weeks at the base of the bristles.</li>
            <li> -it&#x27;s random what you receive.  </li>
            <li> The thing with expensive brushes is that they all eventually get mildew and need to be replaced as well.  </li>
            <li> For the price you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality and not dual-sided as the description notes.  </li>
            <li> The one I received was made of very thin plastic.</li>
            <li> Not that that&#x27;s a bad thing, it&#x27;s just probably not for every day use.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this brush.  </li>
            <li> Im disappointed.</li>
            <li> Annoyingly:-</li>
            <li> Very disappointed this was not  usable.  </li>
            <li> Terrible brush!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent scrub brush. The random color I received was the light blue, which perfectly matched my bathroom! It does exactly what it should and is well made and sturdy. If I ever need another, I&#x27;ll order one of these again.</li>
            <li> Good scrub brush. The rope broke apart pretty much immediately but there is a hole in the plastic handle to hang it up.</li>
            <li> This brush is exactly what I wanted/expected it to be!  It&#x27;s just the right length and has the perfect contour.  The color is nice, also.</li>
            <li> Bought one now I&#x27;m about to buy another one there great.</li>
            <li> For $5 I didn&#x27;t expect much, and I didn&#x27;t get it. The handle is thin and the bristles are stiff. It&#x27;s ok for feet, but it scratches my back rather than scrubs it. I would recommend spending a little more money if you are looking for a brush to use regularly on your back.</li>
            <li> As promised, great quality. Bought it about 6 months or more ago, Buy it</li>
            <li> Christmas gifts for my sister - she enjoys using them both. Unable to reach back because of an accident &amp; these do the trick.</li>
            <li> I paid way to much for this scrub brush. I found the same one at the dollar store. Works great it left my skin soft</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s called a &amp;#34;long-handle&amp;#34; bath brush, the handle isn&#x27;t that long.  It&#x27;s too short for my 6&#x27;3&amp;#34; husband, who was the intended recipient.  Also, the bristles have begun to mat down even after a month or two.  It&#x27;s ok, but it&#x27;s not a home-run.</li>
            <li> Perfect in or out of water.  Who cares what color it is?</li>
            <li> Its too short and kind of hard to hold. Plus you dont know what color you are going to get and I got pink</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! It does exactly what i predicted it should without fail.</li>
            <li> great basic bath brush buts needs about 1 or two more inches in length to be perfect.</li>
            <li> If the handle was 6 inches longer, this would be perfect.  The brush is just the right size, and the bristles are tight together so the liquid body wash doesn&#x27;t sink to the bottom before I can get it to my back.  The stiffness of the bristles is perfect for me, but that&#x27;s subjective.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and great price.</li>
            <li> Nice weight and long handled back scrubber. A bit more pricey than buying at Walmart but well worth the difference for the longer handle. Let&#x27;s me reach everywhere with ease.</li>
            <li> Annoyingly:-( Another form. Not like the photo on the site.</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself and my teenage son.  After he used it for the first time he complained that it hurt to use.  I told him to stop being a baby.  I used mine the next day...let&#x27;s just say my kids love when I have to apologize to them.</li>
            <li> this brush works well, only weakness is in handle that tends to break if you apply too much pressure over time - weeks or months.  However, it is a good length, has a nice brush on the end that is not too soft or too hard and is very usefull in cleaning areas hard to reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just buy another one of these when they break as they are worth it.  I have not found any other brush that comes close to being as use full as this brush is for cleaning in the shower.</li>
            <li> No, I could get the same thing at the Dollar Store.</li>
            <li> Shorter than expected and very flimsy, I would not purchase again</li>
            <li> I really love this back scrubber.  It really gets the job done.  I have needed some help with washing my back since having a stroke. And this brush is all I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> The description says it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;long handle.&amp;#34; But this one is shorter than another one I have that also has a 14&amp;#34; handle.  It&#x27;s fine for the price.</li>
            <li> This brush is very scratchy.  I just bought a cheaper, softer one at Walmart and threw this one out!</li>
            <li> This has been the best thing ever. It is always hard to scrub my back in the shower and this is so wonderful and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It is a nice back scrubber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the bristles were a little more firm and the handle was just a tad longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does the job. I also wish we could choose the color. I got a clear one, so I guess it goes with everything!</li>
            <li> O l gets 4 Stars because we received 2 clear colored brushes. I thought it would be either one pictured . Other than that it does what it is suppose to be doing</li>
            <li> There was rust after a few weeks at the base of the bristles.</li>
            <li> Bought this to wash legs and back after a bike accident that made bending over painful. Seems ok on legs but find it a bit scratchy to use on my back.</li>
            <li> I think I was thinking about rating this a five or a four at one time, but it is simply not as good as a Swissco product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specifically this is a plastic product and thus seems rather cheap in construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles were too stiff and the head on it broke when I was using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend a few more dollars and get the Swissco scrubber.</li>
            <li> got my back scrubber some weeks ago, love it and I use it for every shower, the bristles were kinda hard at first but they are not so bad nemore and the color I got is the green. It has really been helping with my mild back-ne.</li>
            <li> Bristles are VERY stiff and firm. Great for scrubbing your feet from a comfortable, rough and painful on the skin of one&#x27;s back. Perhaps if you are looking to exfoliate your back, this is for you. Me, I just wanted to wash it.</li>
            <li> I needed a back scrubber, and this is perfect. I was not disappointed at all. It is as described. I am very pleased. THank you.</li>
            <li> Gets a lot of use, works as a back scratcher too!</li>
            <li> somewhat smaller than expected</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  A basic, old-school back brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handle length seems long enough to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bristles are soft, yet also give a bit of a scrub (w/o taking off your skin!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knocked 1 star off, because the string-like hanging loop unraveled after only a couple of uses.  A minor problem, though.</li>
            <li> great price and light weight.</li>
            <li> Fine for what it does, but after I had this for a couple of weeks, I found the exact same back brush at the local dollar store, for $1. And it had all the color choices. $1. I could kick myself.</li>
            <li> Price was right and it works.&lt;br /&gt;The handle could have been beefier (I&#x27;ve read reviews were it broke),&lt;br /&gt;but mine hasn&#x27;t yet, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> The scrubber I received does not have the massager side, it&#x27;s flat.  The bristles are REALLY stiff and I find this brush actually hurts trying to use it.  Not sure if it will soften up but I am not a fan.</li>
            <li> My initial impression is that it is a little &amp;#34;sharper&amp;#34; than medium-soft.  Maybe as I get used to it or the brush gets a little use the bristles won&#x27;t feel quite as sharp.  I also wish that both sides of the handle had finger ridges as once the smooth plastic gets soapy it also gets slick.  I&#x27;m keeping it and using it, tho.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality and not dual-sided as the description notes.  I could have likely purchased this from a dollar store and paid less.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s long enough, it&#x27;s a scrubbing brush.. I&#x27;m not really sure what more you can say about this product. Built fine, doesn&#x27;t feel like it will break any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some other people talk about the bristles. Some say too hard, some say too soft, I imagine it&#x27;s all down to personal preference. I guess they&#x27;re just plastic bristles, nothing fancy or anything, but they get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not the kind of guy who needs something fancy or designer made. It gets the job done, seems to have staying power, and I&#x27;ve got no complaints about it.</li>
            <li> Does as advertised. Bristles are not harsh/stiff - rather just right for light scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;Like the textured finger grip handle for &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is a great back scrubber brush. The bristles are firm without being too rigid. Mine is a clear blue. It is a great value - durable and comes in pretty colors.</li>
            <li> Arrived intact and on time...</li>
            <li> I would give this brush more stars, because it is a good brush, but it does not have the massage nubs shown in the picture. I like the length and the firmness of the bristles.</li>
            <li> Hard brussels at first.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my children for stocking stuffers.  They all love them and they were very nice.  Would have liked if they came in different colors, arrived all the same (clear) color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect to wash your back. I just wish the handle was a little longer, because I have a frozen shoulder and have a hard time reaching back.</li>
            <li> Purchased for arthritic elderly Mother, the design was easy for her to handle, color was complimentary and restored her ability to be more self sufficient in personal care.  Priced economically, sturdy and functional!</li>
            <li> Hey, it&#x27;s an inexpensive back scrubber, what more do you want, racing stripes?  It&#x27;s waterproof, high definition, 3D, and wireless.  If you consume less than 6000 calories a day, this bad-boy will reach all of your parts.  I often make faces at it and call it dirty names, but this back scrubber just doesn&#x27;t care.  Loofahs hate it, soaps love it, wash cloths want to be it.</li>
            <li> This item works as expected. The plastic is in good condition and as of this review, the bristles clean, white color is still nice.</li>
            <li> bristles not hard enough;better suited for a woman. handle certainly too short to reach back areas. I should have known better but thought it might be okay&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This brush has great firmness without being too stiff and rough. The handle is slightly curved and long enough to reach all over. The shipping was great and arrived timely. I recommend to anyone needing a bath brush.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly &amp; in good condition.  It scrubs really hard, unlike our previous bath brush.  The pink goes well with my bathroom.</li>
            <li> you must reach higher than normal, bend in ways you&#x27;ve only seen in movies. no really i wish the head was angled in more so i didnt have to stretch my armpit so much. bought for grandma, she can&#x27;t use it, no i have two of these. dual wielding back scrubbers cutting my shower time in half.</li>
            <li> Perfect just what I needed and will be ordering more of them in differant collars it&#x27;s just right for me</li>
            <li> this is nice, it&#x27;s inexpensive and I&#x27;d describe the bristles as medium. they&#x27;re not all soft and smooshy like a doll hair brush but they&#x27;re not going to scrub your skin off. colors are bright, I think the handle is plenty long.</li>
            <li> I gets those hard to reach place in the back and the bristles are medium to soft....just perfect for me</li>
            <li> I guess the only weird part is that you cannot pick the color you want. I got pink. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great deal. It has firm bristles and the handle doesn&#x27;t slip out your hands. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> This brush is cheaper in quality, and seems a little flimsy. But it gets the job done. For the price the item is worth it.</li>
            <li> But its a little less soft than I would have preferred.  Satisfied with it.  It does what i need it to do.</li>
            <li> Not the greatest scrubber but you pay for what you get.  The bristles are really stiff and my daughter complains that it hurts her back.  It feels cheaply made.  I don&#x27;t like that you can&#x27;t pick the color-it&#x27;s random what you receive.  I ordered two and got one blue and one clear.  Next time I will pay more and get a higher quality brush.</li>
            <li> Great little brush. Soft. Almost too soft for some scrubbing, but perfect for a child&#x27;s soft skin.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the bristles would soften after a few weeks of intermittent use...not so much.  This brush, even using the lightest pressure possible, is like sanding your skin off.  The handle is nice and I think it&#x27;s long enough for most people but geez....I use it as a foot brush now because it&#x27;s so rough!</li>
            <li> I was going to give this product fewer stars, but it was exactly what was described in the product description. Good for exfoliation, a good value, and exactly the size/measurements advertised. The grip is surprisingly good if you have soap on your hand, too -- you have to squeeze a bit, but given the price, it&#x27;s not bad. I imagine you could put some kind of tape on the grip, if you really weren&#x27;t able to hang onto it, but I haven&#x27;t found that to be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, why was I going to give it fewer stars? The bristles are REALLY STIFF. Using the brush is a lot like a low-grade sand-blasting wherever you scrub. Fortunately, that&#x27;s good for me. Just be prepared for a very bracing experience.</li>
            <li> Works fine, feels good...</li>
            <li> The brush I received was exactly the same as the one described and pictured here. The bristles are just right for me - soft enough to lather up well and be gentle on my skin, and stiff enough to provide a mildly invigorating scrub. The brush is easy for me to hold and use, and it rinses off and dries quickly. It contributed to a noticeable improvement in the condition of my skin in less than a week. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This brush says &amp;#34;long handle&amp;#34; yet I&#x27;m only 5&#x27; 9&amp;#34; and have hard time scrubbing my back.  The way it is designed is quite inconvenient when you are trying to reach your back.  I can obviously tell that whoever made this didn&#x27;t try it on their backs.</li>
            <li> Bristles have no substance, handle too short.  Bought a replacement from local Bed Bath and Beyond.</li>
            <li> This was something I needed for a long time.  I am still getting used to the rough bristles, but they are softening quickly.  It feels real nice to be able to scrub your whole back.  The picture showed the back of the brush having some massaging nubs but mine was smooth - not entirely truthful, but not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> Low quality. The handle and the brush part both were very low quality. For the price, I think the material could have been much, much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap back scrubber, the price is right, but what I don&#x27;t like is that the bristles are sparse and spaced too far apart for what I like.  The thing with expensive brushes is that they all eventually get mildew and need to be replaced as well.  This brush is 1/5th of the cost of an expensive brush and still works fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bath brush.  There is nothing spectacular about it.  It&#x27;s about medium in the bristles and it has a plastic handle.  If I had it to do over again, I would have waited and then bought the one that I found at Big Lots yesterday for less and could have picked my own color.  The only thing is I like the convenience of not having to go from store to store looking for something when I can have it delivered to my door so this bath brush works.  My advice is that if 1) you can&#x27;t find one anywhere or 2) you just prefer having things delivered to you door, this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li> This scrubber is so great! It&#x27;s not too scrubby but exfoliates with excellence.&lt;br /&gt;I really Love this brush. The difference in the overall feeling of your skin after using it is undeniable.&lt;br /&gt;Leaving behind skin that is so soft. Not hot or lobster red like most brushed do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it. Thank you for this awesome product. I will buy again â™¥</li>
            <li> Did not receive back scrubber in picture. The one I received was made of very thin plastic. Mine broke right away.</li>
            <li> assorted colors, reasonable price and long lasting soft bristles. add to your shower today.</li>
            <li> Ordered two; one for me, and one for my wife. They were both the same color, so we have to use marker pen to tell them apart. They did not hold up to use very long. The bristles crushed down, and I just use them now to apply lotion with the back of the brush, to my back.</li>
            <li> It probably won&#x27;t last long. The handle is really thin and flexes somewhat. For the price it is really replaceable. I wish it was a bit sturdier (even if it were more expensive) The bristles are nice a little stiff at first but if run under hot water they soften temporarily.I will probably buy this again. It has a nice long reach can get the center of my back with no problem.</li>
            <li> Had a wooden one before, but wood ends up cracking. Maybe because the wood was really cheap however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is not going to do that. Nice firm bristles that won&#x27;t break down too quickly, but are soft enough when wet.&lt;br /&gt;Not especially long, could be a inch or two longer, but is long enough.  I&#x27;m happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish you could pick your color however;  I might be in my 40&#x27;s but I&#x27;m still partial to pink.</li>
            <li> This was exactly as advertised, in a nice color to match our shower, and best of all, arrived just TWO DAYS after I placed my order!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came in a simple poly envelope, but with a plastic guard to cover the brush head in transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disabled and don&#x27;t have time to chase around to retail stores to look for things like this. So I REALLY appreciated the free shipping.  Too many of these third-party sellers use shipping costs as a way of gouging customers.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product through the Global Depot vendor, and I received a moderately hard bristle brush that was densely packed, which worked comfortable with liquid soap. It may feel like the bristle is too hard at first, but it will soften up to an extent to give you a moderately tough feel of scrub on the body. It lasted me for 2 years of daily use until the stem part broke, so I decided to buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordering it through CV Trading Corp, I didn&#x27;t realize the product would actually be different than what I got from Global Depot. What I received this time was a soft bristle brush that is loosely packed, which causes the liquid soap to drip somewhat. The acrylic stem is also much thinner and with a larger angle of bend that I have a feeling it will also break easily, and not that it matters but it doesn&#x27;t have the dimples on the back part of the brush as the picture shows with this version, kind of a cheap overall feel to it. I am going to order another one from Global Depot again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, DO NOT BUY FROM CV TRADING CORP.</li>
            <li> I had a similar brush for many years.  When the bristles wore down, I tried a fancy wooden one and a fancy detachable brush type.  Both cracked or broke in a few months.  The handle on this is just the right length and the bristles are just the right toughness.  I am 100% pleased with this brush.</li>
            <li> Husband very happy with this item...wished the string hadn&#x27;t unraveled, next time will burn the end to prevent that.</li>
            <li> Not at all the quality of brush I expected from the descripton. Bristles were svery soft and not at the &amp;#34;back scrubber&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; brush stated in the description.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a back scrubber, it scrubs your back.  I ordered two, I was a little disappointed that they were both clear, but a little bit of nail polish and clear acrylic spray fixed that problem.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my grandchildren to use.  They love it.  It is a great item to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Received the blue one which was the one I was hoping for.  Durable product and the bristles feel just right.  Arrived wrapped in plastic.</li>
            <li> Who would think that it&#x27;s so difficult to find the right back scrubber. Too stiff (ouch), too soft (irratating), but this one is just right for me. I have ordered/bought so many. I have to say... it&#x27;s not for someone looking for a soft brush. But it doesn&#x27;t take off the first layer of skin either. I really like it and have had it for about a year and no mold, no discoloration, no breakage. It&#x27;s weird not being able to pick the color... they all sort of suck... but the product works perfectly and it kind of makes me laugh to see my pink brush hanging in my marble shower!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> The brush is a little rough at first but it is just fine for cleaning one&#x27;s back or even scratching.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed!  Now I can reach those spots that were previously unreachable.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. Works just so so.</li>
            <li> This was a lucky find. The size and softness of the bristles are just right for me. It feels like it&#x27;ll last a good long time. If you&#x27;re worried about getting a brush that goes with your bathroom, this probably isn&#x27;t the choice for you, but if color is no object, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Unless you have skin like iron, all I can say is ouch!  I may use it as a non-metallic BBQ grill brush  :)</li>
            <li> NOT AS PICTURED. The handle is flat, not rounded. Also the back of the brush DOES NOT have massaging nubs as pictured. A little disappointed but it was a decent price. Will update when I actually get to use the brush.</li>
            <li> fun color, decent quality.  bristles are firm &amp; long lasting.  Excellent value for the price!</li>
            <li> The handle is nice and long, Seems to be sturdy.. Would recomened it..Came well packaged and on time...Does the job.</li>
            <li> The brush handle is too short and not angled correctly to use it well to scrub a back.  The brush is also much too soft to clean your skin.  I threw this brush away.</li>
            <li> It works but the handle is not long enough. Hopefully will last longer than the wood one that cost 3x as much but fell apart.</li>
            <li> Not soft enough. Hurts to scrub back or body with it!</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t the same as advertised, there were supposed to be two sides one for brushing and the other is to massaging but when I got mine the massaging side is completely flat which is misleading compared to the pictures they posted, FAKE!</li>
            <li> Maybe I purchased the wrong brush because I am disappointed at how short the handle it.  The one I got has a good enough brush, but I&#x27;d have to be a very small, and flexible, person to use it on my back.</li>
            <li> This an easy to use brush.  Also, not too soft and not too hard.</li>
            <li> Way to rough for the skin.  I am using it to clean the tires of my car.</li>
            <li> I liked the Back Scrub Brush very much.  However, would have preferred a longer handle.  Do you have the longer handles in stock?</li>
            <li> What a rip off. Supposed to be 14 1/2 inches long was only 13 inches. Smooth on the back. No back massager, is definitely not the one that they have pictured on Amazon, Cheap plastic handle. Looks like something you would buy at dollar tree for one dollar. Called Amazon for a refund. Beware of buying from CV trading Corp.</li>
            <li> good stiff brush, which is fine, in general, but a bit too stiff for the face.  the \\&quot;hook\\&quot; on the end of the handle keeps it from slipping out of your hand, which is nice.</li>
            <li> does the job but it is a little to hard for my taste.  great for the price, but a little softer would have been nice,</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter and she really loves it! Nice back scrubber with softer bristles that are kind on her skin! It also cleared her back up right away as she had a bit of back acne. Very good product!</li>
            <li> But be careful, the bristles are rather stiff. Not that that&#x27;s a bad thing, it&#x27;s just probably not for every day use. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This back brush does it all for me... it scrubs and massages, plus gives me a clean, new feeling I don&#x27;t get from other brushes because THEY DON&#x27;T LAST!!!  Just, that they should all last longer without getting funky, scummy, and slimey!  I love this brush and would highly recommend it to anyone at Amazon.com who obviously knows where to buy great stuff for less.  Buy this!!!!</li>
            <li> In my opinion the bristles on this brush were too rough to use on human skin.  Also the handle was so smooth and slippery that once you got soap on it you could not hold onto the brush.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.  A cheap back scrubber.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other varieties, the cloth type that you hold like a log saw and move back and forth using both hands.  I wanted to use those types because I knew I could wash them easily, but they just weren&#x27;t cutting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles can be a bit harsh, so if you have very sensitive skin or plan to use it for children this might be a bit much.  Personally I like the rough feeling, it helps convince me Its exfoliating and cleaning.  But I could see how some people wouldn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to decide how best to clean it.  Maybe I&#x27;ll soak it in a mild bleach solution?  Eventually I know the desire to put it into the dishwasher will be too much, and I will find out the hard way if the bristles melt or not....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for now I&#x27;m very satisfied.  Ultimately the low cost is great as I won&#x27;t feel awful if I have to replace it every so often.</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy weight brush, long enough for me to scrub my entire back, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Brush is not bad. Only problem is handle is to short. I would like to have a brush that is a foot longer</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this brush.  First of all, the bristles are too stiff and rough!  The handle on the brush was not long enough.  The handle was slippery; it really needed a gripper handle.  Very disappointed this was not  usable.  Save your $$.</li>
            <li> The brush is too soft on this and the handle is way too short. I will look for the &amp;#34;Earth Therapeutics&amp;#34; that I prefer.</li>
            <li> Too short and hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dot</li>
            <li> Im disappointed. Got sent a very different and cheap back brush. Design totally different and doesnt have massager surface on back.  The bristles are hair thin and extremely soft.</li>
            <li> Broke after 4 months. I tried to contact the seller but that&#x27;s no longer possible. Cheap, Made in China feel. I&#x27;m thinking the wooden natural ones are built to last better than this Plasticrap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but handle curves (so not as long a reach as expected), and found EXACT same brushes for less at my local supermarket.</li>
            <li> not as long as I expected it to be</li>
            <li> Choses this brush because of a review I read. This is just what I was looking for. Great for ur back.</li>
            <li> This was a really good brush for a great price. However I do think that the bristles are a little too rough, so just be aware of that when purchasing. It&#x27;s all personal preference. Maybe once I use it more it will soften up a little</li>
            <li> This is perfect for anyone! I use this back scrubber when I shower and it always does the work for me. Its effective and does what its supposed to do. A perfect product for your bathroom. Also the shipping for this was quick! I am happy.</li>
            <li> It was wonderful to be able to scrub my back without having to strain it was perfect and I think I have to get some more for quick for gifts</li>
            <li> I received this back brush about a week ago.  The length of the handle is just about right.  The bristles of the brush are a little stiff/harsh, but I think after some use they will soften up.  There is a piece of &#x27;rope&#x27; at the end to hang it...which I wish was a little bigger, but I can replace that no big deal.  Overall I think this brush will serve it&#x27;s purpose just fine.</li>
            <li> Gave this rating because the handle is about 2&amp;#34; smaller than I expected as well as the rope to hang it. The brush part is fine.</li>
            <li> Brush is too soft to be useful as a back scrubber --guess the adage you get what you pay for holds true. Price is as cheap as the product itself.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I needed.  Perfect</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  Bristles feel soft on hands, but rather scratchy on back.  Came in pink, would have preferred green or blue.</li>
            <li> This is about the same as a $5 brush that can be purchased at Walmart.  Nothing fancy, medium size, not too hard but strong enough to hurt your face if you try to scrub it.</li>
            <li> Terrible brush! Bristles hurt my feet.</li>
            <li> This brush has done wonders for my back. When I began to use it every day I saw a huge improvement in the skin on my back - it&#x27;s a bit more radiant and clear (I struggle with acne and eczema) than it was before. I would recommend this to people that have never used a back brush before and want to try it out. An inexpensive and practical option!</li>
            <li> Exactly like the one I purchased from target for $1.99.  Would not purchase again.  Too stiff for me.  Dollar store quality.</li>
            <li> All those wood ones ive used for years fall apart. i liked them but they dont last. these ones are firm and strong. brizzles are tough. good for scrubbing back and wont come apart. imexpensive and wors like i need it to.</li>
            <li> wish the brushes were a bit tougher</li>
            <li> Not as smooth feeling as I anticipated it would be.</li>
            <li> Great for a stocking stuffer. Wish you could pick the color - we received clear - but I guess really no big deal. Works well. Not too hard and not too soft. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> handle too short and not curved enough to be comfortable</li>
            <li> This scrubber doesn&#x27;t have as many bristles as my old one plus, it&#x27;s softer.  My son and husband like theirs but they were washcloth users prior to me buying them scrub brushes.  I ended up buying a replica of my old one at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Love it wish the brush was a little bit  longer</li>
            <li> This brush is exactly what I needed to reach my back and feet without further twisting of my arthritic joints.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Bristles seem to be lasting a long time, although they aren&#x27;t real stiff.  It does feel flimsy at the base of the brush head; but, so far it has held up fine.</li>
            <li> It is a little to stiff and scratchy for my taste, great for the price. Because I have some disability in my shoulders, I should have gotten a longer one.</li>
            <li> The handle broke in half on my second shower.  What else can I say?  I&#x27;m a guy who showers too vigorously?</li>
            <li> I was so excited they shipped me my favorite color, blue, then when I went to use the product for the first time it snapped in the shower... I would love another one at no cost, as perhaps the one I had was a faulty product.</li>
            <li> Bought this so that I could clean the top of my feet and in between the toes. Its works fine and after using it twice on one foot can tell the difference from the other non scrubbed foot. I am a senior who has trouble bending over to clean my feet in the shower and diabetic so have to keep my feet in good order. Only two complaints with this brush. One it is just a little too short. A couple more inches in length and it would be great. Two...as I only use this on my feet....the bristles are just a tad bit too soft. Would be nice to have a brush like this a little longer with stiffer bristles. For the price you cant go wrong. It may take a couple of times to clean up the feet but it does work.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for since my local store did not carry the plastic back brushes anymore, they started carrying the wooden back brushes that rot within a few months time. These are nylon and plastic which are resistant to bacteria. I bought two and are both holding up extremely well.</li>
            <li> Good brush as described especially at the low price.  Bristles are soft but sufficient to do the job.  I could only wish the handle was just a bit longer.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;This brush is very soft and is a pleasure to take a shower with it.&lt;br /&gt;I have very fair and sensitive skin. This brush is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to everyone, because our skin needs to be treated gently.&lt;br /&gt;I detest of those bath brushes seem scrub brushes for clean the floor.&lt;br /&gt;This is the perfect brush for anyone.</li>
            <li> Love using these scrubbers!!!! Works so well at removing dead skin cells, also a lovely back scratcher hahaha.</li>
            <li> i would have given 5 stars if you could choose the color.  Just like a review that i read from another guy who liked the scrubber, but ended up getting the pink one.  This same scenario happened for me too.  I would have been fine with a blue or green one, but of course i get the pink one.  I just don&#x27;t understand the fact that you cannot choose your color.</li>
            <li> No complaints for me. The brush is the perfect stiffness for me. Only upset that I didn&#x27;t get to choose my own color (I got pink).</li>
            <li> Bristles are rough but works good and feels amazing when your back itches lol. The plastic handle is thick and durable. Has small marble sized balls on the back which can be used like a massager.</li>
            <li> Bought 9 of these and everyone loved them!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for washing your back.  It does the job and does not \\&quot;mold\\&quot; or \\&quot;mildew\\&quot; when left hanging in the shower.  It holds up quite nicely.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the long handle and it&#x27;s easy to grip! Great pricing and very quick delivery! Super satisfied and I highly recommend this brush to others. I checked out other brushes online and this one looked the most promising. It delivered! Medium brush that isn&#x27;t too rough but not annoyingly soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up: great brush, great price and shipping, and great quality!</li>
            <li> The product arrived very fast. It was as firm as I desired, but yet did not scratch or irate my back.</li>
            <li> It works, nice price.</li>
            <li> I like it! The only thing is I can&#x27;t choose the color ;(</li>
            <li> handle shorter than expected but decided to keep</li>
