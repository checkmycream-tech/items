            <li>a naturally very light complected</li>
            <li>Have to say I really love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is one of the best red hair dyes I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It is the perfect copper red color with a brilliance that turns heads yet does not look garish.  </li>

            <li>It is the perfect copper red color with a brilliance that turns heads yet does not look garish.  </li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>It was more of an orange/red, like fire.</li>
            <li>I love the gloves that came with the product.</li>
            <li>which i love)</li>
            <li>I am really impressed with this red.  </li>
            <li>Worked so much better than any of Loreal&#x27;s reds.</li>
            <li>It seemed like there was a lot of complaining about orange hues, and I decided I would be OK if my hair came out orange.</li>
            <li>The color stays in my hair better than the Salon dye ever did</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not seeing as many split ends</li>
            <li>noticed  there are 3 more shades to choose from</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my color.</li>
            <li>The best red ever.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t get too panicked over my hair and even though it wasn&#x27;t the color I wanted, I was OK with it.  </li>
            <li>The best red.</li>
            <li>impressed me most about this dye is that the color was brilliant on the virgin hair as much as it was on the other hair.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to explain that I have done this a lot and am familiar with the process and with how my own hair takes color.  </li>
            <li>The color that she glows in is a brilliant copper red hair.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure why as my hair was fully saturated and I even had my husband help check to make sure I had full coverage.  </li>
            <li>wife is a sweet and wonderful woman who always has a natural smile.  </li>
            <li>which cost me $100 plus all the hair therapy products I had to use to counter act the damage from the bleach, easily another $60 a month.</li>
            <li>The color is unique and gorgeous and lasts very well.  </li>
            <li>The color is unique and gorgeous and lasts very well.  </li>
            <li>and this is one of the best and most intense red colors.</li>
            <li>Has great color that really pops and have gotten so many compliments by complete strangers who love the color.</li>
            <li>It seemed like it was doing its job while I had it on my hair, and looked fine after I washed it out.</li>
            <li>The light in my bathroom isn&#x27;t the greatest and it was dark out, so I waited until this morning to take a picture of it.</li>
            <li>And when you pull it out of the box and mix it up, the concotion is light orange.</li>
            <li>The color came out perfect and very even despite my heavy-handed application - and it&#x27;s actually a little more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking than it appears on the box, IMO.</li>
            <li>let&#x27;s see how long it will hold if it does great</li>
            <li>It does not fade like so many reds, and if you take care of it and how you shampoo it, you can get more time out of it than most red dyes.have longer hair, plan on buying two boxes-</li>
            <li>It does not fade like so many reds, and if you take care of it and how you shampoo it, you can get more time out of it than most red dyes.</li>
            <li>I was so excited about this.</li>
            <li>My hair is medium brown with a small amount of gray and the coverage is perfect all over.  </li>
            <li>It really looked amazing right up to the scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been bright red for 6 months using color from Sally&#x27;s and the color lasted from 4-6 weeks.</li>
            <li>Even at work my patients and co works have really made alot of comments on how they love the color  with</li>
            <li>Always always always use cool water on your hair.</li>
            <li>I saw a very pretty bright red, while it was still soaked.</li>
            <li>If it works for you, that&#x27;s great, but if you&#x27;re thinking of trying it, please use any thing other than this.</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s so much more Vibrant</li>
            <li>This color, 6rr, is a super bright eye-catching red, almost unnatural when compared to the other reds available today which makes it very appealing.</li>
            <li>There is also barely any chemical smell during the dying process, which was sort of astounding.</li>
            <li>I color my own hair and have tried a variety of brands, though I like to stick with my favorites as older ones aren&#x27;t made anymore and new ones come out.  </li>
            <li>The rest of the hair was a very faded auburn which was almost brown in color,  light to medium in nature.  </li>
            <li>and I think it goes great with my skin tone, plus it brings out m eye color beautifully (green).</li>
            <li>pink hair ended up bright orange, and I like that.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>well worth the inconvenience.</li>
            <li>and I still would have picked this one from the look on the box its a bright vibrant red color.  </li>
            <li>Right off the bat, something seemed off.</li>
            <li>I have normal light brown hair as shown on the box.</li>
            <li>Love Runway red</li>
            <li>, first time i tried it</li>
            <li>Runway Red is my favorite shade of any hair dye.</li>
            <li>They have magenta and red, it lasts longer than most dyes, and it&#x27;s healthier for your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used this brand before, but I know people who have used this exact dye without issue, so I just went with it.</li>
            <li>but if I&#x27;d read reviews first, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t mind the extra time it takes to maintain this color, because this color is PHENOMENAL.  </li>
            <li>I recommend the red for sure.  </li>
            <li>What was supposed to be a dark red color, turned out bright orange!</li>
            <li>already looking for a new color that wont fade so quickly.</li>
            <li>If you are seeking a bright red, definitely try Loreal Hi Color Highlights!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Vidal Sassoon London Luxe 6RR Runway Red is a GORGEOUS copper red.  </li>
            <li>On the positive side, its not my gray hair that shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i just love how vibrant the red color was</li>
            <li>This is my new color now!!</li>
            <li>And after I waited a week, I washed my hair for the first time, I could already see the color fading dramatically and the length of my hair turning into its original blonde.</li>
            <li>Dull in spots, and bright orange in others.  </li>
            <li>and my hair is splotchy, dull, and faded with about two spots of bright color.  </li>
            <li>I get tons of compliments and it doesn&#x27;t fade much.  </li>
            <li>Just straight up orange.</li>
            <li>My end results were very close to what it pictured on the box which is also unusual and both of these are points in its favor</li>
            <li>fade fast no matter what you use.</li>
            <li>hahahaha.</li>
            <li>But with this one it washes out much faster than any dye I have ever used</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>A lot of the complaints came from people with much lighter hair than mine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not shedding nearly as much as I was.</li>
            <li>I really hope they don&#x27;t stop making this color.</li>
            <li>I LIKE the color (on my hair, not so much the scalp), but</li>
            <li>Because the color IS so bright, any dark patches or new growth will be more obvious and on me, this has happened just 3 weeks later.</li>
            <li>The only good thing I can say about this is that it didn&#x27;t fry my hair as much as some other brands have. ...</li>
            <li>far the most vibrant red I have had.</li>
            <li>It is such a unique color.  </li>
            <li>Just not sure why it&#x27;s not in the stores, but I am glad to know I can find it here!</li>
            <li>it faded out in about 2-3 weeks the first time i used it, and the second time it lasted for about 3.5 weeks before it became a dingy brownish-red (i have light brown hair naturally).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty hard To find it in store, so it&#x27;s amazing to see it on amazon.</li>
            <li>Imagine mixing glowy yellow mustard yellow with a bright fire engine red and that is what it looks like when you are applying the dye to the hair.  </li>
            <li>I thought I had it pretty clear, applied the conditioner, and the water was orange.  </li>
            <li>My hair is more wine red than runway red, but I still really like it.</li>
            <li>i got this dye after trying many different red dyes, and this one came out the brightest.</li>
            <li>but for me- red has never washed out so quickly.</li>
            <li>Not sure why so many reviewers are hating on this pretty color</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for color, I would highly suggest that you go elsewhere.  </li>

            <li>He looked forward to ending my shade but instead ended up a lighter brown with reddish highlights, much like if the sun had lightened his hair naturally over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has not faded much at all since dyeing despite red washing out a bit for the first 5 washings or</li>
            <li>I have tried SO many different box dyes and had my hair professionally colored numerous times, but THIS is now my holy grail.</li>
            <li>Its far more red toned than orange and, in the course of four weeks has faded to a orange-copper color on me, except where I hit the roots 3 different times.</li>
            <li>And now she has stunning long red hair</li>
            <li>I decided to try this for a fun red color over the summer.  </li>
            <li>the fact that she her body type is top heavy zoftig and covered in tattoos and you get a natural weirdo magnet.  </li>
            <li>This is the EXACT color I&#x27;ve been trying to get for the last 5-6 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using Garnier&#x27;s Hot Tamale (76) for four years and stopped because my local stores just didn&#x27;t carry the shade I wanted.</li>
            <li>Usually reds don&#x27;t take to the roots as nicely as the rest of the hair, but this was almost the opposite.  </li>
            <li>Runway Red is an intense, true red without blue undertones.  </li>
            <li>It oxidized on my hair into a vibrant red after awhile anyways, so I had high hopes.</li>
            <li>Not red or reddish, but bright orange with slight pink undertones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Texture of hair is medium fine- not overly thick but not thin</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the water will -never- run clear.</li>
            <li>It makes me wonder what my hair would of looked like if I put it on my natural hair</li>
            <li>I am 46 years old and have been coloring my hair since I was about 20.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I picked Runway Red 6rr because it was on sale and because of that vibrant and unusual red shade.</li>
            <li>hair is healthy, I color as infrequently as possible, no more frequently than two months apart.  </li>
            <li>hair is healthy, I color as infrequently as possible, no more frequently than two months apart.  </li>
            <li>First let me say that she bought the first box at the store and then was not able to find it anywhere when it came time to reapply.  </li>
            <li>vibrant red that i get compliments on everywhere</li>
            <li>This one comes out a vibrant red like on the box.</li>
            <li>On a whim, because I had most of that 3rd bottle left, I dyed my son&#x27;s hair which is a very dark brown.</li>
            <li>hair that this was applied to had about four inches of virgin hair growth which is a medium dark golden brown in color.  </li>
            <li>I see normal guys taking an extra glance all the time and who can blame them</li>
            <li>I have tried many other reds and found them either to be too dark or too orange-y.</li>
            <li>This is just a major letdown.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I AM IN LOVE!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This requires far more maintenance than I amused to, the longevity of the color is questionable and costs more money than Feria since I had to use 2 boxes but the color itself is hard to beat.</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little over a week later and my hair is splotchy, dull, and faded with about two spots of bright color.  </li>
            <li>I bought two boxes to dye my hair with, since one box of a different hair color didn&#x27;t completely cover my hair.</li>
            <li>This is the second time that she has used this color and WOW.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I had a lot of doubt about it working since I have dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;--This will dye towels the first few times- use old towels when drying your hair at first&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s bold brightness earning me now the nick name &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; and I hav noticed a few others now turning up with the  same color!!</li>
            <li>Normally I will use a red shade from Feria, one box is enough and while I&#x27;m not a professional, I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair for nearly 20 years and can get the job done.</li>
            <li>Back then I did it occasionally for a change, but I grayed early so have been coloring out of necessity for quite a while.  </li>
            <li>original hair is virgin dark brown, except for a couple streaks, pink and blue, shown in the photos.</li>
            <li>I went shopping at Dollar General last night and saw this box.</li>
            <li>but if you scrub your scalp gently when washing, it will tone that down</li>
            <li>/&gt;--This sells out quickly, so buy what you need because it might be hard to locate later&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;--This sells out quickly, so buy what you need because it might be hard to locate later&lt;</li>
            <li>It came out a beautiful Medium red when I first colored it, but faded horribly after only a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I received a bad box of this from this seller.</li>
            <li>Since my hair grows very slow, the color fades long before actually growing out and touching up every six weeks isn&#x27;t necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ten days into my color it is an absolute mess, and it didn&#x27;t even start out the way it was supposed to.  </li>
            <li>Ten days into my color it is an absolute mess, and it didn&#x27;t even start out the way it was supposed to.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely horrible.s a little over a week later</li>

            <li> I am really impressed with this red.  </li>
            <li> Worked so much better than any of Loreal&#x27;s reds.</li>
            <li> It seemed like there was a lot of complaining about orange hues, and I decided I would be OK if my hair came out orange.</li>
            <li> The color stays in my hair better than the Salon dye ever did</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing as many split ends</li>
            <li> noticed  there are 3 more shades to choose from</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my color.</li>
            <li> The best red ever.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get too panicked over my hair and even though it wasn&#x27;t the color I wanted, I was OK with it.  </li>
            <li> The best red.</li>
            <li> impressed me most about this dye is that the color was brilliant on the virgin hair as much as it was on the other hair.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to explain that I have done this a lot and am familiar with the process and with how my own hair takes color.  </li>
            <li> The color that she glows in is a brilliant copper red hair.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure why as my hair was fully saturated and I even had my husband help check to make sure I had full coverage.  </li>
            <li> wife is a sweet and wonderful woman who always has a natural smile.  </li>
            <li> which cost me $100 plus all the hair therapy products I had to use to counter act the damage from the bleach, easily another $60 a month.</li>
            <li> The color is unique and gorgeous and lasts very well.  </li>
            <li> The color is unique and gorgeous and lasts very well.  </li>
            <li> and this is one of the best and most intense red colors.</li>
            <li> Has great color that really pops and have gotten so many compliments by complete strangers who love the color.</li>
            <li> It seemed like it was doing its job while I had it on my hair, and looked fine after I washed it out.</li>
            <li> The light in my bathroom isn&#x27;t the greatest and it was dark out, so I waited until this morning to take a picture of it.</li>
            <li> And when you pull it out of the box and mix it up, the concotion is light orange.</li>
            <li> The color came out perfect and very even despite my heavy-handed application - and it&#x27;s actually a little more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking than it appears on the box, IMO.</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s see how long it will hold if it does great</li>
            <li> It does not fade like so many reds, and if you take care of it and how you shampoo it, you can get more time out of it than most red dyes.have longer hair, plan on buying two boxes-</li>
            <li> It does not fade like so many reds, and if you take care of it and how you shampoo it, you can get more time out of it than most red dyes.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this.</li>
            <li> My hair is medium brown with a small amount of gray and the coverage is perfect all over.  </li>
            <li> It really looked amazing right up to the scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been bright red for 6 months using color from Sally&#x27;s and the color lasted from 4-6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Even at work my patients and co works have really made alot of comments on how they love the color  with</li>
            <li> Always always always use cool water on your hair.</li>
            <li> I saw a very pretty bright red, while it was still soaked.</li>
            <li> If it works for you, that&#x27;s great, but if you&#x27;re thinking of trying it, please use any thing other than this.</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s so much more Vibrant</li>
            <li> This color, 6rr, is a super bright eye-catching red, almost unnatural when compared to the other reds available today which makes it very appealing.</li>
            <li> There is also barely any chemical smell during the dying process, which was sort of astounding.</li>
            <li> I color my own hair and have tried a variety of brands, though I like to stick with my favorites as older ones aren&#x27;t made anymore and new ones come out.  </li>
            <li> The rest of the hair was a very faded auburn which was almost brown in color,  light to medium in nature.  </li>
            <li> and I think it goes great with my skin tone, plus it brings out m eye color beautifully (green).</li>
            <li> pink hair ended up bright orange, and I like that.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> well worth the inconvenience.</li>
            <li> and I still would have picked this one from the look on the box its a bright vibrant red color.  </li>
            <li> Right off the bat, something seemed off.</li>
            <li> I have normal light brown hair as shown on the box.</li>
            <li> Love Runway red</li>
            <li> , first time i tried it</li>
            <li> Runway Red is my favorite shade of any hair dye.</li>
            <li> They have magenta and red, it lasts longer than most dyes, and it&#x27;s healthier for your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this brand before, but I know people who have used this exact dye without issue, so I just went with it.</li>
            <li> but if I&#x27;d read reviews first, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t mind the extra time it takes to maintain this color, because this color is PHENOMENAL.  </li>
            <li> I recommend the red for sure.  </li>
            <li> What was supposed to be a dark red color, turned out bright orange!</li>
            <li> already looking for a new color that wont fade so quickly.</li>
            <li> If you are seeking a bright red, definitely try Loreal Hi Color Highlights!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Vidal Sassoon London Luxe 6RR Runway Red is a GORGEOUS copper red.  </li>
            <li> On the positive side, its not my gray hair that shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i just love how vibrant the red color was</li>
            <li> This is my new color now!!</li>
            <li> And after I waited a week, I washed my hair for the first time, I could already see the color fading dramatically and the length of my hair turning into its original blonde.</li>
            <li> Dull in spots, and bright orange in others.  </li>
            <li> and my hair is splotchy, dull, and faded with about two spots of bright color.  </li>
            <li> I get tons of compliments and it doesn&#x27;t fade much.  </li>
            <li> Just straight up orange.</li>
            <li> My end results were very close to what it pictured on the box which is also unusual and both of these are points in its favor</li>
            <li> fade fast no matter what you use.</li>
            <li> hahahaha.</li>
            <li> But with this one it washes out much faster than any dye I have ever used</li>
            <li> i highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> A lot of the complaints came from people with much lighter hair than mine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not shedding nearly as much as I was.</li>
            <li> I really hope they don&#x27;t stop making this color.</li>
            <li> I LIKE the color (on my hair, not so much the scalp), but</li>
            <li> Because the color IS so bright, any dark patches or new growth will be more obvious and on me, this has happened just 3 weeks later.</li>
            <li> The only good thing I can say about this is that it didn&#x27;t fry my hair as much as some other brands have. ...</li>
            <li> far the most vibrant red I have had.</li>
            <li> It is such a unique color.  </li>
            <li> Just not sure why it&#x27;s not in the stores, but I am glad to know I can find it here!</li>
            <li> it faded out in about 2-3 weeks the first time i used it, and the second time it lasted for about 3.5 weeks before it became a dingy brownish-red (i have light brown hair naturally).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty hard To find it in store, so it&#x27;s amazing to see it on amazon.</li>
            <li> Imagine mixing glowy yellow mustard yellow with a bright fire engine red and that is what it looks like when you are applying the dye to the hair.  </li>
            <li> I thought I had it pretty clear, applied the conditioner, and the water was orange.  </li>
            <li> My hair is more wine red than runway red, but I still really like it.</li>
            <li> i got this dye after trying many different red dyes, and this one came out the brightest.</li>
            <li> but for me- red has never washed out so quickly.</li>
            <li> Not sure why so many reviewers are hating on this pretty color</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for color, I would highly suggest that you go elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for color, I would highly suggest that you go elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> He looked forward to ending my shade but instead ended up a lighter brown with reddish highlights, much like if the sun had lightened his hair naturally over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has not faded much at all since dyeing despite red washing out a bit for the first 5 washings or</li>
            <li> I have tried SO many different box dyes and had my hair professionally colored numerous times, but THIS is now my holy grail.</li>
            <li> Its far more red toned than orange and, in the course of four weeks has faded to a orange-copper color on me, except where I hit the roots 3 different times.</li>
            <li> And now she has stunning long red hair</li>
            <li> I decided to try this for a fun red color over the summer.  </li>
            <li> the fact that she her body type is top heavy zoftig and covered in tattoos and you get a natural weirdo magnet.  </li>
            <li> This is the EXACT color I&#x27;ve been trying to get for the last 5-6 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using Garnier&#x27;s Hot Tamale (76) for four years and stopped because my local stores just didn&#x27;t carry the shade I wanted.</li>
            <li> Usually reds don&#x27;t take to the roots as nicely as the rest of the hair, but this was almost the opposite.  </li>
            <li> Runway Red is an intense, true red without blue undertones.  </li>
            <li> It oxidized on my hair into a vibrant red after awhile anyways, so I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> Not red or reddish, but bright orange with slight pink undertones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Texture of hair is medium fine- not overly thick but not thin</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the water will -never- run clear.</li>
            <li> It makes me wonder what my hair would of looked like if I put it on my natural hair</li>
            <li> I am 46 years old and have been coloring my hair since I was about 20.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I picked Runway Red 6rr because it was on sale and because of that vibrant and unusual red shade.</li>
            <li> hair is healthy, I color as infrequently as possible, no more frequently than two months apart.  </li>
            <li> hair is healthy, I color as infrequently as possible, no more frequently than two months apart.  </li>
            <li> First let me say that she bought the first box at the store and then was not able to find it anywhere when it came time to reapply.  </li>
            <li> vibrant red that i get compliments on everywhere</li>
            <li> This one comes out a vibrant red like on the box.</li>
            <li> On a whim, because I had most of that 3rd bottle left, I dyed my son&#x27;s hair which is a very dark brown.</li>
            <li> hair that this was applied to had about four inches of virgin hair growth which is a medium dark golden brown in color.  </li>
            <li> I see normal guys taking an extra glance all the time and who can blame them</li>
            <li> I have tried many other reds and found them either to be too dark or too orange-y.</li>
            <li> This is just a major letdown.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I AM IN LOVE!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This requires far more maintenance than I amused to, the longevity of the color is questionable and costs more money than Feria since I had to use 2 boxes but the color itself is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little over a week later and my hair is splotchy, dull, and faded with about two spots of bright color.  </li>
            <li> I bought two boxes to dye my hair with, since one box of a different hair color didn&#x27;t completely cover my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the second time that she has used this color and WOW.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I had a lot of doubt about it working since I have dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;--This will dye towels the first few times- use old towels when drying your hair at first&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s bold brightness earning me now the nick name &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; and I hav noticed a few others now turning up with the  same color!!</li>
            <li> Normally I will use a red shade from Feria, one box is enough and while I&#x27;m not a professional, I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair for nearly 20 years and can get the job done.</li>
            <li> Back then I did it occasionally for a change, but I grayed early so have been coloring out of necessity for quite a while.  </li>
            <li> original hair is virgin dark brown, except for a couple streaks, pink and blue, shown in the photos.</li>
            <li> I went shopping at Dollar General last night and saw this box.</li>
            <li> but if you scrub your scalp gently when washing, it will tone that down</li>
            <li> /&gt;--This sells out quickly, so buy what you need because it might be hard to locate later&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;--This sells out quickly, so buy what you need because it might be hard to locate later&lt;</li>
            <li> It came out a beautiful Medium red when I first colored it, but faded horribly after only a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I received a bad box of this from this seller.</li>
            <li> Since my hair grows very slow, the color fades long before actually growing out and touching up every six weeks isn&#x27;t necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ten days into my color it is an absolute mess, and it didn&#x27;t even start out the way it was supposed to.  </li>
            <li> Ten days into my color it is an absolute mess, and it didn&#x27;t even start out the way it was supposed to.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible.s a little over a week later</li>
            <li> Still not enough to make up for dying my scalp and leaving orange puddles on my shower floor no matter how long I&#x27;ve been in there.</li>
            <li> I rinsed as long as I possibly could and finished.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m shocked at how many people have assumed it&#x27;s my natural color</li>
            <li> , I have NOT used a single hair therapy product in the last 6 months.</li>
            <li> It dyed my dark brown roots and old dyed dark red hair evenly.  </li>
            <li> my hair is pink not red. .  . . .</li>
            <li> After I got out, I towel dried and then used my blow dryer to finish drying it completely.</li>
            <li> I did NOT color over the blue, but I did color over the pink, and all the rest of my hair which was virgin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife is not naturally a redhead and if she ever sees this post I might not live to regret saying that.  </li>
            <li> But when I got out of the shower and started to dry my hair</li>
            <li> It also made my hair dry.</li>
            <li> hair is fairly long, halfway down my back and medium brown/red in color with lighter ends, darker roots with a little gray mixed in.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally med to dark brown and has a few reddish highlights in it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried using Vidal, and sadly might be my last.</li>
            <li> side note: If you&#x27;re a very dark shade starting off, you may not get drastic results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had bad results, though some have been better than others.  </li>
            <li> I did end up with a darker color than expected.  </li>
            <li> nothing about this experience was as I expected it.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair with too much grey for my taste.</li>
            <li> I could definitely see that my hair was uneven.  </li>
            <li> It looks ridiculous and I now have to go and pay to have a professional color</li>
            <li> It looks ridiculous and I now have to go and pay to have a professional color</li>
            <li> Came as expected, worked as a charm!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fading way faster than any other hair color I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> the rest of my head was just a dull red.</li>
            <li> I rinsed my hair for about twice as long as I usually do and the color just kept running out.  </li>
            <li> so I covered my pillow with a dark towel.  </li>
            <li> it washes down the drain, despite that they&#x27;ve included a conditioner to preserve the color, enough to use once a week for at least four weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Unlike with my Feria, I had to use two boxes of dye to achieve an even all-over color (the 3rd box was because I missed a spot  in the front; user error, not product failure).</li>
            <li> and I know my hair has not grown a half inch in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> because only my roots are dyed, and only in random places and splotches.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend using g two boxes for long or thick hair.</li>
            <li> This color does not stay on and leaves little patches on your hair.</li>
            <li> dye did not show up on any of my dark hair at all, not even in the sun, except for at the roots where it is an ugly orangey color (not even a pretty orange like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been unable to completely correct it for weeks now.</li>
            <li> After it dried, though, I just didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> And a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had bleached my hair a few weeks ago and dyed it a strawberry-ish blond color.</li>
            <li> When I dried my hair, it looked uneven.  </li>
            <li> Among other reds, I did try this one, twice, and it is my least favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This dye is not easy to find, and if you manage to get one, it often will be subdued or fade quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once I got it all in and set my timer, my head itched really bad the first 10ish minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is, by far, the absolute worst hair color I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I was not sure what to expect with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have no more need to hair therapy</li>
            <li> but I would also suggest maybe a taser or at least some pepper spreay.</li>
            <li> At least my hair wouldn&#x27;t be 4-toned</li>
            <li> and i have dyed my hair for at least 10yrs now.</li>
            <li> at least a shimmery GLINT of it in the sunshine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;--The amount of dye in one box is very small, so</li>
            <li> And I am serious when I say this</li>
            <li> Seriously give it a try.</li>
            <li> It stings, which isn&#x27;t too bad, and the smell is middle of the road.</li>
            <li> very thick hair-</li>
            <li> very thick hair-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some bad dye jobs in the past, so even if it didn&#x27;t turn out the way I wanted, oh well.</li>
            <li> can someone explain wtf happened</li>
            <li> but there is something about this hair color that makes the creepy guys come crawling out from under a rock.  </li>
            <li> Sadly I&#x27;ve noticed it gets lighter with every wash.</li>
            <li> Too bad it faded after two washing&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Never looks bad.</li>
            <li> This was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE!!!!  </li>
            <li> HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> It was looking horrible</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible.</li>

            <li> Purchased at target.  HORRIBLE!!!!  Didn&#x27;t deposit color on 85 percent of my hair but the part that did is ronald mcdonal red.  I have normal light brown hair as shown on the box.</li>
            <li> I bought the run way red . . . . . . my hair is pink not red. .  . . . can someone explain wtf happened</li>
            <li> Love Runway red, first time i tried it and i just love how vibrant the red color was, It&#x27;s so much more Vibrant Then Feria Ruby Rush thats what i was using before i tried this color. let&#x27;s see how long it will hold if it does great i will continue to use this color instead of feria, I will start buying through u guys</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE! This turned my roots BRIGHT ORANGE and the rest of my head was just a dull red. I&#x27;ve been unable to completely correct it for weeks now.</li>
            <li> Have to say I really love this product. Has great color that really pops and have gotten so many compliments by complete strangers who love the color. Even at work my patients and co works have really made alot of comments on how they love the color  with it&#x27;s bold brightness earning me now the nick name &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; and I hav noticed a few others now turning up with the  same color!! They did a great job with this~~Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> Runway Red is my favorite shade of any hair dye. I never felt like my hair was brittle or burnt out even though there has to be an oxidizer in this dye.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my daughter&#x27;s hair for quite some time with red dye.  The color that she glows in is a brilliant copper red hair.  This dye is not easy to find, and if you manage to get one, it often will be subdued or fade quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vidal Sassoon London Luxe 6RR Runway Red is a GORGEOUS copper red.  It is such a unique color.  Imagine mixing glowy yellow mustard yellow with a bright fire engine red and that is what it looks like when you are applying the dye to the hair.  I was not sure what to expect with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT KIND OF HAIR WAS THIS APPLIED TO?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair that this was applied to had about four inches of virgin hair growth which is a medium dark golden brown in color.  The rest of the hair was a very faded auburn which was almost brown in color,  light to medium in nature.  Length is about shoulder blade length.  Texture of hair is medium fine- not overly thick but not thin either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW DID THIS DYE PERFORM?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What impressed me most about this dye is that the color was brilliant on the virgin hair as much as it was on the other hair.  Usually reds don&#x27;t take to the roots as nicely as the rest of the hair, but this was almost the opposite.  It really looked amazing right up to the scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is bright right from the start, but after four weeks, it is still just as brilliant at the roots as it is the rest of the hair.  This has not faded much at all since dyeing despite red washing out a bit for the first 5 washings or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW WAS THE HAIR CARED FOR?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair was washed using non sodium lauryl sulfate shampoos and the conditioner that came with the dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER COMMENTS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--This will dye the scalp a bit but if you scrub your scalp gently when washing, it will tone that down&lt;br /&gt;--This will dye towels the first few times- use old towels when drying your hair at first&lt;br /&gt;--The amount of dye in one box is very small, so if you have longer hair, plan on buying two boxes- very thick hair- three&lt;br /&gt;--This sells out quickly, so buy what you need because it might be hard to locate later&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best red hair dyes I have ever used.  The color is unique and gorgeous and lasts very well.  It is the perfect copper red color with a brilliance that turns heads yet does not look garish.  It does not fade like so many reds, and if you take care of it and how you shampoo it, you can get more time out of it than most red dyes.have longer hair, plan on buying two boxes- very thick hair- three&lt;br /&gt;--This sells out quickly, so buy what you need because it might be hard to locate later&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best red hair dyes I have ever used.

            <li> Easy to use - just two steps to mix and use - wonderful color and very good conditioner..  This is my new color now!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair red for about 6/7 years and this is one of the best and most intense red colors. It&#x27;s pretty hard To find it in store, so it&#x27;s amazing to see it on amazon. Came as expected, worked as a charm!</li>
            <li> I get tons of compliments and it doesn&#x27;t fade much.  I did end up with a darker color than expected.  My hair is more wine red than runway red, but I still really like it.</li>
            <li> Love the color. It&#x27;s really bright and has lasted for almost a month now at full color! I recommend using g two boxes for long or thick hair.</li>
            <li> I bought two boxes to dye my hair with, since one box of a different hair color didn&#x27;t completely cover my hair. And when you pull it out of the box and mix it up, the concotion is light orange. It scared me a bit, to be honest. It seemed like it was doing its job while I had it on my hair, and looked fine after I washed it out. After it dried, though, I just didn&#x27;t like it. It wasn&#x27;t the red I was looking for at all. It was more of an orange/red, like fire. And God forbid I walk out into the sun, where it just gets brighter. It turned my roots orange, literally. And after I waited a week, I washed my hair for the first time, I could already see the color fading dramatically and the length of my hair turning into its original blonde. I&#x27;ve had this color on my hair for only a week and two days and it&#x27;s fading way faster than any other hair color I&#x27;ve ever had. If it works for you, that&#x27;s great, but if you&#x27;re thinking of trying it, please use any thing other than this. Try Loreal Hicolor from Sally&#x27;s. They have magenta and red, it lasts longer than most dyes, and it&#x27;s healthier for your hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried SO many different box dyes and had my hair professionally colored numerous times, but THIS is now my holy grail. The color came out perfect and very even despite my heavy-handed application - and it&#x27;s actually a little more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking than it appears on the box, IMO. It has a lot of dimension and is just the most beautiful color. There is also barely any chemical smell during the dying process, which was sort of astounding. Even the conditioner that came with this kit is just awesome, and my hair is as smooth and silky as ever. Will buy over and over again.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Holds color and is perfect! Just not sure why it&#x27;s not in the stores, but I am glad to know I can find it here! Love this!!</li>
            <li> I love it!!!! don&#x27;t think twice about getting this. It works great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I received a bad box of this from this seller. Right off the bat, something seemed off. It was mixing into an orange-y color in the bowl instead of a red. I&#x27;ve never used this brand before, but I know people who have used this exact dye without issue, so I just went with it. It oxidized on my hair into a vibrant red after awhile anyways, so I had high hopes. However, I just washed it out and it turned my light-medium brown hair to ORANGE. Not even a red-orange. Just straight up orange. And then it didn&#x27;t even take in a good portion of my hair (and I have an overgrown pixie bob, there&#x27;s not a lot of hair!) I&#x27;m supposed to be going out tonight and I&#x27;ll have to go out with orange hair and then come home and dye over it with something else before work tomorrow. I was so excited about this. This is just a major letdown. And a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This color, 6rr, is a super bright eye-catching red, almost unnatural when compared to the other reds available today which makes it very appealing. My end results were very close to what it pictured on the box which is also unusual and both of these are points in its favor but if I&#x27;d read reviews first, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it. So here I am sharing my experience as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fairly long, halfway down my back and medium brown/red in color with lighter ends, darker roots with a little gray mixed in. Normally I will use a red shade from Feria, one box is enough and while I&#x27;m not a professional, I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair for nearly 20 years and can get the job done. Since my hair grows very slow, the color fades long before actually growing out and touching up every six weeks isn&#x27;t necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked Runway Red 6rr because it was on sale and because of that vibrant and unusual red shade. Its far more red toned than orange and, in the course of four weeks has faded to a orange-copper color on me, except where I hit the roots 3 different times. Unlike with my Feria, I had to use two boxes of dye to achieve an even all-over color (the 3rd box was because I missed a spot  in the front; user error, not product failure). Because the color IS so bright, any dark patches or new growth will be more obvious and on me, this has happened just 3 weeks later. 4 weeks later and I either need a temporary cover up or to re-dye it and I know my hair has not grown a half inch in 3 weeks. On the positive side, its not my gray hair that shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A side note: If you&#x27;re a very dark shade starting off, you may not get drastic results. On a whim, because I had most of that 3rd bottle left, I dyed my son&#x27;s hair which is a very dark brown. He looked forward to ending my shade but instead ended up a lighter brown with reddish highlights, much like if the sun had lightened his hair naturally over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This requires far more maintenance than I amused to, the longevity of the color is questionable and costs more money than Feria since I had to use 2 boxes but the color itself is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> My wife is not naturally a redhead and if she ever sees this post I might not live to regret saying that.  But she was never THIS red before.  This is the second time that she has used this color and WOW. First let me say that she bought the first box at the store and then was not able to find it anywhere when it came time to reapply.  So she ordered from here, and the only reason it&#x27;s getting 4 instead of 5 stars is the price.  But as to application, color and overall look it would have been a 5.  She looks amazing in it.  And that is where things go off the rails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is a sweet and wonderful woman who always has a natural smile.  Add to that the fact that she her body type is top heavy zoftig and covered in tattoos and you get a natural weirdo magnet.  And now she has stunning long red hair and it&#x27;s like a beacon for them.  I see normal guys taking an extra glance all the time and who can blame them but there is something about this hair color that makes the creepy guys come crawling out from under a rock.  I don&#x27;t know what they think the red hair means to them but I have seen this behavior with my own two eyes.  I&#x27;m not saying don&#x27;t buy it but I would also suggest maybe a taser or at least some pepper spreay.</li>
            <li> I use VS for shampoo &amp; conditioner &amp; I also use it for my hair color too. It&#x27;s never let me down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reds fade fast no matter what you use. Always always always use cool water on your hair. Saves the color and helps prevent breakage.</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair red off and on since 2008-2009. My hair is naturally med to dark brown and has a few reddish highlights in it. I went shopping at Dollar General last night and saw this box. I had to get it. After reading reviews, I was terrified to use it but figured since I already bought it I would give a whirl. I&#x27;ve had some bad dye jobs in the past, so even if it didn&#x27;t turn out the way I wanted, oh well. At least my hair wouldn&#x27;t be 4-toned (oh, that was fun).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this dye was simple as pie. I love the gloves that came with the product. They reminded me of doctors gloves and I wasn&#x27;t worried my nails would pop through them. It didn&#x27;t stink like a lot of hair dyes I&#x27;ve used, which is always a plus. Once I got it all in and set my timer, my head itched really bad the first 10ish minutes. Once I got use to that, I didn&#x27;t even notice. When I got in the shower, it looked like I had went on a mass killing spree. hahahaha. After I got out, I towel dried and then used my blow dryer to finish drying it completely. The light in my bathroom isn&#x27;t the greatest and it was dark out, so I waited until this morning to take a picture of it. Needless to say, I AM IN LOVE! This is the EXACT color I&#x27;ve been trying to get for the last 5-6 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a naturally very light complected and I think it goes great with my skin tone, plus it brings out m eye color beautifully (green). I totally recommend this product. I had bleached my hair a few weeks ago and dyed it a strawberry-ish blond color. Maybe that&#x27;s why my hair turned out so well. It makes me wonder what my hair would of looked like if I put it on my natural hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone can help me on uploading a pic of my hair, I would greatly appreciate it.</li>
            <li> This was just the shade I was looking for! Sadly I&#x27;ve noticed it gets lighter with every wash. But with this one it washes out much faster than any dye I have ever used and i have dyed my hair for at least 10yrs now. already looking for a new color that wont fade so quickly.</li>
            <li> vibrant red that i get compliments on everywhere i go.  i&#x27;m shocked at how many people have assumed it&#x27;s my natural color (it&#x27;s SO red, which i love)...it faded out in about 2-3 weeks the first time i used it, and the second time it lasted for about 3.5 weeks before it became a dingy brownish-red (i have light brown hair naturally).  i don&#x27;t mind the extra time it takes to maintain this color, because this color is PHENOMENAL.  well worth the inconvenience.</li>
            <li> i got this dye after trying many different red dyes, and this one came out the brightest. i highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This color does not stay on and leaves little patches on your hair. I am sticking with Loreal Feria</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with this red.  It dyed my dark brown roots and old dyed dark red hair evenly.  I recommend the red for sure.  Worked so much better than any of Loreal&#x27;s reds.</li>
            <li> I got this at Walmart in did my hair it turned my hair orange not IM pressed</li>
            <li> 6RR Runway Red is an intense, true red without blue undertones.  My hair is medium brown with a small amount of gray and the coverage is perfect all over.  I get compliments on the color all the time.</li>
            <li> The color itself was beautiful beyond belief! Too bad it faded after two washing&#x27;s. Dx I know red doesn&#x27;t stay well in the hair- but for me- red has never washed out so quickly.</li>
            <li> I used the runway red. I have medium brown hair, and I left the dye in for 20 minutes. What was supposed to be a dark red color, turned out bright orange! I wouldn&#x27;t use this again if you paid me!</li>
            <li> I have been thinking about this color for MONTHS. I read tons of reviews about it. It seemed like there was a lot of complaining about orange hues, and I decided I would be OK if my hair came out orange. A lot of the complaints came from people with much lighter hair than mine.&lt;br /&gt;I WISH my hair came out orange, I wish it came out ... anything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original hair is virgin dark brown, except for a couple streaks, pink and blue, shown in the photos. I did NOT color over the blue, but I did color over the pink, and all the rest of my hair which was virgin.&lt;br /&gt;The dye did not show up on any of my dark hair at all, not even in the sun, except for at the roots where it is an ugly orangey color (not even a pretty orange like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind). It makes it look like my scalp is dyed even though it isn&#x27;t. In fact, it ONLY looks like my scalp is dyed... because only my roots are dyed, and only in random places and splotches.&lt;br /&gt;My pink hair ended up bright orange, and I like that.&lt;br /&gt;But nothing about this experience was as I expected it. I was SO looking forward to even just a TINGE of redness ... at least a shimmery GLINT of it in the sunshine. But no.... nothing... This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried using Vidal, and sadly might be my last.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve only ever bought this product in stores so this review will have nothing to do with this seller.&lt;br /&gt;Before I found this product, I was having my hair bleached and dyed at a salon every month which cost me $100 plus all the hair therapy products I had to use to counter act the damage from the bleach, easily another $60 a month. Then I saw the commercial for the London LuxeLine and thought to myself &amp;#34;What do I have to loose?&amp;#34; So I went to my local store and tried it out that night. The first time I used it, I had a lot of doubt about it working since I have dark brown hair. But when I got out of the shower and started to dry my hair I saw a very pretty bright red, while it was still soaked. This product worked so well, and I didn&#x27;t even need to use bleach. The color stays in my hair better than the Salon dye ever did and I have no more need to hair therapy products.&lt;br /&gt;As of now, I&#x27;ve been using the Runway Red for about 6 months, and this is probably the healthiest my hair has been since I started dying it 13 years ago. I&#x27;m not seeing as many split ends and I&#x27;m not shedding nearly as much as I was. And I am serious when I say this, I have NOT used a single hair therapy product in the last 6 months. This product is all around amazing. I will never go to a salon again. Seriously give it a try.</li>
            <li> I use box hair color all the time and have used different shades of red over the years.  I had a $3.00 coupon that was about to expire when I decided to try VS over Olia which I have colored my hair with before.  The Walmart I purchased this color from only had this color red on the VS website noticed  there are 3 more shades to choose from and I still would have picked this one from the look on the box its a bright vibrant red color.  My red color (Feria- Cherry crush)  and highlights (Garnier cookies -n-cream) was beginning to fade.  Not sure why so many reviewers are hating on this pretty color I am pleased with my color.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this color! I have dark brown hair with too much grey for my taste. I have tried many other reds and found them either to be too dark or too orange-y. This one comes out a vibrant red like on the box. It seems to resist fading, too. I get compliments all the time on my hair. I really hope they don&#x27;t stop making this color. I&#x27;ll be sad to have to find another favorite.</li>
            <li> The perfect time shade I was looking fer. ..</li>
            <li> best color! Super bright! Stays longer than others!</li>
            <li> The best red ever.&lt;br /&gt;Used to be a buy my own dye and mix with toner at Sallys girl.&lt;br /&gt;One time it was the middle of the night and I needed dye. Got this and took a chance.&lt;br /&gt;By far the most vibrant red I have had. Its beautiful. Get tons of compliments. Never looks bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using Garnier&#x27;s Hot Tamale (76) for four years and stopped because my local stores just didn&#x27;t carry the shade I wanted. Among other reds, I did try this one, twice, and it is my least favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the water will -never- run clear. Not even after almost twenty minutes of rinsing. Not whether you&#x27;ve had it on for the recommended amount of time or longer. Second, it will dye -everything- on your head, including your scalp, and your skin will turn orange for a while. It stings, which isn&#x27;t too bad, and the smell is middle of the road. I LIKE the color (on my hair, not so much the scalp), but it doesn&#x27;t last-- it washes down the drain, despite that they&#x27;ve included a conditioner to preserve the color, enough to use once a week for at least four weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what VS was thinking when they made this, but I can only think they didn&#x27;t actually try their product. The only good thing I can say about this is that it didn&#x27;t fry my hair as much as some other brands have. ...Still not enough to make up for dying my scalp and leaving orange puddles on my shower floor no matter how long I&#x27;ve been in there. When I dye my hair, I expect my hair to be dyed, not the rest of me; even with short-time application, it was an issue. :|</li>
            <li> This was very disappointing. It came out a beautiful Medium red when I first colored it, but faded horribly after only a week. It also made my hair dry. I have been bright red for 6 months using color from Sally&#x27;s and the color lasted from 4-6 weeks. If you are seeking a bright red, definitely try Loreal Hi Color Highlights! I mixed a tube of Magenta and Red and finally got the red I wanted without bleaching! Sally&#x27;s stocks many colors in this line, and there are tons of reviews on the web! Avoid box colors...I learned my lesson.:(</li>
            <li> The color is AMAZING!  But every time I go into shower it&#x27;s a pool of blood. &#x3D;O  I just hope in summer time when I sweat, my sweat won&#x27;t be the same color as my hair dye.</li>
            <li> I am 46 years old and have been coloring my hair since I was about 20.  Back then I did it occasionally for a change, but I grayed early so have been coloring out of necessity for quite a while.  I color my own hair and have tried a variety of brands, though I like to stick with my favorites as older ones aren&#x27;t made anymore and new ones come out.  I&#x27;ve never had bad results, though some have been better than others.  I wanted to explain that I have done this a lot and am familiar with the process and with how my own hair takes color.  I decided to try this for a fun red color over the summer.  Never again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is, by far, the absolute worst hair color I have ever used.  I checked the directions, like I always do.  I mixed the color and started to apply.  I know to never judge a color by the way it looks in the bottle so I wasn&#x27;t worried about how orange it looked.  I applied the color and waited the maximum time.  The color remained orange.  I rinsed my hair for about twice as long as I usually do and the color just kept running out.  I thought I had it pretty clear, applied the conditioner, and the water was orange.  I rinsed as long as I possibly could and finished.  My hair was orange.  Not red or reddish, but bright orange with slight pink undertones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t get too panicked over my hair and even though it wasn&#x27;t the color I wanted, I was OK with it.  I was worried about the color rubbing off on my sheets so I covered my pillow with a dark towel.  The next day when I showered the water was once again running orange through my shampoo and conditioner.  When I dried my hair, it looked uneven.  I wasn&#x27;t sure why as my hair was fully saturated and I even had my husband help check to make sure I had full coverage.  That night I left the towel again.  The next day when I did my hair I could definitely see that my hair was uneven.  Dull in spots, and bright orange in others.  It was looking horrible and it was only the third day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little over a week later and my hair is splotchy, dull, and faded with about two spots of bright color.  It looks ridiculous and I now have to go and pay to have a professional color my hair, something I haven&#x27;t had to do in 26 years of coloring my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is healthy, I color as infrequently as possible, no more frequently than two months apart.  I never thought to check reviews on hair color and I wish I did because I see some people have had very similar experiences to mine.  If you&#x27;re looking for color, I would highly suggest that you go elsewhere.  Ten days into my color it is an absolute mess, and it didn&#x27;t even start out the way it was supposed to.  Absolutely horrible.s a little over a week later and my hair is splotchy, dull, and faded with about two spots of bright color.
