    <ol>
            <li>Great doing business with you!</li>
            <li>so I am very happy to find it at Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, for one-two coats it is awesome</li>
            <li>This item lives up to the excellent comments I had heard about it.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>great product, I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!!</li>
            <li>Holy mackerel this is amazing!</li>
            <li>This top coat is the best thing to happen to nails.  </li>
            <li>This top coat is excellent.  </li>
            <li>and I still have a GOOD amount</li>
            <li>Painted at 8:45 at night, fell asleep by 9:15, woke with gorgeous nails without any creases or marks.  </li>
            <li>product Deborah Lippmann makes is exceptional, including this one.</li>
            <li>Great Top Coat.</li>
            <li>This product is great as a top coat.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that great for more than 2 layers.</li>
            <li>..in my opinion, this is BETTER than Seche Vite!</li>
            <li>Everything was exactly as described, and it worked perfectly</li>
            <li>not as good as UV cured top coat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was delivered fast, well packed and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>ALL of my friends use this top coat when they come and peruse through my polish collection (which is often)and</li>
            <li>I love how it dries your polish ALL the way through..</li>
            <li>And this top coat--well, let&#x27;s just say I don&#x27;t have to wait for drying.</li>
            <li>, my polish-savvy friends, this top coat is HANDS DOWN the best top coat I have ever used in my life.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and you can work quickly with it, which is a good thing since it starts drying right away.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST fast drying top coat i&#x27;ve used in a long time!</li>
            <li>truly is a wonderful product -- gives a shiny, hard top coat that dries in minutes!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really amazing how fast this product dries my nails.</li>
            <li>I was on the hunt for a great topcoat that would help my polish stay on my nails as my polish tends to chip off the same day I apply it.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but so so worth it!</li>
            <li>Top Coat Mega Shine has done a much better job by far.</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t have too much polish on (like 3 or more coats), this should work great.</li>
            <li>This is a fast drying top coat--</li>
            <li>Your nails honestly look salon-quality with only one coat of this stuff!</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price</li>
            <li>but for me, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the $20 price tag.</li>
            <li>am I in my right mind?!\\&quot;.....</li>
            <li>That hand lasted a bit longer but the polish practically peeled right off my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is beautiful, not too thick, and a nice alternative to Deborah Lippmann&#x27;s \\&quot;Hard Rock\\&quot; as a top coat for when you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
            <li>and I love Deborah Lippman nail polish, it really lasts and holds better than other nail polishes out there.</li>
            <li>the result is very shiny and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>dries very fast.</li>
            <li>It dries polish within 1 minute (for real) and gives your nails a shiny gleam that would make even the most skilled esthetician green with envy.</li>
            <li>you are ready to go!</li>
            <li>but this product does exactly what it is intended to do</li>
            <li>but you really do get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li>There is no yellowing, and it&#x27;s long-lasting and everything anyone could possibly want in a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very shiny!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be willing to pay twice the price.  </li>
            <li>they can&#x27;t tell me enough how much they love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I came to realize the thickness is actually a GOOD thing because it definitely extends the life of your manicure and actually makes nails break-proof.</li>
            <li>hand with SV topcoat had a blindingly bright shine, dried just as fast and lasted for 3 days before chipping/peeling off my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only peeve about this particular top coat is it has a slightly funny smell.</li>
            <li>but eventually I bit the bullet and made the purchase after reading a plethra of positive reviews on Lippmann&#x27;s polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>but if you are layering it makes sense to make sure that you have time allotted to sit still and dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For the impatient nail addict, or mom on the go, buy this top coat!</li>
            <li>; I really needed a fast dry top coat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>Dries fast and keeps a shine no matter what polish brand you decide to use under it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve completely finished my initial bottle, and have purchased two more.</li>
            <li>If you really want dry polish quickly this is worth the expenditure.</li>
            <li>As far as some of the other reviews about a nice gel like shine.....</li>
            <li>If you are the type of person who fills in your manicure when it chips than this is probably a great top coat for you because you&#x27;ll get a lot of wear out of your nail polish, but since I&#x27;m fickle and I get bored with my color quickly, I&#x27;d just as soon save $15 and use Seche Vite and reapply my polish altogether every few days.</li>
            <li>However, the thickness makes it a bit tricky to use the first few times you apply the top coat.</li>
            <li>this top coat dried fine until I attempted to move about 15 minutes later and the polish still got smeared.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, even with the high price tag.  </li>
            <li>Keeps a high shine on my polish.  </li>
            <li>I used to have to set aside a significant amount of time to let my nails dry before I could go to sleep or do anything.  </li>
            <li>However, I do have a sensitive nose and the fact that it dries fast outweighs this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricy, but I really prefer it over other, cheaper top coats and it seems to last longer.</li>
            <li>I have very limited time to do my nails but love having them different colors.  </li>
            <li>this speed dry top coat did, indeed, speedily dry the nail polish.</li>
            <li>Deborah Lippmann products are pricey, but a whole different world away from cheap drugstore products, or even any other brand I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>literally starts to dry almost right away.</li>
            <li>and then one light layer of Wet n Wild Fast Dry \\&quot;The Gold and the Beautiful\\&quot; and</li>
            <li>I used to be plagued by tacky manicures - it would take up to an hour at least to be able to do anything with my hands.</li>
            <li>I can do my nails early evening and not worry that they&#x27;ll still be tacky at bedtime.</li>
            <li>it does not adhere to natural nails, but binds well to polish.</li>
            <li>If you want your nails to look sleek and professional, this is the way to go.  </li>
            <li>It did dry quickly however, it also dried quickly in the bottle.</li>
            <li>overall I feel that Deborah Lippmann Addicted to Speed is a really good product</li>
            <li>hand with DL ATS topcoat had a nice subtle shine, dried very fast and the polish lasted 2 1/2 days before chipping</li>
            <li>Not only are my nails dry in about 10 minutes, they look like shiny colorful glass.  </li>
            <li>and it really is dry ultra fast.</li>
            <li>It does indeed dry fast</li>
            <li>hard &amp; makes them super shiney!</li>
            <li>The polish has lasted over two weeks easy with no signs of wear except the usual tip of nail wear but even that did not show signs until the second week.</li>
            <li>My super dark polishes will last a week.</li>
            <li>Even after waiting for them to dry, a lot of top coats caused bubbles and made the color look dull.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pretty much addicted to painting my nails for the past 10 years or so (I am 23 years old) and believe me when I tell you I have tried EVERY top coat the market has to offer.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really expect anything other than gel or acrylic to last.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>Then apply the quick dry &amp; in 15 mins or less</li>
    </ol>

            <li> In about 5 minutes my nails are dry</li>
            <li> and that is to speed dry polish.</li>
            <li> Seemed to dry quicker.</li>
            <li> Let that totally dry.</li>
            <li> With a little practice though, you&#x27;ll be totally fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent upwards of $4000 on nail polish alone throughout my lifetime--needless to say, I like to think of myself as a &#x27;polish connoisseur&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first, the price tag made me a bit skeptical, \\&quot;HOW can a topcoat cost me $20?</li>
            <li> I reapply every other day.  </li>
            <li> I follow directions carefully - wait 2 minutes from last coat of nail color, then apply Addicted To Speed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like my color lasted any longer than previously</li>
            <li> Half way through the bottle it became gooey.</li>
            <li> Follow instructions like it says (2 minutes after last coat applied, thin coat of DL)</li>
            <li> I paint my nails everyday</li>
            <li> I am always in a hurrying, it seems, and never more so as when I paint my fingernails.</li>
            <li> I bought base, Naked polish cover a this-all form same maker.</li>
            <li> thing I can say negatively about this product is that it IS a bit thick...</li>
            <li> Addicted To Speed topcoat for about 2 months now</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nothing blew my socks off like Deborah Lippmann&#x27;s &#x27;Addicted To Speed&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Addicted To Speed (DL ATS)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about expensive polish.</li>
            <li> Disappointed about that...</li>
            <li> I put on a base coat.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Deborah Lippmann Addicted To Speed topcoat for about 2 months now and it&#x27;s really amazing how fast this product dries my nails. I follow directions carefully - wait 2 minutes from last coat of nail color, then apply Addicted To Speed. In about 5 minutes my nails are dry and I can go about my business. I used to be plagued by tacky manicures - it would take up to an hour at least to be able to do anything with my hands. And there was no way that I could do a manicure in the evening - I would wake up with ruined nails. Not anymore since I discovered Deborah Lippmann. I can do my nails early evening and not worry that they&#x27;ll still be tacky at bedtime. Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but so so worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pretty much addicted to painting my nails for the past 10 years or so (I am 23 years old) and believe me when I tell you I have tried EVERY top coat the market has to offer. I&#x27;ve spent upwards of $4000 on nail polish alone throughout my lifetime--needless to say, I like to think of myself as a &#x27;polish connoisseur&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing blew my socks off like Deborah Lippmann&#x27;s &#x27;Addicted To Speed&#x27;. At first, the price tag made me a bit skeptical, \\&quot;HOW can a topcoat cost me $20? am I in my right mind?!\\&quot;.....but eventually I bit the bullet and made the purchase after reading a plethra of positive reviews on Lippmann&#x27;s polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, my polish-savvy friends, this top coat is HANDS DOWN the best top coat I have ever used in my life. It dries polish within 1 minute (for real) and gives your nails a shiny gleam that would make even the most skilled esthetician green with envy. Your nails honestly look salon-quality with only one coat of this stuff! I&#x27;ve completely finished my initial bottle, and have purchased two more. ALL of my friends use this top coat when they come and peruse through my polish collection (which is often)and they can&#x27;t tell me enough how much they love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONLY thing I can say negatively about this product is that it IS a bit thick...I came to realize the thickness is actually a GOOD thing because it definitely extends the life of your manicure and actually makes nails break-proof. However, the thickness makes it a bit tricky to use the first few times you apply the top coat. With a little practice though, you&#x27;ll be totally fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will NOT regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST fast drying top coat i&#x27;ve used in a long time! When they say \\&quot;ultra quick\\&quot; they&#x27;re NOT lying! After your final coat of color, wait about a minute to give your color time to set. Then apply the quick dry &amp; in 15 mins or less you are ready to go! I love how it dries your polish ALL the way through..hard &amp; makes them super shiney! Totally worth the price..in my opinion, this is BETTER than Seche Vite!</li>
            <li> Great doing business with you! Will definitely shop with this merchant again.  Everything was exactly as described, and it worked perfectly</li>
            <li> This works very well. I am always in a hurrying, it seems, and never more so as when I paint my fingernails. As long as you don&#x27;t have too much polish on (like 3 or more coats), this should work great.</li>
            <li> Great Top Coat.Dries fast and keeps a shine no matter what polish brand you decide to use under it.If you really want dry polish quickly this is worth the expenditure.</li>
            <li> use it with the the rest of the gel system. not as good as UV cured top coat. It &#x27;peels&#x27; away from your nail, like peeling sticky tape of a surface. I&#x27;m sticking with UV cured gel at home system.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle.  It&#x27;s a bit pricy, but I really prefer it over other, cheaper top coats and it seems to last longer.</li>
            <li> this speed dry top coat did, indeed, speedily dry the nail polish. The polish has lasted over two weeks easy with no signs of wear except the usual tip of nail wear but even that did not show signs until the second week. As far as some of the other reviews about a nice gel like shine.....NOT!  My Sally Hansen Top Coat Mega Shine has done a much better job by far. Disappointed about that...but this product does exactly what it is intended to do and that is to speed dry polish. Pricey though.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to polish your nails, you might as well get this. You can polish, apply this, and go. Not all that waiting and then getting smudges. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Holy mackerel this is amazing! Been looking for things to replace my Seche Vite because of the harmful chemicals, and the price tag of DL scared me off but I thought &amp;#34;What the heck!&amp;#34; I really needed a fast dry top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And boy does the name serve justice to the product! Follow instructions like it says (2 minutes after last coat applied, thin coat of DL) and it really is dry ultra fast. Go ahead and go about your business for the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s $20 yes, but you really do get your moneys worth. I paint my nails everyday and I&#x27;ve had this product for almost two months now and I still have a GOOD amount left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the impatient nail addict, or mom on the go, buy this top coat!</li>
            <li> *****&lt;br /&gt;Every product Deborah Lippmann makes is exceptional, including this one. This is a fast drying top coat--literally starts to dry almost right away. It goes on easily and you can work quickly with it, which is a good thing since it starts drying right away. It is beautiful, not too thick, and a nice alternative to Deborah Lippmann&#x27;s \\&quot;Hard Rock\\&quot; as a top coat for when you&#x27;re in a hurry. Deborah Lippmann products are pricey, but a whole different world away from cheap drugstore products, or even any other brand I&#x27;ve ever used. There is no yellowing, and it&#x27;s long-lasting and everything anyone could possibly want in a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;*****</li>
            <li> Very shiny! Seemed to dry quicker.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness for Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;Nordstrom&#x27;s cannot keep this in stock so I am very happy to find it at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It truly is a wonderful product -- gives a shiny, hard top coat that dries in minutes!&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered fast, well packed and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> This product is great as a top coat. it does not adhere to natural nails, but binds well to polish. the result is very shiny and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that great for more than 2 layers. I put on a base coat. Let that totally dry. Then I added 2 coats of O.P.I \\&quot;Yoga-ta Get This Blue\\&quot; and then one light layer of Wet n Wild Fast Dry \\&quot;The Gold and the Beautiful\\&quot; and this top coat dried fine until I attempted to move about 15 minutes later and the polish still got smeared. So, for one-two coats it is awesome but if you are layering it makes sense to make sure that you have time allotted to sit still and dry. Hence the 4 instead of 5 stars. I would still purchase this again, however.</li>
            <li> I have very limited time to do my nails but love having them different colors.  I used to have to set aside a significant amount of time to let my nails dry before I could go to sleep or do anything.  Even after waiting for them to dry, a lot of top coats caused bubbles and made the color look dull.  This top coat is the best thing to happen to nails.  Not only are my nails dry in about 10 minutes, they look like shiny colorful glass.  I&#x27;m not exaggerating either.  Painted at 8:45 at night, fell asleep by 9:15, woke with gorgeous nails without any creases or marks.  I highly recommend this, even with the high price tag.  If you want your nails to look sleek and professional, this is the way to go.  I didn&#x27;t feel like my color lasted any longer than previously but as a physician I use a lot of sanitizer and wash my hands a lot so I don&#x27;t really expect anything other than gel or acrylic to last.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be willing to pay twice the price.  Dries fast enough for me to put on at night, read in bed a few minutes, then go to sleep.  No sheet prints when I wake up!!!! Keeps a high shine on my polish.  I reapply every other day.  My super dark polishes will last a week.</li>
            <li> great product, I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  dries very fast.</li>
            <li> I was on the hunt for a great topcoat that would help my polish stay on my nails as my polish tends to chip off the same day I apply it. I purchased Deborah Lippman Addicted To Speed (DL ATS) topcoat and also Seche Vite (SV). DL ATS cost $20 for a bottle, SV cost $5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hand with DL ATS topcoat had a nice subtle shine, dried very fast and the polish lasted 2 1/2 days before chipping lightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hand with SV topcoat had a blindingly bright shine, dried just as fast and lasted for 3 days before chipping/peeling off my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the DL ATS the chipping was slower and the polish didn&#x27;t peel off my nails the way it did with SV. That hand lasted a bit longer but the polish practically peeled right off my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall I feel that Deborah Lippmann Addicted to Speed is a really good product but for me, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the $20 price tag. If you are the type of person who fills in your manicure when it chips than this is probably a great top coat for you because you&#x27;ll get a lot of wear out of your nail polish, but since I&#x27;m fickle and I get bored with my color quickly, I&#x27;d just as soon save $15 and use Seche Vite and reapply my polish altogether every few days.</li>
            <li> This item lives up to the excellent comments I had heard about it.  It has earned a &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; from me😃!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about expensive polish. This has converted me. I bought base, Naked polish cover a this-all form same maker. My manicures have never lasted as long. And this top coat--well, let&#x27;s just say I don&#x27;t have to wait for drying. I don&#x27;t smudge at all.</li>
            <li> Nail tech introduced me to this line.  This top coat is excellent.  Definitely holds the polish; durable.</li>
            <li> It does indeed dry fast and I love Deborah Lippman nail polish, it really lasts and holds better than other nail polishes out there. My only peeve about this particular top coat is it has a slightly funny smell. However, I do have a sensitive nose and the fact that it dries fast outweighs this. Plus as soon as it dries there&#x27;s no smell.</li>
            <li> It did dry quickly however, it also dried quickly in the bottle. Half way through the bottle it became gooey.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and leaves the nails tacky for a long while.</li>
