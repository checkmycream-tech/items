            <li>I am still happy though because there are a lot of them, they are separated by color, and the price was very reasonable.</li>

            <li>Strong and nice looking plastic container.</li>
            <li>In spite of this, it is a good buy, the gems are beautiful, and it should last a while.  </li>

            <li>Love this item....</li>
            <li>I totally love these rhinestones.</li>
            <li>my clients are more into the bows and rihnestone as of now.</li>
            <li>there are mang gems and iv used some already and got many complements.</li>
            <li>More like 200.</li>
            <li>I just love rhinestones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the price is ok for this type of plastic stone, it is neither shiny gems nor stones.</li>
            <li>However, I love them.</li>
            <li>The case, colors, everything were good,except if there are more size would be much better to use.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s still a lot, definitely more than you would get with a wheel.</li>
            <li>I also find that this package keeps the colors more separate than the wheels.</li>
            <li>The gems are cute</li>
            <li>but I love that I can do my nails at home with the options of colors given.</li>
            <li>Love the colors, too.</li>
            <li>I really love this set.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because I&#x27;m sure she will love them</li>
            <li>I have many more colors and patterns to chose from.  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t  have gotten better service in a store</li>
            <li>Granddaughter will absolutely love these pretties to put on her nails.  </li>
            <li>I love these gems.  </li>
            <li>Love this product definetly recommend it.</li>
            <li>So many colors.</li>
            <li>I love these cute gems.</li>
            <li>My kids love them on their nails.</li>
            <li>I will never have to buy any more gems</li>
            <li>cause there is so many gems.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>The package is perfect because it separates the colors, you don&#x27;t need to worry about getting them mixed up and digging to find what you want.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that was from the shipping process.</li>
            <li>i would like more or a refund</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>love them</li>
            <li>but I know it was more like 500 the stones</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need more for awhile</li>
            <li>They do not melt when the top coat is applied like some I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li>ALL I have too say is I will return :-)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>She did say you should put 2 coats of top coat on to make sure to seal the decoration to the nail.</li>
            <li>I love it though :)</li>
            <li>Love the clarity of the stones</li>
            <li>and if they continue to hold as well as they do on my laptop, I&#x27;ll be ordering from this company again. :)</li>
            <li>I love the colors, but there isn&#x27;t 3000 pieces.</li>
            <li>Wish there was way more and more colors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ok with this item</li>
            <li>Still sparkle after top coat :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m going to order more.  </li>
            <li>could have found a better one but not too disapointed</li>
            <li>I love the case</li>
            <li>I love these gems.</li>

            <li>so I think she will enjoy!</li>
            <li>But there is no way this thing has 3000 gems, maybe 500 at most.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Love the container also, unlike some of the things that you get at stores that are in a bag, this container keeps everything neat without getting all over my nail box.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Love the color selection.</li>
            <li>Love the packaging.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price of this adorable nail accesory</li>
            <li>Alright for the money.. Do not stay shiny once you put top coat on.</li>
            <li>Many colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>The case is nice and secure, too --</li>
            <li>Love the colors of the rhinestones</li>
            <li>but I love them.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THEM</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s still nice to have all of the options, at this price-- however, they we very blended when I opened the package.</li>
            <li>Size and colors were great however there was only one shape</li>

            <li>but thanks anyway!!!</li>
            <li>different colors, very nice.</li>
            <li>So I bought these two weeks ago and love them the price was the best because I usually buy these per color so getting a variety really helps I can now get creative with my nails</li>
            <li>very colorful.</li>
            <li>Worth the price, vibrant colors and good size gems.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars for the lack of &amp;#34;Mixed Shapes&amp;#34; and for being unexpectedly small.&lt;br /&gt;But, all in all, for the price, you get a pretty good deal I&#x27;d say :)</li>
            <li>Even the case is of fair quality, though I don&#x27;t suggest tossing it about in a bag as the tops are not very tight.</li>
            <li>Thank you for a quick and easy process.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and bold colors.</li>
            <li>I got a lot of them for a small price and they are a great value with a nice variety.</li>
            <li>The case makes it very easy to store until ready for use.</li>
            <li>Please give a more accurate description of this item, and I will come back and give more stars!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad the case doesn&#x27;t just fly open, but it would be nice if I could open it without a knife.</li>
            <li>fast delivery very cute but note they are very small very good for crafts, good colors and good little case.</li>
            <li>I was excited to them</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>But for the price it was so worth it !</li>
            <li>they are fun to use!</li>
            <li>fun idea!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t exactly count how many are in them, but I doubt there are 3000 of them.</li>
            <li>What fun!  </li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the picture i love the case the stones are in.</li>
            <li>add a clear coat on top to secure better.</li>
            <li>When it came I was so excited</li>
            <li>Thanks!  :)</li>
            <li>My daughter has had so much fun with these nail art rhinestones!  </li>
            <li>there are so many and so pretty.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot for a cheap, good product with a fast delivery.</li>
            <li>but once you do they are pretty cute.  </li>
            <li>she was excited while ordering but after tying to use one day, she didnt like at all.</li>
            <li>Gems are small and perfect for nails.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>For sure , they are not so many but they are more than enough.</li>
            <li>These are so much fun for using in your nail art creations, my daughter loves them!  </li>
            <li>So much fun for doing nails!</li>
            <li>but it don&#x27;t matter I love them so much!</li>
            <li>The rhinestones are small but are a perfect size, not too chunky.</li>
            <li>it comes  with a variety of colors, its small but its perfect.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but they look like lots of fun!</li>
            <li>It was so much fun receiving this in the mail!</li>
            <li>I was so glad when my gems can all theses pretty colors</li>
            <li>These are really small and perfect for designing nails.</li>
            <li>Well worth the wait!</li>
            <li>so cute and pretty and neat to wear...</li>
            <li>Small sized and perfect.</li>
            <li>The case closes tightly, which is great, but you have to make sure to take the gems you want to use before you start, just so you won&#x27;t damage your nails.</li>
            <li>The case is very nice, snaps securely shut and can be easily used for other purposes once the gems are used up.</li>
            <li>These little jewels are fun to use, and they look great!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely 3000 of them, easily!</li>
            <li>But all in all it was a great buy for what I still got, also super nice getting the small container with it to keep organized.</li>
            <li>Liked the colors but they are too big to put many on a nail.</li>
            <li>The color doesnt smudge like some, and also they stay on forever even with just a clear top coat:)</li>
            <li>Really fun accessories to add to an afternoon of nail fun with the girls :)</li>
            <li>They are much clearer and sparkling than I had expected and the size is perfect.</li>
            <li>Super cheap .. in two ways .. price and what you get ..</li>
            <li>Instead of paying 10+ dollars for a similar case at a beauty supply store! :)&lt;br /&gt;I decorated the &amp;#34;13&amp;#34; on my gradation tassel it looked really nice :&#x27;)</li>
            <li>super cheap</li>
            <li>The order itself was shipped immediately, was expertly packaged, and arrived in perfect condition an impressive 20 days from the day I ordered it by (what I usually term) &amp;#34;a slow boat from China&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>they seemed bigger on picture they are pretty small but fit perfectly on nails for cute designs and comes with about every color i really liked these rhinestones would buy again plus were cheap</li>
            <li>I used clear nail polish to stick them on but maybe nail glue would be better for sticking them on!</li>
            <li>I will mostly use these for fun on my toenails, and I think they will work just right for that purpose.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this item for anyone that wants close to salon look for a very cheap price.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I got so many choices of color with different sizes and it will be easy to use</li>
            <li>I love the large selection of colors to choose from too.</li>
            <li>She would &amp;#34;suggest&amp;#34; that a certain needed one more</li>
            <li>I use it with a special pencil that picks the gems or etc.</li>
            <li>Just the right size for nail art!</li>
            <li>very nice assortment of colors , very nice investment for the money spent, wish it did not take so long to arrive</li>

            <li>this is the third one i have bought from this seller, i have been happy with all three but noticed that the colors varied each time i bought a new one.</li>
            <li>These gems come in beautiful colors, even the black ones are shiny and pretty.</li>
            <li>I love the case, so easy to open and has it all organized.</li>
            <li>Very bright stones--not cloudy or dull.</li>
            <li>Plasticy looking, too large for detailed designs.</li>
            <li>Not only use them on your natural nails you can put em&#x27; on acrylic and make cute designs because there is that many!</li>
            <li>adding a little bling to your nails is great for the soul.</li>
            <li>I simply wish I had more, but other than that, so much fun and beautiful to work with.</li>

            <li>I love all the gem colors and it comes in a really nice little container, where all the colors are separated...love it.  </li>
            <li>Also love the handy little box that they came in.  </li>
            <li>little colored blings for your nails looks great applied, take a while to get to you, but for the price its worth the wait</li>
            <li>They came in a nice little case and I am able to use them for crafts and nails.</li>
            <li>the right size, not too big not too small.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a lot more then what I paid for!</li>
            <li>(Ok, ok, don&#x27;t expect too much, it&#x27;s just a clear plastic bag with a little design on the top, but I love it.)  </li>
            <li>I have had mine stuck on for a few days, and I am happy with them.</li>
            <li>Its an amazing deal and definitely recommend this product.</li>

            <li>and they shipped it for free and fast.  </li>
            <li>This makes for a fun bonding experience with your child.</li>
            <li>item packaging is much smaller than I expected, but perfect for this item.</li>
            <li>For the price I paid, these rhinestones are definitely worth the wait.</li>

            <li>These are so worth the price.</li>
            <li>In fact, the case alone is worth the price for any craft enthusiasts.</li>
            <li>This is the only set I have gotten that came with its own glue.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>This item was worth the money.</li>
            <li>Arrived when expected in good condition.</li>
            <li>I was buying this for my two young daughters who love to paint their nails.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>These were so much fun to use with the girls during their &amp;#34;make up&amp;#34; sleep over.</li>
            <li>Just for that reason itself, the price was worth it.</li>
            <li>Took a while to get here but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Will have fun using them a lot.</li>
            <li>overall the colors are nice.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product, they were smaller</li>
            <li>and they came in the case already which i thought was pretty cool.</li>
            <li>These are so fun to add to your nails.</li>
            <li>It came on time but the jewls ar enot really worth it.</li>
            <li>So many different colors for such a good price.</li>
            <li>this is totaly worth</li>
            <li>and although I didn&#x27;t count out 3000 stones, I did estimate and came out with about 3000 if not a few more, so</li>
            <li>I did get my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>But these are coloured which adds to the the fun.  </li>
            <li>But i must say the are worth the money i payed for&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyways it was worth it</li>
            <li>I am just starting out with nail art and this gives me many options as far as colors go and have a nice sparkle to them.</li>
            <li>so worth it</li>
            <li>They are worth it.</li>
            <li>The container alone is worth the price of all.</li>
            <li>top clear coat trust me glass like finish shine.</li>
            <li>I love the different colors available I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>That it was worth the price</li>
            <li>One layer of clear polish over the top once you&#x27;ve placed them on your nail</li>
            <li>it was worth</li>
            <li>you do get a lot of colors and the container is good but not the quality i expected esp after reading the reviews</li>
            <li>but it will be fun to try.</li>
            <li>all the gems flung out when I opened it, and were lost and their were not as many as I assumed in each quare no where NEAR 3000.</li>
            <li>I Love them so far.</li>
            <li>the case is smaller than I&#x27;d imagined, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Overall, nice set of nail gems.</li>
            <li>I think it is kind of big</li>
            <li>Completely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>From the photo it looks kind big</li>
            <li>They came a lot earlier than I thought they would, I liked that.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth returning though b.c</li>
            <li>It took forever for them to arrive but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice, but they are all one size and there are definitely NOT 3,000 stones as the product description claims.</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase</li>
            <li>My daughters are all caught up in this wild nail craze and this made the top of their wish list.</li>
            <li>The container is nice that the come in, you can open one pocket at a time</li>
            <li>I use clear polish then go over them with clear polish, seems to stay on good.</li>
            <li>I think they a worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Regardless, this is a nice bargain compared to what you would pay in a Sally’s store, etc, for a similar product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and all different colors</li>
            <li>but it only comes with about 900 gems not 3000 but for the price it&#x27;s still nice.</li>
            <li>The lid is kind of a pain to deal with but other than that they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li>No complaints and got great colors in the mix, including black!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product, it&#x27;s great for nails, projects, scrapbooking and many other uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As noted by other buyers there aren&#x27;t 3000 gems but there is still enough to make it a great deal for the price!</li>
            <li>Nice colors, cheap price and the case can be used for other things.  </li>
            <li>But overall its definitely worth your money! :)</li>
            <li>came in thoes circular ones but other than that it was a great deal and fast shipping</li>
            <li>On the plus side the product was received pretty quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>So cute and the container they come in is very nice, they stay in their designated &amp;#34;slots&amp;#34; and I have no problem with them getting mixed in with each other.</li>
            <li>You want to make sure and get the nice, pointy tweezers for these little things!</li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>Good size for nails or any other decoration.</li>
            <li>Other than that I think there is a good variety of colors</li>
            <li>up(doesn&#x27;t seem to close right)</li>
            <li>They are the right size for nails.</li>
            <li>but when I do I will buy from this seller if the price is right</li>
            <li>They are the right size for nails.</li>
            <li>For me the rhinestones are a tad to bulky and don&#x27;t look right on my nails..</li>
            <li>but it seems about right.</li>
            <li>This item was just right for my nail art</li>
            <li>They are the right size as well to decorate your nail with them.</li>
            <li>, I have them on my nails right now ,I will order again and tell my friends ((thank u))</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even imagine using them all right now.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived on time and the price was just right.</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for and the price was just right.</li>
            <li>They add just the right amount of sparkle to any nail job.</li>
            <li>I use them right away as soon as I got them.  </li>
            <li>I got different, beautiful colors(none of them repeated), but they&#x27;re all the same shape and there isn&#x27;t 3000 in the box!</li>
            <li>There were only about 600 gems (yes, I counted); the picture on here looks a heck of a lot more full as well (which is why I bothered to count).</li>
            <li>quality gems and a great little box at an affordable price!  </li>
            <li>a very smart purchase</li>
            <li>I would have love them if they were a little bit smaller.. but either than that they were great.</li>
            <li>They are very sturdy too, they don&#x27;t fall off easily, you really have to pull.</li>
            <li>LOVE YOUR SUPER LOW PRICES !!</li>
            <li>They work great on both lengths, because they are quite small.</li>
            <li>I love that these barely cost pennies to get</li>
            <li>I got these before the date they were supposed to be here they are pretty and colorful I like them</li>
            <li>but generally i was satisfied</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy with the small size of the gems.</li>
            <li>Pretty and still worth the price</li>
            <li>They are really small and cute and apply very easily.</li>
            <li>Pay a little more get better quality.</li>
            <li>Colors are rich and vibrant.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, I was shock when I saw the little box, I thought I was not going to be happy</li>
            <li>I love these cute little gems.  </li>
            <li>These are great for fun and play, but unless you have profession equipment, they are hard to apply.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t order these if you are needing right away or pay the higher shipping cost.</li>
            <li>The little gems are so ADORABLE, and they came sorted in a really nice clear plastic case!!</li>
            <li>Love the round gems and colors are nice and vibrant.  </li>
            <li>they came super fast in the mail and</li>
            <li>They are easy to put on with either a dab of glue or sealed in with a clear coat polish.</li>
            <li>You get a good variety of colors and plenty of them for less the 4 dollars.</li>
            <li>The quality of the gems may not be top notch, but I have no problem sticking them on my nails (they all lasted 4,5ish days at least too), and they make ae nice sparkly addition.</li>
            <li>Lids are extremely secure and thin (great for storage).  </li>
            <li>worth the buy dont think it was 3000 gems case is good to not a cheap case i say buy</li>
            <li>This is nice you 12 color to chose from , the only thing is that they don&#x27;t sparkle too much .</li>
            <li>they are small but great size to be able to put multiple per nail</li>
            <li>They stay on very well, and are very pretty on.</li>
            <li>This item is very pretty the product came undamaged and fast.</li>
            <li>pink was my favorite!</li>
            <li>I liked these little colorful rhinestones!</li>
            <li>this is such a nice case the quality was great and the gems are super pretty, not too big or too small and they will help a bunch to keep my station at work clean</li>
            <li>Nonetheless its pretty good for less then $1.50</li>
            <li>these are exactly as described and they came in super fast.</li>
            <li>great price and love the case it came in.. got it as shown in the pics, gems are big enough for nail art.. not too big</li>

            <li>thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to spill :)  Lots of fun using them on our nails!</li>
            <li>, my 6 year old can get them fine</li>
            <li>The lids open and shut easily, which is particularly nice, so that you don&#x27;t accidentally spill some while trying to open the case.  </li>
            <li>i liked these stones, they are very small but their ok for the price.</li>
            <li>and she loved the little case</li>
            <li>Good little gems.</li>
            <li>Good for little girls and nail art lovers.</li>
            <li>I loved the little gems.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for a friend who is always doing fun new manicures with stones and other accents and she loved it.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a number of item being sent from China and this is the first one to get to the US.  </li>
            <li>, the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying gems online.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>I love doing my nails constantly</li>
            <li>Theres so much i can do with these!</li>
            <li>It was my first try.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>, there isn&#x27;t much to complain about!</li>
            <li>Received the product within a couple weeks and it looks exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>But for what it&#x27;s worth, I really like it</li>
            <li>Lot&#x27;s of pretty gems for nails.</li>
            <li>The gems are pretty, but ....</li>
            <li>It is a shame because the stones are so pretty.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Smaller sized rhinestones would&#x27;ve been better.</li>
            <li>and if I ever need to buy more, I can simply put them in here.</li>
            <li>will be back for more.</li>
            <li>First, there aren&#x27;t 3000 gems.  </li>
            <li>and I love all of the various colors.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>I love the selection of different colors you get.</li>
            <li>exactly what i was looking for......</li>
            <li>*)</li>
            <li>Definitely want a refund for sure.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty</li>
            <li>there were colors that were repeated but was overall pleased with it...</li>
            <li>They are just so cute and the container is so small and adorable.</li>
            <li>I would buy some more in the future.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Now the gems are very very tiny, but that&#x27;s ok with me.</li>
            <li>Its exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product based on the good reviews and cheap price while honestly not expecting much.</li>
            <li>And the size of the rhinestones are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>AND YES I WOULD MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THEM -</li>
            <li>Pretty colors.</li>
            <li>The picture in the description has to be several containers added into one in order to get the look of so many.</li>
            <li>I am using this for a stocking stuffer for an avid scrapbooker.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because it says 3000 nail art gems and there is not that many...</li>
            <li>really small size,flat backs &amp; are  perfect for nails.i estimated i got 1000 gems , not 3000.&lt;br /&gt;great container with flip open tops .all</li>
            <li>everything is exactly like it describes though.</li>
            <li>I love that not only is it a variety of colors but also a variety of sizes.  </li>
            <li>case they come in is not the easiest at first</li>
            <li>Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>The item is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Exactly as I thought they would be.</li>
            <li>I received exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>exactly what the picture has.</li>
            <li>But they work, and are pretty on your nail art.</li>
            <li>Love these - all different sizes and colors.</li>
            <li>it is exactly what they show so</li>
            <li>So not only did I love these, my mom did too.</li>
            <li>Love all the different colors!  </li>
            <li>They can be used for so many different things.</li>
            <li>The picture of them is exactly what you get.</li>
            <li>I used a couple and they have stayed on pretty well.</li>
            <li>Fun, mixed colors are good, all the same shapes (the description may lead you to think otherwise)</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>just used them for the first time tonight</li>
            <li>These are verry pretty.</li>
            <li>They were exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>They love it and the studs aren&#x27;t too big.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like he picture.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Exactly like described.</li>
            <li>Ive only been able to use it once on my nails.</li>
            <li>I love how sturdy the case is; it won&#x27;t come open if you put it in your bag, etc.</li>
            <li>I could NOT have asked for more (especially for the price!)</li>
            <li>Love that I don&#x27;t necessarily need to use them on my nails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much cheaper to add these gems yourself to your acrylic nails rather than getting them at the nail salon!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all evenly sized, no weird misshapen rhinestones stand out.</li>
            <li>Even if it isn&#x27;t exactly 3000 gems it is still a lot of them in the container.</li>
            <li>Will defiantly be repurchasing if I ever finish the first one.</li>
            <li>The gems are smaller than what I wanted but I&#x27;ll find something to do with them :)</li>
            <li>so i am assuming the shipper was quit aware of this issue when it was mailed</li>
            <li>lots of pretty colors ..</li>
            <li>and they are pretty durable, too.</li>
            <li>I love the different colors.</li>
            <li>The picture shows how it looks exactly.</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time buying rhinestones and I love all of the different colors.</li>
            <li>I am overall pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I love that I have 12 different colors to choose from when doing my nails!</li>
            <li>I also love that each color is separated by a compartment (each compartment has a number engraved on it) that I can open &amp; close</li>
            <li>LOVE ALL THE DIFFERENT COLORS</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t count to see how many were actually in.</li>
            <li>but I have yet to be able to open them</li>
            <li>Many different colors for variety.</li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t really complain!</li>
            <li>these are so pretty.</li>
            <li>and I know she&#x27;ll like them since she&#x27;s an avid collector.</li>
            <li>Exactly as stated.  </li>
            <li>These are exactly what I was looking for, for my nail art!&lt;br /&gt;Thrilled with all of the colors</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve said in other reviews I love SODIAL!  </li>
            <li>The colors are mixed together in mostly all twelve slots.</li>
            <li>This was beyond worth the buy and wait for shipping, and shipped much quicker than planned.</li>
            <li>Went back and bought 3 more.</li>
            <li>My daughter has used these once and thinks they are pretty neat.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m highly satisfied, but wish the case was a bit bigger</li>
            <li>And they are exactly as described.</li>
            <li>For months I haven&#x27;t been able to find these rhinestones in stores so this was my next choice</li>
            <li>Honestly, I expected maybe something that was kind of a rip off compared to the picture just because of the price</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love bling in my nails, especially color ones</li>
            <li>but they do come in pretty colors</li>
            <li>exactly what I paid for.</li>
            <li>then i expected but nice.</li>
            <li>But, the colors are pretty and you get a ton of them.</li>
            <li>These gems are ok, they are definitely not 3000 of them</li>
            <li>are so pretty</li>
            <li>These are adorable, I was worried they would be to big</li>
            <li>assorted nail gems, exactly what  you see.  </li>
            <li>picture shows how it is exactly.</li>
            <li>First of all there is no WAY there are 3000 in this thing.  </li>
            <li>Second of all they get quite cloudy when you put a top coat over them.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>they are sooo tiny and cute</li>
            <li>Just needed to straighten out the amount, because there is actually a lot more gems than people can \\&quot;estimate\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>got all different colors and all cute ones</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>especially considering how dang cheap it was!</li>
            <li>Pretty color rhinestones.</li>
            <li>They are the perfect size not too small and not too big.</li>
            <li>So pretty.</li>
            <li>I just love all the colors and how there are different shapes like hearts and moons and stars.</li>
            <li>So, ask first.</li>
            <li>I should have brought multiple packs because I love these and when I do others nails</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll feel pretty immediately.</li>
            <li>exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>You can make a pretty flower with 6 rhinestones.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for Grand daughter who is starting apprentice nail tech.</li>
            <li>These are exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>and I love all the different colors.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s still small but a good bargain deal) and I used them right away</li>
            <li>Mine was very neat, the crystals all in the right parts, no mixing of crystals.</li>
            <li>I really got this for the box, I like have the variety of plastic gems on hand, they are pretty small and great for using for customers on a large volume.</li>
            <li>They are perfect for small little girls my daughter is 4 and they stay on for a long time if u used good nail glue</li>
            <li>this product is ok - tons smaller than it looks in the picture - very tiny - but ok - thanks</li>
            <li>They are very small and great for details .</li>
            <li>was hoping that it would be a little bit more filled</li>
            <li>colors are nice (not off colors) like other places.</li>
            <li>i loved it... looks pretty big on the picture but its not that big!!!</li>
            <li>These little nail gems are fun and sparkle nicely.</li>
            <li>I suck with patience but none the less I am happy with this and glad I got a lot of gems for the little amount I paid.</li>
            <li>I just got these and there are many color stones other companies offer the amount of stones are adequate for my home decorations for my toes.</li>
            <li>I used clear coat before applying them and clear coat on top of them and they would budge.</li>
            <li>it came with a nail stick but overall good for the price &amp; its comes with different shades of colors</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get anything of this good quality and low low price in stores.</li>
            <li>I received it MUCH faster than I had expected, which was a nice surprise.  </li>
            <li>Consistent colors and good small size to use on all sizes of nails.</li>
            <li>I love them especially because nail salons charge so much to put them on i</li>
            <li>I will just make sure in the future to order far in advance!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt; Very cute little gems</li>
            <li>Very cute little gems.</li>
            <li>Yes out f the many many gems maybe 5 were loose in the baggy outside of the case.</li>
            <li>cause this is not what I order and had to spend so much money to take out something I did not want am very very upset</li>
            <li>thanks very much for your services</li>
            <li>They are pretty small stones, seemed a little smaller than others I have purchased on Amazon, so they are perfect for intricate designs, just make sure 2mm is the right size you are looking for.  </li>
            <li>I love that the case is small, about the size of a smartphone, so it stores easily in my nail collection.</li>
            <li>I received this item pretty fast and it looked like there was a lot in the case</li>
            <li>I reccomend the, The delivery was fast and exactly as in the picture.</li>
            <li>Got the product pretty fast</li>
            <li>They go great with my nails, but the only thing i wasn&#x27;t pleased with was when I received the package the case was broken and</li>
            <li>It took a long  time to get them, but for the price it was ok.</li>
            <li>Good quality small gems.</li>
            <li>These are good but really small.</li>
            <li>but good things come in small packages.</li>
            <li>Good size for small nails.</li>
            <li>Makes at home manicures a little more special.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing super different or special about the rhinestones, they&#x27;re just rhinestones, but  what I really like is the fact that they come in a case.</li>
            <li>Pretty nice for as little as it costs.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this nail art gems thinking it would be super small based on a few of the reviews, but it&#x27;s the perfect size.</li>
            <li>Although they do vary in size a little (barely, just try to find ones that look close in size if its that important to you) and they don&#x27;t look like most high quality rhinestones (cut precisely like swarovski crystals, but</li>
            <li>it came with tons of little cute gems!</li>
            <li>exactly what i expected and more</li>
            <li>Wide variety of gems, small and the perfect size for nail designs.  </li>
            <li>The colors are very vibrant.</li>
            <li>Gems and Rhinestones in the individual compartments make it so easy to use.</li>
            <li>It comes with a dozen colors and there is a large number of stones.  </li>
            <li>and they come in this refillable case so that you can re order certain colors as you need them</li>
            <li>They came in in about 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There appeared to be a large amount of the gems in the container and the gems were sorted.</li>
            <li>A tool is needed if you want them to go on right &amp; look pretty &amp; not messy.</li>
            <li>The container is easy to open, and is very convenient with each color of gems being separated.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and they last so long with just a clear coat on top of them.  </li>
            <li>these are nice but a little too large for your nails</li>
            <li>I have found that the gems you buy on sheets stay longer on the nail and are less prone to come off, but the solution for that is simply a stronger top coat or additional top coat.</li>
            <li>Pretty vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty decent over all.</li>
            <li>These are super cute to use when you have patience and a lot of extra time to actually use them.</li>
            <li>I very highly recomend them.</li>
            <li>These little gems can be a nice add-on to your polish.</li>
            <li>Nice, shiny little crystals.</li>
            <li>She now has a little clientele list of her own (family and friends.)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s 3k pieces, like the others all detail, but it comes in a really nice little box.</li>
            <li>The studs in my opinion are TOO DAMN SMALL but other wise ok.</li>
            <li>Love my little compact case with many different color jewels.</li>
            <li>But a HUGE Plus it came 10 days earlier than earliest arrival date.</li>
            <li>but in reality you get not so much.</li>
            <li>I have changed my nails so much this week; just so I can try every color.</li>
            <li>The whole box is 5 in x 2 in.</li>
            <li>My ten year old grand daughter absolutely loves this set, and as inexpensive as it is, it really is a steal</li>
            <li>I bought these gems because they were so much cheaper than at the store.  </li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>I did realize that they were coming from China, but delivery time was fast.</li>
            <li>There are tons of gems in a variety of colors so you can play around as much as you want and not worry about wasting money.</li>
            <li>I really like the product, but the container the gems came in did not contain the gems and about 1/3 of the gems were in the plastic packaging bag that was around the container...</li>
            <li>I really think this is a quality product</li>
            <li>I like it so much and reorder 3 boxes again</li>
            <li>The amount you get for the price is EXTREMELY reasonable.</li>
            <li>Very recommended because arecomfort and fill my spectations.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The nail artist even asked me how much did I pay for this</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>The rhinestones come very organized.</li>
            <li>Really like these.</li>
            <li>Just understand that what you are buying is very inexpensive</li>
            <li>My granddaughter loves these and for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>Reasonable ship time.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li>The shipping was extremely fast from Honkong to California</li>
            <li>However, they aren&#x27;t faceted, so they don&#x27;t sparkle a whole lot, but there are a variety of colors.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d pay more for an empty case at a craft store, so this is a steal.</li>
            <li>thank you so much I will be ordering again from them soon</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t get nearly as much product.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li>Fast shippin.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>Hw much u be paying Ino</li>
            <li>I do to much ..</li>
            <li>My daughter uses them on her nails and they work really well.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s 3000 gems in there.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>very girlish.</li>
            <li>but theyre not very shiny at all and look as though if I add topcoat on top of them so they will stay on my nail longer</li>
            <li>plus they&#x27;re so inexpensive you can really complain.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>They fit on her tiny toes!</li>
            <li>Very versatile.  </li>
            <li>really chunky and they don&#x27;t stick to ANYTHING.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Items were described well and just as I expected, FANTASTIC prices!</li>
            <li>Very cloudy</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>I will reorder when needed, thanks again</li>
            <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t have much of them</li>
            <li>lots of lil gems like real crystals for my nail art...</li>
            <li>It was much better than I ever expected.</li>
            <li>You absolutely can not beat the price.</li>
            <li>I wont be using them much.</li>
            <li>I really like the container that they came in too.</li>
            <li>them don&#x27;t use it to much</li>
            <li>Very organized.</li>
            <li>Got here fast</li>
            <li>really like the color verity but</li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t really complain for the price.</li>
            <li>wont complain to much....</li>
            <li>&amp;Modern.</li>
            <li>Definitely very versatile.</li>
            <li>The nail gems are as described, but they definitely have a cheap plastic gem look to them, as opposed to crystal gems.  </li>
            <li>Still, considering how often I have gems get knocked off of my nails, this was about as much as I wanted to invest in them.  </li>
            <li>3000 may seem like a lot, but I go through them fast.  </li>
            <li>The case keeps them sorted securely and there are a bunch of different colors.</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really expect 3000 pieces for the price</li>
            <li>my case was broken when I got it and customer service was GREAT</li>
            <li>Which is much faster</li>
            <li>I really learned alot before I have even started.</li>
            <li>Cheap, no shine, and tiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleaded with product.</li>
            <li>CAME FAST</li>
            <li>Really???</li>
            <li>It was packaged very well.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I really like this product, I use them for decorating my daughters nails.</li>
            <li>This is something that would probably cost about twice as much at a store.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfies with my order.</li>
            <li>I really ike</li>
            <li>this the shipping was fast</li>
            <li>Very well packaged and nothing out of its place.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product &amp; the company that sells it!</li>
            <li>They are cute and just the size I expected.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting too much  with this  </li>
            <li>I really  like the color assortment also.</li>
            <li>They have different colors that fit almost all of my nail art designs.  </li>
            <li>got it fast</li>
            <li>However, the nail lady didn&#x27;t charge me as much.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping item as described</li>
            <li>But i have to say, this product was cheap, so I wasn&#x27;t actually expecting 3000 to begin with.  </li>
            <li>They stick on your nails and are very blingy.  </li>
            <li>Still took about 3 or 4 weeks to get here but for about $1.50 I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The jewels are smaller than i expected but in good quality, it also came with glue.</li>
            <li>I love them but sadly only got to use it once bc my 3 year old son got into them</li>
            <li>a regular top clear coat use a gel</li>
            <li>Just use the top clear coat, set them with your tweezers and go over with a 2nd coat and they won&#x27;t come off!</li>
            <li>shipment came In earlier than expected which is good.</li>
            <li>and it kind of &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; them and makes them look round like beads..</li>
            <li>The box is very easy to open and close and the plastic is super clear so you can see the rhinestones well without having to open the compartments.  </li>
            <li>OK - First of all, I&#x27;m not one of these people who is going to sit down and count them to see if there really is 3k pieces - who has time for that???  </li>
            <li>Great for the price, very small!</li>
            <li>It arrived in about a week and a half early, which I was very pleased about.</li>
            <li>A small tube a glue would&#x27;ve been a nice extra that I would&#x27;ve gladly paid a little more for.</li>
            <li>I mean I guess is a good thing since you know your rhinestones wont leak out.</li>
            <li>The neat little case keeps them all separate, and super easy to use.</li>
            <li>But on a positive note, its far cheaper to order them through here and the quantity is higher.</li>
            <li>Bought this amount other things for my aunt for a present she loved</li>
            <li>now i love all the colors thought they fall off easily if not put on right</li>
            <li>I got the gems within a week of ordering, they&#x27;re not best of quality but still really good for the price!</li>
            <li>But I use silver more than other colors.</li>
            <li>Again,  like 3 other gemstone purchases i made, it does not have add many add it advertises,  but there are plenty for the price.  </li>
            <li>They are a little small but they are great!</li>
            <li>My costomers kept asking me when these babies will be back in stock, I was so excited I contacted the seller and asked when will they arrive</li>
            <li>but they are so cute,, the shipment was way before the due date..</li>
            <li>Not disappointed, especially for the price and the quantity.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they are just like other gems you buy.</li>
            <li>i would definitely recommend this product to anyone who loves to do nail art like me but at the same time is willing to wait about 2 weeks for them to come in the mail. :)</li>
            <li>So many colors individually packed in their own little section!!!</li>
            <li>It is so much easier to keep these organized with this particular box.</li>
            <li>case is nice, and much easier to use than the usual wheel style.</li>
            <li>i did some pretty neat designs with just the clear gems.</li>
            <li>I used them for the first time today and so far they have stayed on.</li>
            <li>I use these , on my clients nail design, and they love, how delicate, they are on them, and I love how simple, it is to work , with, these gems!</li>
            <li>The gems were sorted nicely so that was a good thing because I was afraid it was going to be mixed together like some of the reviews that I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li>in the picture it looks like you will get a lot of this little gems, but when I received my package their wasn&#x27;t as many as I expected, but overall this is very cute</li>
            <li>This comes in a cute litte case that keeps the gems seperate even if it were to tip upside down.</li>
            <li>Shipping was really fast, and these were cute little project pieces for nail art.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly new at the whole nail art thing</li>
            <li>it mostly bring the color black .</li>
            <li>More than half of the gems were out of the case.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased that my product got here in less than 3 weeks considering it came from China.</li>
            <li>way less in the containers than what it looks like here, but still cute and what i ordered.</li>
            <li>12 squares, totaling at most, less than 1000 gems.  </li>
            <li>I actually received them fairly quickly after placing my order.</li>
            <li>if you have the time, patience and a steady hand...which I have none of.</li>
            <li>Someday i will get order more different gems mixed</li>
            <li>Gems come in a decent quality case separating each color.  </li>
            <li>I must of received a different product from everyone else because the stones I got are way smaller than what is listed/pictured, BUT I will say that they look adorable when used (I added them to my laptop decal to make it</li>
            <li>I love the box it came in with individual compartments to open one at a time.</li>
            <li>These are cute but too big, I thought they would be smaller in size.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super tiny.</li>
            <li>I do recommend this to people that love doing their nails especially even if you have short nails like me.</li>
            <li>You can give your nails a simple or bold look.</li>
            <li>definitely will be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s safe to say I have enough diamonds to last me for years!</li>
            <li>the price!&lt;br /&gt;The quality is decent.</li>
            <li>So many for such a low price~</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still a decent value.</li>
            <li>I love these, the only problem is that they are smaller than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li>I ordered these expecting to have them within a decent amount of time knowing where they were coming from.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if 3,000 were in there, but there was a decent amount of gems in the holder.</li>
            <li>I counted each and every one to be sure, and there were only 370 in the entire container!!!</li>
            <li>These arrived earlier than expected and well packaged, nice color selection.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d spend the few extra dollars and get the good ones.</li>
            <li>The design is made prettier by the many different colors and variations of the different types of designs that can be made.</li>
            <li>bottom of nail very pretty and simple design.</li>
            <li>Twelve different colors, all very pretty.</li>
            <li>I have had a nail obsession lately, so I bought these to make my nails look even cooler, I love them!</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this seller and item.</li>
            <li>and I really highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, again bought these to go with the nail tools.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this item to others.</li>
            <li>The image showing the colors shows a light blue, and i did not receive that color, instead a got a a variation of a pink shade (which i&#x27;m fine with since I like pink better than blue anyway, and</li>
            <li>They came very well packaged, in a neat little container with individual compartments, and were delivered more than a week ahead of schedule!</li>
            <li>For the amount spent, quality and quantity is fine.</li>
            <li>these are fun and add a little &amp;#34;bling&amp;#34; for special occasions and every day wear</li>
            <li>that there were a little bit more stones in the case.</li>
            <li>I love these little gems.  </li>
            <li>Many little glitter for nails and whatever.</li>
            <li>i should have looked around a little more</li>
            <li>This comes in a little case and is just too cute.</li>
            <li>I love these little studs for my nails.</li>
            <li>Cute little stones.</li>
            <li>I love the little container they come in and whould recomend this product.</li>
            <li>They are a little foggy until you apply a top coat over them.  </li>
            <li>There are SO MANY little gems that it will take me forever to use them all.</li>
            <li>I just thought they would be a little shinier or more</li>
            <li>Adorable little gems and</li>
            <li>It did take a little bit to get here, but over all I love these gems.</li>
            <li>Pretty small but worth the money!!</li>
            <li>Its been more than a month now where are my little gems??</li>
            <li>I love the little container that they use for these rhinestones.  </li>
            <li>comes in a little cute box just like the pic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These will make a cute little gift.</li>
            <li>I love these little jewels, They got here before the estimated delivery.</li>
            <li>Okay so I was looking for these little rhinestones and Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply</li>
            <li>So far I have been loving these little stones!</li>
            <li>So they aren&#x27;t just large, but they stick out further than other rhinestones on the nails and pop off pretty easy if they get snagged or hit on anything.</li>
            <li>They are easy to manipulate, just stick them into a dab of nail glue or wet polish!</li>
            <li>the rhinestones are nice, but the hard plastic case came shattered</li>
            <li>I admit it is kind of hard to put them on my nails</li>
            <li>the glue, superglue that comes with it is a crapp bottle, go down to a hobby store and get a real bottle and get a fine tip extender</li>
            <li>thanks for sending it early then</li>
            <li>Needless to say, it was a great price and</li>
            <li>Im ready to go wild with them once christmas comes around.</li>
            <li>I have trouble getting them on just where I want them, but I&#x27;m sure once I learn the trick</li>
            <li>later smile</li>
            <li>Makes for a colorful and different design styles.</li>
            <li>I like that better than the wheel cases since that tends to get messy for me.</li>
            <li>The container that they come in is way better than the round ones though.</li>
            <li>gems are round and are multifaceted ,meaning many sides which adds to sparkliness.&lt;br /&gt;colors are :&lt;br /&gt;-Light purple</li>
            <li>There are several different styles of gems in this pack and its nice to have options when you are trying to do different designs with your nails.</li>
            <li>Love that you have all the colors in one spot versus the round wheel.</li>
            <li>They just came and wasn&#x27;t expecting them for a few more weeks</li>
            <li>But i have three kids that found it fun to help me separate the different stones.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t sure how small they are, even though it says for nail art.</li>
            <li>For those saying that these &#x27;tiny things&#x27; aren&#x27;t worth the two dollars you&#x27;re paying, well, that might be the case in China or Korea, but I dare you to find something in a US store that sells something like this for cheaper.</li>
            <li>I will be having a lot of fun doing different designs for my nails.</li>
            <li>There are definitely not 3000 gems in the package, but for the price I feel it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>like the variety I been having such fun with my nails&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These gems are so colorful and has different shades of a color.</li>
            <li>So i have lost a good bit of my money off the poor organization it comes in.</li>
            <li>I make the design I want and then wait a minute before I put another couple of clear coats on top to glue the stones down.</li>
            <li>but I expected more of them, it took liked it was half empty.</li>
            <li>Other than that, they suit the need I ordered for just fine.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend you getting a easy to open case</li>
            <li>The case itself is honestly a value in itself at less than $2, I will reuse it if I ever actually use up all the gems.</li>
            <li>but these are very richly colored and cut perfectly round.</li>
            <li>I apply a thin top coat, then put the gem on and apply another thin layer of top coat on top of the gem.</li>
            <li>they are as described, i have not counted them, i do not have the time to, but it does seem pretty accurate as they are a ton of these little things!</li>
            <li>very happy-gems aren&#x27;t too big or too small so they&#x27;ll work nicely for my purposes.</li>
            <li>so I would&#x27;ve liked the gems to be a little smaller</li>
            <li>They take a home done manicure to a new level.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get all these colors where I live</li>
            <li>i ordered this under the impression that there would 3000 gems and that it was NEW that was not the case at all</li>
            <li>very hard to pick up and to place and to get them to stick to the nail, but very cute if you got it done the way u wanted to</li>
            <li>The price was very low, so I can&#x27;t really complain too much.  </li>
            <li>unlike the really big fat gems that dont fit or you can only put one!!!!!</li>
            <li>Better than expected for the low price.</li>
            <li>you cant reuse them so it would have gotten 5 stars if there was more gems or at least as much as they said there would be.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m giving them to my little girls, because I could foresee my carpet becoming forever sparkly.</li>
            <li>she like them very much and still uses them a year later to do her nails.</li>
            <li>I use these very frequently.</li>
            <li>The case locks tight so that it doesnt pour out, plus it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Ok for its price not that bad good for beginners dont waist alot of money that latter</li>
            <li>There were a lot, but the case was pretty big</li>
            <li>WHERE NEAR, IM MADDDDDD !</li>
            <li>The case they come in is pretty sturdy and there are a lot of different color varieties.</li>
            <li>I got 3 different blues and one purple instead of 2 different blues and 2 different purples, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>They are obviously not stickers, but individual gems, so unlike the gems you get on sheets, you will definitely need an undercoat and top coat to adhere these to the nail.</li>
            <li>This was exactly as described, the gems are tiny, but again I knew they would be.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend to all who loves rhinestones on nails, or other arts and crafts. :-)</li>
            <li>My five year old loves them!</li>
            <li>II love small ones</li>
            <li>I got it in the mail today, 12 days early!</li>
            <li>The compartment box contains an assorment of small, cute gems for creating nail art.</li>
            <li>My 12 year old daughter loves this set of gems!  </li>
            <li>I love how simple it is to open each individual storge compartment.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more they arrived earlier than i expected too!</li>
            <li>For a small taste of glitter on nails is ok.</li>
            <li>Small, cute gems to stay on nails.</li>
            <li>and they are really small so they should look cute on the nails rather than</li>
            <li>These little gems are easily applied when polish is damp, and stay on until taken off with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>She always comes up with a new design to wow the world.  </li>
            <li>I usually buy packs of these &amp; can&#x27;t really complain for how cheap they are.</li>
            <li>lots of different colors and not mixed up or 1/4 full.</li>
            <li>It came sooner then expected and while I do like it for the price, I have a feeling I&#x27;ll run out quick</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected cute little rhinestones with every color</li>
            <li>They stick on easily with a little dab of clear nail polish.  </li>
            <li>No where near 3000, no where near 1/2 of that!</li>
            <li>Especially since so many people have counted the gems, and found that there is significantly less.</li>
            <li>so you could fit multiple gems on a single nail design.</li>
            <li>Easy to add, just place it on the wet nail polish and then add a clear to make it last longer.</li>
            <li>I do recommend that if you want a certain color for any reason to either buy multiple sets of this or look for that color in bulk.</li>
            <li>Such a large variety of color.</li>
            <li>its very cheap so it wont be suh a big deal if you waste a couple.</li>
            <li>Fantastic little gems.</li>
            <li>...will spend a little more next time.</li>
            <li>I love it not too hard to handle if you are looking for alot of bling</li>
            <li>While some gems become dull after an application of top coat, these did not.  </li>
            <li>hard to pick up the tiny pieces, but it did come with nail glue which is handy.  </li>
            <li>It was extremely cheap and came 2 weeks earlier than the earliest expected delivery date.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need any glue just place them on your nail and paint over them with clear polish</li>
            <li>but I just used clear nail polish to keep it on my nails.</li>
            <li>i use clear coat</li>
            <li>They stick on with no problem with just clear nail polish and they stay on in the baths or showers you don&#x27;t have to worry about reapplying each time.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used glue with them, just put a coat of clear nail polish over them.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to use just clear nail polish, but that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I used them and just set them with some clear polish and they lasted a couple of weeks until i scraped them off.</li>
            <li>For the price totally worth it, checked Sally&#x27;s and way more expensive.  </li>
            <li>My 8 year old loves this.  </li>
            <li>My three year old cannot wait until mommy can jazz up her toes.</li>
            <li>She was surprised when I told her I did it myself.</li>
            <li>Turns out I&#x27;ve got way to much of everything else to do to that prohibits me from gluing tiny diamonds on my nails.</li>
            <li>No trouble with anything.</li>
            <li>They did arrive early though.</li>
            <li>They r for my 13 year old niece.</li>
            <li>I agree with everyone who said that there was nowhere near 3000 stones, but I didn&#x27;t take the time to count each and every stone, you can tell by just glancing at it.</li>
            <li>and I use them on my natural and acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how it came a week early and</li>
            <li>only real problem we had with this was the quality of the case.  </li>
            <li>They arrived early and all stayed in their case.</li>
            <li>theres NOWHERE NEAR the correct number of gems as advertised.</li>
            <li>I got the gems today and they came early</li>
            <li>When it arrived I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>and they came early.</li>
            <li>I stopped getting my nails professionally done to save money</li>
            <li>Unless your a professional that does client after client</li>
            <li>even took some of my old ones out of the wheel container they were in .&lt;br</li>
            <li>My one complaint is there surely does not seem to be 3000 pieces</li>
            <li>not recommend unless you are buying for a 8 year old.</li>
            <li>whereas I thought they&#x27;d be very teeny tiny, but now I know what 2 mm equals!  </li>
            <li>Apply polish and before the polish completely dries, apply the gem.</li>
            <li>Completely my fault.</li>
            <li>so early arrival its a plus.</li>
            <li>There is a variety of colors completely organized into each slot</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really beat 3000 stones, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>The case they come in is upper sturdy and holds up real well.</li>
            <li>i will give them the 1 star as it arried 5 days early.</li>
            <li>Arrived two weeks early.</li>
            <li>There so fun to use and got them pretty fast just disappointed that there wasn&#x27;t as many diamonds as in the picture they show</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really expecting such a variety.</li>
            <li>the 3000 the title says, but I&#x27;m sure I got at least 2000</li>
            <li>Not anywhere near 3000 gems.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to let my 8 year old start using them.</li>
            <li>but I dont think that what is in the package is anywhere near that,</li>
            <li>But, I was surprised to find when the product arrived, it met my expectations.</li>
            <li>They will help you get that professionally manicured look on your nails.</li>
            <li>Makes all my nail art extra fun to do by adding extra sparkle.</li>
            <li>She has fun doing her nails regularly, and she likes to play with different styles.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if there are actually 3000 gems in there, but there are certainly enough that I consider it worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth the money I spent.  </li>
            <li>cause i am just starting to do my nails at home, and the tiny pieces are hard to place right, but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>They add just a little sparkle and make them so unique.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t wait to use my little colorful rhinestones !</li>
            <li>They took a little long to get here, but I am so pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>they are fun to use with my family for nails or even other art projects</li>
            <li>The main reason I only gave this item 3 stars is bc</li>
            <li>very solid and will be useful long after the gems are used up</li>
            <li>I personally love these rhinestones because they are a lot smaller than usual rhinestones.</li>
            <li>i also thought they would be smaller but they are pretty big.</li>
            <li>Even at the cheap price, its not worth the wait to end up getting something completely different from what you ordered.</li>
            <li>good for doing nails, quite small and messy tho.  </li>
            <li>Came in a cool little case, all sorted by colors.</li>
            <li>Let me begin by saying that I highly doubt there are actually 3000 rhinestones in this container.</li>
            <li>It comes with a decent amount of gems and the gems are very durable and they last  a long time.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no down side to this item.</li>
            <li>tried it with just polish but didn&#x27;t stick for long but did very well with nail glue.</li>
            <li>While I did like the &amp;#34;wheel,&amp;#34; I found that this was much easier to use as it offers you the opportunity to keep multiple areas open at once.  </li>
            <li>These are exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>These were good but hard to get out of the package and the little pieces always came out and would be everywhere.</li>
            <li>A few gem colors got mixed up but otherwise the packaging was fine.</li>
            <li>They are really tiny so that they can fit on your nails and come in a little box with compartments for each color gem.</li>
            <li>She love to add a little sparkle to wet painted nails.</li>
            <li>Hard to glue on, fall off easily, doesn&#x27;t come with glue.</li>
            <li>I like the shine and how they small, very useful product.</li>
            <li>Unless you have super tiny fingers or really sharp tweezers, you won&#x27;t like these.</li>
            <li>My mother had open the package - out of curiosity, and sent me a photo through text of my new gems.</li>
            <li>A couple of the compartment lids are a little loose and do not feel secure, but really don&#x27;t plan on travelling with it so not a big issue.</li>
            <li>You pretty much get what you pay for with this kit, nothing out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li>Most nail shops offer something of similar quality for at least five times the price.</li>
            <li>The container was a lot smaller than it looks in the pic, No bigger than my hand really.</li>
            <li>Unlike other reviews i found that each section opened and closed just fine</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and expected!</li>
            <li>I purchased my order about three weeks ago and just received it in a cute little package on the 13 for which I&#x27;m not complaining because I&#x27;m working my way towards other nail items before I even attempt to d&amp;eacute;cor</li>
            <li>There are no other shapes in the box.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are twelve easy to open little compartments for the various colors.</li>
            <li>Box is not to big or to small for easy storage.</li>
            <li>And it contains the following colors: black, royal purple, salmon pink, emerald green, royal blue, hot pink/primrose-kind-of-color, yellow-gold, light green, light pink, silver, light purple/lilac, and red.</li>
            <li>Just for fun little gems for the nails.</li>
            <li>This was definitely a little package but worth its price.  </li>
            <li>They took a little while to recieve but the price and product is well worth it</li>
            <li>Its pretty much what i expected it fits in the palm of your hand.. on the other hand i had no Idea</li>
            <li>I really only ordered this item mainly for mixed shapes.</li>
            <li>everything was a little smaller than i expected but love them cant wait to use them.</li>
            <li>I understand it is pretty reasonable, but at least update the information about the product and send what you promise.</li>
            <li>but i can fit at least 4 on a nail in a line so there not to the point you can barely see them.</li>
            <li>I use a toothpick and a tiny dab of clear nail polish on the tip to pick them up and place them.</li>
            <li>so when I use them for my girls nails i have to add extra layers of the clear coat.</li>
            <li>The gems are small enough to fit about 20 on one nail.</li>
            <li>I have used these for my nail designs and so far I am a big fan of them and would recommend them to others.</li>
            <li>I want the same for my 6 year old.</li>
            <li>The product came early by international shipping and it is serving its purpose!</li>
            <li>No regrets what so ever.</li>
            <li>good quality is worth the money small u can use it on regular nails n fake nails&lt;</li>
            <li>Because of that, I have to be careful when moving the whole tray</li>
            <li>You have to be very meticulous when putting them on (the nail polish needs to be slightly wet to stick)</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s 12 different colors of gems, each marked with a number 1-12 on the case.</li>
            <li>plastic and barely shine.</li>
            <li>They make a big difference.looks professional</li>
            <li>there were definitely no where near 3000 gems in this package.  </li>
            <li>They came much quicker than expected, considering that they were shipped from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li>They look nice on the site, but I was not impressed when I opened the package.</li>
            <li>What annoyed me the most is that they</li>
            <li>my little ones of course had to try them right out.</li>
            <li>I expected them to be a little better quality, they are really not that shiny and get worn down quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use gems, just hard to grab obviously because of their size.</li>
            <li>I like that the case has tops that open individually for each different gem color, and that the dividers are large enough that the gems do not mix.</li>
            <li>but the gems are super duper small.</li>
            <li>Came quick and the container is small.</li>
            <li>I expected the little boxes to be filled</li>
            <li>The product arrived much sooner than promised, and at a price that was WAY below other competitors</li>
            <li>This item arrived much sooner than expected!</li>
            <li>You get a lot and when they&#x27;re empty, the little case they come in can be very useful, too.</li>
            <li>glitter in a cheap box not as shown way to small to long to devlery not even 3000 gems maybe 1000</li>
            <li>so it takes practice placing them exactly where you want them, but by my second toe i had it down to a science.</li>
            <li>Just try not to do what I did and forget and leave the rhinestone case in a hot car, because I think it changed the shape of the box a little and</li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s not filled up very much</li>
            <li>The container is a little smaller than expected but you can fit a lot of the gems in each spot.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a bunch of stuff from Amazon and this was the first thing to arrive a few days after purchase.  </li>
            <li>It comes exactly as the picture shows, multiple colors and a sturdy little case.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, they were not very shiny, other then that it was a great deal</li>
            <li>Shipping was long but much shorter than expected.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste $16.99 at the beauty supply store when you can get the exact same product for a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li>the pink i got that isn&#x27;t shown is really pretty, like a salmon pink color).</li>
            <li>they have the exact same set just fewer but a little bigger stones.</li>
            <li>The only negative was that they came all mixed up but other than that it was ok.</li>
            <li>Impossible to get an accurate count but sufficient to give me my Money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>super small!</li>
            <li>Seriously having this in my nail collection makes me feel cool</li>
            <li>The little container is really neat and would have paid the amount I paid just for the container.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely buy other new colors too.</li>

            <li> I received this product very quick!</li>
            <li> I will warn you though, if you are planning on using them, I would strongly suggest a tweezers and magnifying glass!</li>
            <li> The container it comes in is also very handy n useful.</li>

            <li> The gems size is cool, and can make good nail art.</li>
            <li> I guess sometimes the price isnt too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> I also love the case they come in its so easy to keep track of them and the colors!</li>
            <li> seems to work just fine!</li>

            <li> Love this item....</li>
            <li> I totally love these rhinestones.</li>
            <li> my clients are more into the bows and rihnestone as of now.</li>
            <li> there are mang gems and iv used some already and got many complements.</li>
            <li> More like 200.</li>
            <li> I just love rhinestones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the price is ok for this type of plastic stone, it is neither shiny gems nor stones.</li>
            <li> However, I love them.</li>
            <li> The case, colors, everything were good,except if there are more size would be much better to use.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s still a lot, definitely more than you would get with a wheel.</li>
            <li> I also find that this package keeps the colors more separate than the wheels.</li>
            <li> The gems are cute</li>
            <li> but I love that I can do my nails at home with the options of colors given.</li>
            <li> Love the colors, too.</li>
            <li> I really love this set.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I&#x27;m sure she will love them</li>
            <li> I have many more colors and patterns to chose from.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t  have gotten better service in a store</li>
            <li> Granddaughter will absolutely love these pretties to put on her nails.  </li>

            <li> I will never have to buy any more gems</li>
            <li> cause there is so many gems.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> The package is perfect because it separates the colors, you don&#x27;t need to worry about getting them mixed up and digging to find what you want.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure that was from the shipping process.</li>
            <li> i would like more or a refund</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> love them</li>
            <li> but I know it was more like 500 the stones</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need more for awhile</li>
            <li> They do not melt when the top coat is applied like some I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li> ALL I have too say is I will return :-)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> She did say you should put 2 coats of top coat on to make sure to seal the decoration to the nail.</li>
            <li> I love it though :)</li>
            <li> Love the clarity of the stones</li>
            <li> and if they continue to hold as well as they do on my laptop, I&#x27;ll be ordering from this company again. :)</li>
            <li> I love the colors, but there isn&#x27;t 3000 pieces.</li>
            <li> Wish there was way more and more colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ok with this item</li>
            <li> Still sparkle after top coat :)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m going to order more.  </li>
            <li> could have found a better one but not too disapointed</li>
            <li> I love the case</li>
            <li> I love these gems.</li>
            <li> price- love the carrier case</li>
            <li> so I think she will enjoy!</li>
            <li> But there is no way this thing has 3000 gems, maybe 500 at most.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> Love the container also, unlike some of the things that you get at stores that are in a bag, this container keeps everything neat without getting all over my nail box.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Love the color selection.</li>
            <li> Love the packaging.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price of this adorable nail accesory</li>
            <li> Alright for the money.. Do not stay shiny once you put top coat on.</li>
            <li> Many colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> The case is nice and secure, too --</li>
            <li> Love the colors of the rhinestones</li>
            <li> but I love them.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THEM</li>
            <li> Stones may fade a bit when top coat is applied .</li>
            <li> i think i like the case better then the gems.</li>
            <li> Kids love it.</li>
            <li> They where cute and the container came in a little&lt;br /&gt;Baggie</li>
            <li> I love these</li>

            <li> Although, I don&#x27;t think there are quite 3,000 pieces in the set I am happy with the quality and the variety of colors it does include 11 different colors (The silver is repeated).</li>
            <li> and they will enjoy them</li>
            <li> So it is like getting the gems free.</li>
            <li> Its great especially for practicing placements.</li>
            <li> I feel like I go my money&#x27;s worth and more.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy this because of the variety.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate- a real deal of nice quality stones.</li>
            <li> Yes I understand the price is cheap</li>
            <li> I bought these to try them since they were so cheap.  </li>
            <li> The variety of colours are really nice, and the case it comes in is very convenient.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still nice to have all of the options, at this price-- however, they we very blended when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> Size and colors were great however there was only one shape</li>
            <li> I know this will happen as it always does with cheap rhinestones.</li>
            <li> These gems are cute and colorful, but they don&#x27;t stay on like I assumed.  </li>
            <li> had a free sh</li>
            <li> Package was cheap and did not even specify what the item was.</li>
            <li> Cheap</li>
            <li> I used clear top coat with these then put more on top</li>
            <li> Light Box(Ships From Hong Kong)</li>
            <li> it all the colors were perfect even though the product seemed much larger in the photo i am still a satisfied customer and look forward to ordering more gems in the future.</li>
            <li> sometimes i had some blue gems fly out</li>
            <li> It was mailed in a secure bubble mailer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> 3000 nail gems is a fabulous deal considering Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply sells 100 gems for $9.99.  </li>
            <li> Cheap tho</li>
            <li> It stores my gems seperately and securely.</li>
            <li> I love all the different colors, and I love love love the container.</li>
            <li> Well it was cheap, so I guess you get what you paid for...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t have enough sparkles, decorate my hair clips, use for nail art, also great to embelish my braclets and sunglasses.</li>
            <li> The price is fabulous as buying them at the beauty supply is out of my budget..</li>
            <li> The case is so much better than many in the circular cases, so much easier to keep them separate and secure.  </li>
            <li> Great product, will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> I paid $1.36 with free shipping, the product came within five days.</li>

            <li> Amazing colors and very shiny like swarovski crystals.</li>
            <li> The stones are really tiny and great for nail art.  </li>
            <li> the container is nice and comes very organized.</li>
            <li> These gems are really great especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I ordered these and honestly didn&#x27;t expect much given the price (it was $1.76 when I ordered with no shipping charges).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to a fun creative experience.</li>
            <li> I paid $2.05 which included free shipping.  </li>
            <li> they come out of the case easy and go on easy but pop off quickly</li>
            <li> I love these gems so much that i can help but having three or more on each finger.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old laughed at them when opened.</li>

            <li> different colors, very nice.</li>
            <li> So I bought these two weeks ago and love them the price was the best because I usually buy these per color so getting a variety really helps I can now get creative with my nails</li>
            <li> very colorful.</li>
            <li> Worth the price, vibrant colors and good size gems.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars for the lack of &amp;#34;Mixed Shapes&amp;#34; and for being unexpectedly small.&lt;br /&gt;But, all in all, for the price, you get a pretty good deal I&#x27;d say :)</li>
            <li> Even the case is of fair quality, though I don&#x27;t suggest tossing it about in a bag as the tops are not very tight.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a quick and easy process.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and bold colors.</li>
            <li> I got a lot of them for a small price and they are a great value with a nice variety.</li>
            <li> The case makes it very easy to store until ready for use.</li>
            <li> Please give a more accurate description of this item, and I will come back and give more stars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad the case doesn&#x27;t just fly open, but it would be nice if I could open it without a knife.</li>
            <li> fast delivery very cute but note they are very small very good for crafts, good colors and good little case.</li>
            <li> I was excited to them</li>

            <li> What fun!  </li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the picture i love the case the stones are in.</li>
            <li> add a clear coat on top to secure better.</li>

            <li> she was excited while ordering but after tying to use one day, she didnt like at all.</li>
            <li> Gems are small and perfect for nails.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> For sure , they are not so many but they are more than enough.</li>
            <li> These are so much fun for using in your nail art creations, my daughter loves them!  </li>
            <li> So much fun for doing nails!</li>
            <li> but it don&#x27;t matter I love them so much!</li>
            <li> The rhinestones are small but are a perfect size, not too chunky.</li>
            <li> it comes  with a variety of colors, its small but its perfect.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but they look like lots of fun!</li>
            <li> It was so much fun receiving this in the mail!</li>
            <li> I was so glad when my gems can all theses pretty colors</li>
            <li> These are really small and perfect for designing nails.</li>
            <li> Well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> so cute and pretty and neat to wear...</li>
            <li> Small sized and perfect.</li>
            <li> The case closes tightly, which is great, but you have to make sure to take the gems you want to use before you start, just so you won&#x27;t damage your nails.</li>
            <li> The case is very nice, snaps securely shut and can be easily used for other purposes once the gems are used up.</li>
            <li> These little jewels are fun to use, and they look great!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely 3000 of them, easily!</li>
            <li> But all in all it was a great buy for what I still got, also super nice getting the small container with it to keep organized.</li>
            <li> Liked the colors but they are too big to put many on a nail.</li>
            <li> The color doesnt smudge like some, and also they stay on forever even with just a clear top coat:)</li>
            <li> Really fun accessories to add to an afternoon of nail fun with the girls :)</li>
            <li> They are much clearer and sparkling than I had expected and the size is perfect.</li>
            <li> Super cheap .. in two ways .. price and what you get ..</li>
            <li> Instead of paying 10+ dollars for a similar case at a beauty supply store! :)&lt;br /&gt;I decorated the &amp;#34;13&amp;#34; on my gradation tassel it looked really nice :&#x27;)</li>
            <li> super cheap</li>
            <li> The order itself was shipped immediately, was expertly packaged, and arrived in perfect condition an impressive 20 days from the day I ordered it by (what I usually term) &amp;#34;a slow boat from China&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> they seemed bigger on picture they are pretty small but fit perfectly on nails for cute designs and comes with about every color i really liked these rhinestones would buy again plus were cheap</li>
            <li> I used clear nail polish to stick them on but maybe nail glue would be better for sticking them on!</li>
            <li> I will mostly use these for fun on my toenails, and I think they will work just right for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this item for anyone that wants close to salon look for a very cheap price.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I got so many choices of color with different sizes and it will be easy to use</li>
            <li> I love the large selection of colors to choose from too.</li>
            <li> She would &amp;#34;suggest&amp;#34; that a certain needed one more</li>
            <li> I use it with a special pencil that picks the gems or etc.</li>
            <li> Just the right size for nail art!</li>
            <li> very nice assortment of colors , very nice investment for the money spent, wish it did not take so long to arrive</li>

            <li> The item was exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten sooo many compliments thus far!</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> They arrived exactly 2 weeks after they shipped!</li>
            <li> Just wish there was more clear gems!</li>
            <li> I initially wanted them for decorating my nails when I got done painting them,but there are MANY uses for them!</li>
            <li> The are a lot of pretty colors and tons of them in the box!</li>
            <li> , I will definitely buy more, 1000 stars to this item!</li>
            <li> this is the third one i have bought from this seller, i have been happy with all three but noticed that the colors varied each time i bought a new one.</li>
            <li> These gems come in beautiful colors, even the black ones are shiny and pretty.</li>
            <li> I love the case, so easy to open and has it all organized.</li>
            <li> Very bright stones--not cloudy or dull.</li>
            <li> Plasticy looking, too large for detailed designs.</li>
            <li> Not only use them on your natural nails you can put em&#x27; on acrylic and make cute designs because there is that many!</li>
            <li> adding a little bling to your nails is great for the soul.</li>
            <li> I simply wish I had more, but other than that, so much fun and beautiful to work with.</li>
            <li> perfect for young little ladies.</li>
            <li> I love all the gem colors and it comes in a really nice little container, where all the colors are separated...love it.  </li>
            <li> Also love the handy little box that they came in.  </li>
            <li> little colored blings for your nails looks great applied, take a while to get to you, but for the price its worth the wait</li>
            <li> They came in a nice little case and I am able to use them for crafts and nails.</li>
            <li> the right size, not too big not too small.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a lot more then what I paid for!</li>
            <li> (Ok, ok, don&#x27;t expect too much, it&#x27;s just a clear plastic bag with a little design on the top, but I love it.)  </li>
            <li> I have had mine stuck on for a few days, and I am happy with them.</li>
            <li> Its an amazing deal and definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> the price is amazing compared to the local Sally beauty supply.  </li>
            <li> But it was cheap and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> and they shipped it for free and fast.  </li>
            <li> This makes for a fun bonding experience with your child.</li>
            <li> item packaging is much smaller than I expected, but perfect for this item.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid, these rhinestones are definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Well worth the $1.48.</li>
            <li> Fun colors to decorate with.</li>
            <li> These are so worth the price.</li>
            <li> In fact, the case alone is worth the price for any craft enthusiasts.</li>
            <li> This is the only set I have gotten that came with its own glue.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> This item was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Arrived when expected in good condition.</li>
            <li> I was buying this for my two young daughters who love to paint their nails.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> These were so much fun to use with the girls during their &amp;#34;make up&amp;#34; sleep over.</li>
            <li> Just for that reason itself, the price was worth it.</li>
            <li> Took a while to get here but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Will have fun using them a lot.</li>
            <li> overall the colors are nice.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product, they were smaller</li>
            <li> and they came in the case already which i thought was pretty cool.</li>
            <li> These are so fun to add to your nails.</li>
            <li> It came on time but the jewls ar enot really worth it.</li>
            <li> So many different colors for such a good price.</li>
            <li> this is totaly worth</li>
            <li> and although I didn&#x27;t count out 3000 stones, I did estimate and came out with about 3000 if not a few more, so</li>
            <li> I did get my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> But these are coloured which adds to the the fun.  </li>
            <li> But i must say the are worth the money i payed for&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyways it was worth it</li>
            <li> I am just starting out with nail art and this gives me many options as far as colors go and have a nice sparkle to them.</li>
            <li> so worth it</li>
            <li> They are worth it.</li>
            <li> The container alone is worth the price of all.</li>
            <li> top clear coat trust me glass like finish shine.</li>
            <li> I love the different colors available I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> That it was worth the price</li>
            <li> One layer of clear polish over the top once you&#x27;ve placed them on your nail</li>
            <li> it was worth</li>
            <li> you do get a lot of colors and the container is good but not the quality i expected esp after reading the reviews</li>
            <li> but it will be fun to try.</li>
            <li> all the gems flung out when I opened it, and were lost and their were not as many as I assumed in each quare no where NEAR 3000.</li>
            <li> I Love them so far.</li>
            <li> the case is smaller than I&#x27;d imagined, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Overall, nice set of nail gems.</li>
            <li> I think it is kind of big</li>
            <li> Completely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> From the photo it looks kind big</li>
            <li> They came a lot earlier than I thought they would, I liked that.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth returning though b.c</li>
            <li> It took forever for them to arrive but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, but they are all one size and there are definitely NOT 3,000 stones as the product description claims.</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase</li>
            <li> My daughters are all caught up in this wild nail craze and this made the top of their wish list.</li>
            <li> The container is nice that the come in, you can open one pocket at a time</li>
            <li> I use clear polish then go over them with clear polish, seems to stay on good.</li>
            <li> I think they a worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Regardless, this is a nice bargain compared to what you would pay in a Sally’s store, etc, for a similar product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and all different colors</li>
            <li> but it only comes with about 900 gems not 3000 but for the price it&#x27;s still nice.</li>
            <li> The lid is kind of a pain to deal with but other than that they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> No complaints and got great colors in the mix, including black!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product, it&#x27;s great for nails, projects, scrapbooking and many other uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As noted by other buyers there aren&#x27;t 3000 gems but there is still enough to make it a great deal for the price!</li>
            <li> Nice colors, cheap price and the case can be used for other things.  </li>
            <li> But overall its definitely worth your money! :)</li>
            <li> came in thoes circular ones but other than that it was a great deal and fast shipping</li>
            <li> On the plus side the product was received pretty quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> So cute and the container they come in is very nice, they stay in their designated &amp;#34;slots&amp;#34; and I have no problem with them getting mixed in with each other.</li>
            <li> You want to make sure and get the nice, pointy tweezers for these little things!</li>
            <li> other wise</li>
            <li> Good size for nails or any other decoration.</li>
            <li> Other than that I think there is a good variety of colors</li>
            <li> up(doesn&#x27;t seem to close right)</li>
            <li> They are the right size for nails.</li>
            <li> but when I do I will buy from this seller if the price is right</li>
            <li> They are the right size for nails.</li>
            <li> For me the rhinestones are a tad to bulky and don&#x27;t look right on my nails..</li>
            <li> but it seems about right.</li>
            <li> This item was just right for my nail art</li>
            <li> They are the right size as well to decorate your nail with them.</li>
            <li> , I have them on my nails right now ,I will order again and tell my friends ((thank u))</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even imagine using them all right now.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and the price was just right.</li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and the price was just right.</li>
            <li> They add just the right amount of sparkle to any nail job.</li>
            <li> I use them right away as soon as I got them.  </li>
            <li> I got different, beautiful colors(none of them repeated), but they&#x27;re all the same shape and there isn&#x27;t 3000 in the box!</li>
            <li> There were only about 600 gems (yes, I counted); the picture on here looks a heck of a lot more full as well (which is why I bothered to count).</li>
            <li> quality gems and a great little box at an affordable price!  </li>
            <li> a very smart purchase</li>
            <li> I would have love them if they were a little bit smaller.. but either than that they were great.</li>
            <li> They are very sturdy too, they don&#x27;t fall off easily, you really have to pull.</li>
            <li> LOVE YOUR SUPER LOW PRICES !!</li>
            <li> They work great on both lengths, because they are quite small.</li>
            <li> I love that these barely cost pennies to get</li>
            <li> I got these before the date they were supposed to be here they are pretty and colorful I like them</li>
            <li> but generally i was satisfied</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy with the small size of the gems.</li>
            <li> Pretty and still worth the price</li>
            <li> They are really small and cute and apply very easily.</li>
            <li> Pay a little more get better quality.</li>
            <li> Colors are rich and vibrant.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, I was shock when I saw the little box, I thought I was not going to be happy</li>
            <li> I love these cute little gems.  </li>
            <li> These are great for fun and play, but unless you have profession equipment, they are hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t order these if you are needing right away or pay the higher shipping cost.</li>
            <li> The little gems are so ADORABLE, and they came sorted in a really nice clear plastic case!!</li>
            <li> Love the round gems and colors are nice and vibrant.  </li>
            <li> they came super fast in the mail and</li>
            <li> They are easy to put on with either a dab of glue or sealed in with a clear coat polish.</li>
            <li> You get a good variety of colors and plenty of them for less the 4 dollars.</li>
            <li> The quality of the gems may not be top notch, but I have no problem sticking them on my nails (they all lasted 4,5ish days at least too), and they make ae nice sparkly addition.</li>
            <li> Lids are extremely secure and thin (great for storage).  </li>
            <li> worth the buy dont think it was 3000 gems case is good to not a cheap case i say buy</li>
            <li> This is nice you 12 color to chose from , the only thing is that they don&#x27;t sparkle too much .</li>
            <li> they are small but great size to be able to put multiple per nail</li>
            <li> They stay on very well, and are very pretty on.</li>
            <li> This item is very pretty the product came undamaged and fast.</li>
            <li> pink was my favorite!</li>
            <li> I liked these little colorful rhinestones!</li>
            <li> this is such a nice case the quality was great and the gems are super pretty, not too big or too small and they will help a bunch to keep my station at work clean</li>
            <li> Nonetheless its pretty good for less then $1.50</li>
            <li> these are exactly as described and they came in super fast.</li>
            <li> great price and love the case it came in.. got it as shown in the pics, gems are big enough for nail art.. not too big</li>
            <li> also it arrived very much faster than the estimated date.</li>
            <li> I like it very much and got it on time</li>
            <li> thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to spill :)  Lots of fun using them on our nails!</li>
            <li> , my 6 year old can get them fine</li>
            <li> The lids open and shut easily, which is particularly nice, so that you don&#x27;t accidentally spill some while trying to open the case.  </li>
            <li> i liked these stones, they are very small but their ok for the price.</li>
            <li> and she loved the little case</li>
            <li> Good little gems.</li>
            <li> Good for little girls and nail art lovers.</li>
            <li> I loved the little gems.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a friend who is always doing fun new manicures with stones and other accents and she loved it.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a number of item being sent from China and this is the first one to get to the US.  </li>
            <li> , the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying gems online.</li>
            <li> I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> I love doing my nails constantly</li>
            <li> Theres so much i can do with these!</li>
            <li> It was my first try.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> , there isn&#x27;t much to complain about!</li>
            <li> Received the product within a couple weeks and it looks exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> But for what it&#x27;s worth, I really like it</li>
            <li> Lot&#x27;s of pretty gems for nails.</li>
            <li> The gems are pretty, but ....</li>
            <li> It is a shame because the stones are so pretty.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> Smaller sized rhinestones would&#x27;ve been better.</li>
            <li> and if I ever need to buy more, I can simply put them in here.</li>
            <li> will be back for more.</li>
            <li> First, there aren&#x27;t 3000 gems.  </li>
            <li> and I love all of the various colors.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> I love the selection of different colors you get.</li>
            <li> exactly what i was looking for......</li>
            <li> *)</li>
            <li> Definitely want a refund for sure.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty</li>
            <li> there were colors that were repeated but was overall pleased with it...</li>
            <li> They are just so cute and the container is so small and adorable.</li>
            <li> I would buy some more in the future.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Now the gems are very very tiny, but that&#x27;s ok with me.</li>
            <li> Its exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on the good reviews and cheap price while honestly not expecting much.</li>
            <li> And the size of the rhinestones are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> AND YES I WOULD MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THEM -</li>
            <li> Pretty colors.</li>
            <li> The picture in the description has to be several containers added into one in order to get the look of so many.</li>
            <li> I am using this for a stocking stuffer for an avid scrapbooker.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because it says 3000 nail art gems and there is not that many...</li>
            <li> really small size,flat backs &amp; are  perfect for nails.i estimated i got 1000 gems , not 3000.&lt;br /&gt;great container with flip open tops .all</li>
            <li> everything is exactly like it describes though.</li>
            <li> I love that not only is it a variety of colors but also a variety of sizes.  </li>
            <li> case they come in is not the easiest at first</li>
            <li> Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> The item is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> I received exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> exactly what the picture has.</li>
            <li> But they work, and are pretty on your nail art.</li>
            <li> Love these - all different sizes and colors.</li>
            <li> it is exactly what they show so</li>
            <li> So not only did I love these, my mom did too.</li>
            <li> Love all the different colors!  </li>
            <li> They can be used for so many different things.</li>
            <li> The picture of them is exactly what you get.</li>
            <li> I used a couple and they have stayed on pretty well.</li>
            <li> Fun, mixed colors are good, all the same shapes (the description may lead you to think otherwise)</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> just used them for the first time tonight</li>
            <li> These are verry pretty.</li>
            <li> They were exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> They love it and the studs aren&#x27;t too big.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like he picture.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Exactly like described.</li>
            <li> Ive only been able to use it once on my nails.</li>
            <li> I love how sturdy the case is; it won&#x27;t come open if you put it in your bag, etc.</li>
            <li> I could NOT have asked for more (especially for the price!)</li>
            <li> Love that I don&#x27;t necessarily need to use them on my nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much cheaper to add these gems yourself to your acrylic nails rather than getting them at the nail salon!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all evenly sized, no weird misshapen rhinestones stand out.</li>
            <li> Even if it isn&#x27;t exactly 3000 gems it is still a lot of them in the container.</li>
            <li> Will defiantly be repurchasing if I ever finish the first one.</li>
            <li> The gems are smaller than what I wanted but I&#x27;ll find something to do with them :)</li>
            <li> so i am assuming the shipper was quit aware of this issue when it was mailed</li>
            <li> lots of pretty colors ..</li>
            <li> and they are pretty durable, too.</li>
            <li> I love the different colors.</li>
            <li> The picture shows how it looks exactly.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time buying rhinestones and I love all of the different colors.</li>
            <li> I am overall pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love that I have 12 different colors to choose from when doing my nails!</li>
            <li> I also love that each color is separated by a compartment (each compartment has a number engraved on it) that I can open &amp; close</li>
            <li> LOVE ALL THE DIFFERENT COLORS</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t count to see how many were actually in.</li>
            <li> but I have yet to be able to open them</li>
            <li> Many different colors for variety.</li>
            <li> so can&#x27;t really complain!</li>
            <li> these are so pretty.</li>
            <li> and I know she&#x27;ll like them since she&#x27;s an avid collector.</li>
            <li> Exactly as stated.  </li>
            <li> These are exactly what I was looking for, for my nail art!&lt;br /&gt;Thrilled with all of the colors</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve said in other reviews I love SODIAL!  </li>
            <li> The colors are mixed together in mostly all twelve slots.</li>
            <li> This was beyond worth the buy and wait for shipping, and shipped much quicker than planned.</li>
            <li> Went back and bought 3 more.</li>
            <li> My daughter has used these once and thinks they are pretty neat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m highly satisfied, but wish the case was a bit bigger</li>
            <li> And they are exactly as described.</li>
            <li> For months I haven&#x27;t been able to find these rhinestones in stores so this was my next choice</li>
            <li> Honestly, I expected maybe something that was kind of a rip off compared to the picture just because of the price</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love bling in my nails, especially color ones</li>
            <li> but they do come in pretty colors</li>
            <li> exactly what I paid for.</li>
            <li> then i expected but nice.</li>
            <li> But, the colors are pretty and you get a ton of them.</li>
            <li> These gems are ok, they are definitely not 3000 of them</li>
            <li> are so pretty</li>

            <li> picture shows how it is exactly.</li>
            <li> First of all there is no WAY there are 3000 in this thing.  </li>
            <li> Second of all they get quite cloudy when you put a top coat over them.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> they are sooo tiny and cute</li>

            <li> Pretty color rhinestones.</li>
            <li> They are the perfect size not too small and not too big.</li>
            <li> So pretty.</li>
            <li> I just love all the colors and how there are different shapes like hearts and moons and stars.</li>
            <li> So, ask first.</li>
            <li> I should have brought multiple packs because I love these and when I do others nails</li>

            <li> You can make a pretty flower with 6 rhinestones.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for Grand daughter who is starting apprentice nail tech.</li>
            <li> These are exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> and I love all the different colors.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s still small but a good bargain deal) and I used them right away</li>
            <li> Mine was very neat, the crystals all in the right parts, no mixing of crystals.</li>
            <li> I really got this for the box, I like have the variety of plastic gems on hand, they are pretty small and great for using for customers on a large volume.</li>
            <li> They are perfect for small little girls my daughter is 4 and they stay on for a long time if u used good nail glue</li>
            <li> this product is ok - tons smaller than it looks in the picture - very tiny - but ok - thanks</li>
            <li> They are very small and great for details .</li>
            <li> was hoping that it would be a little bit more filled</li>
            <li> colors are nice (not off colors) like other places.</li>
            <li> i loved it... looks pretty big on the picture but its not that big!!!</li>
            <li> These little nail gems are fun and sparkle nicely.</li>
            <li> I suck with patience but none the less I am happy with this and glad I got a lot of gems for the little amount I paid.</li>
            <li> I just got these and there are many color stones other companies offer the amount of stones are adequate for my home decorations for my toes.</li>
            <li> I used clear coat before applying them and clear coat on top of them and they would budge.</li>
            <li> it came with a nail stick but overall good for the price &amp; its comes with different shades of colors</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get anything of this good quality and low low price in stores.</li>
            <li> I received it MUCH faster than I had expected, which was a nice surprise.  </li>
            <li> Consistent colors and good small size to use on all sizes of nails.</li>
            <li> I love them especially because nail salons charge so much to put them on i</li>
            <li> I will just make sure in the future to order far in advance!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt; Very cute little gems</li>
            <li> Very cute little gems.</li>
            <li> Yes out f the many many gems maybe 5 were loose in the baggy outside of the case.</li>
            <li> cause this is not what I order and had to spend so much money to take out something I did not want am very very upset</li>
            <li> thanks very much for your services</li>
            <li> They are pretty small stones, seemed a little smaller than others I have purchased on Amazon, so they are perfect for intricate designs, just make sure 2mm is the right size you are looking for.  </li>
            <li> I love that the case is small, about the size of a smartphone, so it stores easily in my nail collection.</li>
            <li> I received this item pretty fast and it looked like there was a lot in the case</li>
            <li> I reccomend the, The delivery was fast and exactly as in the picture.</li>
            <li> Got the product pretty fast</li>
            <li> They go great with my nails, but the only thing i wasn&#x27;t pleased with was when I received the package the case was broken and</li>
            <li> It took a long  time to get them, but for the price it was ok.</li>
            <li> Good quality small gems.</li>
            <li> These are good but really small.</li>
            <li> but good things come in small packages.</li>
            <li> Good size for small nails.</li>
            <li> Makes at home manicures a little more special.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing super different or special about the rhinestones, they&#x27;re just rhinestones, but  what I really like is the fact that they come in a case.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice for as little as it costs.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this nail art gems thinking it would be super small based on a few of the reviews, but it&#x27;s the perfect size.</li>
            <li> Although they do vary in size a little (barely, just try to find ones that look close in size if its that important to you) and they don&#x27;t look like most high quality rhinestones (cut precisely like swarovski crystals, but</li>
            <li> it came with tons of little cute gems!</li>
            <li> exactly what i expected and more</li>
            <li> Wide variety of gems, small and the perfect size for nail designs.  </li>
            <li> The colors are very vibrant.</li>
            <li> Gems and Rhinestones in the individual compartments make it so easy to use.</li>
            <li> It comes with a dozen colors and there is a large number of stones.  </li>
            <li> and they come in this refillable case so that you can re order certain colors as you need them</li>
            <li> They came in in about 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There appeared to be a large amount of the gems in the container and the gems were sorted.</li>
            <li> A tool is needed if you want them to go on right &amp; look pretty &amp; not messy.</li>
            <li> The container is easy to open, and is very convenient with each color of gems being separated.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and they last so long with just a clear coat on top of them.  </li>
            <li> these are nice but a little too large for your nails</li>
            <li> I have found that the gems you buy on sheets stay longer on the nail and are less prone to come off, but the solution for that is simply a stronger top coat or additional top coat.</li>
            <li> Pretty vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty decent over all.</li>
            <li> These are super cute to use when you have patience and a lot of extra time to actually use them.</li>
            <li> I very highly recomend them.</li>
            <li> These little gems can be a nice add-on to your polish.</li>
            <li> Nice, shiny little crystals.</li>
            <li> She now has a little clientele list of her own (family and friends.)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s 3k pieces, like the others all detail, but it comes in a really nice little box.</li>
            <li> The studs in my opinion are TOO DAMN SMALL but other wise ok.</li>
            <li> Love my little compact case with many different color jewels.</li>
            <li> But a HUGE Plus it came 10 days earlier than earliest arrival date.</li>
            <li> but in reality you get not so much.</li>
            <li> I have changed my nails so much this week; just so I can try every color.</li>
            <li> The whole box is 5 in x 2 in.</li>
            <li> My ten year old grand daughter absolutely loves this set, and as inexpensive as it is, it really is a steal</li>
            <li> I bought these gems because they were so much cheaper than at the store.  </li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> I did realize that they were coming from China, but delivery time was fast.</li>
            <li> There are tons of gems in a variety of colors so you can play around as much as you want and not worry about wasting money.</li>
            <li> I really like the product, but the container the gems came in did not contain the gems and about 1/3 of the gems were in the plastic packaging bag that was around the container...</li>
            <li> I really think this is a quality product</li>
            <li> I like it so much and reorder 3 boxes again</li>
            <li> The amount you get for the price is EXTREMELY reasonable.</li>
            <li> Very recommended because arecomfort and fill my spectations.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The nail artist even asked me how much did I pay for this</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> The rhinestones come very organized.</li>
            <li> Really like these.</li>
            <li> Just understand that what you are buying is very inexpensive</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves these and for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Reasonable ship time.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li> The shipping was extremely fast from Honkong to California</li>
            <li> However, they aren&#x27;t faceted, so they don&#x27;t sparkle a whole lot, but there are a variety of colors.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d pay more for an empty case at a craft store, so this is a steal.</li>
            <li> thank you so much I will be ordering again from them soon</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t get nearly as much product.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li> Fast shippin.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> Hw much u be paying Ino</li>
            <li> I do to much ..</li>
            <li> My daughter uses them on her nails and they work really well.</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s 3000 gems in there.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> very girlish.</li>
            <li> but theyre not very shiny at all and look as though if I add topcoat on top of them so they will stay on my nail longer</li>
            <li> plus they&#x27;re so inexpensive you can really complain.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> They fit on her tiny toes!</li>
            <li> Very versatile.  </li>
            <li> really chunky and they don&#x27;t stick to ANYTHING.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Items were described well and just as I expected, FANTASTIC prices!</li>
            <li> Very cloudy</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> I will reorder when needed, thanks again</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t have much of them</li>
            <li> lots of lil gems like real crystals for my nail art...</li>
            <li> It was much better than I ever expected.</li>
            <li> You absolutely can not beat the price.</li>
            <li> I wont be using them much.</li>
            <li> I really like the container that they came in too.</li>
            <li> them don&#x27;t use it to much</li>
            <li> Very organized.</li>
            <li> Got here fast</li>
            <li> really like the color verity but</li>
            <li> but you can&#x27;t really complain for the price.</li>
            <li> wont complain to much....</li>
            <li> &amp;Modern.</li>
            <li> Definitely very versatile.</li>
            <li> The nail gems are as described, but they definitely have a cheap plastic gem look to them, as opposed to crystal gems.  </li>
            <li> Still, considering how often I have gems get knocked off of my nails, this was about as much as I wanted to invest in them.  </li>
            <li> 3000 may seem like a lot, but I go through them fast.  </li>
            <li> The case keeps them sorted securely and there are a bunch of different colors.</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect 3000 pieces for the price</li>
            <li> my case was broken when I got it and customer service was GREAT</li>
            <li> Which is much faster</li>
            <li> I really learned alot before I have even started.</li>
            <li> Cheap, no shine, and tiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleaded with product.</li>
            <li> CAME FAST</li>
            <li> Really???</li>
            <li> It was packaged very well.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I use them for decorating my daughters nails.</li>
            <li> This is something that would probably cost about twice as much at a store.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfies with my order.</li>
            <li> I really ike</li>
            <li> this the shipping was fast</li>
            <li> Very well packaged and nothing out of its place.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product &amp; the company that sells it!</li>
            <li> They are cute and just the size I expected.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting too much  with this  </li>
            <li> I really  like the color assortment also.</li>
            <li> They have different colors that fit almost all of my nail art designs.  </li>
            <li> got it fast</li>
            <li> However, the nail lady didn&#x27;t charge me as much.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping item as described</li>
            <li> But i have to say, this product was cheap, so I wasn&#x27;t actually expecting 3000 to begin with.  </li>
            <li> They stick on your nails and are very blingy.  </li>
            <li> Still took about 3 or 4 weeks to get here but for about $1.50 I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The jewels are smaller than i expected but in good quality, it also came with glue.</li>
            <li> I love them but sadly only got to use it once bc my 3 year old son got into them</li>
            <li> a regular top clear coat use a gel</li>
            <li> Just use the top clear coat, set them with your tweezers and go over with a 2nd coat and they won&#x27;t come off!</li>
            <li> shipment came In earlier than expected which is good.</li>
            <li> and it kind of &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; them and makes them look round like beads..</li>
            <li> The box is very easy to open and close and the plastic is super clear so you can see the rhinestones well without having to open the compartments.  </li>
            <li> OK - First of all, I&#x27;m not one of these people who is going to sit down and count them to see if there really is 3k pieces - who has time for that???  </li>
            <li> Great for the price, very small!</li>
            <li> It arrived in about a week and a half early, which I was very pleased about.</li>
            <li> A small tube a glue would&#x27;ve been a nice extra that I would&#x27;ve gladly paid a little more for.</li>
            <li> I mean I guess is a good thing since you know your rhinestones wont leak out.</li>
            <li> The neat little case keeps them all separate, and super easy to use.</li>
            <li> But on a positive note, its far cheaper to order them through here and the quantity is higher.</li>
            <li> Bought this amount other things for my aunt for a present she loved</li>
            <li> now i love all the colors thought they fall off easily if not put on right</li>
            <li> I got the gems within a week of ordering, they&#x27;re not best of quality but still really good for the price!</li>
            <li> But I use silver more than other colors.</li>
            <li> Again,  like 3 other gemstone purchases i made, it does not have add many add it advertises,  but there are plenty for the price.  </li>
            <li> They are a little small but they are great!</li>
            <li> My costomers kept asking me when these babies will be back in stock, I was so excited I contacted the seller and asked when will they arrive</li>
            <li> but they are so cute,, the shipment was way before the due date..</li>
            <li> Not disappointed, especially for the price and the quantity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they are just like other gems you buy.</li>
            <li> i would definitely recommend this product to anyone who loves to do nail art like me but at the same time is willing to wait about 2 weeks for them to come in the mail. :)</li>
            <li> So many colors individually packed in their own little section!!!</li>
            <li> It is so much easier to keep these organized with this particular box.</li>
            <li> case is nice, and much easier to use than the usual wheel style.</li>
            <li> i did some pretty neat designs with just the clear gems.</li>
            <li> I used them for the first time today and so far they have stayed on.</li>
            <li> I use these , on my clients nail design, and they love, how delicate, they are on them, and I love how simple, it is to work , with, these gems!</li>
            <li> The gems were sorted nicely so that was a good thing because I was afraid it was going to be mixed together like some of the reviews that I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li> in the picture it looks like you will get a lot of this little gems, but when I received my package their wasn&#x27;t as many as I expected, but overall this is very cute</li>
            <li> This comes in a cute litte case that keeps the gems seperate even if it were to tip upside down.</li>
            <li> Shipping was really fast, and these were cute little project pieces for nail art.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new at the whole nail art thing</li>
            <li> it mostly bring the color black .</li>
            <li> More than half of the gems were out of the case.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased that my product got here in less than 3 weeks considering it came from China.</li>
            <li> way less in the containers than what it looks like here, but still cute and what i ordered.</li>
            <li> 12 squares, totaling at most, less than 1000 gems.  </li>
            <li> I actually received them fairly quickly after placing my order.</li>
            <li> if you have the time, patience and a steady hand...which I have none of.</li>
            <li> Someday i will get order more different gems mixed</li>
            <li> Gems come in a decent quality case separating each color.  </li>
            <li> I must of received a different product from everyone else because the stones I got are way smaller than what is listed/pictured, BUT I will say that they look adorable when used (I added them to my laptop decal to make it</li>
            <li> I love the box it came in with individual compartments to open one at a time.</li>
            <li> These are cute but too big, I thought they would be smaller in size.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super tiny.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this to people that love doing their nails especially even if you have short nails like me.</li>
            <li> You can give your nails a simple or bold look.</li>
            <li> definitely will be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s safe to say I have enough diamonds to last me for years!</li>
            <li> the price!&lt;br /&gt;The quality is decent.</li>
            <li> So many for such a low price~</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still a decent value.</li>
            <li> I love these, the only problem is that they are smaller than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> I ordered these expecting to have them within a decent amount of time knowing where they were coming from.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if 3,000 were in there, but there was a decent amount of gems in the holder.</li>
            <li> I counted each and every one to be sure, and there were only 370 in the entire container!!!</li>
            <li> These arrived earlier than expected and well packaged, nice color selection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d spend the few extra dollars and get the good ones.</li>
            <li> The design is made prettier by the many different colors and variations of the different types of designs that can be made.</li>
            <li> bottom of nail very pretty and simple design.</li>
            <li> Twelve different colors, all very pretty.</li>
            <li> I have had a nail obsession lately, so I bought these to make my nails look even cooler, I love them!</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend this seller and item.</li>
            <li> and I really highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, again bought these to go with the nail tools.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this item to others.</li>
            <li> The image showing the colors shows a light blue, and i did not receive that color, instead a got a a variation of a pink shade (which i&#x27;m fine with since I like pink better than blue anyway, and</li>
            <li> They came very well packaged, in a neat little container with individual compartments, and were delivered more than a week ahead of schedule!</li>
            <li> For the amount spent, quality and quantity is fine.</li>
            <li> these are fun and add a little &amp;#34;bling&amp;#34; for special occasions and every day wear</li>
            <li> that there were a little bit more stones in the case.</li>
            <li> I love these little gems.  </li>
            <li> Many little glitter for nails and whatever.</li>
            <li> i should have looked around a little more</li>
            <li> This comes in a little case and is just too cute.</li>
            <li> I love these little studs for my nails.</li>
            <li> Cute little stones.</li>
            <li> I love the little container they come in and whould recomend this product.</li>
            <li> They are a little foggy until you apply a top coat over them.  </li>
            <li> There are SO MANY little gems that it will take me forever to use them all.</li>
            <li> I just thought they would be a little shinier or more</li>
            <li> Adorable little gems and</li>
            <li> It did take a little bit to get here, but over all I love these gems.</li>
            <li> Pretty small but worth the money!!</li>
            <li> Its been more than a month now where are my little gems??</li>
            <li> I love the little container that they use for these rhinestones.  </li>
            <li> comes in a little cute box just like the pic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These will make a cute little gift.</li>
            <li> I love these little jewels, They got here before the estimated delivery.</li>
            <li> Okay so I was looking for these little rhinestones and Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply</li>
            <li> So far I have been loving these little stones!</li>
            <li> So they aren&#x27;t just large, but they stick out further than other rhinestones on the nails and pop off pretty easy if they get snagged or hit on anything.</li>
            <li> They are easy to manipulate, just stick them into a dab of nail glue or wet polish!</li>
            <li> the rhinestones are nice, but the hard plastic case came shattered</li>
            <li> I admit it is kind of hard to put them on my nails</li>
            <li> the glue, superglue that comes with it is a crapp bottle, go down to a hobby store and get a real bottle and get a fine tip extender</li>
            <li> thanks for sending it early then</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it was a great price and</li>
            <li> Im ready to go wild with them once christmas comes around.</li>
            <li> I have trouble getting them on just where I want them, but I&#x27;m sure once I learn the trick</li>
            <li> later smile</li>
            <li> Makes for a colorful and different design styles.</li>
            <li> I like that better than the wheel cases since that tends to get messy for me.</li>
            <li> The container that they come in is way better than the round ones though.</li>
            <li> gems are round and are multifaceted ,meaning many sides which adds to sparkliness.&lt;br /&gt;colors are :&lt;br /&gt;-Light purple</li>
            <li> There are several different styles of gems in this pack and its nice to have options when you are trying to do different designs with your nails.</li>
            <li> Love that you have all the colors in one spot versus the round wheel.</li>
            <li> They just came and wasn&#x27;t expecting them for a few more weeks</li>
            <li> But i have three kids that found it fun to help me separate the different stones.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure how small they are, even though it says for nail art.</li>
            <li> For those saying that these &#x27;tiny things&#x27; aren&#x27;t worth the two dollars you&#x27;re paying, well, that might be the case in China or Korea, but I dare you to find something in a US store that sells something like this for cheaper.</li>
            <li> I will be having a lot of fun doing different designs for my nails.</li>
            <li> There are definitely not 3000 gems in the package, but for the price I feel it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> like the variety I been having such fun with my nails&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These gems are so colorful and has different shades of a color.</li>
            <li> So i have lost a good bit of my money off the poor organization it comes in.</li>
            <li> I make the design I want and then wait a minute before I put another couple of clear coats on top to glue the stones down.</li>
            <li> but I expected more of them, it took liked it was half empty.</li>
            <li> Other than that, they suit the need I ordered for just fine.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend you getting a easy to open case</li>
            <li> The case itself is honestly a value in itself at less than $2, I will reuse it if I ever actually use up all the gems.</li>
            <li> but these are very richly colored and cut perfectly round.</li>
            <li> I apply a thin top coat, then put the gem on and apply another thin layer of top coat on top of the gem.</li>
            <li> they are as described, i have not counted them, i do not have the time to, but it does seem pretty accurate as they are a ton of these little things!</li>
            <li> very happy-gems aren&#x27;t too big or too small so they&#x27;ll work nicely for my purposes.</li>
            <li> so I would&#x27;ve liked the gems to be a little smaller</li>
            <li> They take a home done manicure to a new level.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get all these colors where I live</li>
            <li> i ordered this under the impression that there would 3000 gems and that it was NEW that was not the case at all</li>
            <li> very hard to pick up and to place and to get them to stick to the nail, but very cute if you got it done the way u wanted to</li>
            <li> The price was very low, so I can&#x27;t really complain too much.  </li>
            <li> unlike the really big fat gems that dont fit or you can only put one!!!!!</li>
            <li> Better than expected for the low price.</li>
            <li> you cant reuse them so it would have gotten 5 stars if there was more gems or at least as much as they said there would be.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m giving them to my little girls, because I could foresee my carpet becoming forever sparkly.</li>
            <li> she like them very much and still uses them a year later to do her nails.</li>
            <li> I use these very frequently.</li>
            <li> The case locks tight so that it doesnt pour out, plus it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Ok for its price not that bad good for beginners dont waist alot of money that latter</li>
            <li> There were a lot, but the case was pretty big</li>
            <li> WHERE NEAR, IM MADDDDDD !</li>
            <li> The case they come in is pretty sturdy and there are a lot of different color varieties.</li>
            <li> I got 3 different blues and one purple instead of 2 different blues and 2 different purples, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> They are obviously not stickers, but individual gems, so unlike the gems you get on sheets, you will definitely need an undercoat and top coat to adhere these to the nail.</li>
            <li> This was exactly as described, the gems are tiny, but again I knew they would be.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend to all who loves rhinestones on nails, or other arts and crafts. :-)</li>
            <li> My five year old loves them!</li>
            <li> II love small ones</li>
            <li> I got it in the mail today, 12 days early!</li>
            <li> The compartment box contains an assorment of small, cute gems for creating nail art.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter loves this set of gems!  </li>
            <li> I love how simple it is to open each individual storge compartment.</li>
            <li> I will purchase more they arrived earlier than i expected too!</li>
            <li> For a small taste of glitter on nails is ok.</li>
            <li> Small, cute gems to stay on nails.</li>
            <li> and they are really small so they should look cute on the nails rather than</li>
            <li> These little gems are easily applied when polish is damp, and stay on until taken off with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> She always comes up with a new design to wow the world.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy packs of these &amp; can&#x27;t really complain for how cheap they are.</li>
            <li> lots of different colors and not mixed up or 1/4 full.</li>
            <li> It came sooner then expected and while I do like it for the price, I have a feeling I&#x27;ll run out quick</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected cute little rhinestones with every color</li>
            <li> They stick on easily with a little dab of clear nail polish.  </li>
            <li> No where near 3000, no where near 1/2 of that!</li>
            <li> Especially since so many people have counted the gems, and found that there is significantly less.</li>
            <li> so you could fit multiple gems on a single nail design.</li>
            <li> Easy to add, just place it on the wet nail polish and then add a clear to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> I do recommend that if you want a certain color for any reason to either buy multiple sets of this or look for that color in bulk.</li>
            <li> Such a large variety of color.</li>
            <li> its very cheap so it wont be suh a big deal if you waste a couple.</li>
            <li> Fantastic little gems.</li>
            <li> ...will spend a little more next time.</li>
            <li> I love it not too hard to handle if you are looking for alot of bling</li>
            <li> While some gems become dull after an application of top coat, these did not.  </li>
            <li> hard to pick up the tiny pieces, but it did come with nail glue which is handy.  </li>
            <li> It was extremely cheap and came 2 weeks earlier than the earliest expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need any glue just place them on your nail and paint over them with clear polish</li>
            <li> but I just used clear nail polish to keep it on my nails.</li>
            <li> i use clear coat</li>
            <li> They stick on with no problem with just clear nail polish and they stay on in the baths or showers you don&#x27;t have to worry about reapplying each time.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used glue with them, just put a coat of clear nail polish over them.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to use just clear nail polish, but that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I used them and just set them with some clear polish and they lasted a couple of weeks until i scraped them off.</li>
            <li> For the price totally worth it, checked Sally&#x27;s and way more expensive.  </li>
            <li> My 8 year old loves this.  </li>
            <li> My three year old cannot wait until mommy can jazz up her toes.</li>
            <li> She was surprised when I told her I did it myself.</li>
            <li> Turns out I&#x27;ve got way to much of everything else to do to that prohibits me from gluing tiny diamonds on my nails.</li>
            <li> No trouble with anything.</li>
            <li> They did arrive early though.</li>
            <li> They r for my 13 year old niece.</li>
            <li> I agree with everyone who said that there was nowhere near 3000 stones, but I didn&#x27;t take the time to count each and every stone, you can tell by just glancing at it.</li>
            <li> and I use them on my natural and acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how it came a week early and</li>
            <li> only real problem we had with this was the quality of the case.  </li>
            <li> They arrived early and all stayed in their case.</li>
            <li> theres NOWHERE NEAR the correct number of gems as advertised.</li>
            <li> I got the gems today and they came early</li>
            <li> When it arrived I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> and they came early.</li>
            <li> I stopped getting my nails professionally done to save money</li>
            <li> Unless your a professional that does client after client</li>
            <li> even took some of my old ones out of the wheel container they were in .&lt;br</li>
            <li> My one complaint is there surely does not seem to be 3000 pieces</li>
            <li> not recommend unless you are buying for a 8 year old.</li>
            <li> whereas I thought they&#x27;d be very teeny tiny, but now I know what 2 mm equals!  </li>
            <li> Apply polish and before the polish completely dries, apply the gem.</li>
            <li> Completely my fault.</li>
            <li> so early arrival its a plus.</li>
            <li> There is a variety of colors completely organized into each slot</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really beat 3000 stones, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The case they come in is upper sturdy and holds up real well.</li>
            <li> i will give them the 1 star as it arried 5 days early.</li>
            <li> Arrived two weeks early.</li>
            <li> There so fun to use and got them pretty fast just disappointed that there wasn&#x27;t as many diamonds as in the picture they show</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really expecting such a variety.</li>
            <li> the 3000 the title says, but I&#x27;m sure I got at least 2000</li>
            <li> Not anywhere near 3000 gems.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to let my 8 year old start using them.</li>
            <li> but I dont think that what is in the package is anywhere near that,</li>
            <li> But, I was surprised to find when the product arrived, it met my expectations.</li>
            <li> They will help you get that professionally manicured look on your nails.</li>
            <li> Makes all my nail art extra fun to do by adding extra sparkle.</li>
            <li> She has fun doing her nails regularly, and she likes to play with different styles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if there are actually 3000 gems in there, but there are certainly enough that I consider it worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth the money I spent.  </li>
            <li> cause i am just starting to do my nails at home, and the tiny pieces are hard to place right, but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> They add just a little sparkle and make them so unique.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to use my little colorful rhinestones !</li>
            <li> They took a little long to get here, but I am so pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> they are fun to use with my family for nails or even other art projects</li>
            <li> The main reason I only gave this item 3 stars is bc</li>
            <li> very solid and will be useful long after the gems are used up</li>
            <li> I personally love these rhinestones because they are a lot smaller than usual rhinestones.</li>
            <li> i also thought they would be smaller but they are pretty big.</li>
            <li> Even at the cheap price, its not worth the wait to end up getting something completely different from what you ordered.</li>
            <li> good for doing nails, quite small and messy tho.  </li>
            <li> Came in a cool little case, all sorted by colors.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying that I highly doubt there are actually 3000 rhinestones in this container.</li>
            <li> It comes with a decent amount of gems and the gems are very durable and they last  a long time.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no down side to this item.</li>
            <li> tried it with just polish but didn&#x27;t stick for long but did very well with nail glue.</li>
            <li> While I did like the &amp;#34;wheel,&amp;#34; I found that this was much easier to use as it offers you the opportunity to keep multiple areas open at once.  </li>
            <li> These are exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> These were good but hard to get out of the package and the little pieces always came out and would be everywhere.</li>
            <li> A few gem colors got mixed up but otherwise the packaging was fine.</li>
            <li> They are really tiny so that they can fit on your nails and come in a little box with compartments for each color gem.</li>
            <li> She love to add a little sparkle to wet painted nails.</li>
            <li> Hard to glue on, fall off easily, doesn&#x27;t come with glue.</li>
            <li> I like the shine and how they small, very useful product.</li>
            <li> Unless you have super tiny fingers or really sharp tweezers, you won&#x27;t like these.</li>
            <li> My mother had open the package - out of curiosity, and sent me a photo through text of my new gems.</li>
            <li> A couple of the compartment lids are a little loose and do not feel secure, but really don&#x27;t plan on travelling with it so not a big issue.</li>
            <li> You pretty much get what you pay for with this kit, nothing out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li> Most nail shops offer something of similar quality for at least five times the price.</li>
            <li> The container was a lot smaller than it looks in the pic, No bigger than my hand really.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviews i found that each section opened and closed just fine</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and expected!</li>
            <li> I purchased my order about three weeks ago and just received it in a cute little package on the 13 for which I&#x27;m not complaining because I&#x27;m working my way towards other nail items before I even attempt to d&amp;eacute;cor</li>
            <li> There are no other shapes in the box.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are twelve easy to open little compartments for the various colors.</li>
            <li> Box is not to big or to small for easy storage.</li>
            <li> And it contains the following colors: black, royal purple, salmon pink, emerald green, royal blue, hot pink/primrose-kind-of-color, yellow-gold, light green, light pink, silver, light purple/lilac, and red.</li>
            <li> Just for fun little gems for the nails.</li>
            <li> This was definitely a little package but worth its price.  </li>
            <li> They took a little while to recieve but the price and product is well worth it</li>
            <li> Its pretty much what i expected it fits in the palm of your hand.. on the other hand i had no Idea</li>
            <li> I really only ordered this item mainly for mixed shapes.</li>
            <li> everything was a little smaller than i expected but love them cant wait to use them.</li>
            <li> I understand it is pretty reasonable, but at least update the information about the product and send what you promise.</li>
            <li> but i can fit at least 4 on a nail in a line so there not to the point you can barely see them.</li>
            <li> I use a toothpick and a tiny dab of clear nail polish on the tip to pick them up and place them.</li>
            <li> so when I use them for my girls nails i have to add extra layers of the clear coat.</li>
            <li> The gems are small enough to fit about 20 on one nail.</li>
            <li> I have used these for my nail designs and so far I am a big fan of them and would recommend them to others.</li>
            <li> I want the same for my 6 year old.</li>
            <li> The product came early by international shipping and it is serving its purpose!</li>
            <li> No regrets what so ever.</li>
            <li> good quality is worth the money small u can use it on regular nails n fake nails&lt;</li>
            <li> Because of that, I have to be careful when moving the whole tray</li>
            <li> You have to be very meticulous when putting them on (the nail polish needs to be slightly wet to stick)</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s 12 different colors of gems, each marked with a number 1-12 on the case.</li>
            <li> plastic and barely shine.</li>
            <li> They make a big difference.looks professional</li>
            <li> there were definitely no where near 3000 gems in this package.  </li>
            <li> They came much quicker than expected, considering that they were shipped from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li> They look nice on the site, but I was not impressed when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> What annoyed me the most is that they</li>
            <li> my little ones of course had to try them right out.</li>
            <li> I expected them to be a little better quality, they are really not that shiny and get worn down quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to use gems, just hard to grab obviously because of their size.</li>
            <li> I like that the case has tops that open individually for each different gem color, and that the dividers are large enough that the gems do not mix.</li>
            <li> but the gems are super duper small.</li>
            <li> Came quick and the container is small.</li>
            <li> I expected the little boxes to be filled</li>
            <li> The product arrived much sooner than promised, and at a price that was WAY below other competitors</li>
            <li> This item arrived much sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> You get a lot and when they&#x27;re empty, the little case they come in can be very useful, too.</li>
            <li> glitter in a cheap box not as shown way to small to long to devlery not even 3000 gems maybe 1000</li>
            <li> so it takes practice placing them exactly where you want them, but by my second toe i had it down to a science.</li>
            <li> Just try not to do what I did and forget and leave the rhinestone case in a hot car, because I think it changed the shape of the box a little and</li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s not filled up very much</li>
            <li> The container is a little smaller than expected but you can fit a lot of the gems in each spot.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a bunch of stuff from Amazon and this was the first thing to arrive a few days after purchase.  </li>
            <li> It comes exactly as the picture shows, multiple colors and a sturdy little case.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they were not very shiny, other then that it was a great deal</li>
            <li> Shipping was long but much shorter than expected.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste $16.99 at the beauty supply store when you can get the exact same product for a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> the pink i got that isn&#x27;t shown is really pretty, like a salmon pink color).</li>
            <li> they have the exact same set just fewer but a little bigger stones.</li>
            <li> The only negative was that they came all mixed up but other than that it was ok.</li>
            <li> Impossible to get an accurate count but sufficient to give me my Money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> super small!</li>
            <li> Seriously having this in my nail collection makes me feel cool</li>
            <li> The little container is really neat and would have paid the amount I paid just for the container.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely buy other new colors too.</li>
            <li> I just put 2 coats of clear nail polish on my nails and get a toothpick and dip the tip in water and pick up the stone on the color side and press the silver flat side onto the wet nail polish.  </li>
            <li> so I had to vacuum them up</li>
            <li> I think I need to pick up a few more of these for my other plain cases.</li>
            <li> so it looked clear but other than that</li>
            <li> These little gems arrived before expected, and they look exactly as depicted in the 1st photo.  </li>
            <li> Got these the other day and like wow now that&#x27;s 3000&#x27;s the othe rhinestones I got</li>
            <li> There are endless possibilities as far as nail designs.</li>
            <li> What I used was the flat end of my tweezers that I had ordered through here to open the lids besides using them for picking up the nail art gems.</li>
            <li> The stores only have a few choices and the nail salon prices are to high.  </li>
            <li> the studs stick up a little high</li>
            <li> The case is pretty hard to open.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soo small &amp;&amp;&#x27; I certainly didn&#x27;t qet 2000 ,</li>
            <li> and they range from small to large</li>
            <li> The gems are very pretty, but the case is very hard to get open.  </li>
            <li> Assuming the colors are the same in each case, I received Magenta, Yellow, Fuchsia, Orange, Green, Light Blue, Baby Pink, Pink, Clear/Diamond, Sapphire, BLACK and Red.</li>
            <li> I wanted tiny gems and that&#x27;s exactly what I got, like for the center of small flowers and such.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if there really are 3000 as I did not count</li>
            <li> The gems are small ones small enough to fit your nail.</li>
            <li> Just use long nose pliers if you can&#x27;t open the compartments.</li>
            <li> maybe I will just glue them in but don&#x27;t expect them to last long or have any shine</li>
            <li> This will definitely last me and my girls for a long time.</li>
            <li> Despite having to wait an extremely long time for the item, they sent me a wig, which is obviously not nail art gems!  </li>
            <li> They last a long while.</li>
            <li> It came pretty slowly</li>
            <li> Wow I did not realize how tiny these little things were.</li>
            <li> and so was the case(the nail art in the pictures are a little deceiving) and some of the gems had spilled all over in the package so i was sad about that, but besides that i like them they are nice colors</li>
            <li> A lot of the colors are pretty dull and there were no clear jems in my set.</li>
            <li> - there&#x27;s plenty in there, and they will last me a long time, and for what I paid, I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> I use them on my daughter since her nails don’t last very long.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s enough in the case so you can do your nails for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t surprised to find a lot less product than described.</li>
            <li> but the entire container is much smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> These little gems got here reasonably fast but the little boxes were open and the tiny gems were all in a scramble in the bag.  </li>
            <li> I actually purchased these and a few other items for my manicurist, who is so busy doing her job that she doesn.t have much time to locate little treasures like this.</li>
            <li> You could add a single stone, enhance a design, or add one by one to an entire nail.</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed at the fact that the description says you get 3000 total gems but actually there are about 950 about 80 per color..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not very professional looking.</li>
            <li> Although I though that all stones are the same my nail tech informed me that sometimes these rhinestones are not shiny which was the case of these ones that I bought recently once applied to the nail they don&#x27;t sparkle like other ones I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> just pick it with a tweezers and add a little clear nail polish as adhesive.</li>
            <li> These will last me forever and really add subtle, not tacky, beauty to my nails.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than paying $5-10 to have it added onto your pedicure at a salon, and all you need to do to prep is lay down a top coat and add the stones before it dries!</li>
            <li> Appear cheap and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a long time</li>
            <li> but they take a long period to arrive.  </li>
            <li> The end section with the red gems had been crushed in transit.</li>
            <li> but i will never get this again and see where i get it and how long it will take.</li>
            <li> My gems came earlier then expected</li>
            <li> It took awhile to get them but not as long as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a long time</li>
            <li> They seem to stay on as long as the nail salon ones</li>
            <li> I have long nails</li>
            <li> Although a bit smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> I did not count every piece but for the amount I spent there were enough for me not to care.</li>
            <li> and I dint know what it was because I expected to be bigger</li>
            <li> So we got it yesterday and the bos is literally 5 inches long.</li>
            <li> I ordered these gems aside from how long i had to wait for them to arrive (</li>
            <li> i recieved it after several weeks of waiting which was expected giving the fact that it shipped from hong kong</li>
            <li> smaller than I expected......</li>
            <li> Arrived almost 2 weeks earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> shipping took a long time</li>
            <li> Also I expected each color to have an equal amount.</li>
            <li> They came in a lot earlier than I expected</li>
            <li> I ordered through Digital Center and the price was 1.75 per box, so I ordered 3 boxes.</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> but they actually got to me sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM TOOK WAY TOO LONG TO GET HERE.</li>
            <li> They are much smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> It look a long time but came well package.</li>
            <li> The plastic container was broken and I only received 10-15 gems of each color I was expecting at least half full containers and not broken merchanidse</li>
            <li> The gems are cute but the segments on the end are impossible to open.</li>
            <li> It has several different colored stones in it and it&#x27;s plenty of each color except for black.</li>
            <li> Crystals included no instructions, no ,glue and were almost impossible to pick up with tweezers, if you were lucky enough to get one on with clear polish, it fell off almost immediately I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> they are soooooooooooooooo tiny like , you have to be careful because u can loose all of them in seconds....</li>
            <li> Magenta, gold, violet, orange, green, teal, pink, clear, blue, black, red and lavender.  </li>
            <li> They are super hard to get ahold of,even with a tweezers!!</li>
            <li> They are small, but larger ones would have trouble matching the curve of your nail and would probably not stay on very well.</li>
            <li> To the point that when I finally get the little flaps open the gems spill out all over the place.  </li>
            <li> I have shared this along with other products to my local nail salon to save them a lot of money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to agree with other customers about the number of gems you actually get, its not 3000.</li>
            <li> This set is different than the other sets I have.</li>
            <li> But I do have to agree with other people who have reveiwed this product the count on the gems was on the low side but considering the price I will not complain.</li>
            <li> I wish the gems were a little smaller and actual stones.  </li>
            <li> the other ladies there will definitely be jealous!</li>
            <li> The only thing is they&#x27;re a little bigger in diameter, thann</li>
            <li> Shapes are very similar to each other.</li>
            <li> Definitely a lot of little gems and all the different colors to choose from!</li>
            <li> They arrived earlier than expected, which is a plus!</li>
            <li> but they do take a LONG time to get to you!</li>
            <li> besides the container being a little annoying, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The nail art gems are small enough to be discreet but big enough to draw attention to your nails.</li>
            <li> I priced a set very similar to this at a local store and they were WAY, WAY more expensive and contained a very small amount of gems.</li>
            <li> VERY LONG SHIP TIME</li>
            <li> One of them had almost all of the gems out of the compartments and it is going to take me a very long time to sort them out.  </li>
            <li> The gems stay on for a very long time this way.</li>
            <li> But seriously, just tell the truth of what you really are giving.</li>
            <li> is missing the latch off of a couple of the individual containers so i cant open</li>
            <li> the individual tabs to open the sections are so hard to open</li>
            <li> They are super small and hard to work with let alone center on your finger nails.</li>
            <li> The quality is unbelievable for such a low cost.  </li>
            <li> Since I had already read several posts previously, I realized they are on the tinier side.</li>
            <li> only recieved half of the product.</li>
            <li> Just place them on the wet paint and let dry.</li>
            <li> They are acrylic stones and the color/shine isn&#x27;t equal to actual crystal stones, but for small details on a manicure they work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sizes vary slightly but not enough to bother me.</li>
            <li> Usually with things this tiny, the backs dont allow for proper coverage of a glue that will keep them on.</li>
            <li> Each slot opens separately so you&#x27;re less likely to mix or drop all of your gems.</li>
            <li> ENDED UP BUYING SEVERAL NAIL ITEMS FOR A FRIEND WHOS STARTING HER SMALL BUSINESS</li>
            <li> These only get 4 stars, cause when I opened the envelope, half of the containers section were opened and gems where everywhere.</li>
            <li> this has a big amount for less then 10.</li>
            <li> They are all the same small gem, just different colors.</li>
            <li> Each space/ cell is about as wide as my thumb (assuming i have an average sized hand, female in her twenties).</li>
            <li> The only thing was, I didn&#x27;t get why the picture shows, I received a round holder for the gems, not the long container like it shows.</li>
            <li> Each spot has a different color exactly like the picture but the one thing I found tough was how hard it is to open the separate sections!</li>
            <li> The jewels  stuck to the side of the container and they took a long time to ship but other the.</li>
            <li> You could add a little duo eyelash glue and apply them to your face for a dramatic look, weddings, or another special event.</li>
            <li> i thought they would be a little bigger</li>
            <li> I doubt there are actually 3000 little gems</li>
            <li> but I though the gems would be a little bigger.</li>
            <li> gems are a little low quality but can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> They are a  little big for nails</li>
            <li> They were a little mixed up upon arrival.  </li>
            <li> It only took a little amount of time for this product to get to my house.  </li>
            <li> I was just gonna get ripped off with little tiny rhinestones..</li>
            <li> I do like this, however I thought they were going to be a little bit bigger..</li>
            <li> Really tiny little gems</li>
            <li> They are small sized, and not the large ones depicted in the photos, but after reading the reviews I knew that they would be small, and those are what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The gems themselves are a little larger than I expected (they stick out)</li>
            <li> they were a little smaller than i expected</li>
            <li> Only thing i didn&#x27;t like some of the jem containers were hard to open.</li>
            <li> These are pretty small and hard to figure out how to work with to get on your nails</li>
            <li> i have nothing bad to say about this product at all i love the colors and the rhinestones i use them for nail designs</li>
            <li> but this is just rediculous for real thanks for nothing needless to say i wont be ordering from them again EVER.....</li>
            <li> A few extra for each of us and her to use.</li>
            <li> This product arrived way before the expected delivery date and well lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> Shipping was sooner than expected</li>
            <li> The container keeps everything organized but you have to pry them open a bit for a few.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used as often as expected</li>
            <li> My kids are rough on their nails</li>
            <li> I received it about 1 month after ordering, which I expected since it comes from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;ll take awhile to empty the box.</li>
            <li> I sat there with tweezers and spent hours separating the colors and getting them organized.</li>
            <li> even after the lids are closed so the gems tend to&lt;br /&gt;Spill</li>
            <li> no thanks..</li>
            <li> Paid for the 3000 rhinestones advertised and only received barely a few hundred.</li>
            <li> It took longer than I expected to have it.</li>
            <li> Considering I spent 10 dollars on a color wheel at Sally&#x27;s beauty supply that didn&#x27;t even have 20 of each color.</li>
            <li> The shipping was faster than expected</li>
            <li> This container keeps all the stones separate and stays closed even when getting tossed around.</li>
            <li> There were lots of gems and it came a lot faster than it was expected to come.</li>
            <li> These stones aren&#x27;t as shiny as I expected.  </li>
            <li> On the way over i guess it wasnt sealed correcctly cause a few of the sky blue were out.</li>
            <li> I received this product 15 days after ordering, but that was still 1 week ahead of the earliest expected delivery date.  </li>
            <li> definately what i expected... Check this out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were as expected, just was hoping it wasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> so basically i am missing an entire color set of the gems</li>
            <li> shipped quicker then I expected.</li>
            <li> you know it&#x27;s closed</li>
            <li> and i received my order way before I expected</li>
            <li> It arrived before I expected it</li>
            <li> This provided lots of gems for the money spent - will buy again.  </li>
            <li> It does take a few weeks to arrive since its being shipped internationally.</li>
            <li> These gems were just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I got my purchase today, sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> So I saw the review that said there is only a few hundred gems</li>
            <li> or push them into wet nail polish, they still look great.&lt;br /&gt;10/10 would recommend ~</li>
            <li> but I expected 3000 gems.</li>
            <li> Mine came in a round case which was no big deal.</li>
            <li> it came a couple days before the delivery date expected.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t receive black stones in the second one like I did the first.</li>
            <li> I have even found myself gluing them on to cards and other projects for a little extra bling.</li>
            <li> These gems are a little bigger than the other gems I have</li>
            <li> They come in 12 different colors and just what the picture shows: a very small divided container with tiny gems.</li>
            <li> These stones are small enough even for my niece little nails and still noticeable on my big acrylic nails.  </li>
            <li> They are made of plastic with medal backs, and the only color that has bling or shine is black they look like black diamonds.</li>
            <li> these are pretty but way small very hard to use, not for younger kids glue runs over everything and dries before you can get it on stone then trying to put on your nail before it drys and rolls over on wrong side is way to much work.</li>
            <li> After reading through the reviews I expected the gems to be all the same size, and small.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this earlier than it stated but was disappointed when i opened it and one of the compartments had a crack underneath and jewels where spilling out, i had to tape the bottom to keep them in...</li>
            <li> The item also came WAAAAAAY before expected!</li>
            <li> Came in quicker than expected but there&#x27;s not 3000 gems in here!</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The gems are small enough that when placed on the nail, the edges don&#x27;t stick out and won&#x27;t catch on anything.</li>
            <li> i use them so often and not just on my nails on other projects too</li>
            <li> I just wanted other shapes....</li>
            <li> , my fingers are a bit big to grasp the small jewls</li>
            <li> It is not exactly 3000 peices</li>
            <li> Will buy again in due time.</li>
            <li> I usually get the smaller cases.</li>
            <li> I am not going to use these on my nails, but  for  other art projects.</li>
            <li> These are small and simple.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to other.</li>
            <li> Other than that they&lt;</li>
            <li> so be careful!</li>
            <li> These gems are smaller than the usual ones that you see.</li>
            <li> To me personally I think that these rhinestones are a bit too small.</li>
            <li> The title also implies different shapes, but they&#x27;re all small rounds.</li>
            <li> and arrived way before the due date.</li>
            <li> Bought these so that my niece and I can give each other manis and pedis and she loves them, can&#x27;t wait for our spa night.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small enough to do anything with!</li>
            <li> not to big nor small.</li>
            <li> and they stayed on for weeks even after wearing tennis shoes and other shoes that are known for rubbing my nail polish off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to trying these with my next manicure in a few days!</li>
            <li> No rhinestones falling everywhere, which does happen with other companies.</li>
            <li> My box came nearly empty!  </li>
            <li> The lil&#x27; plastic case is small but simple.</li>
            <li> Another thing is that one of the compartments is broken so it can&#x27;t close which means I have to be extra careful not to let it tilt or the gems will be mixed up.</li>
            <li> And the other display pictures it shows multitible size diamonds.</li>
            <li> Although I presume these are meant for nail art, I use them for other purposes.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Totally mixed up with all the colors :/</li>
            <li> just wish it had shape variety like some big some small</li>
            <li> They arent too small or too big.</li>
            <li> They are small enough to be put onto my nails while being visible but not to gaudy.</li>
            <li> I like them enough to use again but wish they weren&#x27;t so small</li>
            <li> They like just came in the mail today and weren&#x27;t expected to come until May 22- June 10!</li>
            <li> Sorry for so much detail, but i figured I&#x27;d let you know everything that I would want to know too!</li>
            <li> These took about a little less then a month to get, when i got them in the mail i was surprised at how small they were</li>
            <li> have to be very careful when applying them.</li>
            <li> A few of the gems fell out during shipment and got mixed up, but not very many</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t loose all the little pretties inside..</li>
            <li> They sent a partial refund in with the package, so I think they knew it was less than promised.</li>
            <li> But I guess I was a little surprised with the size of the case.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s rather small!</li>
            <li> I have bought nail gems from other places and found them to be over priced and not worth the money.</li>
            <li> , There were a few loose rhinestones out side of the container</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers stating that there are less than 3000 pieces as advertised, but I took that into consideration before ordering.  </li>
            <li> the colors are so dull and perhaps the gems are too tiny..</li>
            <li> it is hard to open one</li>
            <li> thing , the sections in the case are hard to open</li>
            <li> Some of the lids are hard to open, but i&#x27;ll manage.</li>
            <li> Some of the compartments are hard to pry open.</li>
            <li> Container is hard to open!</li>
            <li> but i do fing these hard to open</li>
            <li> but once i recieved it the packaging was already ripped open the hard plastic case</li>
            <li> The case is a bit hard to open</li>
            <li> The case seems kinda hard to open.</li>
            <li> I am really beyond upset and mad because I paid for 300o and there isnt even half or even a third.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money</li>
            <li> WHY would they not put the correct number in the listing or at the least a number in the area of what you actually get?</li>
            <li> These are made for small and long nails.</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassel</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product because it&#x27;s just not worth the time.  </li>
            <li> Yes, i sat and counted, each section should have 250 pieces in order to be 3000, but there were about 160 on average.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the container &#x27;leaks&#x27; and sometimes I find them in my nail polish box.</li>
            <li> For the length of time it took to get here, and the cost, it was not worth it.</li>
            <li> too small for my fingers and long nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s 3000 in there, but there&#x27;s quite a few of each color, 12 different colors in all.</li>
            <li> But if i had bought this at the local sallys I would have paid probably at least $10 for what i got.</li>
            <li> I was specting them to take longer since I order this a few days after ordering SODIAL- Silver Kitty Rhinestone Crystal Fashion Jewelry Set with Pink Bow - Ring...  which never arrived.</li>
            <li> They have a thicker base, so you need more nail polish if you don&#x27;t want them to be as raised on the nail.  </li>
            <li> I had black gems mixed with my silver gems and it just made it hard to use</li>
            <li> (: the negative about the product would be that none of the gems have the same amount, some have less than others.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll use them on my daughters nails for a buck I don&#x27;t feel let down.</li>
            <li> then I expected it to!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> Lots of little gems just what I expected!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my jewelry making, and other crafts, as well as for nail art - they are SO versatile!  </li>
            <li> It has 12 different colors and the crystals are small for fingers and toes or even cell phone cases!</li>
            <li> The only thing is it&#x27;s a little hard to get them out of the case one at a time.</li>
            <li> Some of the little compartments are hard to open and I ended up using my teeth</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about this product is that the little compartments in the case the rhinestones come in do not click shut</li>
            <li> There is a lot of pieces but they are way too small and they loose their shine once put on the nail.</li>
            <li> Wish some of the sections weren&#x27;t so hard to open because I&#x27;ve lost quite a few that way</li>
            <li> It does not come with the amount says it dose (less)  </li>
            <li> wish it had some black in it.</li>
            <li> Wish there was black gems as well.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small but not so small that they don&#x27;t make statement and not big to the point where they look tacky.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re half-moon shape - like if you took a ball and cut it in half.</li>
            <li> I like there arent any oddly shaped ones in there.</li>
            <li> now half of the compartments don&#x27;t want to close.  </li>
            <li> so I could get my nail done my way and half the cost.</li>
            <li> I even received black.</li>
            <li> Also, I have always wanted black stones</li>
            <li> but I think I got half that.</li>
            <li> There is definitely less than 3000 gems and an unequal amount of each color.</li>
            <li> As previous reviews have stated there are less than what is described but for the price i can get over it.</li>
            <li> idk what people were talking about saying there was less gems</li>
            <li> Frankly, I bought it for less than $2 shipped</li>
            <li> the set comes with black gems too... &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> and they are also a lot less than 3000</li>
            <li> yeah the little doors are a little hard to open.</li>
            <li> Another complaint is the fact that each slot is very hard to open, so I had to use my teeth to pry it open.</li>
            <li> That was pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> I foresee a mess coming &#x3D;</li>
            <li> The lids snap shut tightly....</li>
            <li> Lids clasp tightly to prevent spillage.</li>
            <li> BUT the container is so hard to open :/</li>
            <li> I hate when they come in the wheel because they easily can mix or slip out of your hand.</li>
            <li> the quantity is too little.</li>
            <li> My little sister likes them though, so i might just give them to her.</li>
            <li> They are smaller than what the pic shows not the big rhinestones really tiny. :(.</li>
            <li> I like the little container</li>
            <li> There were 3021 gems in this little case.</li>
            <li> I still find the little gems everywhere in my room.</li>
            <li> Shipping to a little while but</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a TON of little rhinestones in the case.</li>
            <li> not  all little taps don&#x27;t close</li>
            <li> Other companies send stones that are cloudy or have small piece so plastic sticking from the sides of the stones</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s understandable because they&#x27;re so little.</li>
            <li> I like the little container and will use it after the gems are gone, so I do appreciate it and would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> It can be a little tricky to get them out one by one</li>
            <li> There are tons of little gems in each container.</li>
            <li> and i like how they are divided into each little square and have numbers on each lid(12 colors like picture)</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to break a nail opening the little compartments.  </li>
            <li> and I have yet to receive these little stones.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m heading out to get some nail glue &amp; tweezers to apply these little dots of sparkle.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my little sister who loves doing nails and she loves the gems.</li>
            <li> : they&#x27;re little</li>
            <li> I was expecting a little box of glitter.</li>
            <li> wanted around $10.00 for a little wheel with around 100 stones in it.</li>
            <li> Not very many, about five in each color.</li>
            <li> A little uneven, but can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t care about the specifics because they have never let me down!</li>
            <li> Every thing i expected!!!  </li>
            <li> Call me silly, and maybe the deminsions were posted but these were a lot smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these rhinestones for her nails and she uses them at her beauty school everyday.  </li>
            <li> I had to organize a few of the colors</li>
            <li> and I still have quite a few</li>
            <li> Green</li>
            <li> They come in lots of colors which I use all year round.</li>
            <li> Dont need to go waste my money on pedi.</li>
            <li> and it is not cheap at all for under 2$ incl shipping</li>
            <li> I dont worry if there are 50-100 missing.</li>
            <li> I did have a problem opening a few of the slots.</li>
            <li> Even though I had to wait a few weeks for these to arrive</li>
            <li> I feel that I wasted my money on them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> She watched a few videos online and wanted to try it herself.</li>
            <li> Not cheap ones</li>
            <li> Green</li>
            <li> Picked these up just to practice nail designs on myself and a few of my friends.</li>
            <li> These are all round gems.  </li>
            <li> Not a huge deal, but it wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> cases are sometimes very hard to open, usually breaking my nails or chipping them.</li>
            <li> they are a little to small, but will work for now.</li>
            <li> Showed up and was a mess none of the crappy looking gems are even in the container, they were all over inside the packaging!</li>
            <li> These were a mess!  </li>
            <li> Really small little gems</li>
            <li> It opens to each gem separately, so spillage of all contents is impossible, unless you open all the different lids.</li>
            <li> Very small gems that I plan to use for things other than nails.  </li>
            <li> But with that said they are very hard to work with, so patience is the key with these suckers.</li>
            <li> These are alright, plain and ordinary but alright.</li>
            <li> You get what they say you will get, my only complaint was that the container was broken and not of any use to me for storing.</li>
            <li> I received mine, at least half my gems were in the bottom of the bag.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re little gems that you can use to decorate anything!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alot for a little price!</li>
            <li> These will add a little bling to any nail design!</li>
            <li> just a little hard to handle trying to get them put</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super worried about it though because for less than $2.00, after shipping and tax, I still think it&#x27;s a steal!!!  </li>
            <li> They come in a small bubble wrapped envelope.</li>
            <li> The rhinestones come in a variety of colors in a small container like it&#x27;s shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> They were small</li>
            <li> small  </li>
            <li> I am also have trouble keeping them abhered to my nails waiting for some glue to arrive from another seller, will see how that works!</li>
            <li> They arrived in a small package from China about five weeks after I placed the order.</li>
            <li> Sadly they are all the same size.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect them to be that small</li>
            <li> I was a bit bummed at how small they were (didn&#x27;t realize how small 2mm were)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if theirs 3000 pieces</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if you get 3000 crystals because I am not going to count them</li>
            <li> Yeah they are small</li>
            <li> but no, they&#x27;re way too small.</li>
            <li> These are an unbelievable value for the money.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy the stones from another store.  </li>
            <li> there small so you can use them for nails .</li>
            <li> totally cheaper than buying them at the store, and there was nothing wrong with quality.</li>
            <li> I was just anxious to get.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the gems to be this small.</li>
            <li> I think they are a lil bit to small for 3D nail art.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> Came in a small, divided plastic container and there are a LOT of small gems.  </li>
            <li> I have small hands and fingers</li>
            <li> Not sure how well I will do</li>
            <li> Rhinestones aren&#x27;t that shiny and the container is small comparing too the picture</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to use than the wheel container rhinestones usually come in.</li>
            <li> As the title states, there are not nearly as many pieces in this container as there are in the circular ones, both of which I have bought on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> They are really small.</li>
            <li> They are soooo small.</li>
            <li> Some of the pockets on the case are difficult to open.</li>
            <li> So far....placed 3 on each big toe when giving myself a pedi, let my niece choose random colors to add to her mani...</li>
            <li> I recommend buying the tweezers as well because they are really small</li>
            <li> and I have fairly small hands...</li>
            <li> , they are quite small in size...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I received</li>
            <li> but too small for others</li>
            <li> &amp; the gems are really small.</li>
            <li> In the past, anything I ordered from China took 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> They are small (look up 2mm if you are not sure of the size)</li>
            <li> The case is small</li>
            <li> I am very impatient .</li>
            <li> Not sure on it being 3000 in the case, hard to say because they are so small.</li>
            <li> I have bought several different kinds of rhinestones and I hate the case the come in</li>
            <li> stuff.but so small they should be bigger.it hard to pick it up.since</li>
            <li> BUT this happened because the case itself is made weird &amp; since it&#x27;s a long shipping distance</li>
            <li> I find it hard to match them up well or make a design.</li>
            <li> And there not that hard to put on.</li>
            <li> then I thought and were hard for me to pick up</li>
            <li> Hard to keep this things on unless you use gel....</li>
            <li> They set well in the topcoat and did not smear, smudge, or become dull when covered with additional topcoats.</li>
            <li> The cost was too hard to pass up, had to get it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s so hard to find these items at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I can hardly see them on my nails.  </li>
            <li> A bit hard to grab them</li>
            <li> I used them for a phone case and OMG hard to work with</li>
            <li> I learned this the hard way.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that it says mixed shapes and none of the shapes were mixed they were all round.</li>
            <li> nothing was broken however, one of the cases gems were spilled all over the little bag it came in</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are thick and dull made of plastic or something.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> so I advise to purchase this item at least 3 weeks before you need it.</li>
            <li> For those who may not know, this is being shipped from China so if you need it to use for an event, order at least 4 weeks ahead of time.</li>
            <li> i could get my hands on and these suckers still fell off..</li>
            <li> but a few of the tabs were broken off when I receive it.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my daughter but shipping was SLOW SLOW SLOOOOW.</li>
            <li> slow shipping....</li>
            <li> Some of them I cannot open to this day, it&#x27;s tough!!</li>
            <li> not very happy.</li>
            <li> I guess ill just have to purchase other rhinestones</li>
            <li> Was a little disappointed that the sizes of the gems weren&#x27;t very different.</li>
            <li> The case is sturdy but very difficult to open...</li>
            <li> These are very small.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very difficult to open each section.</li>
            <li> This is very small and it is a lot in each square.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to find this item locally for the price.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing was, it was a lot out of its compartment.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed as I received less than half of the promised 3,000 pieces.</li>
            <li> Item is also VERY thick</li>
            <li> its the size of the palm of my hand almost like the size of an thin iPhone</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t tell her (this is my secret).</li>
            <li> ordered 3 but 1 box came broken with stones all over...</li>
            <li> One of the compartments was broken and all of that colors gems were lost in the package when they arrived.</li>
            <li> The case it came in was broken</li>
            <li> The package game taped in bubble wrap in a bubble wrap package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> those and one of the containers is broken with NO GEMS IN IT</li>
            <li> just when I got my package, the case had two broken storage squares, the silver n purple...</li>
            <li> However after some time the stone falls off and leaves behind the silver backing.</li>
            <li> I received this item broken and the gems spilled into the package.</li>
            <li> no great mystery or instructions.</li>
            <li> this is very very small!  </li>
            <li> , it is so hard!!</li>
            <li> things i was a little disappointed about was that there&#x27;s not 3000 gems like the description says.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do mean very difficult.  </li>
            <li> Nothing is really wrong with the product, it just isn&#x27;t as described.</li>
            <li> These gems give my toes a fancy look without the cost of an expensive pedicure.  </li>
            <li> But whoever is going to actually count all these gems just to say its not 3000 is just insane.</li>
            <li> Do not know why thay put a wrong picture.</li>
            <li> I counted them myself as I was bored one day.</li>
            <li> They are difficult to put on.</li>
            <li> None of the colors were in the wrong spot.</li>
            <li> but for $2 how can you go wrong?</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t expensive</li>
            <li> I DO like this product but find that they are difficult to adhere to the nails.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look like fake diamond gems.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li> Once I opened it, not even 3000 \\&quot;gems\\&quot; or \\&quot;rhinestones\\&quot; not buying from here again!!&lt;br /&gt;- angry customer</li>
            <li> I think $1.00 u can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> , now I sorry because I can&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> so I may be wrong.</li>
            <li> so I cannot even open those compartments to use those gems :&#x27;(</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical that it would show up at my house for that price.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s wrong.</li>
            <li> For the price, you seriously can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> now that mine has arrived ill</li>
            <li> There was a random gem that didn&#x27;t have a colored backing to it</li>
            <li> they are difficult to put on by yourself</li>
            <li> but they almost look like fake gold on kids clothes or toys</li>
            <li> So thankful I had ordered very thin tweezers in order to pick these up though.  </li>
            <li> They are very frustrating to use, even with slanted tweezers.</li>
            <li> One section on each container was broken :(  </li>
            <li> The product disappointed me, the box came broken and some rhinestones has fallen out.</li>
            <li> She has now gone crazy with decorating her nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid of everything falling out.</li>
            <li> You honestly can&#x27;t go wrong here for the price!</li>
            <li> go wrong at this price!</li>
            <li> very difficult to use it.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to find this size flatback crystal in a variety of colors.</li>
            <li> The stones themselves aren&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> So frustrated with this item.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who is thinking about buying you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> delivery did seem like it took forever :(</li>
            <li> Anyways, I am disappointed that it cheated me with the amount of promised nail pieces.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;not disappointed one bit&lt;</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> there is not 3000 gems:-(</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I hate that i cant store them because the case they come in does not keep them in it.</li>
            <li> but its kinda annoying trying to get the rhinestones out.</li>
            <li> Crap crap crap!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I felt very stupid when I saw them in person.</li>
            <li> it looks horrible</li>
            <li> looks like something you get get your child to decorate a paper or a drawing horrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These were good but hard to get out of the package and the little pieces always came out and would be everywhere.</li>
            <li> love it! exactly what i expected and more</li>
            <li> Love the range of colors and the fact that it comes in a case that fit nicely in my nail tool bag. Such a great deal!!!</li>
            <li> These little jewels are fun to use, and they look great!  These are great for the price.  Try them yourself.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old loves this.  I gave it to her as a birthday gift.  She love to add a little sparkle to wet painted nails.</li>
            <li> Deceitful advertising.  There are 12 different colors and only 59 pieces in each section.  Also, the container is a 2 inch circular container, and not this rectangle container as showed in the photo.  I will upload photos when I can.</li>
            <li> The price was great but the stone r so chip u get want u pay for sorowkis r way better</li>
            <li> Very Nice colors and a nice box, a very good buy for my craft work. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a quick and easy process. Love love these to decorate my nails and toe nails and so many colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> that there were a little bit more stones in the case. There were a lot, but the case was pretty big so it looked lost!</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about this product is that the little compartments in the case the rhinestones come in do not click shut and before I figured that out I lost a bunch. That was pretty disappointing. Hopefully this helps someone, the rhinestones themselves were fine. The case is sealed when it is shipped so none were lost in shipping.</li>
            <li> I love them!!!  There are so many possibilities of designs!!!!  I finally recieved these gems!!  I ordered a number of item being sent from China and this is the first one to get to the US.  They shipped it right away!!!  I will definately order from them again!!!</li>
            <li> the colors are so dull and perhaps the gems are too tiny.. some of the colors were mixed with others.</li>
            <li> this product is so pretty!!.... the colors are amazing and I love the compartments they are in its so easy to use!!!</li>
            <li> the rhinestones are nice, but the hard plastic case came shattered and i had to sort through all the tiny rhinestones.</li>
            <li> An amazing deal for 3000 rhinestone. My customers love bling bling on their nails so I needed a lot, the shipping was fast! Love it, thank you</li>
            <li> I priced a set very similar to this at a local store and they were WAY, WAY more expensive and contained a very small amount of gems. This is an excellent deal. It takes about two weeks for shipping. They come in a small bubble wrapped envelope.</li>
            <li> I thought they would have a cheep appearance because of the price but they are awesome. Beautiful colors and good bottoms surfaces that stick nicely to my nails. This was my first time buying gems online. I do recommend that if you want a certain color for any reason to either buy multiple sets of this or look for that color in bulk. It looks like there is a lot but in reality you get not so much. Compared to my own shopping around this is the best buy for making some cute nail art.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. much!! I love these!!!!! They are really great!!! I would recommend these to anyone!! Thanks for everything!! Great customer service.</li>
            <li> I DID NOT GET 3000 gems OR NO WHERE NEAR, IM MADDDDDD ! I WAITED ALL THEM WEEKS FOR [THIS] ?????</li>
            <li> Great value and easy to use on nails. Comes in a great case that can be used for other things when gems are used.</li>
            <li> they were just what i was looking for</li>
            <li> I bought these to help my daughter &amp;#34;bedazzle&amp;#34; her nails.  The product arrived much sooner than promised, and at a price that was WAY below other competitors I feel this is a great deal. A word of caution: I find that when affixing the gems, it is best to apply a bond coat first, then lay them onto the nail with tweezers while it is still tacky.  Seal it with a good fixative (I like some of the quicker topcoats, like Seneche), and you&#x27;re done.  PS, Amazon has some great how-to nail books to get you started, or look through the millions of Youtube tutorials.  This makes for a fun bonding experience with your child.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves them they were the second of three items I ordered to show it shipped the same day I ordered as well :). I was excited to them show before the actual projected date to and she loved the little case</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this earlier than it stated but was disappointed when i opened it and one of the compartments had a crack underneath and jewels where spilling out, i had to tape the bottom to keep them in... other wise it was a great purchase</li>
            <li> I have used these for my nail designs and so far I am a big fan of them and would recommend them to others. I will buy them again when I need more.</li>
            <li> this is so cute! its so adorable, i absolutely love it. its totally worth it if you love doing nails!</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money! There is a nice amount of gems and PRETTY colors! : ) Not only use them on your natural nails you can put em&#x27; on acrylic and make cute designs because there is that many!</li>
            <li> I just received my order. It came very quickly. The gems look great. I bought them to use in craft projects- my first will be small glass Christmas ornaments. My husband took one set to possible use in some of his model kits.</li>
            <li> This product definitely didn&#x27;t have 3000 pieces. I understand it is pretty reasonable, but at least update the information about the product and send what you promise. Besides that, the gems are nice.</li>
            <li> Love them. They ship out as they stated and the gems are more bling in person than on amazon showed.  I will purchase more in the future. Very happy with the gems I bought.</li>
            <li> This item arrived much sooner than expected! My three year old cannot wait until mommy can jazz up her toes. Now I just have to wait for the tweezers to get here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item packaging is much smaller than I expected, but perfect for this item. Great color range and stones have a nice shine to them.</li>
            <li> I got this particular mix because it seemed to have a good variety of colors, and I&#x27;m not disappointed.  There have only been a couple of times that I&#x27;ve thought &amp;#34;Oh, I wish it had this color too&amp;#34;, but for the price this really is a great deal.  Much less expensive than paying $5-10 to have it added onto your pedicure at a salon, and all you need to do to prep is lay down a top coat and add the stones before it dries!</li>
            <li> The colors are nice. Good size for nails or any other decoration. The container keeps gems in place. 12 different colors.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I love doing my nails constantly and I love the color options available in this product. I have changed my nails so much this week; just so I can try every color. I should have ordered more. :-)</li>
            <li> i thought they would be a little bigger but they are still fine. Theres so much i can do with these!</li>
            <li> this is very very small!  Good assortment for the price but the entire container is much smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Works as described.  Good quality small gems.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid, these rhinestones are definitely worth the wait. I actually received them fairly quickly after placing my order. The case they come in is pretty sturdy and there are a lot of different color varieties.</li>
            <li> The whole box is 5 in x 2 in. The covers close securely. Just use long nose pliers if you can&#x27;t open the compartments. I got 3 different blues and one purple instead of 2 different blues and 2 different purples, but that&#x27;s ok. I checked all the colors against the picture. They are small, but larger ones would have trouble matching the curve of your nail and would probably not stay on very well. I have had mine stuck on for a few days, and I am happy with them. I got a compliment from a lady at a store today. She was surprised when I told her I did it myself. It was my first try. I also got a tube of nail glue. I counted 275 for one of the colors. That would make about 3300 total. Well worth the $1.48. They are nice and shiny. They took about 10 days to get. My daughter is enjoying them too.</li>
            <li> The item was exactly as described! They looked fabulous and none of the sections were opened or spilled once received. The item also came WAAAAAAY before expected! I would HIGHLY recommend this seller and item. I love the gems and am super excited to use them. I think they&#x27;ll suit my needs perfectly and draw a lot of attention! Buy this item.... And from this seller!</li>
            <li> My ten year old grand daughter absolutely loves this set, and as inexpensive as it is, it really is a steal</li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected, but these jewels are great for shining up your manicure, and are easy to apply with some top coat.</li>
            <li> Came in quicker than expected but there&#x27;s not 3000 gems in here! But for the price it was so worth it ! Id buy again(:</li>
            <li> I love these little gems.  I look forward to using a lot of them. They will look beautiful on everyone&#x27;s nails and just the perfect size. I will be getting many more of these.</li>
            <li> Its not the amount the say is is , but they are gorgeous .! The color are cute and in style</li>
            <li> Lots of neat designs can be made with these gemstones...if you have the time, patience and a steady hand...which I have none of. But, that&#x27;s not the fault of the product.</li>
            <li> Fun colors to decorate with.</li>
            <li> I order 2 of these because they were cheap &amp; I plan to use them a lot. I had this idea to always have coordinating nails with my outfits.  I want the same for my 6 year old. Turns out I&#x27;ve got way to much of everything else to do to that prohibits me from gluing tiny diamonds on my nails. My kid actually likes to have her nails painted but just one hand and it lasts for one day only. I just coordinate her clothes to.the shade of dirt under her nails. Works wonders! Seriously having this in my nail collection makes me feel cool &amp; I&#x27;d definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> They are what they say they are</li>
            <li> I like this product. It looks exactly as pictured. The price is awesome. Many little glitter for nails and whatever. You should try it.</li>
            <li> Thanks! I purchased these mainly for the granddaughter who&#x27;s studying cosmetology and loves keeping our toes looking lovely. A few extra for each of us and her to use. Arrived in a short time!</li>
            <li> This product arrived way before the expected delivery date and well lived up to my expectations. As noted by other buyers there aren&#x27;t 3000 gems but there is still enough to make it a great deal for the price!</li>
            <li> i have used mine many times now i love all the colors thought they fall off easily if not put on right</li>
            <li> my grandchildren loved the nail gems and I&#x27;m giving some to my sister who loves&lt;br /&gt;to have her nails polished and decorated.</li>
            <li> I bought these gems because they were so much cheaper than at the store.  You get way more bang for your buck.  I like the container it comes it, just wish it had different sized gems.  Other than that, there isn&#x27;t much to complain about!</li>
            <li> Great colors, all very organized. Perfect for my needs. Makes all my nail art extra fun to do by adding extra sparkle.</li>
            <li> I ordered these expecting a variety of shapes, but it is only 2mm circles. Not a huge deal, but it wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. The gems are fine, and I appreciate this case over the wheels. Nothing is really wrong with the product, it just isn&#x27;t as described. I contacted the seller to ask for clarification, but the seller didn&#x27;t understand what I was asking.</li>
            <li> Very cute. tried it with just polish but didn&#x27;t stick for long but did very well with nail glue. Good.</li>
            <li> these were much smaller than i expecdpted</li>
            <li> Love the round gems and colors are nice and vibrant.  Comes in an awesome case that can be reused again and again.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> this was really great the value was amazing and the quality was amazing as well. I love how sturdy the case is</li>
            <li> I&#x27;s so happy I bought these rhinestones! I am always doing my nails along with family and friends and everyone asks for gems on their nails. These are perfect and at a great price!</li>
            <li> Worth the price, vibrant colors and good size gems. Box is not to big or to small for easy storage.</li>
            <li> I thought it was qonna take forever to qet them , but I qot them a couple days before they said it was qonna arrive. They&#x27;re soo small &amp;&amp;&#x27; I certainly didn&#x27;t qet 2000 , but ohh well they were cheap soo lets see  how my nails turn out (:</li>
            <li> I love these crystals and the container they came in is wonderful. I will be able to use it again after the crystals are gone. Great price as well.</li>
            <li> i have short nails and these fit perfectly on them. very easy to apply. I really like this I love all that colors</li>
            <li> So awesome. So many colors in perfectly organized containers, and so cheap</li>
            <li> Great gems for nail art. Pretty vibrant colors. Only downside is that it took four weeks to be delivered. Goodness.  The case is sturdy but very difficult to open...I do mean very difficult.  To the point that when I finally get the little flaps open the gems spill out all over the place.  I had to use scissors or a knife to pop the flaps open. Oh and there definitely aren&#x27;t 3,000 gems.  I counted one section that appeared to have the most and that count was 205.  What appeared to be the smallest section had 107 so in total it wasn&#x27;t 3,000 but for just over $1, you can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> These are very pretty gems. I love the colors, but there are fewer gems than pictured. If there were more gems, this would have gotten 5 stars.</li>
            <li> These gems give my toes a fancy look without the cost of an expensive pedicure.  I have trouble getting them on just where I want them, but I&#x27;m sure once I learn the trick, I&#x27;ll be even more hooked!</li>
            <li> Received the product within a couple weeks and it looks exactly as stated. Haven&#x27;t used the product yet but will be soon.</li>
            <li> These are so great for when I&#x27;m doing my nails. They add just a little sparkle and make them so unique. They are very sturdy too, they don&#x27;t fall off easily, you really have to pull.</li>
            <li> The rhinestones come in a variety of colors in a small container like it&#x27;s shown in the picture. However it&#x27;s not filled up very much, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me ): Another complaint is the fact that each slot is very hard to open, so I had to use my teeth to pry it open. But for what it&#x27;s worth, I really like it (:</li>
            <li> It does not come with the amount says it dose (less)  its the size of the palm of my hand almost like the size of an thin iPhone it mostly bring the color black . You will need design tweezer to use this product to attach to your nail but happy with them they are a great size for special detail in nail</li>
            <li> Shipping took a long time but I think it was shipped from China. Lot&#x27;s of pretty gems for nails. I have not counted but I don&#x27;t see how there could be 3,000 inside. I am still happy though because there are a lot of them, they are separated by color, and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I see people complaining up here and it blows my mind! I receives this 3 weeks prior to the estimated delivery date for one. Two. It came in a cute case packaged nice. Yes out f the many many gems maybe 5 were loose in the baggy outside of the case. But whoever is going to actually count all these gems just to say its not 3000 is just insane. For the price it is. The case is worth more. So atop complaining!</li>
            <li> LOVE These....use them all the time. Got extra to go with the dotters and will add nail polish and remover for Christmas gifs!</li>
            <li> The gems are pretty, but .... the quantity is too little. I think I paid for the container rather than the gems themselves. They do not even fill it halfway.</li>
            <li> The rhinestones don&#x27;t flake off easily and their colors are vibrant! The box is also pretty spiffy and easy to use. :)</li>
            <li> I thought they will come in different sizes from the picture but when I got they all are same size? Do not know why thay put a wrong picture.</li>
            <li> Great selection and has a lot of diamonds I love these.</li>
            <li> Fun, Fun, Fun and so easy to apply. Brings life to my nails and so many colors to choose from</li>
            <li> bought these for a crafting project and they was cheap, and worked perfectly for what I needed them for. :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  see why I got write a bunch of words for something I like, now if I didn&#x27;t like I have a whole lot more to say. But I don&#x27;t cause I like it, it&#x27;s pretty cool!!! I love that it comes with glue too.</li>
            <li> I purchased these nail art gems expecting them at this size but when i received it the gems were not in the case they were all mixed and there is like 3,000 of them so it took me quite a while to separate all of them. Overall great product for the price you can&#x27;t find these for that price at a store. I contacted the seller and they fully refunded me my money and i get to keep the gems.</li>
            <li> These worked just as we&#x27;ll as others I have paid more for.  The case is great too as it keeps all the colors separated!</li>
            <li> I give this a low rating simply because of the case;sometimes it is hard to open one and then some case lids open up(doesn&#x27;t seem to close right) all my stones ended up mixing up or spilling out. It is a shame because the stones are so pretty.</li>
            <li> I knew when I ordered this item that I probably wouldn&#x27;t get 3000 pieces. When I got them (I ordered 3 for that reason) I wasn&#x27;t surprised to find a lot less product than described. Either way, it&#x27;s  pretty cheap and that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t bother me. Other than that I think there is a good variety of colors and it&#x27;s perfect for nails and make up. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love these.. they came super fast in the mail and my little ones of course had to try them right out. Be careful not to spill :)  Lots of fun using them on our nails! thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this item....I purchased this along with Nail tape stripe and marbleizing dotting pen set. I am getting great use out of all of the items.  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> These are so worth the price. I can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive they are. The case is very nice, snaps securely shut and can be easily used for other purposes once the gems are used up. In fact, the case alone is worth the price for any craft enthusiasts. The gems are small enough that when placed on the nail, the edges don&#x27;t stick out and won&#x27;t catch on anything. They are obviously not stickers, but individual gems, so unlike the gems you get on sheets, you will definitely need an undercoat and top coat to adhere these to the nail. I have found that the gems you buy on sheets stay longer on the nail and are less prone to come off, but the solution for that is simply a stronger top coat or additional top coat. These gems come in beautiful colors, even the black ones are shiny and pretty. For the price, you cannot pass these up. These will last me forever and really add subtle, not tacky, beauty to my nails.</li>
            <li> These rhinestone gems come in a variety of colors and are so beautiful and sparkly.  I am really impressed with the compartment they are shown in.  Each compartment opens individually.  For the price I paid I thought I would have had to find storage for the gems.  I really like this product and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I totally love these rhinestones. There are several colors to choose from. There are also shaped. So the next time I get my nails done, or I do them myself, if I happen to lose a rhinestones I can now replace it. Loved that it came with glue too. This is the only set I have gotten that came with its own glue. The price was great. Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> These where a great price and I love adding them to my nails or just having them on hand for girls night! I have even found myself gluing them on to cards and other projects for a little extra bling.</li>
            <li> perfect amount, array of colors, these are a good price point and a great add to a nail art collection.</li>
            <li> i loved these stones i gonna have to order more soon i use them so often and not just on my nails on other projects too</li>
            <li> still havent used mine yet but plan on using it soon. my clients are more into the bows and rihnestone as of now.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and value for the price. The quality is unbelievable for such a low cost.  I have shared this along with other products to my local nail salon to save them a lot of money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will save me money by allowing me to do my nails at home.</li>
            <li> watch videos on youtube on how to use them. they are fun to use! I just wanted other shapes....I guess ill just have to purchase other rhinestones</li>
            <li> This item was worth the money. It is a great buy at a great price. It has several different colored stones in it and it&#x27;s plenty of each color except for black.</li>
            <li> So many color varieties, and they are good priced,  i love them and the variety of colors that come with it!</li>
            <li> i b ought this for my sister and she loved it. it cane whith the amiunt it said(atkeast i thinkso) . there are mang gems and iv used some already and got many complements.</li>
            <li> They are the right size for nails. They work great on both lengths, because they are quite small. I ordered these for my fianc&amp;eacute;. I did realize that they were coming from China, but delivery time was fast. All in all, she is very happy.</li>
            <li> This was exactly as described, the gems are tiny, but again I knew they would be. Perfect for doing nails.</li>
            <li> I loved the rhinestones they are the perfect size for nails or Art Deco!!! Shipped quickly and even greater price!!!</li>
            <li> Great way to make your feet look good</li>
            <li> I am tryng my hand at nail art and this is a needed essential for the art. The product came early by international shipping and it is serving its purpose!</li>
            <li> Overall these nail art gems order was alright. To start off what I order and received did not look anything like the pictures advertised for this item. The box of gems was as big as my hand when in the picture it looks 3 times bigger. These are not 3000 gems, and they were scattered all over the place, there was no organization what so ever. Shipping was sooner than expected but I thought I was going to receive what I seen over when I purchased the item. The gems size is cool, and can make good nail art. Overall this is an alright item.</li>
            <li> Liked the colors but they are too big to put many on a nail. Smaller sized rhinestones would&#x27;ve been better.</li>
            <li> nice colors and the case is wonderful</li>
            <li> My two teenagers and niece use them to make their designs on hands and toes, my daughter just used them for fourth july design on hands to make her stars for her flag theme.</li>
            <li> So i ordered these gems because they had a variety of colors and were just the size i needed. I open the package and there they are! These cute gems are perfect but i have this 4 stars because there is not 3000 gems. More like 200. But hey i still recommend these!</li>
            <li> very nice assortment of colors , very nice investment for the money spent, wish it did not take so long to arrive</li>
            <li> I did design different w any nail with diamond. Someday i will get order more different gems mixed later smile</li>
            <li> I just love rhinestones. They came in diff colors in a nice case. I use them for my nail work. I definitely recommend to all who loves rhinestones on nails, or other arts and crafts. :-)</li>
            <li> SODIAL(TM) 3000 Nail Art Gems Mixed Colours Shapes in Case (Size 2mm)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the price is ok for this type of plastic stone, it is neither shiny gems nor stones. bought from</li>
            <li> I didnt receive the correct amount of gems but the seller sent me the correct amount X 2. Now i have plenty of them and they are cute and tiny, perfect for my budding nail designer (9 year old daughter)</li>
            <li> the glue, superglue that comes with it is a crapp bottle, go down to a hobby store and get a real bottle and get a fine tip extender and u will be able to do this right, my fingers are a bit big to grasp the small jewls, my 6 year old can get them fine, she loves them, i didnt count hw many, its enuff for her to be happy.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing super different or special about the rhinestones, they&#x27;re just rhinestones, but  what I really like is the fact that they come in a case. It is very easy to keep them organized like this and if I ever need to buy more, I can simply put them in here. Great buy for the price :)</li>
            <li> No trouble with anything. lots of color choices. wish it had some black in it. will be back for more.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with other customers about the number of gems you actually get, its not 3000. BUT for the price and quality of the product the price is amazing and worth it!! I&#x27;m fairly new at the whole nail art thing so I don&#x27;t want to pay a ton of money for something I&#x27;m going to use rather quickly. There are tons of gems in a variety of colors so you can play around as much as you want and not worry about wasting money. I recommend this product to anyone who is thinking about buying you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I got the product almost 2 weeks earlier than the estimated arrival date.</li>
            <li> However, I love them. The case, colors, everything were good,except if there are more size would be much better to use.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and looks good.  My daughter loves these rhinestones for her nails and she uses them at her beauty school everyday.  Great Deal !!!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product, I have 5 grown daughters and they use the kit more than I do!  Gems look great!</li>
            <li> I really like the product, but the container the gems came in did not contain the gems and about 1/3 of the gems were in the plastic packaging bag that was around the container...</li>
            <li> I doubt there are actually 3000 little gems but there&#x27;s still a lot, definitely more than you would get with a wheel. I also find that this package keeps the colors more separate than the wheels.</li>
            <li> First, there aren&#x27;t 3000 gems.  That&#x27;s the name, I guess.  The package is smaller than I imagined as well.  But the price was great.  The gems are sorted by color.  The box is nice because each color has a separate lid.</li>
            <li> The gems are cute but i have to say there is NOT 3000 gems and all of them are the same shape which works for me. But you still get a good bit. They are a nice size specially for my nails. I would recommend the product just dont expect 3000 gems! Shipping took about 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I like them. Since I had already read several posts previously, I realized they are on the tinier side. The container keeps everything organized but you have to pry them open a bit for a few. What I used was the flat end of my tweezers that I had ordered through here to open the lids besides using them for picking up the nail art gems. The rest of them opened. I ordered 2 because I had read prior reviews that stated that there may not be enough? (I would&#x27;ve counted them but because they remind me of a bigger version of glitter, and I do not want to see them on the floor.</li>
            <li> I really think this is a quality product and I would buy it again. Really good!! Loved IT! So happy I got this!</li>
            <li> I like it so much and reorder 3 boxes again but they take a long period to arrive.  I am still waiting for them.</li>
            <li> Love these!! Arrived when expected in good condition. Pretty good packaging too. Wish there was black gems as well. But for the price I don&#x27;t mind picking them up separate.</li>
            <li> The amount you get for the price is EXTREMELY reasonable. However, it took over a month for me to get it. I supposed that is what you get in exchange for the deal.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item and it arrived earlier than estimated. Variety and amount is exceptional. I haven&#x27;t used as often as expected but I love that I can do my nails at home with the options of colors given. I would definately purchase again when needed.</li>
            <li> What can I say? This is a very nice product. It was extremely cheap and came 2 weeks earlier than the earliest expected delivery date. The gems are nice and come in a very nice plastic container: much better than the wheels that gems are usually sold in. A few of the gems fell out during shipment and got mixed up, but not very many so I was not bothered by this. I would pay $10 for this product if it wasn&#x27;t so cheap already. Just goes to show the great value of these gems! Love the colors, too.</li>
            <li> I really love this set. I like how each color is in it&#x27;s own section. This is easy to store and easy to use. I cant wait to use them. I would order them again. I only wish tracking information would have been provided. However still a great buy! This same pack is 10.00+ at my local beauty supply store. Great price!</li>
            <li> This again I got for my great niece. I chose this rating because I&#x27;m sure she will love them but until she uses them I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars. Thx again</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  Had all my nail supplies about 3 or 4 days after I placed my order and on came from Germany.  I have many more colors and patterns to chose from.  The stores only have a few choices and the nail salon prices are to high.  Quality is great and I couldn&#x27;t  have gotten better service in a store</li>
            <li> kids enjoy the sparkels, bought for their fun times doing nails, they have fun witht he gems one time purchase enough for me</li>
            <li> It was replaced with a $.10 item.  I will no longer purchcase anything from China because this is the third time I&#x27;ve been ripped off.</li>
            <li> I was buying this for my two young daughters who love to paint their nails.  Now we have used the gems every time they do their nails. The price was amazing and the gems are perfect!</li>
            <li> SODIAL(R) 3000 Nail Art Gems Mixed Colours Shapes in Case size 2 mm love it so much this product for my nails or bows , the sellers are suitable and attencion very fast to resolve situations in the transaccion. Very recommended because arecomfort and fill my spectations.</li>
            <li> Good product.  The container is great.  It keeps everything in place and I love all of the various colors.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter will absolutely love these pretties to put on her nails.  Can&#x27;t wait to share them with her.  Neat stuff...</li>
            <li> I gave this a five star rating because of all of the different choices in the colors and all the shapes that they are.</li>
            <li> What can you say about sparkles? They&#x27;re FUN!!  Gems come in a decent quality case separating each color.  Probably best to glue them on and cover with a couple coats of clear to hold them... fun idea!</li>
            <li> These gems are great except for the fact that the gems fall off your nails really easily. They did arrive early though.</li>
            <li> I loved these!! The color doesnt smudge like some, and also they stay on forever even with just a clear top coat:)</li>
            <li> If your kids love nail art as much as mine this is a great buy because the selection is great and the sizes are too but for an adult it&#x27;s not very professional looking.</li>
            <li> there are alot of them...super small! they are fun to use with my family for nails or even other art projects</li>
            <li> I love these gems.  I just started decorating my own toes, and these are perfect.  The options of colors are great, too; lots to choose from.  They are flat-backed and stay on my toes even without glue.</li>
            <li> Were delivered in a good amount of time.  The lid is kind of a pain to deal with but other than that they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> I was really happy with this product! It is not exactly 3000 peices but i think it was still a great product... It comes with alot of colors and it was shipped to my house very quickly! Love this product definetly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Theses gems are amazing I uses them a lot. So many colors. Definitely worth the price. Plus it came earlier then I expected it to!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> I love these cute gems. Makes for a colorful and different design styles. Cant wait to use them again. Thanks</li>
            <li> Tho it might not have all 3000 pieces, cant beat the price $1.85 including shipping. My kids love them on their nails. My kids are rough on their nails so i had to use nail glue.. I will never have to buy any more gems cause there is so many gems. Totally worth the $1.85!!!!!! Buy it!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what it says. The rhinestones are great quality and fun to make designs! It doesn&#x27;t take about 3 weeks to receive being they ship from hong kong but their cheap and great quality. I am satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> These gems are great! The package is perfect because it separates the colors, you don&#x27;t need to worry about getting them mixed up and digging to find what you want. The case closes tightly, which is great, but you have to make sure to take the gems you want to use before you start, just so you won&#x27;t damage your nails. A dab of top/base coat keeps them in place. I haven&#x27;t lost any. Will be buying some more!</li>
            <li> They were small but i can fit at least 4 on a nail in a line so there not to the point you can barely see them. I liked them.</li>
            <li> I got the gems within a week of ordering, they&#x27;re not best of quality but still really good for the price!</li>
            <li> Great my wife loves it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally inexpensive for the value you obtain for it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a very smart purchase, I hope we can do business in future</li>
            <li> I love the selection of different colors you get. The only bad thing was, it was a lot out of its compartment. I had to organize a few of the colors but I&#x27;m sure that was from the shipping process.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with this inexpensive purchase! It took some time to get here so I advise to purchase this item at least 3 weeks before you need it. For $1.38 this is quite a steal.... I went to the nail salon and got a crystal set and they deigned one nail on each hand for me and I&#x27;ve gotten sooo many compliments thus far! The nail artist even asked me how much did I pay for this and I didn&#x27;t tell her (this is my secret). I highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> only recieved half of the product. not very happy. i would like more or a refund okay. thanks. wouldnt Buy again.</li>
            <li> In the picture you only see I  one container, but when you receive it it&#x27;s two. This is awesome. The rhinestones come very organized.</li>
            <li> Looooveeee these!!! They were exactly what i was looking for!! They come in 12 different colors and just what the picture shows: a very small divided container with tiny gems. The container is so cute and nice! It opens each color individually so they dont miss. BUT the container is so hard to open :/</li>
            <li> Yay! All different colors and sizes and a great quantity. love them delivery did seem like it took forever :( but overall love love love them!</li>
            <li> I felt very stupid when I saw them in person. I got a bit upset because they were a &amp;#34;tad&amp;#34; small  but then I re-read the description &amp; saw that it said &amp;#34;2mm&amp;#34; so I got over it. But with that said they are very hard to work with, so patience is the key with these suckers. A tool is needed if you want them to go on right &amp; look pretty &amp; not messy. Look very cute &amp; sparkly in the sun &amp; the colors were pretty good, meaning I was able to use every color.</li>
            <li> received product as described. Love it! No regrets what so ever. Will buy again in due time. Thank you for a great deal</li>
            <li> Got these the other day and like wow now that&#x27;s 3000&#x27;s the othe rhinestones I got says 2400 but I know it was more like 500 the stones r beautiful ans sparkly I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need more for awhile but when I do I will buy from this seller if the price is right</li>
            <li> Color selection is very very nice - did not buy it to use as nail art - bought it for my niece who will use it for cricket and crafting projects</li>
            <li> the gems aren&#x27;t as dazzling as I thought they would be. They look nice on the site, but I was not impressed when I opened the package. They have the tendency to look cheap.</li>
            <li> I like them a lot. There are a ton of them in the package.  They are the right size for nails. I ordered these for my daughter for her birthday. I did not realize that, they were coming from China.  So delivery time was almost a month.  All in all, I am very happy. I will just make sure in the future to order far in advance!!!</li>
            <li> I got this wonderful package in the mail yes they are tiny but the way they are individually in the box and cap locked I love it not too hard to handle if you are looking for alot of bling don&#x27;t buy these but if you want tiny gems that shine then get them</li>
            <li> I do my own nails and this is great when you want to &amp;#34;BLING&amp;#34;. Great colors and a large amount of stones.</li>
            <li> it give me more rhinestone to put on my nails to make more lines and different type of flower on my nails</li>
            <li> These were so much fun to use with the girls during their &amp;#34;make up&amp;#34; sleep over. Everyone was glitzed out from fingers to toes.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommend them!!</li>
            <li> Really like these. They do not melt when the top coat is applied like some I&#x27;ve had. Do not catch on things, like some others weather on fingers or toes.</li>
            <li> Stones arrived in their own compartment and are a good size which makes using it for nail art easy and simple.</li>
            <li> they are a little to small, but will work for now. I am satisfied.  There is a great amount of diamonds in each slot.</li>
            <li> These are salon quality and color and a great price! I should have bought more!! Hope to see them again!</li>
            <li> ALL I have too say is I will return :-) A SUPER THANK YOU~!! :-)  LOVE YOUR SUPER LOW PRICES !!</li>
            <li> exactly what i was looking for...... next time i will order bigger sizes. will shop again. thank you thank you</li>
            <li> Great for the price, very small! Just for fun little gems for the nails. They r for my 13 year old niece.</li>
            <li> There probably aren&#x27;t quite as many gems as they say there are, but there are a variety of colors and a good amount of each color</li>
            <li> These are perfect I did think the box was going to be bigger but it&#x27;s ok. The gems are wonderful they are easy to pick up and place on the nail and you don&#x27;t need any glue just place them on your nail and paint over them with clear polish and they will stay on until you remove them with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed as I received less than half of the promised 3,000 pieces. I counted them myself as I was bored one day. Anyways, I am disappointed that it cheated me with the amount of promised nail pieces. I do not know what else they would do to so I recommend being cautious - unless you don&#x27;t mind having a lesser amount of items.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my child. She loves it. She did say you should put 2 coats of top coat on to make sure to seal the decoration to the nail.</li>
            <li> These gems are very pretty. I find myself using them in every manicure I do. I very highly recomend them.</li>
            <li> Love this crystals so many for a great price</li>
            <li> It does not have 3000 rinestone in it. It probably has 150 or 200 maximun</li>
            <li> I purchased it b/c the price was reasonble, not a big gamble. I received it about 1 month after ordering, which I expected since it comes from Hong Kong. I wasn&#x27;t in a rush to receive it, so it didn&#x27;t matter. Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but to my surprise, it is actually a nice product. I really liked the box it came in. Just for that reason itself, the price was worth it. Strong and nice looking plastic container. The gems are what you see is what you get. And variety of colors. Each compartment has a different color. Very cool product! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> These are good but really small. It&#x27;s perfect for if you want to do mini designs with the gems on your nails. I love it though :)</li>
            <li> super cute and looks great on your nails</li>
            <li> I ordered these as a gift and I was quite happy with the amount of stones for the price and the great vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> Love the clarity of the stones</li>
            <li> I must of received a different product from everyone else because the stones I got are way smaller than what is listed/pictured, BUT I will say that they look adorable when used (I added them to my laptop decal to make it *pop*) It arrived in about a week and a half early, which I was very pleased about. I agree with everyone who said that there was nowhere near 3000 stones, but I didn&#x27;t take the time to count each and every stone, you can tell by just glancing at it. I didn&#x27;t receive any doubles of a color, so overall I&#x27;d say i&#x27;m very satisfied with this product and if they continue to hold as well as they do on my laptop, I&#x27;ll be ordering from this company again. :)</li>
            <li> Overall I like the product but I though the gems would be a little bigger. They are tiny. The colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li> I love the colors, but there isn&#x27;t 3000 pieces. Not even 200. Very disappointing. Wish there was way more and more colors. Definitely want a refund for sure. Not worth the money AT ALL</li>
            <li> The only thing with these gems are they are not as sparkly as you were probably counting on.  Otherwise great selection of colors.</li>
            <li> i purchased this item for a friend who does nails at a local nursing home with mixed elderly and younger clients.  she loved the product.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful. I never thought that I would ever see what 3000 nail gems looked like.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic container is great!</li>
            <li> In the picture look like it was full but is actually not it comes with all the colors there..I&#x27;m ok with this item I will buy it again in the future just for a pack of one color I paid like 9$ n for all this colors I paid like 2$</li>
            <li> Arrived within a month (free shipping) . I use these for makeup purposes so they work great for me. Happy with my purchase, they are the perfect size to glue along my lash line and inner eye</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these gems they are perfect size to decorate your nails they are small but great size to be able to put multiple per nail i can fit 9 on my thumb nail making a u shape on them bottom of nail very pretty and simple design. If you know how to put them on the size will not matter. Still sparkle after top coat :)</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for Christmas this year (20013), I think it is awesome and have no doubt that my niece will love it.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and on time and I really highly recommend this product, it works super well and I love it! Great if you wanna add some bling to your look!</li>
            <li> Nice deal quickly shipped. I think it&#x27;ll take awhile to empty the box. He e at deal to go with a friend and get some added sparkle to your pedicure.</li>
            <li> The art gems are extremely tiny.  How do you apply these gems?  The colors are pretty but no directions are suppied.</li>
            <li> this was the best $1.38 I&#x27;ve spent.  I&#x27;ve used the rhinestones on fingernails and in body art.  They work fabulous and I&#x27;m going to order more.  I won&#x27;t complain if they ship faster though.</li>
            <li> I am actually wearing these gems on an accent nail and it&#x27;s very pretty. The main reason I only gave this item 3 stars is bc I can&#x27;t stand lying. Why say there is 3,000 pieces when there isn&#x27;t even 300!!! Please give a more accurate description of this item, and I will come back and give more stars!</li>
            <li> These are very small. Just understand that what you are buying is very inexpensive so don&#x27;t expect to get a warehouse supply when you get this in the mail.</li>
            <li> A little uneven, but can&#x27;t beat it for the price. My five year old loves them! Very cute for summer!</li>
            <li> These little gems are easily applied when polish is damp, and stay on until taken off with nail polish remover. Great way to decorate the nails!</li>
            <li> there were colors that were repeated but was overall pleased with it...i should have looked around a little more could have found a better one but not too disapointed</li>
            <li> they are so cute, and the shipping was fast. they are all different colors, any color you need, they&#x27;re here. I love the case, it&#x27;s easy to separate them all and keep them. But I use silver more than other colors.</li>
            <li> Jewels of every color, fun for all ages, using our imagination to make beautiful designs on toes and fingers love it</li>
            <li> I got these for my daughter yes I was very happy  and looks forward to using amazon for many more items thank u very much</li>
            <li> This is a great buy! You can&#x27;t find this price in any store. I&#x27;m very happy with this. You can make beautiful nail art and save money at the same time. :)</li>
            <li> I love these gems. They are just so cute and the container is so small and adorable. There was a good variety of color! Good price if you are a &amp;#34;beginner&amp;#34; for nail designs. The price is very good for all the little gems you get!</li>
            <li> quick ship- cheap price- love the carrier case</li>
            <li> I like the stones just not as many of some! I am also have trouble keeping them abhered to my nails waiting for some glue to arrive from another seller, will see how that works!</li>
            <li> Very nice, it was exactly what I was looking for. I used it already come with glue but I just used clear nail polish to keep it on my nails. It has several colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> Lots of little gems just what I expected! It&#x27;s a stocking stuffer for my teenage daughter so I think she will enjoy! Great price and great product.</li>
            <li> perfect for young little ladies. My granddaughter loves these and for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it. Reasonable ship time.</li>
            <li> fast delivery very cute but note they are very small very good for crafts, good colors and good little case. I recommend</li>
            <li> Their SO ADORABLE! I have no complaints about the time and boxing. But there is no way this thing has 3000 gems, maybe 500 at most. What annoyed me the most is that they WOULDN&#x27;T STAY ON! I think I need to get glue or something, which I happily would have paid more for if it was included in the package, but they do not stick to the nail polish. Did my nails one night and put the gems on, went to be 4 hours later, woke up to find the paint messed up and the gems on my bed leaving polish stains.</li>
            <li> I love them. I used them for the first time today and so far they have stayed on. They took my manicure to the next level. I didn&#x27;t exactly count how many are in them, but I doubt there are 3000 of them. However I love them anyway and were a great price!</li>
            <li> I usually get the smaller cases. This was packed with little gems in beautiful colors. I am having so much fun with it!!! I would buy some more in the future. In very satisfied with the Cheeky store services. You guys are tops!!!!</li>
            <li> This comes in a little case and is just too cute. The rhinestones are tiny, so if that is what you are looking for than you are in luck. II love small ones so I was very happy. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> What fun!  Great colors and different sizes, nice addition to my DIY kit working on nail designs.  Love the container also, unlike some of the things that you get at stores that are in a bag, this container keeps everything neat without getting all over my nail box.  :)  And the price........great.  Quit ship as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service! Plus the gems look spectacular!!! Love the color selection. They&#x27;re small but not so small that they don&#x27;t make statement and not big to the point where they look tacky. Perfect sized gems!</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I expected. Tiny mirror back plastic gems. I ordered two of them. They arrived in a small package from China about five weeks after I placed the order. One section on each container was broken :(  The end section with the red gems had been crushed in transit.</li>
            <li> Nail Art Gems were just as described. The case holds colors separate as they should be. I Would order from again! Thanks!</li>
            <li> The shipping was very quick which I will purchase from company again b/c of that. Now the gems are very very tiny, but that&#x27;s ok with me. They are made of plastic with medal backs, and the only color that has bling or shine is black they look like black diamonds. Overall I&#x27;m happy. Love the packaging. 4 stars b/c of size of gems and not shiny.</li>
            <li> but i did not like it but i will never get this again and see where i get it and how long it will take.</li>
            <li> Its exactly what I wanted. I am very happy with it. You can&#x27;t beat the price of this adorable nail accesory</li>
            <li> glitter in a cheap box not as shown way to small to long to devlery not even 3000 gems maybe 1000</li>
            <li> Great jewels. Tiny. Good for nails. I hate that i cant store them because the case they come in does not keep them in it. So i have lost a good bit of my money off the poor organization it comes in.</li>
            <li> Alright for the money.. Do not stay shiny once you put top coat on. You would think you&#x27;d get 3000 since it says that but there were definitely not.</li>
            <li> This is really nice, I haven&#x27;t used it yet, I know it wasn&#x27;t going to be a full box, because of the reviews I have read about this. I am not going to use these on my nails, but  for  other art projects.</li>
            <li> these are pretty but way small very hard to use, not for younger kids glue runs over everything and dries before you can get it on stone then trying to put on your nail before it drys and rolls over on wrong side is way to much work.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on the good reviews and cheap price while honestly not expecting much. It came around 2-3 weeks later and I find this to be a great product. I don&#x27;t think there are 3,000 in this box but I would&#x27;ve still purchased this product. It came in a container that neatly separates the different colors. I like that better than the wheel cases since that tends to get messy for me.</li>
            <li> These are small and simple. Nice and sparkly. Many colors to choose from. I gave this product 5 of 5 stars because they work as promised. I would buy this product again. I would recommend this product to other. I payed $2.55 and free S&amp;H when I purchased this item.</li>
            <li> Took a while to get here but worth the wait. Really cute, great colors, large supply of all. The case is nice and secure, too -- I never worry I&#x27;m going to lose the ones I&#x27;m not using and I don&#x27;t have to tape it shut like I do the wheel dispensers.</li>
            <li> I got it in the mail today, 12 days early! I love the box it came in with individual compartments to open one at a time. And the size of the rhinestones are exactly what I wanted. For the price you get a great deal. Will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> I love the colors! They are the perfect size for nail art. I have bought several different kinds of rhinestones and I hate the case the come in but I love the case these come in! I will order again.</li>
            <li> These were good for the price. They are all separated by color. Sadly they are all the same size. I was searching for size variations. But still a good deal</li>
            <li> Love my little compact case with many different color jewels. They came to me perfectly packaged, all in their little spaces. I use Seche Vite top coat to keep them in place for 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> a creation  collection of several types of designs each nail can be different or do the same as all at the</li>
            <li> Love the colors of the rhinestones but it&#x27;s very difficult to open each section. I broke a nail trying to open one. I had to use a butter knife to open 3 of them.</li>
            <li> These jewels are cute, very shiny but they are so tiny!! I didn&#x27;t expect them to be that small but I love them.</li>
            <li> Again,  like 3 other gemstone purchases i made, it does not have add many add it advertises,  but there are plenty for the price.  They area great size, nice color variety and all were organized and contained.</li>
            <li> Call me silly, and maybe the deminsions were posted but these were a lot smaller than I expected. They are difficult to put on.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THEM AND YES I WOULD MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THEM - THE AMOUNT YOU I RECIEVED WAS AMAZING FOR THE MONEY</li>
            <li> There are 10 compartments of different colored gems. When I received it there were some that had come out of the container. Then I noticed that several of the lids would not close. That&#x27;s fine, just make sure you keep it upright and maybe put some tape on those that won&#x27;t close.</li>
            <li> It came in a timely manner and was good for the price. I am very happy with it. Stones may fade a bit when top coat is applied .</li>
            <li> Pretty colors. Nice assortment. The only thing is it&#x27;s a little hard to get them out of the case one at a time. Other than that, very nice.</li>
            <li> gems are a little low quality but can&#x27;t beat the price. i think i like the case better then the gems. very solid and will be useful long after the gems are used up</li>
            <li> These little gems got here reasonably fast but the little boxes were open and the tiny gems were all in a scramble in the bag.  I sat there with tweezers and spent hours separating the colors and getting them organized. But the product is fine and will work well for the craft project I planned to use them on.  The price was very low, so I can&#x27;t really complain too much.  It is a good thing I enjoy puzzles....lol.</li>
            <li> My gems have been on toes for 2 weeks now. Easy to apply and bold colors. Kids love it. Great buy</li>
            <li> None of the colors were in the wrong spot. The gems look and shine beautifully. The colors in the picture are how they look, and there are a good amount of each gem. I got them a lot faster than I was expecting. I love these and plan on getting more, can&#x27;t believe how good the price is.</li>
            <li> This was definitely a little package but worth its price.  I don&#x27;t really think it has 3000 gems but its nothing to complain taking the price I paid&lt;br /&gt;Overall, its a good product.</li>
            <li> No where near 3000, no where near 1/2 of that! Left claim with seller, will see what happens. Very disappointed. WHY would they not put the correct number in the listing or at the least a number in the area of what you actually get? The picture in the description has to be several containers added into one in order to get the look of so many. Item is also VERY thick but i&#x27;m not even worried about that. Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> I just ordered this item! I will do a review on my blog when it arrives so suscribe to me! @ killertalk411.blog.com</li>
            <li> They where cute and the container came in a little&lt;br /&gt;Baggie but then I noticed that there was a lot of the gems&lt;br /&gt;All over the inside of them bag. So the container has some&lt;br /&gt;Gaps even after the lids are closed so the gems tend to&lt;br /&gt;Spill out if you take them anywhere. Other than that they&lt;br /&gt;Are great and a great price. Shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li> Best product OUT there and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it,, great quality perfectly made no imperfections on the stones last long purchased two about three months ago and still have plenty to last awhile I strongly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Liked the way the gems were packaged.  Very easy to retrieve from the container.  Colors are bright and fairly easy to apply to nails.  Will order from this supplier again.  Arrived as scheduled and in very good condition.</li>
            <li> Great deal these can be sued for nails or scrapbooking embellishments.  I am using this for a stocking stuffer for an avid scrapbooker.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because it says 3000 nail art gems and there is not that many... Maybe 1500. but for $2 how can you go wrong? I would have gone to a beauty store and paid triple for it. It would be best to change the description to 1500.</li>
            <li> These are cute but too big, I thought they would be smaller in size. They come in all shapes and sizes of stones so good luck if you want a lot of one color one style!</li>
            <li> I love these it been awhile since I ordered them and I still have quite a few</li>
            <li> Nice colors, cheap price and the case can be used for other things.  I ordered a bunch of stuff from Amazon and this was the first thing to arrive a few days after purchase.  Thank You!</li>
            <li> No complaints and got great colors in the mix, including black! Great deal for the price and a start for a variety of colors.</li>
            <li> The product came in 2-3 weeks and appears the same as the pictures. They description says \\&quot;3000 PCS Nail Art Rhinestones Glitter\\&quot;, which implies that there are 3,000 pieces. That&#x27;s definitely not the case. I would estimate 250-400. Either way, it was an extremely good price and I&#x27;d probably pay $10 at the store for the same thing. I still think they should be honest and realistic about how many gems are included.</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT 3000 in them. Very disappointed. The container that they come in is way better than the round ones though.</li>
            <li> as soon as I received my rhinestones, I HAD to use them! colors are nice (not off colors) like other places. and came WITH nail glue to apply. lots of gems, great deal for the price, well worth it, thumbs up.</li>
            <li> My gems came earlier then expected but I like the packaging,  everything was neat in its own container. I was a bit bummed at how small they were (didn&#x27;t realize how small 2mm were) but the colors are nice though there isn&#x27;t a whole lotmof each color. You might not be able to do all your nails with one color if u plan on using a lot for one finger. Nonetheless its pretty good for less then $1.50</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great stones. Will have fun using them a lot. Thanks and Aloha for the great service. Have a great day.</li>
            <li> really small size,flat backs &amp; are  perfect for nails.i estimated i got 1000 gems , not 3000.&lt;br /&gt;great container with flip open tops .all gems are round and are multifaceted ,meaning many sides which adds to sparkliness.&lt;br /&gt;colors are :&lt;br /&gt;-Light purple&lt;br /&gt;-Gold/yellow&lt;br /&gt;-Light blue&lt;br /&gt;-Dark pink&lt;br /&gt;-Silver/clear&lt;br /&gt;-Black&lt;br /&gt;-Dark Green&lt;br /&gt;-Dark blue&lt;br /&gt;-Light pink&lt;br /&gt;-Light green&lt;br /&gt;-Light purple&lt;br /&gt;-Red</li>
            <li> I was really happy with my order. The shipping was extremely fast from Honkong to California (I placed my order July 28, 2013 and it arrived 8/8/2013). The gems look really nice and I use them on my natural and acrylic nails. Although, I don&#x27;t think there are quite 3,000 pieces in the set I am happy with the quality and the variety of colors it does include 11 different colors (The silver is repeated). Its an amazing deal and definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The colors are amazing. I love the case. I just wish they are in different shapes. I would refer this to a friend</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I anticipated but my grand-daughter will like them on her nails.  It took awhile to get them but not as long as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> i guess i should have checked exactly how small 2mm was..(tiny) ..i would need 4mm or bigger instead for nail art . i would say what i liked the most was the pill case lol. everything is exactly like it describes though.</li>
            <li> Awesome little container and jewels for the price.  Shipping was slower than things bought in the states, but I was very impressed with the quality.</li>
            <li> A birthday gift for my girlz and they sure loved them , thanks again cheap price and they will enjoy them</li>
            <li> I ordered these gems on July 31st , they were shipped two days later .They got here just in 2 weeks! sooner than the delivery estimate (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is very cute &amp; the case that holds the gems are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;The things i was a little disappointed about was that there&#x27;s not 3000 gems like the description says.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s around 1000 in total &amp; the gems are smaller than 2mm d;&lt;br /&gt;Last thing , the sections in the case are hard to open /:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but overall the colors are nice.</li>
            <li> I like all of the colors and it even came on time and I can make a bunch of different designs. I admit it is kind of hard to put them on my nails but when I do it looks really nice</li>
            <li> Arrived way ahead of anticipated date in a padded package. Perfect starter set for those who want a little jazz for their nails. They&#x27;re super tiny. Buying this locally would have cost me $20, but was just $1.38 online. I don&#x27;t know about anyone else, but I can wait a week or two for it to arrive for that price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are twelve easy to open little compartments for the various colors.</li>
            <li> Cannot beat the price for the amount of stones you get. The neat little case keeps them all separate, and super easy to use. I will be buying more. I have done several designs and topped with uv topcoat and they last for WEEKS!! They are great on my toes. The made it through 2 water parks!! love the colors!!</li>
            <li> I really liked this product, they were smaller then i taught but i made them work there was variation and they came in the case already which i thought was pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Item came as described.  Very nice however the compartments are not as full as pictured but I&#x27;m not going to try to count all the tiny gems.  It is definately enough for whatever I want to use them for.  The little container is really neat and would have paid the amount I paid just for the container.  So it is like getting the gems free.</li>
            <li> very cute colors ... theres not to many but theres a not for the price u pay.. good size gems</li>
            <li> These are so fun to add to your nails. They take a home done manicure to a new level. Love them and what a GREAT price!</li>
            <li> This is what I needed for my nails, love all the colors and the size is perfect. I will buy more.</li>
            <li> It came on time but the jewls ar enot really worth it. I find it hard to match them up well or make a design. My little sister likes them though, so i might just give them to her.</li>
            <li> if youre into doing nails and like to practice a lot...this is for you. its very cheap so it wont be suh a big deal if you waste a couple.</li>
            <li> I love that not only is it a variety of colors but also a variety of sizes.  Plus its a killer deal!</li>
            <li> Bought for Christmas gift for my daughters nails. She love it!!</li>
            <li> many time I was ordered it. Because this is very useful and good price. easy to use.  good good good</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the picture i love the case the stones are in. They are very nice colors and are perfect for nails or whatever u will use them for.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;pill box&amp;#34; design is awesome. It is very easy to use and keeps things super organized. Gives you tons of good quality gems for the price.</li>
            <li> not for me to se i put on it dinot stay on i use clear coat i guess need use glue</li>
            <li> These are perfect for nails. Just place them on the wet paint and let dry. add a clear coat on top to secure better.</li>
            <li> So far I have been loving these little stones! They are perfect for nail art and are the perfect size. I love the large selection of colors to choose from too. I&#x27;m extremely happy I bought these and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> You pretty much get what you pay for with this kit, nothing out of the ordinary. For me the rhinestones are a tad to bulky and don&#x27;t look right on my nails..</li>
            <li> My daughters love it, almost had me talked into doing my nails.</li>
            <li> Grand daughter loved it</li>
            <li> The gems are cute but the segments on the end are impossible to open. So I haven&#x27;t used them yet.</li>
            <li> A Good deal for the price. I would like more shapes, but these work great. I would purchase them again.</li>
            <li> These are cute!  OK now they don&#x27;t look like swarovski but if you expect that you should look at the price again :)&lt;br /&gt;The case they come in is not the easiest at first but it&#x27;s fine and resuable.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful for nail art, card making any craft really.  For the box and 1/10th the number of gems beauty stores charge 15.00!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this case. It is sturdy and opens easily. Oh yeas, the stones. They are good too Lol.</li>
            <li> good deal for your money, many different colors, quality not the best. the shine is mainly gone with top coat</li>
            <li> The case is pretty hard to open. Would definitely recommend you getting a easy to open case or you might end up losing a lot if gems like me.</li>
            <li> Got them wayyyyy before the estimated delivery and they are great. I already have them on my nails. I love them so much. And the container is a great way to store them.</li>
            <li> It was smaller than I thought but good things come in small packages. Shipping took a long time but I think it was coming internationally. We haven&#x27;t opened the gift yet as it is for Christmas for my daughter but I think she will love it. Definitely good value for money!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect size and shape for nail art. Shipment was awesome stay on along time with uv polish or gel and super glue form own personal experience. Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. The jewels are smaller than i expected but in good quality, it also came with glue. The caps on the case do not want to stay shut so be careful! But again for the price you can&#x27;t complain! I would def order again!</li>
            <li> I have not used them yet but from the package it&#x27;s also what I was looking for will look great for the summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if theirs 3000 pieces but I&#x27;m satisfied I have to be honest I thought the box would be big based on the picture shipping came in a day before estimated awesome I totally recommend this product to anyone who likes to bedazzle their nails</li>
            <li> They are smaller than what the pic shows not the big rhinestones really tiny. :(. Need to use more rhinestones.</li>
            <li> I love the way it brings it in a box all organized. When it came I was so excited but when I opened it some gems were mixed but it was like only 10 gems. These gems are smaller than the usual ones that you see. These are made for small and long nails. I love the colors. I do recommend this to people that love doing their nails especially even if you have short nails like me.</li>
            <li> The item is exactly as described. The compartment box contains an assorment of small, cute gems for creating nail art.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my nails!</li>
            <li> I love these as hey are very cheap and comes in great colors and looks fabulous on my nails.  I can&#x27;t believe what I pay at the nail salon when I get these added now that I an order and do my own nails I love that these barely cost pennies to get and I get soooo many of them in soooo many colors.</li>
            <li> I got these to use in scrapbooking.  The colors are very bright and will look great in the middle of flowers or anything you can think of.</li>
            <li> Very understanding and easy to work with. The compartments make the product easier to use and more efficient. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Very good quantity for the price. Exactly as I thought they would be. Very happy with my purchase. Thank you!</li>
            <li> good quality is worth the money small u can use it on regular nails n fake nails&lt;br /&gt; thanks for sending it early then the date u say.</li>
            <li> This comes as described and I just love it. I&#x27;m not sure if you get 3000 crystals because I am not going to count them but for the price I&#x27;m more than satisfied with the amount of crystals and the case they come in.</li>
            <li> I love them. I thought they would be a bit bigger though. but the gems are really cute to put on nails</li>
            <li> However, they aren&#x27;t faceted, so they don&#x27;t sparkle a whole lot, but there are a variety of colors. They&#x27;re good for practicing nail art, like setting them in acrylic or something like that. They&#x27;re half-moon shape - like if you took a ball and cut it in half. You get a lot and when they&#x27;re empty, the little case they come in can be very useful, too. You&#x27;d pay more for an empty case at a craft store, so this is a steal. Good little gems.</li>
            <li> The gems are very pretty, but the case is very hard to get open.  I&#x27;m glad the case doesn&#x27;t just fly open, but it would be nice if I could open it without a knife.</li>
            <li> for the price it&#x27;s ok! if u want to have mor for a cheaper price get the wheel! it comes with a lot more! overall it&#x27;s good though, comes with all the colors it says!</li>
            <li> These assorted colors are amazing. Makes for great fun with decorating your nails with. The only thing I have an issue with, is when you open the tab, it&#x27;s a 50/50 shot that the tab will close again. Because of that, I have to be careful when moving the whole tray so nothing falls out.</li>
            <li> I officially love Cheeky beauty supplies ! Just how it looks in the picture that&#x27;s how it came a week early and all the colors are beautiful I also ordered the set of 5 3D silver crowns and they shipped them together in the same bag! So I was super happy when they both got here I will be suscribing to their youtube account thank you so much I will be ordering again from them soon can&#x27;t wait to use my little colorful rhinestones ! 😄</li>
            <li> I really liked all the colors. I absolutely loved these 3000 nail art gems. They look amazing on my nails</li>
            <li> HOLY GEMS! I got a lot of them for a small price and they are a great value with a nice variety. I like there arent any oddly shaped ones in there.</li>
            <li> Good quality and the kids love them! Easy to use and the case comes in handy for storage and the colors are great</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not a lot to say about these. The color selection is great, and they look like your average nail rhinestones. But on a positive note, its far cheaper to order them through here and the quantity is higher. Somewhere like Sally&#x27;s charges $6 for 4 colors and you don&#x27;t get nearly as much product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use them all the time. They come in lots of colors which I use all year round.</li>
            <li> I really liked these gems, and i love the variety of colors. I use these for nail art, and I&#x27;ve also used these with eyelash glue and used them on my face for makeup for parties because the size is perfect.</li>
            <li> I just received my package yesterday. I received exactly what I ordered. I like the little container it&#x27;s in, so organized. For those who may not know, this is being shipped from China so if you need it to use for an event, order at least 4 weeks ahead of time. Of to polishing my nails, Chao!</li>
            <li> If you love doing your own nails, you need these!  Gorgeous rhinestones and gems!</li>
            <li> Its great especially for practicing placements. lots of great colors wide variety. I&#x27;ll be using them to do practice nails.</li>
            <li> I bought some nail glue from wal mart and I use these all the time on my toes/finger nails. They stay really well and are super cute. Can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> Best packaging out of all of the nail art rhinestones I&#x27;ve gotten. The price was great and the rhinestones are beautiful on my nails!</li>
            <li> Such a great variety and a very good price. I bought one for me and one for my niece, I love them. You have to be very meticulous when putting them on (the nail polish needs to be slightly wet to stick) but if you know what you are doing then they&#x27;re a blast!!</li>
            <li> just took some time, but it was christmas. i plan on getting more. im glad no taxes, that as nice</li>
            <li> Fast delivery look just like in the pic will buy again happy with my purchase. U HAVE to use some type of GLUE if not they fall off, nail polish alone will not make them stay on your nail.</li>
            <li> To me personally I think that these rhinestones are a bit too small. It&#x27;s nice but I don&#x27;t like it as much. The price is great though.</li>
            <li> They are a  little big for nails But also can be used for so many things even jewelry making Lost stone if right size replaceable!!</li>
            <li> Fast shippin. Great colors and nice bling. Dont need to go waste my money on pedi. Any time I could do my nails. Works great.</li>
            <li> They are all nice and bright, stick well to the nails with nail glue. Timely delivery and it is not cheap at all for under 2$ incl shipping</li>
            <li> exactly what the picture has. it has all the colors i need and it came with glue! that is awesome!  :)</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.  You get tons of stones in different colors.  Some of the lids are hard to open, but i&#x27;ll manage.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled when I received these gems.  I use them for make-up looks instead of for nail art.  They are wonderful!  So thankful I had ordered very thin tweezers in order to pick these up though.  I would have no problem recommending them to others.  Twelve different colors, all very pretty.</li>
            <li> This product works very well. I like the shine and how they small, very useful product. Works great! Thanks!  :)</li>
            <li> Yeah they are small but I still lke em doe..its just Hw da pick look u do get alot BTW..they are great for nails dats wat i olny use em for I love to put em  on my toes for the Summer they also stay on kinda lng to jus lke if i went to the chinese.But you have to  use krazyglue ONLY .The nail salon wanna charge me $15 extra ooo hell noo I will do my own..no thanks..u will lke em to watch..I just hope u have a lil patients .as well.I apply mines on with tweezers ..people think I have money cuz some ask chicks say to me Gurllllll u stay with rhinestones Hw much u be paying Ino a lot Hun? So I say yeah girl I do I do to much ..yea rite I be smiling inside .I&#x27;m soo badd I Cnt be giving away all my lil secrets.lol so yea.. if you are a person who love rhinestones dis is for you ma.</li>
            <li> There are several different styles of gems in this pack and its nice to have options when you are trying to do different designs with your nails.</li>
            <li> Love that you have all the colors in one spot versus the round wheel. Each spot has a different color exactly like the picture but the one thing I found tough was how hard it is to open the separate sections! Some of them I cannot open to this day, it&#x27;s tough!!</li>
            <li> So many different colors for such a good price. Love the box they come in, locks very well and doesn&#x27;t let the gems fall out.</li>
            <li> 3000 pieces, my aunt Fanny; the title is misleading. There are maybe two dozen of each color. The title also implies different shapes, but they&#x27;re all small rounds. But they work, and are pretty on your nail art.</li>
            <li> I love all the gem colors and it comes in a really nice little container, where all the colors are separated...love it.  Beautiful colors!!</li>
            <li> I wish it were bigger and has more nail art grms in it  cause it great when you want to do a design with it on the nail salon or a home</li>
            <li> I really love having these gems to put on my nails. I hope I can think of others ways to use them.</li>
            <li> I love this kinda case! I keep all the colors from getting mixed up! Perfect for doing my own nails.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised an glad to get this&lt;br /&gt;not disappointed one bit&lt;br /&gt;great item to get&lt;br /&gt;one happy customer</li>
            <li> Yea...I counted...There were 3021 gems in this little case. They held up very well with my top coat too! Will be reordering when this case runs out!</li>
            <li> The product came before the EAD, they are all the different colors that I wanted. A great price and great product! They look good on my nails too!!</li>
            <li> I feel like I go my money&#x27;s worth and more.  My daughters and I enjoy this because of the variety.  I did not have a problem with the shipper.</li>
            <li> Smaller than it looks like good colors container is good keeps them seal. Ok for its price not that bad good for beginners dont waist alot of money that latter its just gonna fall off</li>
            <li> My daughter uses them on her nails and they work really well. Lots of different color choices. And there not that hard to put on.</li>
            <li> Loved it! great price and love the case it came in.. got it as shown in the pics, gems are big enough for nail art.. not too big</li>
            <li> It takes a while to get home&lt;br /&gt;But&lt;br /&gt;I like this mixd cubics&lt;br /&gt;Good price&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend of this item</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a friend who is always doing fun new manicures with stones and other accents and she loved it.  It comes with a dozen colors and there is a large number of stones.  They are acrylic stones and the color/shine isn&#x27;t equal to actual crystal stones, but for small details on a manicure they work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real problem we had with this was the quality of the case.  There were two of the compartments where the locking/snapping mechanism didn&#x27;t work, leading to spillage.  Despite this, however, these are a great deal at the price.</li>
            <li> Bought this amount other things for my aunt for a present she loved it works well and she said she has so many color choices.</li>
            <li> These r excellent nail art stones but they do tend to pop off easy so u go through them quick but for someone that limes to do there nail it&#x27;s perfect to use  u don&#x27;t have to fiddle around to get them out they come out of the case easy and go on easy but pop off quickly</li>
            <li> My daughter has had so much fun with these nail art rhinestones!  She always comes up with a new design to wow the world.  This is a great company, we will be ordering from them again!</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. It comes exactly as the picture shows, multiple colors and a sturdy little case. I was hesitant to buy this because it said it would take up to 45 days to get to me but I got it in about a week.</li>
            <li> Ridiculously tiny. Probably my mistake. I thought I would decorate Christmas ornaments with them but no, they&#x27;re way too small.</li>
            <li> I got these before the date they were supposed to be here they are pretty and colorful I like them</li>
            <li> These little gems can be a nice add-on to your polish. You can give your nails a simple or bold look. I didn&#x27;t like the amount in the box. Some colors had more gems than others.</li>
            <li> These are an unbelievable value for the money.  Use these for manis &amp; pedis to dress up the color &amp; style &amp; make designs.  My nail tech tells me she can&#x27;t get them herself from her supplier for this price.  Love the multi-colors to personalize each pedicure.  Don&#x27;t hesitate- a real deal of nice quality stones.</li>
            <li> Love these. They were cheap and work great.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the stones from another store.  I got this for the price but the gems are not as shinny. I compared them to the ones I have at home and it is not the same quality.  If you are not looking for great quality they do just fine. I use them on my daughter since her nails don’t last very long.</li>
            <li> It took forever and a day for this to arrive. In fact, I was surpised when it came because I forgot ordering it. Needless to say, it was a great price and just what I needed for my nail decor collection.</li>
            <li> So frustrated with this item. Paid for the 3000 rhinestones advertised and only received barely a few hundred. Seller has been quite uncooperative. Yes I understand the price is cheap but thats not the point. The sellers need to have integrity.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for nail bling. I love these little studs for my nails. They came very quickly in the mail,and they even sent me the difference in the price  change. I love these for my pedicures. They stick on with no problem with just clear nail polish and they stay on in the baths or showers you don&#x27;t have to worry about reapplying each time. I love and brought my mom one to .</li>
            <li> good to store and use whenever you want ad very cheap I love this and would most likely buy again and again</li>
            <li> I bought these to try them since they were so cheap.  I love them there are so many and so pretty. I got them for $1.39 and actually got a dollar back. This was the greatest deal ever. I love them</li>
            <li> Perfect little gems to add to any nail art decoration. The variety of colours are really nice, and the case it comes in is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Love these - all different sizes and colors. This set is different than the other sets I have. Different shades.</li>
            <li> l like the colors diamonds very beautiful stuff.but so small they should be bigger.it hard to pick it up.since am not a pro.i handle with a twizzer! it doesnt work that way .</li>
            <li> This product is so awesome it came in the mail so quikly and there is not 3000 but there is alot of them and there small so you can use them for nails . unlike the really big fat gems that dont fit or you can only put one!!!!! this is totaly worth the money will be repurchiseng this product. and the colors are so vibrant and sparkly totaly chick love them im so glad i found this item. I totaly recomend this to anyone who wants awesome gems for a unbeatibal price!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Produt okay ,but the are not 3000 like they say ,I counted then 1300</li>
            <li> I received this item pretty fast and it looked like there was a lot in the case but I really don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s 3000 gems in there. The case seems to be good quality and the gems as well. The gems were sorted nicely so that was a good thing because I was afraid it was going to be mixed together like some of the reviews that I&#x27;ve read. If there were enough gems like was stated, I would have given it five stars.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  They are the prefect size and nice and shiny.  I had no problem getting them to stay on by using Seche Vite.  I am not sure if there really are 3000 as I did not count but it seems about right.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I wanted! I have had a nail obsession lately, so I bought these to make my nails look even cooler, I love them!</li>
            <li> totally cheaper than buying them at the store, and there was nothing wrong with quality. the containers are convienient too, i like it much more than the wheels.</li>
            <li> this is a great buy.  so many gems so many ideas for my nails.  a really great price too.  and arrived way before the due date.</li>
            <li> These are super cute.</li>
            <li> Nice colours. nice presentation. Good quality and a good quantity to use for different purposes. I reccomend the, The delivery was fast and exactly as in the picture.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Cute little stones. Bought these so that my niece and I can give each other manis and pedis and she loves them, can&#x27;t wait for our spa night.</li>
            <li> Really fun accessories to add to an afternoon of nail fun with the girls :) Haven&#x27;t used glue with them, just put a coat of clear nail polish over them.</li>
            <li> During shipping all of the rhinestones mixed together. It&#x27;s still nice to have all of the options, at this price-- however, they we very blended when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> There is a lot of stones and great colors plenty to choose from. I would recommend buying it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I usually buy packs of these &amp; can&#x27;t really complain for how cheap they are. Although I don&#x27;t use every color, it&#x27;s always nice to have them in case I ever do. These are 2 mm rhinestones. They aren&#x27;t the shiniest or greatest, but work as rhinestones nonetheless. I use them on nail art &amp; phone cases. Most of them are usually in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;The cases are sometimes very hard to open, usually breaking my nails or chipping them. :^( I have to use something like scissors to open them.</li>
            <li> The case is sturdy, the sampling is generous.  The shipment was made promptly, and the product is really nice.  It is used for nails and works great.  I bought a pencil that helps apply the rhinestones and together they work great.  Better than expected for the low price.</li>
            <li> They are PERFECT!! I absolutely love the them!! The colors and my nails look fab!! I also use to make my baby cousins hair pins. She loves them!</li>
            <li> Huge variety of colors, the size is just perfect for your nails. It is an excellent product. 5 stars rated.</li>
            <li> I loved these my daughter put them on a fish she was decorating for her bathroom (going with the fishing theme) and her barbies are blinged out to</li>
            <li> great deal !!  my daughter will love this for her nails !! great for any art project may have to order more for me  !</li>
            <li> This item was just right for my nail art</li>
            <li> great for the price of them. I was amazed when I paid 1.50 for it and sallys beauty store sells the same kit for 19.99 will order them again when I need them</li>
            <li> i love them but it seemed like i waited forever for them to get here but once they arrived i was totally happy with them.</li>
            <li> these gem add a lot your nail designs and I love the variety of sizes you get. They arrived early and all stayed in their case.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product! For the price it&#x27;s a deal! I would buy from this company again with no problem. 😃It took longer to get than what I wanted but it was within the delivery dates they gave me. LoL! I was just anxious to get.</li>
            <li> it is nice to use. very girlish. It took some time to arrive but it was ok, i wasnt in a hurry. it is exactly what they show so no surprises there which is good.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this set of nail art gems for the different shapes and sizes. She has fun doing her nails regularly, and she likes to play with different styles. She was THRILLED with this gift.</li>
            <li> Great product and awesome vendor I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> They just came and wasn&#x27;t expecting them for a few more weeks 6/22 was order date got them today 7/9 love the colors can&#x27;t wait to use really good amount in each compartment 12,different colors</li>
            <li> Would be 4 stars bcuz theres NOWHERE NEAR the correct number of gems as advertised. But a HUGE Plus it came 10 days earlier than earliest arrival date. So 5 stars in my book!</li>
            <li> These little gems are the perfect size to add color to any manicure. They are the perfect accent. I also found that I could use them to replace a couple of tiny gems that fell off my dogs color. They are easy to manipulate, just stick them into a dab of nail glue or wet polish!</li>
            <li> I had problems with the order at the begining but they were great, they were really helpful and had my products re-delivered got them right away when they were resend...love them..great for nails!!</li>
            <li> These are good for kids/little girls. Thats about it. Plasticy looking, too large for detailed designs. Pay a little more get better quality.</li>
            <li> received it on time&lt;br /&gt;really cute nail shapes</li>
            <li> It took longer than I expected to have it.</li>
            <li> These were as described. The only negative was that they came all mixed up but other than that it was ok.</li>
            <li> So not only did I love these, my mom did too. When I did her nails, she just wanted more and more gems on her nails. She would &amp;#34;suggest&amp;#34; that a certain needed one more and I added. I love the case, so easy to open and has it all organized. I also like the variety of colors, I can use different ones all the time.</li>
            <li> Just the right size for nail art! Love all the different colors!  They were a little mixed up upon arrival.  But i have three kids that found it fun to help me separate the different stones. Unlike other reviews i found that each section opened and closed just fine</li>
            <li> I love these. I actually purchased these and a few other items for my manicurist, who is so busy doing her job that she doesn.t have much time to locate little treasures like this.</li>
            <li> I bought more than one of these as gifts also! We love them! So many and a great price!!  I love them!! They seem to stay on as long as the nail salon ones I&#x27;ve had.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> The amount and variety of nail art gems is wonderful, especially for the cheap price! There are so many things you can do with these!</li>
            <li> I received my goods and was satisfied with what I recieved thankyou</li>
            <li> Love the box that the gems come in. It is so much easier to keep these organized with this particular box. The price is great too.</li>
            <li> I love how they are all organized. Very pretty and love that there are so many different colors. They can be used for so many different things.</li>
            <li> These are a great addition to anyone&#x27;s nail designs. They are easy to apply with a curved tweezers and stays put when applying a top coat after application or my preference (sealing them with gel nail polish)</li>
            <li> Size and colors were great however there was only one shape</li>
            <li> I love that these gems came with this great box.  The box could probably be sold for the price I paid for everything, so I&#x27;m loving this deal.  I will be buying more for my fellow scrapbookers!</li>
            <li> I was inspired by Jem &amp; The Holograms cartoon from the eighties.  There all about Glam just like the product. Shipping was great. Only thing i didn&#x27;t like some of the jem containers were hard to open. I have long nails and I would cry if i&#x27;d broke one opening it.</li>
            <li> Its does the job I wish it came with a nail stick but overall good for the price &amp; its comes with different shades of colors</li>
            <li> not all  of the stones are perfectly the same size, but good enough to use them for nail decorations. also it arrived very much faster than the estimated date. I ordered this on Oct1st and the estimated date was Oct28, but it actully was delivered on 16th! Of course safely. Thanks a lot for a cheap, good product with a fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I love them but sadly only got to use it once bc my 3 year old son got into them and I wasn&#x27;t going to pick these up so I had to vacuum them up lol.  I&#x27;m glad they were cheap.</li>
            <li> very surprise, and very happy. i will never go anyplace to order again. good happy goood happu goood happy gooog</li>
            <li> Nice set of nail art gems and variety of gem colors, great deal price, these will last through plenty of projects.</li>
            <li> will be reusing the case for sure! haven&#x27;t used um yet but theyre not very shiny at all and look as though if I add topcoat on top of them so they will stay on my nail longer they will be dulled and gold will turn to yellow! I know this will happen as it always does with cheap rhinestones. maybe I will just glue them in but don&#x27;t expect them to last long or have any shine</li>
            <li> Thank you for your nice Nail Art Gems Colours Shapes. I really really love it. Have a nice day!!! GOD BLESS</li>
            <li> I suck with patience but none the less I am happy with this and glad I got a lot of gems for the little amount I paid. Soooo ecstatic.</li>
            <li> i thought they were somewhat bigger. but still like them</li>
            <li> these are exactly as described and they came in super fast. I personally love these rhinestones because they are a lot smaller than usual rhinestones. They are awesome for people who have tiny nail beds like myself.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the many color choices that come with this set of nail art gems.  The price was awesome and the delivery arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> i love all the colors and they are a perfect size and they make my nails look amazing. a great buy</li>
            <li> Upon getting these gems, I was not home. My mother had open the package - out of curiosity, and sent me a photo through text of my new gems. They looked stunning when I seen the photo. The picture of them is exactly what you get. 12 beautiful colors. with plenty of gems. The price is great! Considering I spent 10 dollars on a color wheel at Sally&#x27;s beauty supply that didn&#x27;t even have 20 of each color. I would for sure buy this product again! Thank You.</li>
            <li> I use these , on my clients nail design, and they love, how delicate, they are on them, and I love how simple, it is to work , with, these gems! definitely will be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the gems to be this small. I was hoping they would be bigger. I used a couple and they have stayed on pretty well. They weren&#x27;t expensive so I didn&#x27;t feel the need to take them back.</li>
            <li> ordered 3 but 1 box came broken with stones all over...the individual tabs to open the sections are so hard to open I have to use a tweezer to get them open...will not order again or recommend...will spend a little more next time.</li>
            <li> I loved them.  Although a bit smaller than I expected. they&#x27;ll work perfect for my cards!  And there are sooooo many!!</li>
            <li> These are pretty small and hard to figure out how to work with to get on your nails but once you do they are pretty cute.  For the price they are a great deal.</li>
            <li> I bought these not for nails but to sas up my makeup tutorials that I do on YouTube. They&#x27;re a bit smaller than I thought they&#x27;d be but that&#x27;s fine in my case they are very pretty and I&#x27;m glad that they&#x27;re are so many colors. The shipping was faster than expected I wasn&#x27;t supposed to get them until September 19 it August 21 so the shipping is awesome for being based out of Hong Kong. I would deffinently recommend trying these I used them on a tutorial today and was very pleased with the outcome plus they&#x27;re so inexpensive you can really complain.</li>
            <li> I DO like this product but find that they are difficult to adhere to the nails. They came in good shape and fairly good time.</li>
            <li> good quality for the price you pay, ABSOLUTELY LOVE how it  is organized!&lt;br /&gt;i use these on myself and friends while doing nails &amp; they are a big hit, i will definitely be buying these again!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for a second time because I was happy with the first. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t receive black stones in the second one like I did the first. That&#x27;s why I gave them 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I wanted some nice quality yet affordable rhinestones for nail art, and these came in cute packaging.  (Ok, ok, don&#x27;t expect too much, it&#x27;s just a clear plastic bag with a little design on the top, but I love it.)  The box is very easy to open and close and the plastic is super clear so you can see the rhinestones well without having to open the compartments.  Just try not to do what I did and forget and leave the rhinestone case in a hot car, because I think it changed the shape of the box a little and now half of the compartments don&#x27;t want to close.  I definitely want to buy again and I love this product!  They are pretty small stones, seemed a little smaller than others I have purchased on Amazon, so they are perfect for intricate designs, just make sure 2mm is the right size you are looking for.  Also, I have found a lot of times you don&#x27;t quite get the full number listed (or not even close) and although I didn&#x27;t count out 3000 stones, I did estimate and came out with about 3000 if not a few more, so I did get my money&#x27;s worth.  I was not expecting such a good quality case and I am very happy with my purchase, I may purchase again just for another case!  Oh, and I LOVE the colors!  Great buy!</li>
            <li> I got the gems today and they came early I have worn these all day and they are still on I will recommend and order again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this awhile ago. Probably around June or July. I love it. If love doing your nails, then you&#x27;ll love it as well. It comes with all the colors that&#x27;s listed. There&#x27;s enough in the case so you can do your nails for a very long time.</li>
            <li> These got to my house within 4 days. Which was awesome. They&#x27;re just as I expected and for the awesome price I couldn&#x27;t pass this up!!</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter loves this set of gems!  The price was great.  The container is easy to open, and is very convenient with each color of gems being separated. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Fun, mixed colors are good, all the same shapes (the description may lead you to think otherwise) but once you put them on the nail and put a top coat on to hold them, they aren&#x27;t as sparkly.</li>
            <li> the colors were correct but it definitely was not 3000 count</li>
            <li> I use these a lot! They are easy to put on with either a dab of glue or sealed in with a clear coat polish. They stay on very well, and are very pretty on. Great price also :)</li>
            <li> Just as described, speedy shipping!  Thanks</li>
            <li> The gems are a great way to express some glitzy ness on my toes, and the money that I spent was well worth it, so my advice to you all is…get the product :)</li>
            <li> Great to use with shellac! Love them.</li>
            <li> Very cute tiny nail gems.</li>
            <li> Pretty &amp; good value for the price</li>
            <li> These gems are cute and colorful, but they don&#x27;t stay on like I assumed.  I had to purchase a nail glue to keep them adhered to my nail.  I was hoping to use just clear nail polish, but that didn&#x27;t work.  They are cute though.</li>
            <li> What can I say about nail gems - the best.  But these are coloured which adds to the the fun.  I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> So cute and the container they come in is very nice, they stay in their designated &amp;#34;slots&amp;#34; and I have no problem with them getting mixed in with each other.</li>
            <li> They are a little small but they are great! I love the colors and I can&#x27;t wait to put them on my nails. You can&#x27;t get all these colors where I live so I am very happy with these. They will great on my nails. Great business to order from! Thanks</li>
            <li> This container keeps all the stones separate and stays closed even when getting tossed around. The color variety is good. Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Unless you have super tiny fingers or really sharp tweezers, you won&#x27;t like these. They are super small and hard to work with let alone center on your finger nails. Not worth the hassel</li>
            <li> This product arrived just as described, and looks just like the picture. The tiny gems are separated by color within the bigger container - the compartments each have their own snap-shut lid to keep them safe.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, she loves it, had tons of colors and shapes, she loves to decorate her nails.</li>
            <li> I just got these and there are many color stones other companies offer the amount of stones are adequate for my home decorations for my toes. Looking forward to using them</li>
            <li> When i revived the package, there were NO gems in the container/s all in the bag!</li>
            <li> Love have the differnt colors and shapes so I could get my nail done my way and half the cost.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s great.  The sizes vary slightly but not enough to bother me.</li>
            <li> Mom had ordered these for me they took about 2 weeks to get here just used them for the first time tonight and I must say I love them!</li>
            <li> Great deal!! I love the case and they are just as describe. Perfect for someone who loves nail art.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price</li>
            <li> One of the compartments was broken and all of that colors gems were lost in the package when they arrived.</li>
            <li> Mine had not been sealed.&lt;br /&gt;When I received mine, at least half my gems were in the bottom of the bag.</li>
            <li> Color on the cool side as I was expecting warm happy colors. Disappointed</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these! They fit on her tiny toes!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality , super easy to use and in a very easy to use , easy to keep sorted case! Makes an excellent addition to your nails. Expect many compliments.</li>
            <li> Lots of gems to choose from, shapes and colors. Super happy with this, got a lot for a little :) Came in the mail fast too!</li>
            <li> Good to use do decorate your nails!!!! I love it! So many colors individually packed in their own little section!!! They are the right size as well to decorate your nail with them.</li>
            <li> very hard to pick up and to place and to get them to stick to the nail, but very cute if you got it done the way u wanted to</li>
            <li> I love using gems when painting my nails and this product is perfect for just that! There were lots of gems and it came a lot faster than it was expected to come. I only had one problem and that was one of the compartments lid broke so I couldn&#x27;t close it. But overall its definitely worth your money! :)</li>
            <li> This was a great bargain for the case alone. THe gems are great and there are alot of them. I bought it for crafts, not for nails and I am very pleased with the purchase. Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> i liked and if i need i buy again and i recomendednto another person i would like to you continue had a free sh</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE! And for the price that I got them at, you can&#x27;t beat it! They arrived exactly 2 weeks after they shipped! Very pleased with them! I&#x27;ve done Christmas nails with them and I just absolutely love these jewels! They&#x27;re small enough to do anything with! I will definitely order another batch when I run out!</li>
            <li> These are verry pretty. they dont stick on as well as i  hoped. the colors are bright and look really good over colored polish</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. When it arrived I was pleasantly surprised. They are much clearer and sparkling than I had expected and the size is perfect. There are a lot of colors to choose from and I am looking forward to all the looks I will be able to put together with these.</li>
            <li> Great deal great price!</li>
            <li> There are many gems to choose from, the colors are wonderful. The case makes it very easy to store until ready for use.</li>
            <li> I love these nail art gems.  The colors are great and they are good sizes.  I use them all the time!  They are great accents or can be placed to fix a mistake on you polish and no one would ever know!  I will buy more of these when I am finished with them.</li>
            <li> The plastic container was broken and I only received 10-15 gems of each color I was expecting at least half full containers and not broken merchanidse</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter. very difficult to use it. she was excited while ordering but after tying to use one day, she didnt like at all.</li>
            <li> Just came in the mail today.  Just what I was expecting.  Very happy.  I would order again but I have so many gems now !</li>
            <li> great value for the money</li>
            <li> i loved it... looks pretty big on the picture but its not that big!!! I love the colors and the case!</li>
            <li> Love the product, I enjoyed bringing out my nails, will buy from this stellar again, thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> These rhinestones are amazing! They are very small and great for details . I love the little container they come in and whould recomend this product.</li>
            <li> Great color variety... The case is awesome too. Some of the little compartments are hard to open and I ended up using my teeth lol. This is a great deal. GET IT!</li>
            <li> Havent yet uses them but they took forever too get here&lt;br /&gt; I am very impatient . But i must say the are worth the money i payed for&lt;br /&gt; Very cute little gems</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this kit , individual snap lids help keep the pieces seperated , plenty of choices and colors.</li>
            <li> It only took a little amount of time for this product to get to my house.  I opened the package and the gems were everywhere ! I do not recommend this product because it&#x27;s just not worth the time.  More than half of the gems were out of the case.  I still find the little gems everywhere in my room.</li>
            <li> These were purchased for crafts so I can&#x27;t comment on using them on nails. The variety of colors will come in handy with crafts.</li>
            <li> its perfect for any nail design you want it came in the time they said  I recommend  to anyone who love to do their nails</li>
            <li> I did not like was not what I was expecting they were smaller then I thought and were hard for me to pick up</li>
            <li> YEOW!!! That&#x27;s tons of gems!!! This will definitely last me and my girls for a long time. Amazing choice !!!!</li>
            <li> The gems are great, they add glamour to your nails. I love these gems so much that i can help but having three or more on each finger. They are just awesome.</li>
            <li> Great color selection, good price, good size for nails and pretty much anything you want to use it for. Also comes in a solid case... The lids snap shut tightly.... Shipping to a little while but maybe because I ordered it durning holdiday season. Anyways it was worth it and I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. Very versatile.  Many colors and very cute size. I would recommend this product for all your beauty and accessories bedazzling needs.lol</li>
            <li> Such pretty colors and perfect size for nails</li>
            <li> I Love all the colors &amp; that it all comes in an easy to open/close container so they don&#x27;t get mixed.</li>
            <li> Very GOOD as promised</li>
            <li> these are nice but a little too large for your nails</li>
            <li> really chunky and they don&#x27;t stick to ANYTHING. i used some of the strong glue i could get my hands on and these suckers still fell off..</li>
            <li> The case was pretty small but not complaining. I got them on time and all of my colors was provided, they greatfully gets a thumbs up :)</li>
            <li> Love everything that is out on the market for nails.  Nail art design has become huge and even us amatuers can get in on the fun with our do it yourself items.</li>
            <li> great and stays on but i wish it came with the glue</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described, very happy buyer! (:</li>
            <li> Love the sparkle these add to a manicure!</li>
            <li> The gems came just as described. I don&#x27;t know if there are actually 3000 gems in there, but there are certainly enough that I consider it worth the money. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the plastic box. Some of the compartments are hard to pry open.</li>
            <li> I received my purchase very quickly considering it was coming to the US from China, which was a great perk! But I do have to agree with other people who have reveiwed this product the count on the gems was on the low side but considering the price I will not complain. Great seller and great product, I love the case it came in. Great addition to my collection!</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter she loves it</li>
            <li> Package was cheap and did not even specify what the item was. No instructions included either. Could be a chocking hazard. Appear cheap and difficult to use. My 16 year old laughed at them when opened.</li>
            <li> Loved these diamonds. They were exactly as advertised and I was very impressed. It came on time and was in a neat package. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I got this set for my daughter and her friends when she has sleepovers and play nail shop. They love it and the studs aren&#x27;t too big.</li>
            <li> This item is very pretty the product came undamaged and fast. Gems are small and perfect for nails. Love them</li>
            <li> They came during the week it said they would come. Looks exactly like he picture. Good quality for both nails &amp; body art. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Good deal for nail art supplies!</li>
            <li> For the amount spent, quality and quantity is fine. I did not count every piece but for the amount I spent there were enough for me not to care. Coming from overseas product came relatively quickly (a couple of weeks).</li>
            <li> I give this five stars because I find it to be a very good deal. I am just starting out with nail art and this gives me many options as far as colors go and have a nice sparkle to them. I will definitely be reordering these and getting some for my sister as well. No issues for me to include.</li>
            <li> These are the best little gems ever..  super cute and they&#x27;re  the perfect size for my nails.  They&#x27;re perfect for acrylics and natural nails.  I will definitely buy these in the future</li>
            <li> Wonderful colors, perfect for nails!  Cheap and yes, I use it, ty for this product!  They are are basically one size but cute!</li>
            <li> i think these are my favrite and the case opens individually for the color using amd you get a lot for the price you pay!!!</li>
            <li> LoVe it ...very cute n so worth it</li>
            <li> I received this quickly, and a great assortment of colors!  I love that this comes in a case!  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Cute rhinestones for the price.  My daughter enjoyed using these on her nails for decoration.</li>
            <li> Very cute and fun! comes with all colors see in the image..</li>
            <li> The case it came in was broken</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> GREAT VARIETY AND LOOKS FABULOUS ON MY NAILS!!!</li>
            <li> You honestly can&#x27;t go wrong here for the price! Exactly what I needed and expected! Just wish there was more clear gems!</li>
            <li> These take a while to receive, just be patient. They are worth it. Exactly like described.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the amount of gems that I received and the mixed amount of clolors. I even received black. I am very disappointed that it says mixed shapes and none of the shapes were mixed they were all round. I really only ordered this item mainly for mixed shapes. On the plus side the product was received pretty quickly and well packaged. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I got these for a friend and stole a couple for myself :) Very small, great colour selection. A mix of bright, vibrant colours and softer pastels. I&#x27;m so happy with these. I might order another set for myself!</li>
            <li> I use them for practically all of my nail art and they stick on great and look just as amazing.</li>
            <li> They are OK. I think they are a lil bit to small for 3D nail art. Maybe I should of went something bigger than 2mm.</li>
            <li> Love the product but it took a while to come</li>
            <li> I will buy again! The container alone is worth the price of all. I dont worry if there are 50-100 missing.</li>
            <li> I bought this to do nail art on myself and my friends. I think it&#x27;s safe to say I have enough diamonds to last me for years!</li>
            <li> Hard to keep this things on unless you use gel....well if you wash dishes....which I do....</li>
            <li> These stones aren&#x27;t as shiny as I expected.  I gave them to my 11 yr.old daughter.  She loved them.</li>
            <li> No Rinestones were spilled came with the correct amount and container was intact.</li>
            <li> I wish the gems were a little smaller and actual stones.  these are those cheap glue on gems!</li>
            <li> Items were described well and just as I expected, FANTASTIC prices! You can&#x27;t get anything of this good quality and low low price in stores.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look like fake diamond gems.&lt;br /&gt;Most are deformed.</li>
            <li> this product is ok - tons smaller than it looks in the picture - very tiny - but ok - thanks</li>
            <li> Cute case ! But gems are inferior . Very cloudy</li>
            <li> Brings alot for different designs.</li>
            <li> Works well without chipping.</li>
            <li> Love the container and all the diverse colors! Looks great on nails and anything else you want to glue it to :D</li>
            <li> Fantastic little gems. I love the case that keeps them so nicely separated. Really awesome quality and quantity for the price. I did not use them for nail art, but they did bling up my cell phone case!! I think I need to pick up a few more of these for my other plain cases.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of shapes in this kit.  Also love the handy little box that they came in.  Keeps everything neat and together.  Love the colors.</li>
            <li> I receive the product and I dint know what it was because I expected to be bigger but it&#x27;s small and I don&#x27;t think it has 3000 gems inside but I do like it and the colors are so brigth</li>
            <li> Beautiful just gorgeous I love them sooo much. You can get top quality designs and looks with these I would advice when your done instead of a regular top clear coat use a gel top clear coat trust me glass like finish shine. But its optional.</li>
            <li> I really love these rhinestones, the price is un beatable.  The case has a flip lid for each color, totally amazing &amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> It gets 3 stars for the case which I&#x27;d pay a dollar for anyways, but there are NOT 3000 in there</li>
            <li> Love love this!! the colors were great and I think you get way more diamonds then it says. It shipped super quick and I use them all he time. I did have a problem opening a few of the slots.</li>
            <li> Ive only been able to use it once on my nails. But i love them.. they arent big which is good! Im ready to go wild with them once christmas comes around. On the way over i guess it wasnt sealed correcctly cause a few of the sky blue were out. but it was no worries to me.. They come sealed pretty good once you put the Gems whee they belong. i love that all come in there own spot!! &amp; shipment came sooner than expecte which is another thumbs up!! thank you</li>
            <li> Very cute little gems. Teeny tiny so you could fit multiple gems on a single nail design. The colors are bright and kept fully seperate in the container.</li>
            <li> lots of different colors and not mixed up or 1/4 full. way to go! i wish all jewels came like this</li>
            <li> It was fast shipping, &amp; i love all the colors. great size. not to big nor small. i get a lot of compliments on them because the colors stand out</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to anyone, Very nice item, exactly as appears in picture, with great colors for more designs!... :D</li>
            <li> Excellent new colors. Love it; one of the best products in this genre. Will definitely buy other new colors too. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Wide variety of gems, small and the perfect size for nail designs.  Bright, vibrant colors and nice, sturdy box to hold them all neatly.</li>
            <li> I love the range of color it comes in. The container it comes in is also very handy n useful.</li>
            <li> I love how sturdy the case is; it won&#x27;t come open if you put it in your bag, etc. The gems are nice and small - perfect for nails or crafting. There is quite a nice selection of colors too. I could NOT have asked for more (especially for the price!)</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for my friend, when i received it a lot of the gems was fell out of the container, i spend hours putting it back in the corrected order but generally i was satisfied and so was my friend.</li>
            <li> My costomers kept asking me when these babies will be back in stock, I was so excited I contacted the seller and asked when will they arrive he said in two days and they came early. I did three sets of nails with these and each client loved the colors, I will re-buy.</li>
            <li> OK - First of all, I&#x27;m not one of these people who is going to sit down and count them to see if there really is 3k pieces - who has time for that???  So I will say I am very happy with the product.  I received it MUCH faster than I had expected, which was a nice surprise.  The photos of the product are accurate.  Came in a small, divided plastic container and there are a LOT of small gems.  3000 or not - there&#x27;s plenty in there, and they will last me a long time, and for what I paid, I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> they work great and they look great and are very fun to use on my nails I would like my friend know</li>
            <li> These are almost top of line looking.  They are a little foggy until you apply a top coat over them.  I love them and they were perfect for my 9 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> So we got it yesterday and the bos is literally 5 inches long. It has 12 sections of different color gems but has 100 of like 3 colors and the rest have maybe 80 and i tried counting and it added up to like 900 not 3000.... I am really beyond upset and mad because I paid for 300o and there isnt even half or even a third. DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> When I received the product it was spilled all over the package all the colors were mixed. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Crap crap crap!! Showed up and was a mess none of the crappy looking gems are even in the container, they were all over inside the packaging!</li>
            <li> I love the different colors available I would recommend this product. I like how the gems have their own snapped container.</li>
            <li> Usually with things this tiny, the backs dont allow for proper coverage of a glue that will keep them on. I used clear top coat with these then put more on top and they stayed on for weeks even after wearing tennis shoes and other shoes that are known for rubbing my nail polish off</li>
            <li> Love that I don&#x27;t necessarily need to use them on my nails. I can use them else where like in blinging out pictures for my scrapbook</li>
            <li> Great assortment and price.  Every one loved them so much. Thanks so much.&lt;br /&gt;Hope to do business with you again.</li>
            <li> I loved this product so much, I bought 8 more.  I have made flowers on my nails and received lots of compliments.  They are 2 mm in size and that is perfect for finger nails.  The variety of colors is nice.  The price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I am so exited and glad I bought this, this is a really good price for this item you can make designs with it and it can be great for party&#x27;s and sleep overs but I would recommend this item to everyone because it is so exiting knowing you bought something so well and so cheap!!</li>
            <li> I wanted tiny gems and that&#x27;s exactly what I got, like for the center of small flowers and such. Great for the price and arrived sooner than expected(:</li>
            <li> Awesome products, just wish it was a little quicker ship time but thanks anyway!!! I will reorder when needed, thanks again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much cheaper to add these gems yourself to your acrylic nails rather than getting them at the nail salon! The salon I get my nails done at charges $2 PER FINGER. I love all the new designs I can do now.</li>
            <li> this jewels are fine looking on my toe nails but feels and look too bulky on my fingernails can not stand them when trying to braid my daughters hair.  I was impress with the delivery since they came from Hong Kong I was specting them to take longer since I order this a few days after ordering SODIAL- Silver Kitty Rhinestone Crystal Fashion Jewelry Set with Pink Bow - Ring...  which never arrived.</li>
            <li> Omg the rhinestones don&#x27;t shine once you place them in the nail and I thought they would be smaller but i guess not. Also it doesn&#x27;t have much of them</li>
            <li> Container is hard to open!</li>
            <li> Love these! I love the box they always came in.</li>
            <li> The jewels  stuck to the side of the container and they took a long time to ship but other the. That it was worth the price</li>
            <li> I was definitely pleased with the price on these. Unfortunately, they were not very shiny, other then that it was a great deal</li>
            <li> Arrival time came in great; was happy to open my package. Once I opened it, not even 3000 \\&quot;gems\\&quot; or \\&quot;rhinestones\\&quot; not buying from here again!!&lt;br /&gt;- angry customer</li>
            <li> I received this product 15 days after ordering, but that was still 1 week ahead of the earliest expected delivery date.  They were packaged well and recieved in good condition.  The colors are very vibrant. I have not had any problems with the stones staying attached to my nails. They set well in the topcoat and did not smear, smudge, or become dull when covered with additional topcoats. Would purchase again when needed. Good value for the price paid.</li>
            <li> what can i say...i love nail art...what is there not to like when your nails are beautiful!! not 2 mention the price for them was awesome!! already did my nails and some friends nails with them!!</li>
            <li> I ordered these expecting a decent amount of nail gems to practice with and ended up being really impressed. There&#x27;s a TON of little rhinestones in the case. Better value and price than anything at Sally&#x27;s, even with my pro discount. There&#x27;s 12 different colors of gems, each marked with a number 1-12 on the case. Assuming the colors are the same in each case, I received Magenta, Yellow, Fuchsia, Orange, Green, Light Blue, Baby Pink, Pink, Clear/Diamond, Sapphire, BLACK and Red. They&#x27;re all evenly sized, no weird misshapen rhinestones stand out. The case itself is honestly a value in itself at less than $2, I will reuse it if I ever actually use up all the gems. Shipping took about 1 1/2 weeks, perfect. The package game taped in bubble wrap in a bubble wrap package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: Light Box(Ships From Hong Kong)</li>
            <li> There are SO MANY little gems that it will take me forever to use them all. All for under $2! I initially wanted them for decorating my nails when I got done painting them,but there are MANY uses for them! They would be very handy in many kinds of crafting!</li>
            <li> It came pretty slowly but I was very happy with the product. The are a lot of pretty colors and tons of them in the box!</li>
            <li> Colors are rich and vibrant. Too many uses to think of for these gems.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong at this price!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for a friend that is starting off nail art and it is great for that purpose.</li>
            <li> what a deal! lots of lil gems like real crystals for my nail art...colors are beautiful love the container better than the circular dial a section kinds that spill. this one has individual snap open compartments for each color</li>
            <li> Got the product pretty fast then i thought i was going to receive it by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks alot for the great product</li>
            <li> These rhinestones are super awesome and so easy to use, i love them and would recommend anyone to get them</li>
            <li> I stopped getting my nails professionally done to save money so I&#x27;ve been trying to add my own designs to my nails myself to fight the temptation of getting my nails professionally done again. These gems were cute and of course a great price for the amount of gems you get. I have small hands and fingers so I would&#x27;ve liked the gems to be a little smaller but I guess the gems stand out even more now. One layer of clear polish over the top once you&#x27;ve placed them on your nail and they aren&#x27;t going anywhere!</li>
            <li> There are many colors in this strong case and they are numbered. It was much better than I ever expected.</li>
            <li> Most def, worth the money!! I LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;Exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much.&lt;br /&gt;Price worthy for sure</li>
            <li> very pleased. extremely cute. cant wait to give it to my sister in law as a gift! I think she will love it</li>
            <li> I have bought nail gems from other places and found them to be over priced and not worth the money. Most come in flimsy wheels. This one came in a sturdy case that came be used even after the gems are gone. Even if it isn&#x27;t exactly 3000 gems it is still a lot of them in the container. Unless your a professional that does client after client then I feel this is a good investment. You get a good variety of colors and plenty of them for less the 4 dollars. Will defiantly be repurchasing if I ever finish the first one.</li>
            <li> Shipping was really fast, and these were cute little project pieces for nail art. However, when I apply them on the nail (The white/diamond) it looks glossed over and not as shiny as I wanted. It could just be the adhesive I use for sticking it to my nail. These are great for fun and play, but unless you have profession equipment, they are hard to apply. Great for young girls. I would recommend this item for anyone that wants close to salon look for a very cheap price.</li>
            <li> definately what i expected... Check this out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sallys beauty supply..&lt;br /&gt;Acrylic Rhinestones in a Box&lt;br /&gt;By: So Easy&lt;br /&gt;Online Price: $18.29</li>
            <li> I ordered these gems aside from how long i had to wait for them to arrive (2 weeks) it was worth it all the colors were perfect even though the product seemed much larger in the photo i am still a satisfied customer and look forward to ordering more gems in the future.</li>
            <li> I Recieved the items in the mail sooner than I was told, but that was a plus ! (: the negative about the product would be that none of the gems have the same amount, some have less than others.</li>
            <li> You absolutely can not beat the price. A couple of the compartment lids are a little loose and do not feel secure, but really don&#x27;t plan on travelling with it so not a big issue. I&#x27;m thinking I might use these for some card decorating too.</li>
            <li> Very cute. Love them. Use them in art projects and as nail art.. easy to use. Sparkly. Kids love them.</li>
            <li> I just wished I would of looked at the size closer before buying. The gems are smaller than what I wanted but I&#x27;ll find something to do with them :)</li>
            <li> This was great! It came in a reasonable amount of time, in perfect condition,and exactly as it said that it would. Very satisfied</li>
            <li> these are cheap rhinestones for sure. plastic and barely shine. i also thought they would be smaller but they are pretty big. you do get a lot of colors and the container is good but not the quality i expected esp after reading the reviews</li>
            <li> They were as expected, just was hoping it wasn&#x27;t quite so small.&lt;br /&gt;But the product is great.  Nice Variety of color.</li>
            <li> Som glitter for my nail designs. Not sure how well I will do but it will be fun to try.</li>
            <li> it was smaller than i initially thought it would be. and it does not look like 3000+ to me. a lot fewer</li>
            <li> I just received these nail art gems in the mail today.  Even though I had to wait a few weeks for these to arrive I didn&#x27;t mind because they were so inexpensive.  They look nice and I&#x27;m happy with the small size of the gems. I also like that they come in a compartmentalized container so that the tiny gems don&#x27;t mix colors. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying these with my next manicure in a few days!</li>
            <li> good for doing nails, quite small and messy tho.  have to be very careful when applying them. I wont be using them much.</li>
            <li> Definitely like the size.  I just thought they would be a little shinier or more rhinestone like but all in all they are very cute and would recommend.</li>
            <li> i got a wheel for like 5 bucks and i havent used them all but when i saw this for a couple bucks i had to buy it they are great and dont get mixed up like the wheel where they move around from the static but i do fing these hard to open sometimes i had some blue gems fly out so i am more carefull</li>
            <li> i ordered this under the impression that there would 3000 gems and that it was NEW that was not the case at all i recieved it after several weeks of waiting which was expected giving the fact that it shipped from hong kong but once i recieved it the packaging was already ripped open the hard plastic case is missing the latch off of a couple of the individual containers so i cant open those and one of the containers is broken with NO GEMS IN IT AT ALL and they were not dumped into the package or anything so i am assuming the shipper was quit aware of this issue when it was mailed so basically i am missing an entire color set of the gems givin the price i didnt expect it to be perfect but this is just rediculous for real thanks for nothing needless to say i wont be ordering from them again EVER.....</li>
            <li> these are perfect .. just what i ordered .. lots of pretty colors .. i love them and  my customers will love them</li>
            <li> little colored blings for your nails looks great applied, take a while to get to you, but for the price its worth the wait</li>
            <li> Bought it for the wife. She has now gone crazy with decorating her nails.  Pretty good bang for you buck.</li>
            <li> This is just perfect. Obviously I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s 3000 but it is a lot. The case locks tight so that it doesnt pour out, plus it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I recieved these in a timely manner. I love how simple it is to open each individual storge compartment. Varities in colors is awesome too. Definatly will recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Adorable little gems and they work great on nails. Good color options and they are pretty durable, too. Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Pretty and still worth the price but I am not counting them to see if there really are that many there.</li>
            <li> I didnt know they was so Small,but  i like them, I have them on my nails right now ,I will order again and tell my friends ((thank u))</li>
            <li> i bought these a while back I just forgot to put on a review....,&lt;br /&gt;I love the gems and they stick very well to the nails and all of that. just when I got my package, the case had two broken storage squares, the silver n purple... all the gems flung out when I opened it, and were lost and their were not as many as I assumed in each quare no where NEAR 3000. maybe 300.</li>
            <li> I like how the compartments hold different gems. I love the different colors. It did take a little bit to get here, but over all I love these gems. Makes my nails cute.</li>
            <li> This case works perfectly whether you&#x27;re a pro or starting out. Each slot opens separately so you&#x27;re less likely to mix or drop all of your gems.There are endless possibilities as far as nail designs. You could add a single stone, enhance a design, or add one by one to an entire nail. Why stop at nails? You could add a little duo eyelash glue and apply them to your face for a dramatic look, weddings, or another special event. Shipping was long but much shorter than expected. It was mailed in a secure bubble mailer.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend and plan to purchase more.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and the amount  you  get for you money.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a Christmas gift and my girls are going to love them. They are just the right size for their fingernails and the colors are great. I really like the container that they came in too.</li>
            <li> The product is really nice but it just arrived on Janyary 3rd?  Missed the date this was ordered for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Hi, I got this for my daughter. She loves it. It does have very nice gems and the colors are pretty. My daughter used it for her nails and craft projects&lt;br /&gt;dee</li>
            <li> I bought these for my jewelry making, and other crafts, as well as for nail art - they are SO versatile!  They came very well packaged, in a neat little container with individual compartments, and were delivered more than a week ahead of schedule!</li>
            <li> shipped quicker then I expected.Love the container,&lt;br /&gt;I even took some of my old ones out of the wheel container they were in .&lt;br /&gt;love that you know it&#x27;s closed and you don&#x27;t loose all the little pretties inside..</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re kinda cheapy looking but they do the job.</li>
            <li> My grandaughters love them</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, again bought these to go with the nail tools.  Order now as come from china, great stocking filler.</li>
            <li> Price was perfect, so I purchased them don&#x27;t use it to much but if I ever want to I know it&#x27;s there for I think $1.00 u can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> The Nail Art Gems are in a great case that allows you to select only the color you need easily.  They stick on easily with a little dab of clear nail polish.  The best part is they look great and add that special touch to your home mani/pedi!</li>
            <li> 3000 nail gems is a fabulous deal considering Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply sells 100 gems for $9.99.  Now I don&#x27;t have to use them so sparingly!  Also, I have always wanted black stones and I didn&#x27;t know they existed until I received this.  Great price, good quality.</li>
            <li> I love this product, the colors are very bright and the perfect size. The BEST part is they r soooo cheap!!!!! I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I received this very quickly! The picture shows how it looks exactly. The colors are very bright and the perfect size. Great container too. Very organized.</li>
            <li> The stones did not shine when I put them on a client. I was very disappointed. I bragged on the amount and price to my fellow nail tech, now I sorry because I can&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> in the picture it looks like you will get a lot of this little gems, but when I received my package their wasn&#x27;t as many as I expected, but overall this is very cute and I love them. its great and will make any nails cute</li>
            <li> Got here fast the price was great but this wasn&#x27;t the case it came in it came in thoes circular ones but other than that it was a great deal and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I would give ZERO stars if I could.  I ordered a set of 3000 nail art gems. I received the package from this seller on 6/13/2013 and the item that ended up being sent to me was a wig for hair. I took a picture of the item that was delivered and the packaging of the item as well.  This is unacceptable as I did not order a hair wig at all.  Despite having to wait an extremely long time for the item, they sent me a wig, which is obviously not nail art gems!  I have requested a refund and will not be doing business with this seller again.  I suggest others do the same.  Even at the cheap price, its not worth the wait to end up getting something completely different from what you ordered.</li>
            <li> ok so this item is good expect when i recieved it some of the stones had come out of the box and where all inside the packaging. I like the colors but i think they should take more care in how they ship the item.</li>
            <li> smaller than I expected...... really like the color verity but not  all little taps don&#x27;t close so well that&#x27;s the only issue</li>
            <li> These are the cutest gems ever.  So glad I ordered these.  Great price and on time.  Exactly as pictured.  Recommended</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying rhinestones and I love all of the different colors. It is a great add on to accent my nails</li>
            <li> I am overall pleased with this purchase. It was delivered really quick and the packaging was neat. No rhinestones falling everywhere, which does happen with other companies. My one complaint is there surely does not seem to be 3000 pieces but you can&#x27;t really complain for the price. Not to mention, the color quality of the stones is nice. Other companies send stones that are cloudy or have small piece so plastic sticking from the sides of the stones but these are very richly colored and cut perfectly round. I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s maybe 1000 pieces or so in the case but I didn&#x27;t stay there counting them so I may be wrong. With that said, for the price, it&#x27;s a pretty good purchase and I&#x27;ve been buying different stones for awhile so I should know. These are pretty good. I suggest to buy them.... And another plus, they come in a great case too!</li>
            <li> I love that I have 12 different colors to choose from when doing my nails! I also love that each color is separated by a compartment (each compartment has a number engraved on it) that I can open &amp; close so i don&#x27;t have to worry about the gems mixing or falling out. You also can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I do my own nails and reall enjoy the jewel embelihments.  these are fun and add a little &amp;#34;bling&amp;#34; for special occasions and every day wear</li>
            <li> These are not what nail techs are use to using.&lt;br /&gt;They are thick and dull made of plastic or something.&lt;br /&gt;Will not recommend unless you are buying for a 8 year old.</li>
            <li> I really liked this! Theyvarw easy to use I loved the colors that were provided and liked the storage box it came in</li>
            <li> ENDED UP BUYING SEVERAL NAIL ITEMS FOR A FRIEND WHOS STARTING HER SMALL BUSINESS AND SHE LOVED IT</li>
            <li> Wish some of the sections weren&#x27;t so hard to open because I&#x27;ve lost quite a few that way but there are definitely a lot of stones to go around. Overall good product.</li>
            <li> Generous supply of tiny gemstones.  Perfect it you do a lot of nails.</li>
            <li> Rhinestones aren&#x27;t that shiny and the container is small comparing too the picture</li>
            <li> I DO LOTS OF BEADING AND CRAFTING I AM GLAD I ORDERED THESE I WISH I ORDERED MORE AT THE TIME...LOVE ALL THE DIFFERENT COLORS</li>
            <li> You get what they say you will get, my only complaint was that the container was broken and not of any use to me for storing. could be from shipping so wont complain to much.... would buy again just to see...</li>
            <li> Came 2wks before the min. est delivery date. I Love them so far. Looks like many are in there. Pretty small but worth the money!! Will order again.</li>
            <li> this is such a nice case the quality was great and the gems are super pretty, not too big or too small and they will help a bunch to keep my station at work clean (i work in a nail salon) the other ladies there will definitely be jealous!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t count to see how many were actually in. But it&#x27;s a lot. Good quality. I would recommend. Good buy.</li>
            <li> I can tell I like the gems but I have yet to be able to open them, it is so hard!!</li>
            <li> daughter loved getting these</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 3000 pieces or the name of art gem.I like it but I can&#x27;t rate this. Prefer one color in each box</li>
            <li> These were a great gift to give to my mom for Christmas!  She loved the amount of gems, and also the variety of colors!</li>
            <li> Perfect for what i was looking for. Comes in a organized case. The only downside is it took over a,month and a,half for me to receive them and i had actually forgot i had bought them. But there awesome for the price if you don&#x27;t need them right away</li>
            <li> I love the packaging--so easy to use and separate. Very bright stones--not cloudy or dull. Many different colors for variety.</li>
            <li> Arrived before the estimated time. I love it. Stylish. Cute. &amp;Modern. All at a good price!!! EASY to apply . Love this nail art accessory !!!</li>
            <li> This crystal set was only 2 bucks and I got free shipping! It has 12 different colors and the crystals are small for fingers and toes or even cell phone cases! I do a lot of self manicures so being able to decorate my own nails for practically free was exciting! No need to use glue! Just use the top clear coat, set them with your tweezers and go over with a 2nd coat and they won&#x27;t come off!</li>
            <li> The gems themselves are a little larger than I expected (they stick out) whereas I thought they&#x27;d be very teeny tiny, but now I know what 2 mm equals!  Great variety of colors ... a lot of gems included ... the case is smaller than I&#x27;d imagined, which is nice.  It opens to each gem separately, so spillage of all contents is impossible, unless you open all the different lids. The lids open and shut easily, which is particularly nice, so that you don&#x27;t accidentally spill some while trying to open the case.  the price is amazing compared to the local Sally beauty supply.  I&#x27;d order this again!</li>
            <li> Hard to glue on, fall off easily, doesn&#x27;t come with glue. These are very okay. Cheap tho so can&#x27;t really complain!</li>
            <li> same as picture. would purchase again! and love the case.</li>
            <li> Still using the same pack, almost years later.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great for the price and there are many of them of different colors, the picture does not mislead anyone</li>
            <li> Good for design like it</li>
            <li> Good value for the money</li>
            <li> Perfect for nails! I love it! Use a bit of top coat to keep the jewels in place or else they fall off.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure how small they are, even though it says for nail art. They come in a really nice plastic box, as pictured. I bought them for my Mother who does lots of crafts and an extra couple boxes for my daughters, however, after seeing how tiny they are, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m giving them to my little girls, because I could foresee my carpet becoming forever sparkly. Great deal!</li>
            <li> I ordered and received the three Nail Art Gems &amp;#34;as promised&amp;#34; with no problems. These are all gifts so I have not used them personally but they look like they will work beautifully. Apply polish and before the polish completely dries, apply the gem. The colors are vibrant and I think that the girls will love them.</li>
            <li> These gems are a little bigger than the other gems I have but the case is great and I will reuse it.</li>
            <li> They make a big difference.looks professional</li>
            <li> Lots of gems.....my daughter and I love it!</li>
            <li> These only get 4 stars, cause when I opened the envelope, half of the containers section were opened and gems where everywhere. D: (Also, holy s*** those gems are TINY. I think I underestimated just how tiny they&#x27;d be.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, all in all, the gems are a good quality, the container is very nice, (and though I doubt there are 3000 gems) it&#x27;s pretty decent over all.</li>
            <li> Love this imma order another</li>
            <li> these were for my daughter for Christmas. she like them very much and still uses them a year later to do her nails.</li>
            <li> The cost was too hard to pass up, had to get it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so hard to find these items at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> The girls loved these.  They used hem to have a mani/pedi day. Great gift idea! Great pricing....quick shipping.  Thanks and enjoy!</li>
            <li> I thought these were bigger. I didn&#x27;t realize they were fingernails until I got them in the mail. Completely my fault.</li>
            <li> This set is perfect! It stores my gems seperately and securely. I hate when they come in the wheel because they easily can mix or slip out of your hand. No such problem with this case! Must buy for all nail artists.</li>
            <li> Came in a cool little case, all sorted by colors. Perfect for designs on nails!&lt;br /&gt;Love them! I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I am pleased that my product got here in less than 3 weeks considering it came from China. I am not, however happy that this product isn&#x27;t as described! I got different, beautiful colors(none of them repeated), but they&#x27;re all the same shape and there isn&#x27;t 3000 in the box! My box came nearly empty!  I am furious, but at the end of the day....yeah...you get what you pay for! I gave it 4 stars because honestly, the gems are beautiful! Call me a glutton for punishment, but I will order again. :) The gems are just so beautiful and shiny...they hipnotize me.</li>
            <li> I love all the colors that comes with the set! They are the perfect size. I can&#x27;t wait to try them!</li>
            <li> gifting a must. i cant think anyone would not find a place with these. scrapbooking especially.  these are so pretty. eyelash adhesive you have such a twinkle.</li>
            <li> The rhinestones are smaller than I thought and so was the  box they came in...still I think it&#x27;s a great product and can&#x27;t wait to use them!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product!!! I love all the different colors, and I love love love the container. It&#x27;s easier to use than the wheel container rhinestones usually come in. Only took a couple of weeks to arrive from overseas. Well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Yes, i sat and counted, each section should have 250 pieces in order to be 3000, but there were about 160 on average. I contacted the seller and helped me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;quality of gems and container are excellent tho</li>
            <li> Item arrived just as described! It was well packaged and the stones are beautiful quality! Perfect gift for my teen!</li>
            <li> I simply wish I had more, but other than that, so much fun and beautiful to work with. Definitely very versatile.</li>
            <li> The gems are smaller than I thought they&#x27;d be. Almost like sprinkles on a cupcake. I gave them to my oldest granddaughter and I know she&#x27;ll like them since she&#x27;s an avid collector.</li>
            <li> The gems arrived sooner than the estimated delivery date, which is always a plus. It was packaged perfectly and arrived exactly as described. The colors are bright and vivid. These gems are perfect for nail art or other crafts.</li>
            <li> VERY LONG SHIP TIME but once received was good for the price!&lt;br /&gt;The quality is decent. The lil&#x27; plastic case is small but simple.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like there&#x27;s 3000 of these gems in this container. They are very frustrating to use, even with slanted tweezers.</li>
            <li> The nail gems are as described, but they definitely have a cheap plastic gem look to them, as opposed to crystal gems.  They have a thicker base, so you need more nail polish if you don&#x27;t want them to be as raised on the nail.  Still, considering how often I have gems get knocked off of my nails, this was about as much as I wanted to invest in them.  I will mostly use these for fun on my toenails, and I think they will work just right for that purpose.</li>
            <li> VERY VERY NICE!!!! ABSolutley LOVE!!!! They took a little while to recieve but the price and product is well worth it</li>
            <li> I paid $1.59 with free shipping, and I believe that there was 3,000-5,000 pieces, I can&#x27;t remember!  However, I absolutely love it!  The little gems are so ADORABLE, and they came sorted in a really nice clear plastic case!! They stick on well, and they last for quite awhile!! I&#x27;d have paid several dollars for those from a store, or anywhere else!  Thanks to Amazon and the buyer, I&#x27;m thrilled with my product! :)</li>
            <li> i was kinda worried when i read all the comments saying that they were not 3000, I was so pleased when I received my package today and very happy to notice that they are 250 gems at least per color that makes 2500, and relly nice colors, for 1.95 cant beat that. Also i was expecting them in the next two weeks so early arrival its a plus.</li>
            <li> So many for such a low price~ The container is an added bonus. I love it. The quality of the gems may not be top notch, but I have no problem sticking them on my nails (they all lasted 4,5ish days at least too), and they make ae nice sparkly addition. For those saying that these &#x27;tiny things&#x27; aren&#x27;t worth the two dollars you&#x27;re paying, well, that might be the case in China or Korea, but I dare you to find something in a US store that sells something like this for cheaper. Most nail shops offer something of similar quality for at least five times the price. This was a great deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the selection of colors, good price and quick delivery. The only thing is they&#x27;re a little bigger in diameter, thann what appears on the computer screen, that&#x27;s why I rated it 3 stars. Overall, nice set of nail gems.</li>
            <li> There is a variety of colors completely organized into each slot and i received my order way before I expected</li>
            <li> Well it was cheap, so I guess you get what you paid for...they don&#x27;t stick to nails at all</li>
            <li> The case it comes in isn&#x27;t the greatest but there  are good rhinestones for sure</li>
            <li> Exactly as stated.  Many colors to choose from. Shapes are very similar to each other. Good for little girls and nail art lovers.</li>
            <li> It arrived before I expected it but I felt the picture didn&#x27;t do the size justice. Another thing is that one of the compartments is broken so it can&#x27;t close which means I have to be extra careful not to let it tilt or the gems will be mixed up. One last thing is that it obviously does not have 3000 gems but it&#x27;s still a decent value.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I was looking for, for my nail art!&lt;br /&gt;Thrilled with all of the colors and I love how they are organized.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve said in other reviews I love SODIAL!  Good price for the amount of gems you get and the quality is consistent.  The rectangle case is a bit difficult to get into, but I opted to try it as the circular ones have a habit of mixing the colours when you spin the top around to get to what colour you want.  3000 may seem like a lot, but I go through them fast.  I will be ordering more soon!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the gems, thank you so much! , I will definitely buy more, 1000 stars to this item!</li>
            <li> As the title states, there are not nearly as many pieces in this container as there are in the circular ones, both of which I have bought on Amazon.  They are also much smaller, which is not an advantage to me.  I can hardly see them on my nails.  I feel that I wasted my money on them.</li>
            <li> I love the containers that these come in.... but a few of the tabs were broken off when I receive it. so I cannot even open those compartments to use those gems :&#x27;( I purchased two at the same time, and both of them have the same problem</li>
            <li> Item was as described, was received ahead of date! It made a great gift for my sister who is learning to do nail designs.</li>
            <li> OK nail decor..plain stones</li>
            <li> Love them! the case stays shut and the gems are perfect!</li>
            <li> especially the container. Thought they were a bit bigger though. And the other display pictures it shows multitible size diamonds.</li>
            <li> shipment came In earlier than expected which is good. Definitely was not 3000 gems. They are really small. The colors are mixed together in mostly all twelve slots. Not necessarily bad considering the price.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really beat 3000 stones, especially for the price. The case keeps them sorted securely and there are a bunch of different colors.</li>
            <li> i like them, these are very good gems and nice size and i love the packagind and easy to use</li>
            <li> these are super cute, but very tiny which makes them great for nail art, but i used them to decoden my cell phone case.  I might try them out on my nails later. I didnt count them b/c i dont have time for that, but I dont think it&#x27;s 3000 of them, but compared to store prices I will order again if i need some.</li>
            <li> For sure , they are not so many but they are more than enough. Big variety of colors like the picture. I think it is kind of big but they still work fine for me.</li>
            <li> I want to say that u have to use Krazy glue to stick them on because. I used nail polish and it didn&#x27;t work but I like it I would recommend everybody to use it!😄😎😛😜</li>
            <li> Absolutely 3000 of them, easily! And they are all in their compartments in the case, after being shipped. Arrived almost 2 weeks earlier than expected. Completely worth the purchase. At my local beauty store, it&#x27;s $20 for 20 and that doesn&#x27;t include the case! This was beyond worth the buy and wait for shipping, and shipped much quicker than planned. Happy bedazzling!</li>
            <li> This comes in a cute litte case that keeps the gems seperate even if it were to tip upside down. Nice variety of colors... am loving it for an accent nail every now and then!</li>
            <li> These were purchased as an extra for when my daughter does her nails. They are just as advertised, no question on what I ordered</li>
            <li> This product is just what I needed to get my clients nails done and with the variety I get so many satisfies colors</li>
            <li> I purchased this item thinking I was just gonna get ripped off with little tiny rhinestones.. But no they are perfect and definitely match the description!! Recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> From the photo it looks kind big and like it would have alot of gems but it really doesn&#x27;t. It came sooner then expected and while I do like it for the price, I have a feeling I&#x27;ll run out quick but I&#x27;d buy more from this seller.</li>
            <li> Everything that I wanted was what I got. The description was perfect and the picture is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the amount of stone that I received. I like the case as well. I will order more I. The future</li>
            <li> Very good for doing designs on your nails. I would recommend these if you like doing designs on your nails and like gemstones.</li>
            <li> They were very good quality and look beautiful on my nails. I like the compartment box that they came in also</li>
            <li> different colors, very nice. easy to use and very organized. love doing stuff on my nails and this is just the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> The gems are awesome. The case they come in is upper sturdy and holds up real well. Went back and bought 3 more.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t have enough sparkles, decorate my hair clips, use for nail art, also great to embelish my braclets and sunglasses. The price is fabulous as buying them at the beauty supply is out of my budget..</li>
            <li> My daughter has used these once and thinks they are pretty neat.  I bought them for her and I to share.</li>
            <li> I loved the little gems. They are soooo small. Perfect for nails. Some of the colors are mixed up but it&#x27;s understandable because they&#x27;re so little. Great product. I&#x27;ll definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect 3000 pieces for the price but I think I got half that. They sent a partial refund in with the package, so I think they knew it was less than promised. I like the little container and will use it after the gems are gone, so I do appreciate it and would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I like the casing it is cute. Can&#x27;t wait to play with them. They look really nice, bright and colorful.</li>
            <li> This provided lots of gems for the money spent - will buy again.  I am really enjoying these!  My goal is to be able to do my own toe designs!!!!!  Trial and error becomes cheap with these!</li>
            <li> These are so much fun for using in your nail art creations, my daughter loves them!  So much fun for doing nails!</li>
            <li> Tiny gems perfect for nails or crafting. I used it to line a leaf in an altered art project and they were the perfect size.</li>
            <li> Definitely a lot of little gems and all the different colors to choose from! Just received this item yesterday and I&#x27;m highly satisfied, but wish the case was a bit bigger</li>
            <li> hard to pick up the tiny pieces, but it did come with nail glue which is handy.  shipping took a long time</li>
            <li> this was so cheap, it was definalty worth it. it came with tons of little cute gems! all different colors too!</li>
            <li> This item all in all was a great bargain.  Impossible to get an accurate count but sufficient to give me my Money&#x27;s worth.  The packaging could use improvement.. for some reason the stones filter out of the carton without the lid(s) ever being opened.  Glad that I had placed the case inside a Zip-Loc bag.</li>
            <li> I Love the colors, The box is awesome and I will reuse. I am more than happy and will buy more.</li>
            <li> My order came in the mail today and I absolutely love them. They arrived earlier than expected, which is a plus! And they are exactly as described. Can&#x27;t wait to use them in my nails :) Would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I love the rhinestones they are flashy but.. my case was broken when I got it and customer service was GREAT I didn&#x27;t have not one hassle when it came to them Great product and great customer service</li>
            <li> The variety of colors and shapes are fantastic and help the creative process!  The case is so much better than many in the circular cases, so much easier to keep them separate and secure.  Shipping was quick and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Nice, shiny little crystals. Although I presume these are meant for nail art, I use them for other purposes. It is very difficult to find this size flatback crystal in a variety of colors. Even the case is of fair quality, though I don&#x27;t suggest tossing it about in a bag as the tops are not very tight. But I bought this product for the crystals, not the box.</li>
            <li> Nicely organized container. Lids clasp tightly to prevent spillage. Consistent colors and good small size to use on all sizes of nails.</li>
            <li> I have bought items from them multiple times, even though I still have rhinestones from my last order  I want to stock up in case people realize the great deal they have!! I see people complaining because there aren&#x27;t enough rhinestones but I don&#x27;t care about the specifics because they have never let me down! The price is so reasonable and the product is great!! I will definitely buy more from them :)</li>
            <li> I love them they are so beautiful it took alil while to come but it don&#x27;t matter I love them so much! They look great on my nails :D</li>
            <li> I love these, the only problem is that they are smaller than I thought they would be. They work great and look amazing thoug. I would reccomend them to my friends if they were looking for something like this. They came a lot earlier than I thought they would, I liked that.</li>
            <li> Ordered this on May 10th and got it on May 28th. Which is much faster then it said it would be. The colors are what they showed in the pictures. I will be having a lot of fun doing different designs for my nails.</li>
            <li> For months I haven&#x27;t been able to find these rhinestones in stores so this was my next choice and I will be purchasing these again. I bought two cases so I&#x27;m stocked up for a while. The rhinestones are small but are a perfect size, not too chunky.</li>
            <li> i liked these stones, they are very small but their ok for the price. the case is handy so u dont mix up all the colors.</li>
            <li> I received it a week early which made me super happy! Even though the container is tiny which doesn&#x27;t matter to me because i put them in a pill organizer case , but the rhinestones are awesome tiny but great! I recommend this product to everybody !</li>
            <li> I love that all the colors are separated in their own compartments. The container is a little smaller than expected but you can fit a lot of the gems in each spot.  It can be a little tricky to get them out one by one but I just use some tweezers to get one out and place it and it works out well.</li>
            <li> Great product, will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> It works great and stays on love it I would recommend to anyone who is a nail lover like myself</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed at the fact that the description says you get 3000 total gems but actually there are about 950 about 80 per color..its good for the price but you don&#x27;t get what they say you&#x27;ll get</li>
            <li> I use it with a special pencil that picks the gems or etc. up and apply to my finger nail.&lt;br /&gt;  It is really cool to do it yourself, I love it thanks to a friend, and I&#x27;m honored for her showing me what she does,&lt;br /&gt;  I really learned alot before I have even started. Erika</li>
            <li> I love these rhinestones the kit is a lot smaller than I imagined but the rhinestones are perfect for nails and they adhere fine with top coat or gel sealer. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.FYI It does take a few weeks to arrive since its being shipped internationally.</li>
            <li> These stones are small enough even for my niece little nails and still noticeable on my big acrylic nails.  I love the colors and they last so long with just a clear coat on top of them.  Great gems!</li>
            <li> this is the third one i have bought from this seller, i have been happy with all three but noticed that the colors varied each time i bought a new one. definitely not 3000 diamonds but would buy another one if i need them again. great price but they do take a LONG time to get to you!</li>
            <li> I love all the colors that came in this!!! awesome! and there are so many I just cant choose which color to use first lol :)</li>
            <li> I paid $1.36 with free shipping, the product came within five days. When I opened the package I noticed not only did I get the gems but I also found a dollar bill tucked in there as well... There is definitely less than 3000 gems and an unequal amount of each color. Overall, I can&#x27;t complain for $0.36.</li>
            <li> I love these nail gems because their are 12 different colors and shapes to choose from and the containers have clip lids that allow for great storage and non-spills.  If used correctly, they stay on your nails until you take them off, but you must have nail tweezers to apply them.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I expected maybe something that was kind of a rip off compared to the picture just because of the price but when I saw the actual thing I was very happy! It was a bit bigger than I thought it would be (it&#x27;s still small but a good bargain deal) and I used them right away and they look great on my nails!!!! Totally worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Loved the many colors it came in, enough of a choice to decorate any combinations I can come up with. Easy to apply with a bit of nail glue. Packaged well so the colors do not mix which makes it easier to use.</li>
            <li> Great price for product plus sturdy case for the gems which is very helpful.  Will be perfect for my daughters nail decorating birthday party! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought these a while back and every time I do my nails or toes, I use them. The variety of colors is wonderful and they are the perfect size. I will re-buy these in the future.</li>
            <li> i ordered 2 sets and only got 1. There is now way 3000 pieces in that container, at most 120. i will give them the 1 star as it arried 5 days early. i will not EVER ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN!</li>
            <li> so many colors so little time :) i love rhinestoning my nails myself and the quality of these were great. pink was my favorite!</li>
            <li> there were definitely no where near 3000 gems in this package.  There were 3 colors that were repeated.  But the case and qulaity was good.  Some of the pockets on the case are difficult to open.</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;3 I love it great product for nails.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anybody.&lt;br /&gt;I give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> There are tons of little gems in each container. A bit hard to grab them but they look great on! :)</li>
            <li> Cheap, no shine, and tiny. Like the size of a pen tip. I used them for a phone case and OMG hard to work with</li>
            <li> Love the the packaging and quality of the rhinestones.</li>
            <li> Good quality and good amount.</li>
            <li> Great item.good shipping</li>
            <li> The product disappointed me, the box came broken and some rhinestones has fallen out. Haven&#x27;t even used it yet b.c I&#x27;m afraid of everything falling out. Wasn&#x27;t worth returning though b.c it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> The jems were good but I expected more of them, it took liked it was half empty. Also I expected each color to have an equal amount.</li>
            <li> So far....placed 3 on each big toe when giving myself a pedi, let my niece choose random colors to add to her mani...no problems with the actual product. The container is a bit weak--one of the plastic lids broke..I foresee a mess coming &#x3D;P*</li>
            <li> I love bling in my nails, especially color ones so these were perfect, I could be very creative now with all these colors.</li>
            <li> These are so awesome! It took forever for them to arrive but it was worth it. As previous reviews have stated there are less than what is described but for the price i can get over it. I used them and just set them with some clear polish and they lasted a couple of weeks until i scraped them off. Downside? you cant reuse them so it would have gotten 5 stars if there was more gems or at least as much as they said there would be.</li>
            <li> Product as described,  I  will order again. I&#x27;m very pleaded with product. Can&#x27;t wait to use them on my projects.</li>
            <li> These are so cute, and work perfectly. Great buy, and I had no issues receiving it.  I use these very frequently.</li>
            <li> It came on time is the only truth. There were only about 600 gems (yes, I counted); the picture on here looks a heck of a lot more full as well (which is why I bothered to count). It&#x27;s okay, and it&#x27;s a great buy. But seriously, just tell the truth of what you really are giving.</li>
            <li> As others have commented, there cannot possibly be 3000 gems in this case.  In spite of this, it is a good buy, the gems are beautiful, and it should last a while.  Just wish they were truthful about the quantity.  The order itself was shipped immediately, was expertly packaged, and arrived in perfect condition an impressive 20 days from the day I ordered it by (what I usually term) &amp;#34;a slow boat from China&amp;#34;.  I am pleased with this seller and this product and will use them again.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> It was good just took forever to get. The product was great and everything seemed to be what it was suppose to be.</li>
            <li> the stones are very tiny and you dont get an equal amount of all the colors. but they do come in pretty colors</li>
            <li> like omg here love it their a lot got them to day and happy with the striping i got thank you</li>
            <li> These gems were just what I expected. Beautiful, easy to use for someone who has a little experience with nails and a steady hand. They are fun and bright and a great deal.</li>
            <li> so happy with the nail art gems, looking forward to buy more colorful gems and other product for nails!! love it!! :)</li>
            <li> way less in the containers than what it looks like here, but still cute and what i ordered. I recommend buying the tweezers as well because they are really small</li>
            <li> There are so many.  Great value for the price.  I can&#x27;t even imagine using them all right now.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> exactly what I paid for. They came in a nice little case and I am able to use them for crafts and nails.</li>
            <li> I love it I wish it would come in different sizes</li>
            <li> I love these!!! Must have!!</li>
            <li> Amazing colors and very shiny like swarovski crystals. Great accent to have in your 3D nails art collection. They say forever with a dab of super glue. Great Price, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> YOU JUST CANT BEAT THE PRICE FOR THIS. LOTS TO CHOOSE FROM. CAME FAST AND MY DAUGHTER JUST LOVES ALL THE COLORS.</li>
            <li> I love this it comes  with a variety of colors, its small but its perfect. will re pourchase again reccomend</li>
            <li> I ordered these expecting to have them within a decent amount of time knowing where they were coming from.  The stones themselves aren&#x27;t bad but it definitely doesn&#x27;t look like there are 3000 stones.  Also, I waited over three months for them! Really??? 3 months!? Never again</li>
            <li> I am happy with all but one.  One of them had almost all of the gems out of the compartments and it is going to take me a very long time to sort them out.  In fact....it just might not happen!</li>
            <li> Some of them are unusable. Not very many, about five in each color. Other than that, they suit the need I ordered for just fine.</li>
            <li> These took about a little less then a month to get, when i got them in the mail i was surprised at how small they were i thought they&#x27;d be bigger but they were very tiny and so was the case(the nail art in the pictures are a little deceiving) and some of the gems had spilled all over in the package so i was sad about that, but besides that i like them they are nice colors and i like how they are divided into each little square and have numbers on each lid(12 colors like picture) so over all i wouldn&#x27;t repurchase this because they are MUCH smaller then i wanted but they are ok and i will still use them for nail art.</li>
            <li> Very cute I was surprised how many you get and how professional they look.  I&#x27;m Going to give them to my granddaughter for Christmas.</li>
            <li> lots of rhinestones I purchased this to fancy up some at home manicures. Although I though that all stones are the same my nail tech informed me that sometimes these rhinestones are not shiny which was the case of these ones that I bought recently once applied to the nail they don&#x27;t sparkle like other ones I&#x27;ve seen. Not exactly what I was looking for but I&#x27;ll use them on my daughters nails for a buck I don&#x27;t feel let down.</li>
            <li> just like in the beauty supplies store but for 30% of the price</li>
            <li> I love these! I use them all the time on myself and paying customers. I will be buying more when I run out!</li>
            <li> these are really nice. smaller then i expected but nice. my daughter and i use them almost all the time.</li>
            <li> Priced just right,  Color are perfect - product is of good quality. It was packaged very well.&lt;br /&gt;My grand daughter was very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Arrived two weeks early. They are ok for the price. Good size for small nails. Doesn&#x27;t seem like 3000, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice for as little as it costs.  Worth the money I spent.  Perfect sized jewels for nail art.  Happy with it.</li>
            <li> I got a nice selection of colors and the item arrived quickly. There are definitely not 3000 gems in the package, but for the price I feel it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this set as I was getting ready to purchase more gems.  While I did like the &amp;#34;wheel,&amp;#34; I found that this was much easier to use as it offers you the opportunity to keep multiple areas open at once.  I would suggest that you slowly open your selections (prior to working on your nails) to help avoid spilling.  Lids are extremely secure and thin (great for storage).  Very happy with product!</li>
            <li> they were really great they seemed bigger on picture they are pretty small but fit perfectly on nails for cute designs and comes with about every color i really liked these rhinestones would buy again plus were cheap</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and they really liked them when they had gotten them. A few gem colors got mixed up but otherwise the packaging was fine. A great product and really cheap, I could have gotten these at Sally&#x27;s for twenty bucks I am glad I waited and bought them on here!</li>
            <li> Great colors, can be match with pretty much any style.&lt;br /&gt;Just the right size, not too big not too small.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a lot more then what I paid for!</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, but they are all one size and there are definitely NOT 3,000 stones as the product description claims. I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a few weeks now.  They came in a lot earlier than I expected and I&#x27;ve been loving using them.  The case is a bit hard to open and I don&#x27;t want to break a nail opening the little compartments.  I just have to take my time and all is good.  Love them!!!!</li>
            <li> Um okay so I ordered these one dec 4th today is jan 9 and I have yet to receive these little stones. Its been more than a month now where are my little gems?? This is not what I consider a timely manner at all</li>
            <li> The gems look just like the picture. idk what people were talking about saying there was less gems and they were smaller, mine looked prefect!! i would buy again and again!!</li>
            <li> Love these thing! so easy to put on and my girls loves me to do their nail too! They are great to do any art work on your nails!</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I use them for decorating my daughters nails. Product arrived on time and the price was just right.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a lot larger than I was expecting and I have fairly small hands... So i can&#x27;t use them for a lot of rhinestone designs that I&#x27;d like to. But, the colors are pretty and you get a ton of them. If you&#x27;re clumsy/clutsy and prone to hitting your hands on things - good luck keeping these things on. They have some sort of... &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; on them. So they aren&#x27;t just large, but they stick out further than other rhinestones on the nails and pop off pretty easy if they get snagged or hit on anything.</li>
            <li> These are smaller then what I thought they would be but I am actually glad for being a DIY nail girl these are perfect size for my nails and you can&#x27;t beat the price plus free shipping! I love this seller!</li>
            <li> Just an ok product, but not bad for the price. Would recommend. This is something that would probably cost about twice as much at a store.</li>
            <li> my girls loved it.they are always doing there nails.my fifteen year old does her nails all the time.she&#x27;s very artistic</li>
            <li> Great deal for the price I paid.  Very small gems that I plan to use for things other than nails.  My husband will use in his fly tying</li>
            <li> These gems are ok, they are definitely not 3000 of them and they are different colors, but they are not different shapes as shown in the pictures.</li>
            <li> I received these 2 weeks and 4 days after the day I ordered them. They came much quicker than expected, considering that they were shipped from Hong Kong. I ordered through Digital Center and the price was 1.75 per box, so I ordered 3 boxes. Great deal. They are small sized, and not the large ones depicted in the photos, but after reading the reviews I knew that they would be small, and those are what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Lots of bang for your buck here! I got a steal deal on these! I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but they look like lots of fun!</li>
            <li> Awesome price for how many gems you get. It was delivered quickly too. 2 weeks before estimated date. Gems were all the same size though, just different colors.</li>
            <li> This came in like 2 days ago , took like 2 weeks . But it was okay because it shipped from Asia.. Came earlier than expected. They came in a nice plastic box with 10 colors. I used them yesterday and love them ! They are the perfect size for nails. I used clear nail polish to stick them on but maybe nail glue would be better for sticking them on! They were cheap too , great deal. I would recommend them to anyone ! (:</li>
            <li> These are itty bitty jewels but are very pretty. They look great too! The price was just as good and very pleased my with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Not bad....havent been used....I brought this for my daughter but shipping was SLOW SLOW SLOOOOW. I cant tell you how well they look....but I guess they are ok....and whether they work good or not will depend on the glue that holds them on the nail....so great price....slow shipping....many colors</li>
            <li> perfect size rhinestones for nail art and the case is very cute, organized and convenient to use. I love this product</li>
            <li> I liked these little colorful rhinestones! They go great with my nails, but the only thing i wasn&#x27;t pleased with was when I received the package the case was broken and there were rhinestones everywhere! Totally mixed up with all the colors :/</li>
            <li> I love the case it came in the colors are so pretty can&#x27;t wait to start using them. I will be getting more</li>
            <li> I love the little container that they use for these rhinestones.  I received this order in the timeframe they had proposed and the description was very accurate.</li>
            <li> Super cheap .. in two ways .. price and what you get .. but there is so many .. so if you want to get these for a beginner or for you teen .. scoop them up ..</li>
            <li> These are adorable, I was worried they would be to big but they are perfect, Like the case it is easy to use, nice variety of colors! Will buy again and would recommend!</li>
            <li> There so fun to use and got them pretty fast just disappointed that there wasn&#x27;t as many diamonds as in the picture they show</li>
            <li> Great product, price, &amp; shipping arrival timing!</li>
            <li> I purchased these to use in my paper craft projects.  They are lovely....quality gems and a great little box at an affordable price!  Just a note, they are quite small in size...</li>
            <li> They came in all different colors and sizes , literally. I wasn&#x27;t really expecting such a variety. Bows, butterflies, triangles, moons, and much more.</li>
            <li> nail decorating! assorted nail gems, exactly what  you see.  lots of variety to choose from - cant complain about it.</li>
            <li> I do like this, however I thought they were going to be a little bit bigger.. anyways I do love them and I have used them on some friends of mine also . .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am very happy with this item.  It is just as described, lots of color choices too! The container is sturdy as well.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors are filled with more pieces than others, no problem.  But there are definitely not 3000 gems at most there may be 50-80 gems in each square.  12 squares, totaling at most, less than 1000 gems.  I&#x27;m not super worried about it though because for less than $2.00, after shipping and tax, I still think it&#x27;s a steal!!!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Very cute. However after some time the stone falls off and leaves behind the silver backing.</li>
            <li> This is very small and it is a lot in each square. Worth the purchase and i am very happy over all.</li>
            <li> The colors were varied and a good amount of each color  in each slot of the container. Some were out of place but nothing to worry about. Please overall with what I can accomplish with this product.</li>
            <li> they were a little smaller than i expected but they are so cute,, the shipment was way before the due date.. i would recommend to anyone..</li>
            <li> I Love these and will be reordering. Love all the colors and the box is the cutest thing...There very easy to use and looks great on my nails</li>
            <li> they are soooooooooooooooo tiny like , you have to be careful because u can loose all of them in seconds....</li>
            <li> I order these diamonds at a every good price told me that they will get here in a month instead they got here in a week they were in great condition all the colors they said they had and they range from small to large I was very satisfies with my order. They are perfect for small little girls my daughter is 4 and they stay on for a long time if u used good nail glue</li>
            <li> All the colors I received were awesome! I don&#x27;t know if 3,000 were in there, but there was a decent amount of gems in the holder. Great buy for the price, i love doing designs with them on my toes :)</li>
            <li> They took a while to get here, however these are awesome gems and each compartment is departed so the colors and shapes do not mix (like they do with so many others). Colors do not run with opi fast forward top coat.&lt;br /&gt;Check out my nail art slide show where i have used this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;8mI6RWODtc0&amp;feature&#x3D;youtube_gdata_player</li>
            <li> These little gems are beautiful! Great variety of colors. Perfect size to use on nails. The case is heavy-duty plastic.</li>
            <li> my greandaughter uses these for her nails and she just loves the colors and shapes they work really great and look great too</li>
            <li> so nice my girls love making new things up for their nails very nice would tell my friends about it if asked</li>
            <li> I expected them to be a little better quality, they are really not that shiny and get worn down quickly.</li>
            <li> I got these nail art gems really quickly, and for the price you can&#x27;t miss.&lt;br /&gt;The case is nice, and much easier to use than the usual wheel style. The selection of colors is great and the amount is amazing.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled when this arrived!  Frankly, I bought it for less than $2 shipped and I was skeptical that it would show up at my house for that price.  Now I&#x27;m heading out to get some nail glue &amp; tweezers to apply these little dots of sparkle.</li>
            <li> I received this product very quick! It met all the requirements.&lt;br /&gt;The picture shows how it is exactly. I love the container it was put in as well.&lt;br /&gt;Very organized.&lt;br /&gt;THANK-YOU!</li>
            <li> SODIAL(TM) 3000 Nail Art Gems Mixed Colours Shapes in Case (Size 2mm)..these are awesome...the colors are bright and beautiful. I Love them</li>
            <li> The diamonds are good, I like the colors. I would have love them if they were a little bit smaller.. but either than that they were great.</li>
            <li> I really ike this the shipping was fast&lt;br /&gt;I like the variety I been having such fun with my nails&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it had shape variety like some big some small</li>
            <li> These are a great buy! Such a large variety of color. I will purchase more they arrived earlier than i expected too! Yaaay Me!</li>
            <li> worth the buy dont think it was 3000 gems case is good to not a cheap case i say buy</li>
            <li> The gems look great. The case is really nice. I prefer this kind of case to the wheels, I find that it is just easier.</li>
            <li> this was really great! my daughter and her friends really loved it, and for the price you cant beat it.</li>
            <li> I would never order again I thought it would be like the ones at the nail salon and they feel nothing like it very cheap and it looks horrible I rather pay the extra cash and get it done at the salon !! looks like something you get get your child to decorate a paper or a drawing horrible didn&#x27;t even shine</li>
            <li> This product is awesome and perfect for nails. It came sooner than expected which is awesome. Very well packaged and nothing out of its place. Definitely recommend this....what I absolutely loved about it too was the price. The price is awesome!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a great price.  The stones are really tiny and great for nail art.  I just put 2 coats of clear nail polish on my nails and get a toothpick and dip the tip in water and pick up the stone on the color side and press the silver flat side onto the wet nail polish.  I make the design I want and then wait a minute before I put another couple of clear coats on top to glue the stones down.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 4 stars bc 3 wasn&#x27;t enough. Although they do vary in size a little (barely, just try to find ones that look close in size if its that important to you) and they don&#x27;t look like most high quality rhinestones (cut precisely like swarovski crystals, but hey… what would someone expect for this price lol) they definitely get the job done. I&#x27;m not sure that I received the 3000 the title says, but I&#x27;m sure I got at least 2000 which is more than ok for me. Shipping did take a while since they were coming from overseas but they actually got to me sooner than expected. Perfect size for nail art and i would definitely suggest buying these and would reconsider buying them again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for the jems and love how it came in a case so there easy to get to. I ordered a ton of nail gems and they all fit in this perfectly</li>
            <li> i bought this to use for my nails with the tool I bought. it came with a lot of gems, in separate containers, but the colors were all mixed together. I had black gems mixed with my silver gems and it just made it hard to use</li>
            <li> First of all there is no WAY there are 3000 in this thing.  Second of all they get quite cloudy when you put a top coat over them.</li>
            <li> the only problem is you have to buy glue for them separately but you could also subsitute the glue for a top coat.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, I was shock when I saw the little box, I thought I was not going to be happy however the stone are perfect I immediately got them in use and got a nice design on my toes and finger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m posting this on behalf of my 12 year daughter. She watched a few videos online and wanted to try it herself. The packaged arrived on time. She loves it. She now has a little clientele list of her own (family and friends.)</li>
            <li> I loveeeee them to cute</li>
            <li> These were a mess!  They came in scattered all over the place.  Threw them away.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no down side to this item. Great price, easy to use,and they add beauty &amp; bling to any design...great item!</li>
            <li> my daughter is very happy with the item.</li>
            <li> Colorful and pretty - easy to spill, though.I prefer the wheel arrangement-&lt;br /&gt;glad I bought 2 wheels.</li>
            <li> Was a little disappointed that the sizes of the gems weren&#x27;t very different. Was hoping for larger.</li>
            <li> Perfect for adding bling to my manicures. You get a lot of them. My only complaint is that the container &#x27;leaks&#x27; and sometimes I find them in my nail polish box.</li>
            <li> These crystals are perfect for nail art and other projects! Don&#x27;t waste $16.99 at the beauty supply store when you can get the exact same product for a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> i have nothing bad to say about this product at all i love the colors and the rhinestones i use them for nail designs</li>
            <li> Product was shipped quickly and we found it to be conveniently packed, the kids will love doing their nails with these gems.</li>
            <li> nice. I dont have time to be writing all this stuff. The product is nice. very pretty. Took forever to get it though.</li>
            <li> My daughters are all caught up in this wild nail craze and this made the top of their wish list.</li>
            <li> I got my purchase today, sooner than expected.  The stones are perfect size for nail decoration and they come in a very sturdy box that keeps them secure.  Recommend 100%.</li>
            <li> Great size of the gems and they come in this refillable case so that you can re order certain colors as you need them it also prevents them from mixing when you are using them the package did take a while to come so order way in advance but great item for the price</li>
            <li> These gems were very reasonably priced &amp; came in a good variety of colors. It took a long  time to get them, but for the price it was ok. Just don&#x27;t order these if you are needing right away or pay the higher shipping cost.</li>
            <li> Really small little gems but they seem to stick on well if you apply them correctly. The container works great and they&#x27;re are a lot of each color but i didn&#x27;t count.</li>
            <li> I love gems and i couldn&#x27;t hesitate on these.. very cute colors and the set comes with black gems too... &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> the container is nice and comes very organized. but the gems are super duper small. there about 0.5 mm or so. okay size for nails ... but too small for others</li>
            <li> These gems are really great especially for the price! I don&#x27;t think there are 3000, so only downfall. But all in all it was a great buy for what I still got, also super nice getting the small container with it to keep organized. Also I purchased on January 8, said I would receive February 3-19, and I received it on January 29!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I expected. I bought a couple to use as stocking stuffers and it worked just like I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it!!!! It was so much fun receiving this in the mail! Ive already used them on my nails and all my friends are complimenting me! I also love the case they come in its so easy to keep track of them and the colors!</li>
            <li> For a small taste of glitter on nails is ok. The price is right. I wanted to see more glitter in each compartment since teenagers will use it up quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and in a nice package.  I can&#x27;t wait to get my nails done.  I received them in the mail quickly and all in each slot.</li>
            <li> This product is great. It was suppose to get here February 5 but it came in today (January 28) i am beyond satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> These nail gems are great. You can make all kinds of designs. Great case that keeps them in place. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> There is a lot of pieces but they are way too small and they loose their shine once put on the nail.</li>
            <li> Not anywhere near 3000 gems. I expected the little boxes to be filled but no. DO NOT be fooled by the picture.</li>
            <li> super nice I am going to have rhinestones for ever</li>
            <li> Great price, great arrival time, &amp; great product! I would highly recommend this product &amp; the company that sells it!</li>
            <li> I like it very much and got it on time</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected and they are also a lot less than 3000 but they are only 2$. Also they got here within 2 weeks so it wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Good stuff,  bright, clear. Not cheap ones</li>
            <li> Wonderful variety, wonderful price, wonderful shipping speed.</li>
            <li> Perfect and in a great case. I can&#x27;t wait to let my 8 year old start using them. The price was awesome!!</li>
            <li> Great for the price!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Waaaay smaller than it looks.</li>
            <li> I love all the colors and such a great price.... defiantly gonna order more.</li>
            <li> Love these gems! They came bnip and looked like is was all 3000. I am very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> These rhinestones are great their packaged nicely &amp; fit your nails really nicely I love how they have their own separate compartments they look great on nails or toes.</li>
            <li> Great for nail art! If you want a variety of colors for your nails purchase this! They are slightly large but still look great!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Very nice!</li>
            <li> These work great if you are using shellac polish. They tend to fall off of regular.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and the price was just right.</li>
            <li> I ordered these and honestly didn&#x27;t expect much given the price (it was $1.76 when I ordered with no shipping charges). The product came in 2-3 weeks and appears the same as the pictures. They description says \\&quot;3000 PCS Nail Art Rhinestones Glitter\\&quot;, which implies that there are 3,000 pieces. That&#x27;s definitely not the case. I would estimate 250-400. Either way, it was an extremely good price and I&#x27;d probably pay $10 at the store for the same thing. I still think they should be honest and realistic about how many gems are included I doubt that would impact their orders because of the unbeatable price. The container is nice that the come in, you can open one pocket at a time so there&#x27;s no mixing of the colors. A small tube a glue would&#x27;ve been a nice extra that I would&#x27;ve gladly paid a little more for. I definitely recommend this product, it&#x27;s great for nails, projects, scrapbooking and many other uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colors:&lt;br /&gt;-Light purple&lt;br /&gt;-Gold/yellow&lt;br /&gt;-Light blue&lt;br /&gt;-Dark pink&lt;br /&gt;-Silver/clear&lt;br /&gt;-Black&lt;br /&gt;-Dark Green&lt;br /&gt;-Dark blue&lt;br /&gt;-Light pink&lt;br /&gt;-Light green&lt;br /&gt;-Light purple&lt;br /&gt;-Red</li>
            <li> I bought this for my little sister who loves doing nails and she loves the gems. They arent too small or too big. And, now she cant stop doing everyone&#x27;s nails. Great Product!</li>
            <li> It took me about 2 1/2 to get these which was fine. I got a good deal on these, they were under 3 bucks. I bought them for craft projects for my kids and for the price I think it was a great bargain.</li>
            <li> everything was a little smaller than i expected but love them cant wait to use them. they are sooo tiny and cute</li>
            <li> Was very impressed with how they were sorted, got all different collors and they work wonderfully! They are small enough to be put onto my nails while being visible but not to gaudy.</li>
            <li> While some gems become dull after an application of top coat, these did not.  They remained shiny which is the whole purpose of having BLING on your nails :)</li>
            <li> Wonderful sparkly pretties; arrived quicker than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Great color variety; I plan to use them for nail art as well as scrapbooking.</li>
            <li> Love these rhinestones; they&#x27;re the perfect size and easy to work with with just a little practice. I use a toothpick and a tiny dab of clear nail polish on the tip to pick them up and place them. The colors are great and they&#x27;re very sparkly. Make sure you use a topcoat or they will pop off. I wouldn&#x27;t blame that on the stones though; you just have to adhere them well!</li>
            <li> So I saw the review that said there is only a few hundred gems and that&#x27;s wrong. I actually counted and in each box there are about 190~200 gems of each color. Having 12 boxes, that&#x27;s about 2000+ gems. Almost didn&#x27;t write a review, because everything good about this product has already been said. Just needed to straighten out the amount, because there is actually a lot more gems than people can \\&quot;estimate\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The container was a lot smaller than it looks in the pic, No bigger than my hand really. Perfect for a teenage girl.</li>
            <li> 3000 gems in 12 shades is a GREAT deal. I love that the case is small, about the size of a smartphone, so it stores easily in my nail collection. The colors are beautiful and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any imprefections on the gems. I love it!</li>
            <li> i reallylike these, and for the price, it was a great deal! i just have a problem cause i am just starting to do my nails at home, and the tiny pieces are hard to place right, but that&#x27;s okay, they are as described and wok well, i just have to get used to using them, and i will, i also ordered the tweezers for these by the same company, and they help ALOT, so i do recommend those as well. if you are better with tiny pieces, and with your nails, or are more crafty than i am, than you will deffintly love these! they are as described, i have not counted them, i do not have the time to, but it does seem pretty accurate as they are a ton of these little things!</li>
            <li> I was so glad when my gems can all theses pretty colors so many very nice pick shipping was fast im glad to add these to my nail art collection</li>
            <li> I received my gems within the time frame that was given. They are cute and just the size I expected. They are the perfect size for nail art. I have used them a couple times now and love them. They add just the right amount of sparkle to any nail job. I am just looking for more designs to use them in. I would definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> These are really small and perfect for designing nails. Really cute, lots of colors and lots of gems. Very inexpensive and I&#x27;d definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> They came just as they are shown.  I have not actually used them yet but I anticipate they will work will.  I was please with the size of the gems</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought it would be, but sufficient for the price.  Free shipping made this deal okay.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered for two granddaughters who love nail gems.  i know they&#x27;ll be happy to get them.&lt;br /&gt;No similar products to compare with.</li>
            <li> Pretty good delivery time considering it was coming  from china . The gems are small ones small enough to fit your nail. Love the amount and how many colors I got!</li>
            <li> I cant believe how inexpensive these are! I bought a similar case at Sally&#x27;s for over $12.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Will order more because they are an incredible value.</li>
            <li> They are perfectly sized, easy to manage and keep in order with the cute plastic box with sectioned off compartments and that close tightly. Bright and awesome colors.</li>
            <li> After reading through the reviews I expected the gems to be all the same size, and small. But I guess I was a little surprised with the size of the case.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s rather small! Lol. And there are no &amp;#34;Mixed Shapes&amp;#34; or anything, they&#x27;re all the same.&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I do love these! And I love the packaging. I gave it 4 stars for the lack of &amp;#34;Mixed Shapes&amp;#34; and for being unexpectedly small.&lt;br /&gt;But, all in all, for the price, you get a pretty good deal I&#x27;d say :)</li>
            <li> Every thing i expected!!!  I guess sometimes the price isnt too good to be true.  Now I need more design ideas.</li>
            <li> was hoping that it would be a little bit more filled but they are great though no problem with picking them up .</li>
            <li> Crystals included no instructions, no ,glue and were almost impossible to pick up with tweezers, if you were lucky enough to get one on with clear polish, it fell off almost immediately I will not be buying this product again. I</li>
            <li> These are alright, plain and ordinary but alright. They do what they&#x27;re intended to do but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this set again.</li>
            <li> Came quick and the container is small. Lots of nice colors at a great price. Easy to add, just place it on the wet nail polish and then add a clear to make it last longer. I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> They are great. I use clear polish then go over them with clear polish, seems to stay on good. Had them on for over week till I took them off.</li>
            <li> These are super cute to use when you have patience and a lot of extra time to actually use them. I used clear coat before applying them and clear coat on top of them and they would budge.</li>
            <li> I counted each and every one to be sure, and there were only 370 in the entire container!!! For the length of time it took to get here, and the cost, it was not worth it.</li>
            <li> We bought these for our daughter, and when they arrived she ended up spending the entire weekend doing her fingers, toes and my nails!  She loves them!  I like that the case has tops that open individually for each different gem color, and that the dividers are large enough that the gems do not mix.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time&lt;br /&gt;Just as described in the picture&lt;br /&gt;Even comes in a little cute box just like the pic.&lt;br /&gt;I got all different colors and all cute ones&lt;br /&gt;I personally love the product, use them all the time</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM TOOK WAY TOO LONG TO GET HERE. I GOT IT WAY AFTER CHRISTMAS. GUESS I SHOULD HAVE ORDERED SOONER BUT FOR THE PRICE ITS GOOD.</li>
            <li> Great value! They took a little long to get here, but I am so pleased with the purchase. Along with my dotting tool, I was able to create tons of blinged out nail looks. For the price, you seriously can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> These arrived earlier than expected and well packaged, nice color selection. I wish there was a size variety but it&#x27;s ok. I like them thanks!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to add these to my nails!!  Product arrived quickly and were in perfect condtion when I received them.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them.</li>
            <li> Love them! I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s 3000 but there&#x27;s a lot! I would recommend these if you like doing your own nails!</li>
            <li> Well i guess these are going to be helpful  i have not gotten the chance to use them yet but working on it</li>
            <li> &amp; arrived ahead of schedule too! very happy-gems aren&#x27;t too big or too small so they&#x27;ll work nicely for my purposes. thanks!</li>
            <li> This is nice you 12 color to chose from , the only thing is that they don&#x27;t sparkle too much .</li>
            <li> now that mine has arrived ill do lots of designs with it thank you very much. just perfect great colors.</li>
            <li> I share this with my cousin. We are both nail addicts and these are absolutely perfect. The case is not cheaply put together, they are assorted into beautiful colors, and superglue makes &#x27;em stick like a charm. or push them into wet nail polish, they still look great.&lt;br /&gt;10/10 would recommend ~</li>
            <li> I love these gems I love the case and I love the colors I&#x27;ve already used them about 4 times they&#x27;re really nice and nice to do nail art k with</li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s all sorted out. They are great. I recommend getting precise tweezers (the one with pointy tip) to use when putting stone on nails!</li>
            <li> the studs stick up a little high so when I use them for my girls nails i have to add extra layers of the clear coat. Im going to try and use them for badazalling. Hopefully it works! :)</li>
            <li> Bought these for my teenage daughter to use with her nails.  They work great, there are a variety of colors, and the size is smaller than most of them we find locally.</li>
            <li> I love these things! they add sass to my pedicures and manicures. and the shipment came in days before it said it would</li>
            <li> Easy to use gems, just hard to grab obviously because of their size. I used a tweezer which worked just fine for me. There was a random gem that didn&#x27;t have a colored backing to it so it looked clear but other than that, I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
            <li> This product is a graet deal at a great price.  Very difficult to find this item locally for the price.</li>
            <li> I just got it and I try it last night it was very nice let see what my friend tell me and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just going to say Amazon</li>
            <li> Great size for nails although not the smallest I&#x27;ve seen&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy case with lids that snap shut... don&#x27;t see any duds yet</li>
            <li> These were deliver just as stated when ordered.  They are very colorful and delightful to use.  I use them right away as soon as I got them.  I am quite please with the container that they are in also.</li>
            <li> myriad of colors and very cool and convenient case. they are difficult to put on by yourself but i did purchase the pen set to put on.</li>
            <li> I love them especially because nail salons charge so much to put them on i just bring my own when i go</li>
            <li> So I bought these two weeks ago and love them the price was the best because I usually buy these per color so getting a variety really helps I can now get creative with my nails thank you!</li>
            <li> Nice colors and not expensive but I do have to put topcoat over them so they don&#x27;t fall off and it kind of &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; them and makes them look round like beads.. I like them enough to use again but wish they weren&#x27;t so small</li>
            <li> They arrived WAYYY before the estimated ship date. They like just came in the mail today and weren&#x27;t expected to come until May 22- June 10! They are really tiny so that they can fit on your nails and come in a little box with compartments for each color gem.</li>
            <li> who would i be if i didn&#x27;t make a pro/con list? definitely not a gilmore girl! ok...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so so so many rhinestones. so many. are there 3000 like advertised? i have better things to do than to count all of them, but there are plenty. especially considering how dang cheap it was! i will definitely order again when i run out...in 100 years. as i type this i have beautifully bedazzled toes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;got here quickly. 13 days after i placed the order. considering it came from china i&#x27;d say that&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the case is GREAT. compartmentalized and no chance of them spilling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: they&#x27;re little so it takes practice placing them exactly where you want them, but by my second toe i had it down to a science. use tweezers!</li>
            <li> there is not 3000 gems:-(</li>
            <li> They last a long while. I think they a worth the wait.</li>
            <li> These little nail gems are fun and sparkle nicely. The package is easy to use and keeps the separated pretty well.</li>
            <li> Gems and Rhinestones in the individual compartments make it so easy to use. Colors are vivid and it has a good assortment.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I got so many choices of color with different sizes and it will be easy to use</li>
            <li> Just received my order and to my delight, each color cube was filled with gems! You really can&#x27;t beat the price. I saw these gems listed at Sally&#x27;s for 4 times the price for 1/4 of the gems. Ordered on 2/18 and received on 3/6. Well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> i was at the nail salon yesterday. they have the exact same set just fewer but a little bigger stones. 45 dollars. this has a big amount for less then 10.</li>
            <li> good but they almost look like fake gold on kids clothes or toys but after adding them on my nails they look good. on time, new and good.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. I use them all the time. So many colors to choose from. I like it</li>
            <li> Each pocket has maybe 20 gems where as it looks like 100. &amp; the gems are really small. Its okay for the price but I expected 3000 gems. Its more like 500</li>
            <li> I was not expecting too much  with this  but I was impressed. Mine came in a round case which was no big deal. The gems are small enough to fit about 20 on one nail. I really  like the color assortment also.</li>
            <li> Picked these up just to practice nail designs on myself and a few of my friends. Not disappointed, especially for the price and the quantity. Now if I was a nail tech, that would be something different. Good buy for personal use.</li>
            <li> Wow I did not realize how tiny these little things were. But I did not pay much for them and it just takes some tweezers and glue and your good to go. Not sure on it being 3000 in the case, hard to say because they are so small. But it came way before it said it would so that is good!!! I recommend buying!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s 3k pieces, like the others all detail, but it comes in a really nice little box. Mine was very neat, the crystals all in the right parts, no mixing of crystals. They are really small and cute and apply very easily. Really glad i got these.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a friend. She loved it. She does nails all the time and it came to great use. Perfect packaging and perfect in time. No problems what so ever. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t help myself &amp; ordered 2 hehe&lt;br /&gt;*Shipping took around 2 weeks to receive but it&#x27;s okay because it&#x27;s free shipping :)&lt;br /&gt;*Condition nothing was broken however, one of the cases gems were spilled all over the little bag it came in BUT this happened because the case itself is made weird &amp; since it&#x27;s a long shipping distance there&#x27;s nothing the shippers could have done to avoid it :o&lt;br /&gt;*Over all product I LOVE IT! They&#x27;re little gems that you can use to decorate anything! They&#x27;re SUPER affordable! Instead of paying 10+ dollars for a similar case at a beauty supply store! :)&lt;br /&gt;I decorated the &amp;#34;13&amp;#34; on my gradation tassel it looked really nice :&#x27;)</li>
            <li> These came 2 weeks earlier than they were suppose to. So I was happy about that, There were a few loose rhinestones out side of the container but eh, it was no big deal. I just put them back in. The case seems kinda hard to open. I don&#x27;t know if its just the one that I got or if anyone else had one like this but yeah the little doors are a little hard to open. I mean I guess is a good thing since you know your rhinestones wont leak out. but its kinda annoying trying to get the rhinestones out. besides the container being a little annoying, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. Pretty color rhinestones. Will be using them for my nail art :)</li>
            <li> I did get a set with a tool to help me use it. But this is the same order with out the tool.</li>
            <li> I love these cute little gems.  They have different colors that fit almost all of my nail art designs.  It is one of the must have nail art accessories!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s alot for a little price! I just ordered more cuz I love it so much :)</li>
            <li> These gems are so colorful and has different shades of a color. They are the perfect size not too small and not too big.</li>
            <li> I received this item broken and the gems spilled into the package. It also did not contain 3000 gems it was more like a couple hundred. They also have a foggy color to them. You get what you pay for!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very much to say about these except they are awesome!! :) I used them on my nails for prom and got sooo many compliments on them:) I will warn you though, if you are planning on using them, I would strongly suggest a tweezers and magnifying glass! They are super hard to get ahold of,even with a tweezers!! But all-in-all, would definitely buy these again. I am so pleased! :)</li>
            <li> not just  for your fingernails.  can be used to make craft decorations with.  super cheap so it&#x27;s ok with kids too.</li>
            <li> i order this product on May 16, 2013. It said Your estimated delivery date is: Wednesday, June 12, 2013 - Friday, June 28, 2013. I got this product May 31, 2013. I&#x27;m very impressed its not even June yet and I have received it. Its pretty much what i expected it fits in the palm of your hand.. on the other hand i had no Idea it came with nail glue. There was glue and finger prints all over the container like someone has used it many times before. But you can&#x27;t beat the price I paid $1.67 So over all I&#x27;m very SATISFIED customer</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be huge it wasn&#x27;t but i guess you get what you pay for. The studs in my opinion are TOO DAMN SMALL but other wise ok.</li>
            <li> So, this states there are 3000 pieces, but I&#x27;m sure I don&#x27;t have more than 1000. Each color couldn&#x27;t be more than 50 or 60 gems. Also, mine didn&#x27;t come with different shapes. They are all the same small gem, just different colors. I guess buying these is a gamble...by some reviews they have different amounts of gems.</li>
            <li> I love these glitter nail dot...so cute and pretty and neat to wear...dependable to buy from...love the product..would recommend to others</li>
            <li> just like described. very colorful. Just need to know how to do it and a good amount of patience lol.</li>
            <li> what i got in the mail was not what was advertised. it was the same as this http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BF1M10/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o07_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only reason i ordered this one was for the case they were going to be coming in.</li>
            <li> Am just so uPset cause this is not what I order and had to spend so much money to take out something I did not want am very very upset</li>
            <li> I recommend this product and delivery is very good I made a lot of different designs thanks very much for your services</li>
            <li> The colors are great. I should have got a picker or something. too small for my fingers and long nails. awesome for a great price!</li>
            <li> got it fast and it&#x27;s been great for my nail art! I plan on using them again and telling my friends</li>
            <li> These are great for nail art. I love them. Small sized and perfect. Luv all the colors too. Will buy them again and again. The case is nice as it keeps all the beads separate too. Great product !!!</li>
            <li> So pretty. I just love all the colors and how there are different shapes like hearts and moons and stars.</li>
            <li> Nice set of stones for your nails. Makes at home manicures a little more special.</li>
            <li> best buy ever would order some more soon. the shippment was just in time i&#x27;ve used them all the time</li>
            <li> They are much smaller than I expected. However, the nail lady didn&#x27;t charge me as much. Because, I brought my own jewels. I hear that this is uncommon. So, ask first.</li>
            <li> This item is so pretty!!! I like the shinny a lot. If the box are full there were be even more fantastic. Love it anyway</li>
            <li> Bought these for my mother in law who loves doing her nails and all her grandkids nails. She loves them!</li>
            <li> Got this item to start doing my own nails at home. They are perfect. Would highly recommend this item to others.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE GEMS THEY ARE REALLY NICE. THE SIZE IS GREAT AND THE STORAGE BOX PORTABLE AND EASY TO CARRY</li>
            <li> I was expecting a little box of glitter. No these ate nail jems just like the nail studio has. I have been putting them on my daughter&#x27;s nails and they are great.</li>
            <li> shipping was quick and i love them perfect for the price ordering a few more was suprised at how many were in here aand so neat in the plastic container i love them</li>
            <li> A lot of the colors are pretty dull and there were no clear jems in my set. Some of the lids in the container do not want to open so I can&#x27;t even get to 4 of the colors. I&#x27;d spend the few extra dollars and get the good ones.</li>
            <li> I purchased my order about three weeks ago and just received it in a cute little package on the 13 for which I&#x27;m not complaining because I&#x27;m working my way towards other nail items before I even attempt to d&amp;eacute;cor my fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, they&#x27;re a really cute size and convienient size should you want to over decorate your nails with gem art. I&#x27;m looking forward to a fun creative experience.</li>
            <li> Very pretty colors. just a little hard to handle trying to get them put on.&lt;br /&gt;anyone that likes doing there nails would like them. would be nicer and easier if someone can do them for you.</li>
            <li> I really got this for the box, I like have the variety of plastic gems on hand, they are pretty small and great for using for customers on a large volume. they are not crystals or cut glass, so do not expect that.</li>
            <li> daughter uses this all the time.  seems to work just fine!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping item as described</li>
            <li> I should have brought multiple packs because I love these and when I do others nails the always want to use them so I need to buy more please come up with an even larger amount kit cause I would surely buy it!</li>
            <li> Came on time and love all the colors of the nail gems! Stay in pretty good and there is lots of them! However word to the wise... Don&#x27;t drop them...the top comes off very easily...I learned this the hard way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s 3000 in there, but there&#x27;s quite a few of each color, 12 different colors in all. I&#x27;m sure they are just like other gems you buy. But it was cheap and fast delivery. I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> My girls (10 and almost 14) love anything to do with nails! This was no exception. They loved them! You want to make sure and get the nice, pointy tweezers for these little things!</li>
            <li> These will make a cute little gift. You can&#x27;t beat he price which is why I even bought them. Came quick too.</li>
            <li> great color choices and there are a ton in the package! love that there is an organizer box so they dont end up in the bottom of my cart!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay over 6 dollars for them, so I am satisfied.  There isn&#x27;t 3000, but it is plenty to use for a while.  I started getting into doing my nails now that I am growing them out, and this is perfect. the delivery was fassttt! it came a couple days before the delivery date expected.</li>
            <li> Great product,  arrived sooner than expected.  Best deal I was able to find for these, and its great. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll like it. adding a little bling to your nails is great for the soul. you&#x27;ll feel pretty immediately. and the fact that there are so many and in ch beautiful colors is a pro.&lt;br /&gt;I just pick it with a tweezers and add a little clear nail polish as adhesive. that&#x27;s it. no great mystery or instructions. you can make lines, waves or even create designs.</li>
            <li> this was not at all what i expcted nor was it what is seemd on the page. if it had not been a gift i would have returned it</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying that I highly doubt there are actually 3000 rhinestones in this container. Especially since so many people have counted the gems, and found that there is significantly less. But i have to say, this product was cheap, so I wasn&#x27;t actually expecting 3000 to begin with.  However overall its good. The container is about 6&amp;#34; X 1.5&amp;#34; X 3/4&amp;#34; (i&#x27;m estimating bc i don&#x27;t have a ruler at hand). Each space/ cell is about as wide as my thumb (assuming i have an average sized hand, female in her twenties). And it contains the following colors: black, royal purple, salmon pink, emerald green, royal blue, hot pink/primrose-kind-of-color, yellow-gold, light green, light pink, silver, light purple/lilac, and red. The image showing the colors shows a light blue, and i did not receive that color, instead a got a a variation of a pink shade (which i&#x27;m fine with since I like pink better than blue anyway, and the pink i got that isn&#x27;t shown is really pretty, like a salmon pink color). Sorry for so much detail, but i figured I&#x27;d let you know everything that I would want to know too!</li>
            <li> This product is a great nail decal!  They stick on your nails and are very blingy.  I would definitely reccomend this!</li>
            <li> When I ordered,  I knew it was coming from China. In the past, anything I ordered from China took 3-4 weeks. But...seriously. ..it came in a week! I don&#x27;t know how...but I was thrilled! And they gems are cute...exactly what I ordered.  And for $1.50...it was a steal! You can&#x27;t get a better deal at any drugstore in the U.S. ...and they shipped it for free and fast.  I will order from these guys again!</li>
            <li> Really tiny little gems but i lovee them perfect for nail art i did my nails and they look beautiful, i love all the colors! Great buy! Fast shipping! awesome seller !! Thanks :)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected cute little rhinestones with every color it was a great purchase I should recommend any girl to buy one</li>
            <li> I love these little jewels, They got here before the estimated delivery. Still took about 3 or 4 weeks to get here but for about $1.50 I can&#x27;t really complain. These will add a little bling to any nail design! It says 3000 but I dont think that what is in the package is anywhere near that, But if i had bought this at the local sallys I would have paid probably at least $10 for what i got.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for and a great price for it. Would buy again with them. Thanks</li>
            <li> These little gems arrived before expected, and they look exactly as depicted in the 1st photo.  I paid $2.05 which included free shipping.  I agree with the other reviewers stating that there are less than 3000 pieces as advertised, but I took that into consideration before ordering.  There are definitely 100+ gems, all the same tiny size, for each of the 12 colors… I would say 1500+ pieces.  Regardless, this is a nice bargain compared to what you would pay in a Sally’s store, etc, for a similar product.  I would purchase again for this price.</li>
            <li> It look a long time but came well package. Some stone came out the box but it was ok. I guess.</li>
            <li> i ordered these on april 1st, i was supposed to get them between April 25th and may 1st or something like that. well i recieved them April 17th. i culdnt wait to open them and see how they look.. THEYRE AMAZING!!! i love the case that it comes in as well. theyre perfect for my nails.. yes i already used some. i would definitely recommend this product to anyone who loves to do nail art like me but at the same time is willing to wait about 2 weeks for them to come in the mail. :)</li>
            <li> i did some pretty neat designs with just the clear gems. i can&#x27;t wait to mix it up with the different colors.</li>
            <li> Got my item a week before the earliest projected delivery date.  I would guess there are 250 in each color.  For the price totally worth it, checked Sally&#x27;s and way more expensive.  They are small (look up 2mm if you are not sure of the size) so they would be discreet.  You can make a pretty flower with 6 rhinestones.  The container is awesome, portable, secure and there are 12 colors!!  Magenta, gold, violet, orange, green, teal, pink, clear, blue, black, red and lavender.  Have not used them yet.</li>
            <li> my granddaughter loves it</li>
            <li> i love these stones they look so nice and enhances nail designes. they are just the right size and colors too for cute summer designs.</li>
            <li> Very happy with how fast I received my shipment. The case is small but I like it because it fits perfectly into my nail bag. It brought all those colors and they are very cute!</li>
            <li> I ordered this nail art gems thinking it would be super small based on a few of the reviews, but it&#x27;s the perfect size. It comes with a decent amount of gems and the gems are very durable and they last  a long time. They come in a good variety of colors which is great.</li>
            <li> Okay so I was looking for these little rhinestones and Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply wanted around $10.00 for a little wheel with around 100 stones in it. Then I came across this! The colors are great, they are easy to apply (if you have the nail dotting tool or a toothpick) and they last if you know how to apply rhinestones to nails.</li>
            <li> Bought this for Grand daughter who is starting apprentice nail tech. She loves them and states she will use them in her learning table.</li>
            <li> This is a remarkable deal for those who like to add some bling to anything.  I am amazed at the quality and quanitity of all the colors.</li>
            <li> Considering the price of this product, I didn&#x27;t expect anything. But, I was surprised to find when the product arrived, it met my expectations. These nail gems are wonderful and very useful. I apply a thin top coat, then put the gem on and apply another thin layer of top coat on top of the gem. The gems stay on for a very long time this way. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys decorations on their nails!</li>
            <li> These are exactly as advertised. Small, cute gems to stay on nails. They do not fall off. They&#x27;re in a variety of colors and great product.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails, love the colors their awesome jewels... thanks a lot love them will buy more soon</li>
            <li> They allow total control of the design . The design is made prettier by the many different colors and variations of the different types of designs that can be made.</li>
            <li> Perfect for nail art and I love all the different colors. I will definitely be buying this same product when I run out.</li>
            <li> The gems arrived 3 weeks before the promised arrival date.  The price was good.  The drawback?  These are all round gems.  There are no other shapes in the box.  I was hoping for stars and hearts.... Oh Well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and all different colors but it only comes with about 900 gems not 3000 but for the price it&#x27;s still nice.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter - she paints her nails constantly. They came in in about 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There appeared to be a large amount of the gems in the container and the gems were sorted. The colors were bright and pretty. The container closes well. I will probably buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> I love theses gems! I just do my nails at home and these worked out perfectly. The only thing was, I didn&#x27;t get why the picture shows, I received a round holder for the gems, not the long container like it shows. But I still love them.</li>
            <li> The nail art gems are small enough to be discreet but big enough to draw attention to your nails. They will help you get that professionally manicured look on your nails. I love the variety of colors.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used them yet but i gave them 3 stars because they don&#x27;t look bad.&lt;br /&gt;plenty of colors. and they are really small so they should look cute on the nails rather than the big bulky jewels.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how well they stay on but i will update my review once i get around to using them</li>
