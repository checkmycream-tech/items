            <li>My lips feel so good after wearing this all day, but it looks as good as lipstick!  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like putting on lipstick, but you don&#x27;t need a mirror because it&#x27;s really just chapstick.  </li>
            <li>Nutmeg is no longer available in stores, so I bought a 4-pack.</li>

            <li>I have only recently tried this product and it is amazing!!</li>

            <li> I get dry lips all year long, so I always have one of these in my pocket.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super sad that this color is being discontinued!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other product on my lips!</li>
            <li> but it is not very strong</li>

            <li> Nutmeg is my favorite BB lip shimmer.  Too bad they discontinued the shade.</li>
            <li> I love burt&#x27;s bees and I was very upset when they stopped making the nutmeg.  Now I think I like the caramel better!  I am glad to have both and love this lip shimmer!</li>
            <li> I like Burt Bees products, this is a nice balm with added color. I can smell the coloring which I don&#x27;t care for the smell but it is not very strong so I can tolerate it. It does help the lips and makes them feel good and fell softer.</li>
            <li> Burt Bees lip shimmer is translucent and has menthol in it.  I like the way it feels like healing lip balm while still giving a little gloss and color.  The nutmeg shade looks natural with my skin tone.  Does not look like heavy makeup or lipstick.  Nice.</li>
            <li> I have been using these \\&quot;shimmer\\&quot; gloss for several years and I loved the color \\&quot;Papaya\\&quot;.  They have replaced it with \\&quot;Cherry\\&quot;, not bad but I liked Papaya better.  These are so slim you can carry one in your pocket easily.

            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is an incredibly moisturizing lip balm/shimmer/gloss!  Usually anything this moisturizing does not have the amount of color that this has.  My lips feel so good after wearing this all day, but it looks as good as lipstick!  It isn&#x27;t sticky or smell bad like a lot of lip glosses, either.  It has no taste (no strawberry, for example).  I think I am one of the last holdouts to try Burt&#x27;s Bees, but now I am a believer!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s bees are the best products.&lt;br /&gt;This particular color I was having a hard time finding at Wegman&#x27;s after a while (colors maybe rotate?)&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was a tad pricey - but it was a BOX of 4 - so great!&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t stay on a s long as lipstick, but have a really nice color - not too sheer. Best ingredients - copare with whatever&#x27;s in your purse. . . . . . great for kids too.</li>
            <li> PLEASE Bring this color back!  It is the only lipstick that looks good on me!</li>
            <li> Just the right color for me, right amount of gloss, not sticky, nice thin size for small purse or pocket.</li>
            <li> Everybody is different. These colors are individualistic and work for some not others. This was a new color and it is not an out there color, it is a nice everyday color. Here in AZ you have to have something on your lips all the time or else they crack.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Burts Bees Shimmer in Nutmeg for years now.  I have very fair skin, and a co-worker of mine has olive skin, and we both think this is the perfect color!  I&#x27;ve recently started wearing Burts Bees Champagne Lip Shimmer over Nutmeg, and the effect is just lovely.    The Burts Bees lip products are very moisturizing, and I wear them daily.</li>
            <li> I have only recently tried this product and it is amazing!! Love the feel of it and just the right amount of color. Wish I had tried sooner.</li>
            <li> I love this lip shimmer and the color (nutmeg) is really hard to find in the stores. The color is subtle and the lip gloss keeps your lips moist.</li>
            <li> This is the only color i found to work for me, and it&#x27;s absolutely PERFECT. I know i&#x27;m not the only one who&#x27;s upset they discontinued it. It&#x27;s such a natural shade, and it makes your lips look simply pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BURT&#x27;S BEES, PLEASE BRING NUTMEG BACK!</li>
            <li> Nice sheer color with conditioners of a lip balm/chapstick in one.  Nice cooling for already sunburnt or wind chapped lips.</li>
            <li> Love this &amp;#34;chapstick&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s kind of like putting on lipstick, but you don&#x27;t need a mirror because it&#x27;s really just chapstick.  Nutmeg is no longer available in stores, so I bought a 4-pack.</li>

            <li> The stores in our area no longer carry this shade and it&#x27;s always been one of my favorite. Glad I could find it here!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this crew product for years.  My son loves it too.  I work with it on my clients.</li>
            <li> Since discovering this product, I haven&#x27;t worn lipstick.  It&#x27;s a terrific product, but unfortunately Burt&#x27;s Bees no longer makes the nutmeg color.  I have tried other colors that look close, but nothing looks as good on me.  I have bought several tubes of this discontinued color on-line and will be very disappointed when the time comes that stocks have been depleted.</li>
            <li> I bought these for Christmas gifts. i love the Burt&#x27;s Bees products. All natural ingredients. The color was very neutral and can be worn by women with different skin tones.</li>
            <li> Keeps my lips feeling healthy, soft, and hydrated! All the colors are great...subtle and natural looking. I don&#x27;t use any other product on my lips!</li>
