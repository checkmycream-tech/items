    <ol>
            <li>If you do this the product if great!  </li>
            <li>sharpest and best nail clipper i have ever had</li>
            <li>If you have the money and you like having the best</li>
            <li>Excellent quality and a good price</li>
            <li>Great for travel given the size.    </li>
            <li>The Nail clippers were a great choice.  </li>
            <li>I have another Zwilling J.A Henckels nail clipper which I bought in Germany and still works great after 5 years</li>
            <li>The ingenious design in terms of how this clipper opens and closes/folds up is impressive.</li>
            <li>I even use the included nail file, and it works surprisingly well.  </li>
            <li>Loved the look and the ultra slim design and was going to throw it in an altoids kit for EDC.  </li>
            <li>Easily my favorite nail clipper I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing nail clipper.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have the heft or balance to be used effectively.</li>
            <li>When you are done using them, they basically fold into themself and there is a nice leather holde to store them in.  </li>
            <li>worked up about it, but it would be a nice addition to the clippers</li>
            <li>worked up about it, but it would be a nice addition to the clippers</li>
            <li>It puts a nice crease in your nail....</li>
            <li>The leather case isn&#x27;t too great, as it slips right out ALL the time, but the clipper is so good, I can&#x27;t give it 4 stars for the case.</li>
            <li>I cuts my nails very easy.  </li>
            <li>They are clearly made in China but still the best clippers ever.</li>
            <li>They arrived a day early and are perfect.  </li>
            <li>, I have ordered several of these wonderful nail clippers as gifts for friends and family, and they all love them.  </li>
            <li>not believe paid a lot of money for a clipper from most famous clipper brand but get a sharp-but-nothing-else clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>This is the best nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever used, and it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve kept for years instead of weeks.</li>
            <li>What they can&#x27;t understand is how much better these are over those eighty nine cent gas station/convenience/drug store clippers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>The Henckels Ultra-Slim clippers simply do a better job, and look better doing it.</li>
            <li>The Henckels Ultra-Slim clippers simply do a better job, and look better doing it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this thing.  </li>
            <li>I like the size and interesting looks of the clipper and case.  </li>
            <li>no doubt, extremely sharp with a well conceived curve to assure maximum length minimum in-cut, nice easthetic transversal grooves, a smart locking system and a nicely conceived elegantly crafted leather slim suite has every ingredient to be a winning design despite the fact of two fairly noticeable flaws;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Zwilling J.A. Henkels nail clipper is a beautiful item, brushed SS</li>
            <li>Being a proud American, I wouldn&#x27;t have read them anyway.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them during the past year and they are great!  </li>
            <li>Despite other reviewers problems, these work great for me, It took a while to work out how to get them to work correctly, but once I did it was easy</li>
            <li>The design is neat and clean, just like your nails will be.  </li>
            <li>Why not make it as pleasant of an experience as possible?  </li>
            <li>very good cutting edge, sleek , good carrying case, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I can now power through my nails in no time, and all of the nails stay right where I clipped them for easy cleanup.  </li>
            <li>Who ever thought that nail clippers could be cool?  </li>
            <li>I love a well made product and this really fits that bill.</li>
            <li>The blades themselves are very sharp and as a whole the design and material is top-notch.</li>
            <li>After looking at what was available here on Amazon, I settled on the Henckels Ultra-Slim clippers, largely because of the sleek design and the reputation of the manufacturer in kitchen cutlery.</li>
            <li>I am now contemplating purchasing a second set to insure I always have this great and vitally necessary grooming accessory available.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money, I would purchase another one.</li>
            <li>They were right about the nice sharp blade.  </li>
            <li>Keep the second one in a safe.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve carried nail clippers with me daily, for most of my life.</li>
            <li>Henckels clippers simply cut better.</li>
            <li>despite this issues, on my professional opinion this nail clipper is a nice addition to any man&#x27;s personal grooming kit, despite the price.</li>
            <li>People often gave me funny looks when they heard about how much those clippers cost.  </li>
            <li>These clippers folded flat, and were made from a better quality of steel - with a stainless finish, rather than chrome-plated.</li>
            <li>I expected this to be a very finely crafted tool, the finest example of a nail clipper.</li>
            <li>These are simply better, they make a clean cut quietly and they fold up smaller than any</li>
            <li>It is good for anyone who has hard nails and large fingers.</li>
            <li>Great thin clipper.  </li>
            <li>Does an excellent job cutting.  </li>
            <li>but there are really nothing equivalent to these that I can find in a brick and mortar store.  </li>
            <li>but once you do, they work really well.  </li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it is square so its very efficient from a space standpoint.  </li>
            <li>Shipping from the seller was fast.  </li>
            <li>When paying so much for nail clippers you expect the biting motion to be sm</li>
            <li>I really like them.  </li>
            <li>only thing I miss is a some kind of spot for a key ring.</li>
            <li>Had a better pair I bought in Germany - thesre don&#x27;t even come closeto matching my old ones, especially what I was charged for them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s both a nail clipper and a fun toy that could provide hours of entertainment for the right individual.</li>
            <li>Then 2 weeks later, I find the original set that I thought were lost.  </li>
            <li>Whereas standard clippers provide constant tension between the thumb and finger, this folding design means that the clipping handle can easily slide out of place if not held right, changing the tension if used at arm&#x27;s length.</li>
            <li>They have never experienced the incredible relief of surgical precision to remove hangnails that only these clippers and their ilk deliver.  </li>
            <li>My advice either you buy the real thing &amp;#34;made in Germany&amp;#34; or don&#x27;t waste your money, you are better of with a CVS Nail Clipper maybe not as fancy but no doubt, for sure it would definitely outperform this Chinese one.</li>
            <li>and I think that they will most likely last me until I lose them.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The leather pouch is a nice touch and even with it, these are thin enough that they could easily be carried in a wallet.</li>
            <li>My old clippers included a tool to clean under my nails and/or push back the cuticle.</li>
            <li>In the meantime when I had to use my old clippers, I really missed these.  </li>
            <li>First, these clippers have a really neat design for all you personal hygiene geeks out there.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if these clippers are quite worth their price, but I definitely don&#x27;t regret purchasing them.</li>
            <li>Is there possibly some other clippers that do the same great job for cheaper, possibly...  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy this because it wasn&#x27;t an exact duplicate of the J.A.Henckels nail clipper I had been using for the last 3 decades ever since receiving one for christmas.  </li>
            <li>The old design was fantastic but eventually broke in the same key area each time.  </li>
            <li>Not a safe place, in a SAFE.</li>
            <li>It is super sharp as described.</li>
            <li>They still remain super sharp.  </li>
            <li>the old clipper has lost its sharpness over time.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are different from the older models.  </li>
            <li>small to handle, and the press part is not always fit well.&lt;br /&gt;Can</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, it&#x27;s a small portlable clippers, I like the case that they comes with, after first use</li>
            <li>And best of all, it is small and compact and folds away without damaging the cutting edges.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is clearly a product where the designer put an enormous amount of thought into how to blend form and function into a tool that looks like it would be at home in the glove box of a Porche or a Ferrari.</li>
            <li>They were a marked improvement, but still not the kind of precision cutting instrument that I wanted.</li>
            <li>And the design is about 1/3 thinner than my previous favorite, making for a clipper so small, I&#x27;ve taken to carrying it in the supplied leather sleeve, just to avoid inadvertently misplacing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always frustrated with cheap clippers that don&#x27;t make a clean cut.</li>
            <li>The other clippers leave my nails sharp  with a rough jagged edge but these cut smooth.</li>
            <li>At first, these were a little strange to use, but I eventually got the hang of it and now using them is quite a pleasure.  </li>

            <li> At first, these were a little strange to use, but I eventually got the hang of it and now using them is quite a pleasure.  </li>
            <li> Maybe their nails are soft, unlike my diamond-hard, carbon steel sharp phalanges daggers.  </li>
            <li> Once I figured out how to open the device and engage the clipping action, the ingenuity of the design had me forgetting all about the previous incarnation.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and they don&#x27;t cut well, or last a long time.</li>
            <li> And save one, small tradeoff, it&#x27;s an order of magnitude better than my older clippers (which I did eventually find, enabling me to make a side-by-side comparison of the cutting ability of the tools).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Uneven top to bottom cutting action.</li>
            <li> Only time will tell if this one will stay as sharp.</li>
            <li> One was supposed to be smaller than the other.  </li>
            <li> The clipper itself was thinner than I expected.</li>
            <li> It is also a piece of art, it is so thin and modern looking,</li>
            <li> The nail clips off without any rough edges, eliminating the need for a file.  </li>
            <li> However, these clippers are quite small and given the loose sliding mechanism, should be advertised as fingernail clippers only.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase some expensive finger nail clippers, but clipping my nails is one of my least favorite things.  </li>
            <li> Sharp, fits in my pocket (which is helping me kick my nail-biting habit), and doesn&#x27;t send nail clips flying.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is good for anyone who has hard nails and large fingers. It is super sharp as described. For me as small fingers, it can cut nail too deep and difficult to apply for your foot nail.</li>
            <li> First, these clippers have a really neat design for all you personal hygiene geeks out there. The ingenious design in terms of how this clipper opens and closes/folds up is impressive. It&#x27;s both a nail clipper and a fun toy that could provide hours of entertainment for the right individual. Great for travel given the size.    The blades themselves are very sharp and as a whole the design and material is top-notch. However, these clippers are quite small and given the loose sliding mechanism, should be advertised as fingernail clippers only. For toes, this item just won&#x27;t cut it (pun intended). Whereas standard clippers provide constant tension between the thumb and finger, this folding design means that the clipping handle can easily slide out of place if not held right, changing the tension if used at arm&#x27;s length. For fingers this isn&#x27;t a problem, but with toes it&#x27;s difficult to keep the handle in the correct position for accurate cutting. You were warned.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and a good price, I have ordered several of these wonderful nail clippers as gifts for friends and family, and they all love them.  Keep one in your purse of toiletry bag at all times!</li>
            <li> Sharp, fits in my pocket (which is helping me kick my nail-biting habit), and doesn&#x27;t send nail clips flying.  Easily my favorite nail clipper I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> I read several review about this fancy clipper.&lt;br /&gt;After made a decision to buy this one as a gift for my friend&lt;br /&gt;I thought I will get a same package like others.&lt;br /&gt;End up got a poor plastic pack with a clipper inside.&lt;br /&gt;Make me think the cost down of packing maybe happen to clipper itself as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try to use the one I bought for myself.&lt;br /&gt;It did not work as describe like other review.&lt;br /&gt;Too small to handle, and the press part is not always fit well.&lt;br /&gt;Can not believe paid a lot of money for a clipper from most famous clipper brand but get a sharp-but-nothing-else clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regret to buy that.</li>
            <li> The clipper arrive on time (amazon prime delivery. Packaging was sufficient, a bubble wrapped envelope. It was also quite hard to remove the clipper from its plastic packaging.    The clipper itself was thinner than I expected. It is almost twice as thin as my old Zwilling clipper. It is also very sharp, sharper than my previous one(perhaps the old clipper has lost its sharpness over time.) Only time will tell if this one will stay as sharp.</li>
            <li> The Zwilling J.A. Henkels nail clipper is a beautiful item, brushed SS 304L no doubt, extremely sharp with a well conceived curve to assure maximum length minimum in-cut, nice easthetic transversal grooves, a smart locking system and a nicely conceived elegantly crafted leather slim suite has every ingredient to be a winning design despite the fact of two fairly noticeable flaws;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The leaf spring system is a little bit awkward and difficult to maintain in place while in operation, making it a little bit risky taking into account the sharpness of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;2) The locking system is a little bit loose and tricky to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But despite this issues, on my professional opinion this nail clipper is a nice addition to any man&#x27;s personal grooming kit, despite the price.</li>
            <li> Great thin clipper.  Does an excellent job cutting.  Reviews saying otherwise must not understand how it works.  Simple if you do it correctly.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase some expensive finger nail clippers, but clipping my nails is one of my least favorite things.  Why not make it as pleasant of an experience as possible?  At first, these were a little strange to use, but I eventually got the hang of it and now using them is quite a pleasure.  I learned that you have to clip, then tap out the nail, then clip.  If you let the clippings stay in the clipper, it won&#x27;t work well.  I can now power through my nails in no time, and all of the nails stay right where I clipped them for easy cleanup.  I even use the included nail file, and it works surprisingly well.  I don&#x27;t know if these clippers are quite worth their price, but I definitely don&#x27;t regret purchasing them.</li>
            <li> The Nail clippers were a great choice.  They were right about the nice sharp blade.  I cuts my nails very easy.  The negative part is that you have to turn the clippers to the side to empty the clippings every other nail or it get jammed up.  If you do this the product if great!  I Recommend it.  It is also a piece of art, it is so thin and modern looking,</li>
            <li> Sharp, compact , however the cutting mechanism is awkward.</li>
            <li> I love these. I&#x27;m always frustrated with cheap clippers that don&#x27;t make a clean cut. And nicer clippers make a clean cut but make an annoying click noise and throw your clippings half way across the room. These are simply better, they make a clean cut quietly and they fold up smaller than any other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I miss is a some kind of spot for a key ring. Still giving them 5 stars though, and probably buying a few as gifts this year.</li>
            <li> I purchased two clippers from two different vendors.  One was supposed to be smaller than the other.  They were both identical but advertised differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are different from the older models.  They are clearly made in China but still the best clippers ever.</li>
            <li> sharpest and best nail clipper i have ever had</li>
            <li> very good cutting edge, sleek , good carrying case, easy to use. Worth the money, I would purchase another one.</li>
            <li> Had a better pair I bought in Germany - thesre don&#x27;t even come closeto matching my old ones, especially what I was charged for them.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever used, and it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve kept for years instead of weeks. The leather case isn&#x27;t too great, as it slips right out ALL the time, but the clipper is so good, I can&#x27;t give it 4 stars for the case.</li>
            <li> I expected this to be a very finely crafted tool, the finest example of a nail clipper. What I got was a poorly constructed piece of junk. It also doesn&#x27;t have the heft or balance to be used effectively. I have gone back to using my $8 clipper purchased at the local drug store.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, it&#x27;s a small portlable clippers, I like the case that they comes with, after first use I have realized how sharp they&#x27;re.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this because it wasn&#x27;t an exact duplicate of the J.A.Henckels nail clipper I had been using for the last 3 decades ever since receiving one for christmas.  The old design was fantastic but eventually broke in the same key area each time.  People often gave me funny looks when they heard about how much those clippers cost.  What they can&#x27;t understand is how much better these are over those eighty nine cent gas station/convenience/drug store clippers.  They have never experienced the incredible relief of surgical precision to remove hangnails that only these clippers and their ilk deliver.  Maybe their nails are soft, unlike my diamond-hard, carbon steel sharp phalanges daggers.  These clippers came in, sans instructions.  Being a proud American, I wouldn&#x27;t have read them anyway.  Once I figured out how to open the device and engage the clipping action, the ingenuity of the design had me forgetting all about the previous incarnation.  I am now contemplating purchasing a second set to insure I always have this great and vitally necessary grooming accessory available.  *edit* as luck would have it, I thought I lost my set of clippers, so I went ahead and bought another set.  Am I crazy?  Maybe but there are really nothing equivalent to these that I can find in a brick and mortar store.  They arrived a day early and are perfect.  Then 2 weeks later, I find the original set that I thought were lost.  Now I have two sets.  Do yourself a favor, buy 2.  Keep the second one in a safe.  Not a safe place, in a SAFE.</li>
            <li> My wife thought I was crazy to spend so much on \\&quot;just clippers\\&quot;.    I&#x27;ve used them during the past year and they are great!  They still remain super sharp.  No flying nails to lodge in your seat, or carpet, or.....  you get the idea.  The design is neat and clean, just like your nails will be.  There is a small file built in that does the job in a pinch.  The leather pouch is a nice touch and even with it, these are thin enough that they could easily be carried in a wallet.</li>
            <li> Who ever thought that nail clippers could be cool?  These are nifty.  It does take a moment to figure out how they work but once you do, they work really well.  When you are done using them, they basically fold into themself and there is a nice leather holde to store them in.  I love a well made product and this really fits that bill.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing nail clipper.  The nail clips off without any rough edges, eliminating the need for a file.  And best of all, it is small and compact and folds away without damaging the cutting edges.  The previous version of this clipper also did the same thing, just that the cutting edges moved ever so slightly out of alignment when folding away to prevent damage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve carried nail clippers with me daily, for most of my life. In the beginning, I&#x27;d carry the kind you can buy at any supermarket - cheap, chrome-plated things that are fairly bulky, ugly, and not something you mind terribly, should you lose them. Oh, and they don&#x27;t cut well, or last a long time. As I began to travel, I discovered cutlery shops, and the clippers made by companies that actually cared about design. These clippers folded flat, and were made from a better quality of steel - with a stainless finish, rather than chrome-plated. They were a marked improvement, but still not the kind of precision cutting instrument that I wanted. After misplacing a pair of clippers I&#x27;d carried for almost 20 years, I went looking for a replacement. Sadly, the model I owned was no longer made. After looking at what was available here on Amazon, I settled on the Henckels Ultra-Slim clippers, largely because of the sleek design and the reputation of the manufacturer in kitchen cutlery. I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is clearly a product where the designer put an enormous amount of thought into how to blend form and function into a tool that looks like it would be at home in the glove box of a Porche or a Ferrari. And save one, small tradeoff, it&#x27;s an order of magnitude better than my older clippers (which I did eventually find, enabling me to make a side-by-side comparison of the cutting ability of the tools).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Henckels clippers simply cut better. The difference in feel is much like the difference between cutting through a well-done steak versus a stick of butter. It&#x27;s that dramatic. And the design is about 1/3 thinner than my previous favorite, making for a clipper so small, I&#x27;ve taken to carrying it in the supplied leather sleeve, just to avoid inadvertently misplacing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned one trade-off. My old clippers included a tool to clean under my nails and/or push back the cuticle. The Henckels clippers are not so-equipped. Given the minimalist form-factor, I&#x27;m not sure where they would have put this, or how it could be integrated into the tool, so I&#x27;m not too worked up about it, but it would be a nice addition to the clippers, should they figure out how to add it without ruining the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold. The Henckels Ultra-Slim clippers simply do a better job, and look better doing it. And at prices that are comparable to their competitors, you won&#x27;t pay a premium for the additional quality.e they would have put this, or how it could be integrated into the tool, so I&#x27;m not too worked up about it, but it would be a nice addition to the clippers, should they figure out how to add it without ruining the design.

            <li> I wanted to love this thing.  I hate not having a nail clipper.  Loved the look and the ultra slim design and was going to throw it in an altoids kit for EDC.  I also like the fact that it is square so its very efficient from a space standpoint.  Got it out of the packaging and tried it out on my thumb nail....no dice.  The two baldes do not touch when the clipper is fully depressed.  It puts a nice crease in your nail....but it woldnt cut them.  Returned it disappointed.  Shipping from the seller was fast.  No complaints there.</li>
            <li> Worst nail clipper ever, instead of clipping the nails it would just bite them, all the pieces were very poorly assembled, it ended up in the trash can after just 5 minutes of receiving it. I have another Zwilling J.A Henckels nail clipper which I bought in Germany and still works great after 5 years so I decided to get an extra one. My advice either you buy the real thing &amp;#34;made in Germany&amp;#34; or don&#x27;t waste your money, you are better of with a CVS Nail Clipper maybe not as fancy but no doubt, for sure it would definitely outperform this Chinese one.</li>
            <li> Uneven top to bottom cutting action. When paying so much for nail clippers you expect the biting motion to be sm</li>
            <li> I like the size and interesting looks of the clipper and case.  However, after using them, they leave nails rather sharp and in need of some tune-up with a file or whatever.  I didn&#x27;t expect that with a nail clipper set this expensive.</li>
            <li> 1 out of 3 don&#x27;t work I don&#x27;t recommend it at all</li>
            <li> Despite other reviewers problems, these work great for me, It took a while to work out how to get them to work correctly, but once I did it was easy and they worked well</li>
            <li> What can I say about these expensive little clippers?  I really like them.  Is there possibly some other clippers that do the same great job for cheaper, possibly...  But I don&#x27;t regret buying these... If you have the money and you like having the best then I reccomend them.  I&#x27;ve been using them for about a year and I think that they will most likely last me until I lose them.  They fold up so small that I have thought I lost them twice only to have them turn up again.  In the meantime when I had to use my old clippers, I really missed these.  The other clippers leave my nails sharp  with a rough jagged edge but these cut smooth.</li>
