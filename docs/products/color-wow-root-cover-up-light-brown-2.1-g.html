            <li>Have tried many root cover ups.</li>

            <li>Easy to use.</li>

            <li>Accurate timing with accurate item as described</li>
            <li>I ordered the light brown which blended well with my hair color and the highlighting.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I got the light brown Color</li>

            <li>It works brilliantly and isn&#x27;t a mess!</li>
            <li>This goes on easily and blends in very well.</li>
            <li>And I have found that a light dusting on my eyebrows is a better and more natural look than most other products devoted to eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Good product, natural looking to use in-between professional coloring.</li>
            <li>Worth the expense.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more natural and&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>This is worth the money.</li>
            <li>The color blended right in with my reddish hair with blond highlights.  </li>
            <li>that happens and this covers it right</li>
            <li>Could put a lot more product in compact which would last alot longer.</li>
            <li>I just used this product for the first time this morning</li>
            <li>Wow did a fantastic job covering it.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely buy it again when I need more.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well on regrowth at my temples and forehead because the skin underneath takes on the color.</li>
            <li>stays in place pretty well, and doesn&#x27;t rub off on pillows, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>We need a color in between blonde and brown.  :)</li>
            <li>Product did exactly as it said it would.  </li>
            <li>it really works, Choose right your color.</li>
            <li>I really like Color</li>
            <li>Sticky and doesn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li>I had to really struggle to get coverage with this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend--it worked for me!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried two or three products and really like this one.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this now!</li>
            <li>This is highly recommended if you color your hair.  </li>
            <li>This one really works and looks natural.</li>
            <li>My hair is more of an ash brown color with some blonde highlights that covers a lot of grey.  </li>
            <li>I use it to fill in thinning hairline and to cover new grays in between coloring.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found a new use for the color.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Light Brown&amp;#34; is actually a dark, muddy brown powder that easily stains your scalp and completely misses the roots.  </li>
            <li>Ordered light but what I received was really dark.  </li>
            <li>This looks natural!</li>
            <li>The medium brown was more like dark black/brown in my opinion and the light brown is rather dark as well, which I opted for since the next lightest choice is blond looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty much what I expected.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes a huge mess and doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>My hair has thinned considerably and this helps to make it look fuller.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>No mess and no rubbing off.  </li>
            <li>Bar none, there is no other product that surpasses this.  </li>
            <li>When I applied it, I did notice some transfer of the powder onto my fingers, so just be careful not to use too much when applying to your roots.</li>
            <li>Even though just used on my part, there was a little rub off on my pillow that washed right out--</li>
            <li>Much easier than any other product I have used over the years.</li>
            <li>I had to put so much of the powder on the brush in order to cover the grey and it didn&#x27;t last as long as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I was a little concerned whether it really works.  </li>

            <li> my hair grows very fast so, the gray appears in two weeks and a half!!</li>
            <li> Wow which looks really dark but somehow blends in well with my hair color.  </li>
            <li> The last time I colored my hair was 6 weeks ago, so I had some visible grey re-growth and Color</li>
            <li> I apply it following a blow dry and styling.  </li>
            <li> I have found other color powered compacts that are way less expensive and give a more natural appearance.</li>
            <li> It covers grey and also covers the areas where my hair is thinning and you can see my scalp.</li>
            <li> simple to use, and it performs as expected</li>
            <li> I am really grey, and I have looked for something that helps me get through my color appointments.  </li>
            <li> Wish I bought a long time ago!</li>
            <li> Your hair has to be dry to use it.  </li>
            <li> I just checked my roots in the harsh fluorescent lights in the ladies&#x27; room at work and it looks similar to when I get my roots done at the salon, so I am hoping this product will save me money in the long run by extending the time between salon visits.</li>
            <li> The brush is definitely usable with one small side and one larger side.</li>
            <li> For the little amount of pressed powder it is more practical to use Toppik or Caboki for coverage and less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I read some of the negative reviews regarding Color Wow before ordering so</li>
            <li> It seems to cover the skin under my hair, but not really the hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky like some other products and it stays on all day.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have a Sally Beauty Supply nearby or other beauty supply store, check on Drugstore.com.</li>
            <li> and i dont want to dye my hear so frequently,, with this product, I can manage a week or  more!!!does not feel or look greasy or fake, as other products do,  </li>
            <li> So, in an area where I puff my hair up a little (the crown) it doesn&#x27;t cover re-growth.  </li>
            <li> I use it on the part in my hair and in a few areas around my face.  </li>
            <li> so this is extending the time between hair colorings by a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to have my roots colored every three weeks</li>
            <li> Lasts for a day or so but not more.</li>
            <li> Really hard to use makes spots rather then</li>
            <li> It was hard to figure out what color to buy, but online hints helped.  </li>
            <li> but I am a little confused about it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too pasty, has a weird sheen and is expensive.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t cover the gray at all :(.</li>
            <li> I hate</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s too pasty, has a weird sheen and is expensive. I have found other color powered compacts that are way less expensive and give a more natural appearance.</li>
            <li> Wow is a perfect name for this product as that is what I said the first time I used it. Really works well, can be applied quickly and great for travel.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t cover the gray at all :(.</li>
            <li> this is great for in between colorings...</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly and goes on easily. Does the trick for root cover. It even stays on after the shower. Great product.</li>
            <li> My hair has thinned considerably and this helps to make it look fuller.  I apply it following a blow dry and styling.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Could put a lot more product in compact which would last alot longer. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> It splatters a lot and it does covers up but does not stay on like it shows it doe on the commercial.</li>
            <li> I ordered the light brown which blended well with my hair color and the highlighting. This product is a powdery consistency like eye shadow. Even though just used on my part, there was a little rub off on my pillow that washed right out--no staining. Good product, natural looking to use in-between professional coloring.</li>
            <li> this is the best buy for me !!! my hair grows very fast so, the gray appears in two weeks and a half!! and i dont want to dye my hear so frequently,, with this product, I can manage a week or  more!!!does not feel or look greasy or fake, as other products do,  it really works, Choose right your color. and that is it. My hair is light brown and it works perfectly!!</li>
            <li> Love! Love! Love! Can&#x27;t live without this now! I use it to fill in thinning hairline and to cover new grays in between coloring.  It works brilliantly and isn&#x27;t a mess!</li>
            <li> I just used this product for the first time this morning and I am very impressed. The last time I colored my hair was 6 weeks ago, so I had some visible grey re-growth and Color Wow did a fantastic job covering it.

            <li> This product is so easy to use and covers amazingly well.  The color blended right in with my reddish hair with blond highlights.  I am delighted with it.  I usually have to have my roots colored every three weeks and this will allow me to postpone another week.</li>
            <li> Have tried many root cover ups. This one really works and looks natural. Worth the expense.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  I have bought several of these since they came out and will continue its usage.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes a huge mess and doesn&#x27;t work.  Period.</li>
            <li> I really like Color Wow. It covers grey and also covers the areas where my hair is thinning and you can see my scalp. I hate&lt;br /&gt;When that happens and this covers it right up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found a new use for the color. It&#x27;s my favorite so far. I have tried everything to cover my thinning brows&lt;br /&gt;from pencils to creams. Using a good brush and Color Wow is the best result yet. It&#x27;s more natural and&lt;br /&gt;Easy and fast!&lt;br /&gt;I will be talking about this on my blog. Savvyshopperreviews.com  Check it out!</li>
            <li> This product is a powder, like eye shadow. It covers well and lasts all day. The brush is definitely usable with one small side and one larger side. My only problem with this product is the color choices. I have medium brown hair with some blond-ish and red undertones.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this from a store so while I was there I could open the package and see all the color choices. The medium brown was more like dark black/brown in my opinion and the light brown is rather dark as well, which I opted for since the next lightest choice is blond looking.&lt;br /&gt;The color is a bit darker than my hair color and I can see where it is however it&#x27;s not totally bad because of my varied color to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;All I wish is there was 1 more lightest brown choice.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this again because there&#x27;s nothing I&#x27;ve come across that covers this well with out the stickiness like the &amp;#34;mascara&amp;#34; cover ups.</li>
            <li> Works okay.  Prefer the spray I get at CVS</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t go on easily or cover well !</li>
            <li> Best root cover up I&#x27;ve ever tried!  Soft to touch, not sticky like some others, blends nicely around face.  Lasts until next washing.</li>
            <li> Great product, but  quite pricey!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve found for color tough-up.  It blends into my hair easily and conceals great.  No mess and no rubbing off.  The added bonus is the nice compact with mirror it comes in - can carry it with me in my purse !</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic.  I&#x27;m buying it again</li>
            <li> Amazing product highly recomended it</li>
            <li> Sticky and doesn&#x27;t really work.  I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> The color match was very good and the powder is easy to apply. Lasts for a day or so but not more. Pretty much what I expected. I would give it a 5 star review if it lasted longer as I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day. Will definitely buy it again when I need more.</li>
            <li> Allergic reaction on scalp</li>
            <li> Excelllent product that doesn&#x27;t have a waxy or tacky build-up.  Coverage is great and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I like this but I am a little confused about it.  It seems to cover the skin under my hair, but not really the hair.  So, in an area where I puff my hair up a little (the crown) it doesn&#x27;t cover re-growth.  Maybe I&#x27;m not applying it correctly.  It works pretty well on regrowth at my temples and forehead because the skin underneath takes on the color.</li>
            <li> I had to put so much of the powder on the brush in order to cover the grey and it didn&#x27;t last as long as advertised.  By the next morning it was gone.  The product has possibilities but needs to be perfected.  For the little amount of pressed powder it is more practical to use Toppik or Caboki for coverage and less expensive.  I had to really struggle to get coverage with this product.</li>
            <li> Provides very good coverage.  Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Sent back. Did not use.</li>
            <li> I read some of the negative reviews regarding Color Wow before ordering so I was a little concerned whether it really works.  I have to say I am really impressed!!  My hair is more of an ash brown color with some blonde highlights that covers a lot of grey.  I got the light brown Color Wow which looks really dark but somehow blends in well with my hair color.  I use it on the part in my hair and in a few areas around my face.  I have my hair colored every 8 weeks and was starting to think I might have to get it done every 6 weeks so this is extending the time between hair colorings by a few weeks.  It only takes me about 5 minutes to apply.  It does not come off on your pillow case.  Highly recommend--it worked for me!</li>
            <li> Bar none, there is no other product that surpasses this.  I can easily manage the time in between my visit to my hairdresser for color.  And I have found that a light dusting on my eyebrows is a better and more natural look than most other products devoted to eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This product works great.  I use it between color appointments to touch up my roots.&lt;br /&gt;It stays in place pretty well, and doesn&#x27;t rub off on pillows, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Very simple to use, and it performs as expected</li>
            <li> Excellent. Never knew this product would cover up so well. Wish I bought a long time ago! It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Gets me through to the next salon appointment.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky like some other products and it stays on all day.  Your hair has to be dry to use it.  I&#x27;ve even tried using the blonde to give highlights. I suggest trying it for yourself.</li>
            <li> Best root coverage I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> This stuff is miracle in a box!!!</li>
            <li> This is highly recommended if you color your hair.  I can&#x27;t be without this cover up.  It is truly amazing.  It doesn&#x27;t come off on your clothes or pillow cases.  It stays on until you shampoo it out.  You might consider getting a shade lighter than your hair when purchasing.  My hair is dark brown and this light brown is a perfect match.  This is worth the money.</li>
            <li> What a great product!  We need a color in between blonde and brown.  :)</li>
            <li> Love love love this product. It covers great and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky like sprays. I have recommended it to my friends</li>
            <li> Product did exactly as it said it would.  It covered my roots perfectly and did not come off until I washed my hair.</li>
            <li> Ordered light but what I received was really dark.  Really hard to use makes spots rather then going on as powder.</li>
            <li> Incredible product, I already bought another one for a backup.  Covers the hair great between hair appointments.  A must for any one who dyes their hair. Much easier than any other product I have used over the years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried two or three products and really like this one.  It was hard to figure out what color to buy, but online hints helped.  This goes on easily and blends in very well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  The product doesn&#x27;t cover gray roots well, nor is it anything like the product description.  The &amp;#34;Light Brown&amp;#34; is actually a dark, muddy brown powder that easily stains your scalp and completely misses the roots.  Buy one of the mascara type root cover ups.  They&#x27;re easier to use, have better colors and cost about 2/3 of what this useless product cost.  If you don&#x27;t have a Sally Beauty Supply nearby or other beauty supply store, check on Drugstore.com.</li>
            <li> Accurate timing with accurate item as described</li>
            <li> This really works!!!  I am really grey, and I have looked for something that helps me get through my color appointments.  This looks natural!</li>
            <li> Works well. I was pleasantly surprised. Does not rub or wear off either.</li>
