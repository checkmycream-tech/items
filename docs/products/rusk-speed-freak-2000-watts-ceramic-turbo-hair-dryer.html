            <li>The Rusk Speed Freak has changed my morning routine for the better!</li>
            <li>Amazing blow dryer</li>
            <li>I own one myself and purchased additional dryers for each of my daughters.  </li>
            <li>It does own up to the claim of dramatically reducing drying time as well.</li>
            <li>and i am so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need ear plugs to use it, love what it does to my hair</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>We bought this hair dryer to save precious time in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Like most hairdryers I dont like the placement of the controls as when you use it you tend to move the controls around.</li>
            <li>Havent found a dryer that has better placed controls.</li>
            <li>I will add though that The dryer looks great and has a high quality feel to it.</li>
            <li>I purchased the replacement within an hour of breaking the original because there was not a decision to make in regards to what do I replace it with?!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best dryer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Would definitely buy again, but so far, no need as mine is holding up great!</li>
            <li>If you have lots of hair, like myself, you will be amazed at how quickly this dryer reduces drying time and helps to control frizz.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Love it, left my hair straight and nice and shinny and my hair is very curly</li>
            <li>strong and makes your hair dry so fast!!!!  </li>
            <li>this has to be one of the absolute best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a long, long time!  </li>
            <li>Where has this dryer been my whole life?!</li>
            <li>so it did wonders to my long curly hair :)</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>My hair drys fast.</li>
            <li>While this hair dryer did dry my hair very quickly, it burnt my hair and caused it to become very frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Just be careful leaving it on the hot setting as it does get super hot and you dont want to break or damage the hair .</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this dryer to anyone.</li>
            <li>and I work in a high end salon.  </li>
            <li>The dryer itself is a little heavy but still a great purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for over 2 years now, and it still works like it was brand new.  </li>
            <li>Be warned though, the powerful motor on it makes it heavier than your average hair dryer.</li>
            <li>My second one, first last over two years with mostly daily use</li>
            <li>It dried my thick, wavy hair to a shiny, straight style that I would normally only be able to achieve with a flat iron.</li>

            <li> This is a replacement purchase for the same model. I dropped the previous one on a tile service and broke it. I was devastated. This is hands down the best dryer I&#x27;ve ever used. If you have lots of hair, like myself, you will be amazed at how quickly this dryer reduces drying time and helps to control frizz. I purchased the replacement within an hour of breaking the original because there was not a decision to make in regards to what do I replace it with?!</li>
            <li> The Rusk Speed Freak has changed my morning routine for the better! I had been using another brand of hair dryer for years that also dried my very long, thick hair in record time however, my record time of 11 minutes was cut down to 7 minutes after using the Rusk Speed Freak. I highly recommend this product to anyone with long and/or thick hair. It has been a life changer! So happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great blow dryer! Cuts drying time to half! The dryer itself is a little heavy but still a great purchase. I also like that it is quieter than my previous dryers.</li>
            <li> You know how your hair looks when you leave the hairdresser?  Sleek and wonderful?  My hairdresser promised me it depends on the quality of blow dryer.  I didn&#x27;t believe him.  I have been used to buying my hairdryers at CVS and couldn&#x27;t believe the price difference would make a difference in appearance.  He convinced me to try.  Amazon had it on sale.  Lo and behold.  Big difference.  In fact, I&#x27;m looking to buy another one to have on hand for others when they visit.</li>
            <li> I own one myself and purchased additional dryers for each of my daughters.  We all have long thick hair and the Speed Freak dries our hair quicker than any other dryer we&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve had mine for over 2 years now, and it still works like it was brand new.  No hot odor or burning hair smell like you sometimes get when a dryer is over 2 years old.  Would definitely buy again, but so far, no need as mine is holding up great!</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer after my drugstore brand died. I chose it based on a beauty blog recommendation and the rave reviews here on Amazon. I was not disappointed! Where has this dryer been my whole life?! I was amazed at its power and heat and the overall quality factor. It dried my thick, wavy hair to a shiny, straight style that I would normally only be able to achieve with a flat iron. It does own up to the claim of dramatically reducing drying time as well. It is a bit on the heavier side, but if that bothers you, this same dryer comes in a lightweight version. I would highly recommend this dryer to anyone.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter as a birthday gift. I have one that she has used but this hair dryer is like none other</li>
            <li> My hair type is thick and wavy. I purchased this hAir dryer in addition to a round brush to dry my hair strait. While this hair dryer did dry my hair very quickly, it burnt my hair and caused it to become very frizzy.  I will add though that The dryer looks great and has a high quality feel to it.</li>
            <li> this has to be one of the absolute best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a long, long time!  thank you.</li>
            <li> Great dryer! My second one, first last over two years with mostly daily use</li>
            <li> I was anxious to try out this new hair dryer since my hair stylist recommended it to me, and once I got it, it was beyond my expectations. Love it, left my hair straight and nice and shinny and my hair is very curly so it did wonders to my long curly hair :)</li>
            <li> strong and makes your hair dry so fast!!!!  I would recommend this to anyone.  I really like it and i am so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need ear plugs to use it, love what it does to my hair</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer. Its not too heavy. My hair drys fast. Leaves my hair feeling great..</li>
            <li> We bought this hair dryer to save precious time in the morning.  It definitely saves time without overdrying hair.  Be warned though, the powerful motor on it makes it heavier than your average hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This works great! Like most hairdryers I dont like the placement of the controls as when you use it you tend to move the controls around. Havent found a dryer that has better placed controls. But this dryer works well.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is worth every penny. I have two of them, one for home and one for traveling. I&#x27;ve had my hair dryers for several years. This hair dryer blows out your hair quickly!!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing blow dryer and I work in a high end salon.  Just be careful leaving it on the hot setting as it does get super hot and you dont want to break or damage the hair .</li>
            <li> This is my third one of these.  Best hair dryer ever!</li>
            <li> It tangles my hair like never before even after it is brushed again after I&#x27;m done. My hand switches the speed on the handle every 30 seconds- poor placement</li>
