            <li>A really good Li e for the money.</li>
            <li>It is remarkable and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>I went out to see what women were talking about on Amazon and found \\&quot;Ole&#x27;s\\&quot; formula to be very interesting.  </li>
            <li>Very refreshing smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>Love it !</li>
            <li>It sure did that!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>My skin feels nourished and looks healthy!</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>It looks amazing too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Serum is one of my favorite things in the morning, along with a good cup of coffee.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really loving this line.</li>
            <li>However, you would probably want to use some kind of moisturizer after applying the serum.  </li>
            <li>I get better results using Oil of Olay for a much more affordable price!</li>
            <li>Sure, this feels great and smooth, thanks to a beautifully composed texture.</li>
            <li>If you want healthy smooth and bright skin, get it.  </li>
            <li>This is light and amazing.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Smells like oranges, has a lovely gel/oil feel, and both firms my face and makes it glow.</li>
            <li>The wrinkles are just as prominent as ever</li>
            <li>It surely helps!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>$38 per oz, its 1 of the best price outthere that you can find for th eserum that actually works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended... Check out his Spa when you are in West hollywood/LA area :-)</li>
            <li>just okay.</li>
            <li>now have the skin of that girl women are jealous of because she can run to the grocery store with no makeup on. :)</li>
            <li>Great item, FAST shipping.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more inclined to stick to that.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 29 and love taking care of my skin ....</li>
            <li>Makes skin look healthy</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it......</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the texture.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>my skin looks better, my skin is brighter.</li>
            <li>I use it at night after cleaning my skin, using the Obaji products on top.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The results I have noticed from this serum are brighter, more youthful-looking skin.  </li>
            <li>I would love this product if Ole Henriksen didn&#x27;t use an orange pigment that is a known carcinogen.  </li>
            <li>all, this is a cosmetically elegant formulation, but i would rather pay more money to know what i&#x27;m getting.</li>
            <li>so I can get away with that for the most part.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how it works after another couple of weeks, but so far so good!</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean scent.  </li>
            <li>The Peter Thomas Roth Serum feels very light weight and easily absorbs into my skin, but this feels like a gel when it goes on.  </li>
            <li>The good thing is that it really works!</li>
            <li>this is really good, keeps skin in good conditions, it looks better next day and its not so oily so u can use it at daytime</li>
            <li>My first impression was how much I loved the scent.  </li>
            <li>Love this serum...goes on easy</li>
            <li>It is excellent for additional skin protection during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li>I would be happier to trade off the bright, cheery color for the peace of mind of knowing I was not slathering a possible carcinogen on my face.</li>
            <li>I bought this with the rest of the Truth line (based on a sample I used and loved) and I really like it.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly into the skin and leaves no residue.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Once I stopped using it my skin cleared up and looked fine.</li>
            <li>They are pretty reasonably priced, smell good, work great, and are made with a lot of natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It took a little while, but then I noticed my skin is almost flawless.</li>
            <li>Then over time I saw my complexion become brighter and baby smooth.  </li>
            <li>A great overall product and may buy it again.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, it does seem to give my skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li>I inititally tried it a few years ago, but wasn&#x27;t impressed, so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, penetrates in, and doesn&#x27;t irritate.  </li>
            <li>Added this to my nightly routine and good results so far</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this product after I read all of the rave reviews.</li>
            <li>I had received a sample and was excited when I found this on line.</li>
            <li>I love this serum, its light weight and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and is completely non-irritating.  </li>
            <li>I got a full 1 oz bottle as part of hand held face scrubber.</li>
            <li>If it contained 20%, 15%, or even 10%--that would be good enough make a claim on the package.</li>
            <li>So now I use it first, then apply my normal night lotion on top.</li>
            <li>If I had oilier skin it might be enough on its own.</li>
            <li>However, I still think a lot of other Ole Henriksen products are great (I really like both the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>One pump is enough to cover my entire face, neck, and decollete area (a good reminder not to skip those areas!).  </li>
            <li>and I have noticed a positive difference in skin clarity (immediatly!).</li>
            <li>First, it smells divine-a citrus vanilla scent that&#x27;s fresh but not cloying.</li>
            <li>The serum has a light, nice scent and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel too tight after I put it on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying this serum won&#x27;t work for everyone--I personally know many who swear by its brightening prowess--but for those of you with sensitive skin, I beg of you--try a sample first!!!</li>
            <li>I wanted so badly to love it--and let me preface this by saying that I love every other Ole Henriksen product I&#x27;ve ever tried!!</li>
            <li>About myself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am almost thirty and used to tan frequently, however my skin doesn&#x27;t show much sun damage and is fairly healthy.</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend!!Love it!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>(- In the first month or so... then the glow started to dissapear, after still-continuous use.</li>
            <li>my doctor recommend me to use a higher sunblock.</li>
            <li>however when I used retinoids alone my skin still looked pretty crummy</li>
            <li>I use all ole products but this was the first that started the obsession.</li>
            <li>The Vitamin C the skin absorbs is most likely not a benefit when you consider the poison the skin also absorbs from the pigment.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why, if you have the choice of 10% or 20% vitamin C, ALWAYS CHOOSE THE HIGHER STRENGTH.</li>
            <li>I have skin redness problem whenever I feel hot or dehydrated.  </li>
            <li>Such a nice surpise to find something that really works on older skin.</li>
            <li>and because I&#x27;ve really liked other products from Ole Henriksen.    </li>
            <li>so it is hard to pinpoint exactly what has caused my skin to look so good.</li>
            <li>It certainly brightens your skin.</li>
            <li>This product however does not seem to do much to boost the firmness of my skin, which was one of the reasons I got it.  </li>
            <li>looks, much  softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>I bought this serum on a whim as part of the \\&quot;Whole Truth\\&quot; kit (eye cream, cream, serum).</li>
            <li>I really like this serum and would definitly buy it again.</li>
            <li>so there wasn&#x27;t much to \\&quot;fix\\&quot; here except to increase the glow.</li>
            <li>and it goes FAST.</li>
            <li>but since I tend to have oily skin, it didn&#x27;t work out very well.  </li>
            <li>It has a citrus smell that I really like.</li>
            <li>I missed it too much.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I dont know if I see much of a difference though</li>
            <li>I have it almost gone but have not seen really any difference in my skin thought have read on</li>
            <li>I regret it so much</li>
            <li>It works very well at keeping my face hydrated and looking youthful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of disappointed to have spent over $200 for his products that didn&#x27;t have the best results!</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have stated a moisturizer on top is a must and one pump is plenty for my face and neck.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>After a month of using Truth Serum, it&#x27;s like I have a whole new face.</li>
            <li>There is a slight warmth that comes with application which I don&#x27;t love</li>
            <li>I smooth it over my face/neck and once dry</li>
            <li>However, if you don&#x27;t mind the feel of a gel or slightly sticky skin you might like this more than I do.  </li>
            <li>I occasionally want to find something that is being touted as the &amp;#34;newest, latest and greatest&amp;#34;, but I always go back to this.  </li>
            <li>I only used this for 4 days and my skin feels brighter and super hydrated.  </li>
            <li>but I can get past it since my sensitive skin seems to love it!</li>
            <li>Will go back for more in the near future.</li>
            <li>like it because of the light Orange sense &amp; its NOT greasy at al like other serum.</li>
            <li>used to be a product junkie, and bought something new whenever I ran out.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t seen any new sun/pollution/environmental damage to my skin.  </li>
            <li>The orange scent dissipates within a few minutes, and you will be left with super smooth, soft, and hydrated skin all day.</li>
            <li>This product has completely re-texturized my skin!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re unsure about purchasing definitely get a sample first.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not sure this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>If u have sensitive skin like me, dont even try it !</li>
            <li>not a bad product, but next time I will order bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>The only real benefit was the glow.    </li>
            <li>Ole Henriksen Truth Serum is a soothing morning treatment for my 66 year old skin.  </li>
            <li>I am 34 years old with medium-light melasma and never-ending acne.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone 40 years old and over.</li>
            <li>The item arrived and the box was completely falling apart, almost like it had been chewed on by an animal.</li>
            <li>I does seem to give my skin a glow and help make it soft, but I don&#x27;t like the feel of this serum after applying  </li>
            <li>and I do not wake up with anything unexpected (breakouts, oil,</li>
            <li>it has made my skin clear and soft.</li>
            <li>Made me breakout, so I just use it near my eyes for added brightness</li>
            <li>I am fairly young</li>
            <li>Wish I had had this product 20 years ago, but better late than never.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I then finish off with Clinque&#x27;s Moisture Surge Overnight Mask, My face stays soft and supple all day.</li>
            <li>I feel like one of the few people who really doesn&#x27;t like this product, but after trying it twice over the span of a few years, I can honestly say it does nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a terrific product, I actually notice a difference in appearance when I use it unlike so many other pricey beauty products.</li>
            <li>The bottle was just barely half full.</li>
            <li>It is like magic, seriously.</li>
            <li>My breakouts have calmed down (retnoids alone didn&#x27;t do this), pores look smaller, and makeup goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I apply his facial creme which is another highly recommended product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick or sticky, but absorbs instantly.</li>
            <li>Definitely not worth full price, sending back immediately.</li>
            <li>&quot; It&#x27;s hard to comment on fine lines or wrinkles because I don&#x27;t have any</li>
            <li>I use a few of the Obaji products, but heard about this one and thought it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>If they could just take out the unnecessary pigment this product would be fantastic!  </li>
            <li>On application this serum initially feels a little sticky but quickly goes away.  </li>
            <li>Yes I will be a live long</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hooked!I use a little before bed and a little more when I wake up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Second, it makes my skin, usually dry, very clear and soft.</li>
            <li>The only problem for me is that I&#x27;m only 21 years old...</li>
            <li>I deviated once from Ole Henricksen after my initial try but it was only because I was trying to use up old stuff/cut costs.</li>
            <li>I found out later from a skincare-smart sales associate that the vitamin C in this product is likely unstable, as the container it comes in is a clear glass bottle that likely lets some air in.</li>
            <li>First of all, at the age of 34, I have not had any issues with blemishes for quite a few years.</li>
            <li>I usually apply this right out of the shower, my face still damp.</li>
            <li>I have one of the biggest blemishes I&#x27;ve ever had and a few more small ones.</li>
            <li>Thin formula goes on easily and blends into the skin well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great serum that is less expensive than other brands.</li>
            <li>I purchased this in the hopes it would lighten the dark spots on my cheeks and help clear up my skin in general.  </li>

            <li> I went out to see what women were talking about on Amazon and found \\&quot;Ole&#x27;s\\&quot; formula to be very interesting.  </li>
            <li> Very refreshing smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> Love it !</li>
            <li> It sure did that!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> My skin feels nourished and looks healthy!</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> It looks amazing too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Serum is one of my favorite things in the morning, along with a good cup of coffee.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving this line.</li>
            <li> However, you would probably want to use some kind of moisturizer after applying the serum.  </li>
            <li> I get better results using Oil of Olay for a much more affordable price!</li>
            <li> Sure, this feels great and smooth, thanks to a beautifully composed texture.</li>
            <li> If you want healthy smooth and bright skin, get it.  </li>
            <li> This is light and amazing.  </li>
            <li> I love this oil.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Smells like oranges, has a lovely gel/oil feel, and both firms my face and makes it glow.</li>
            <li> The wrinkles are just as prominent as ever</li>
            <li> It surely helps!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> $38 per oz, its 1 of the best price outthere that you can find for th eserum that actually works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended... Check out his Spa when you are in West hollywood/LA area :-)</li>
            <li> just okay.</li>
            <li> now have the skin of that girl women are jealous of because she can run to the grocery store with no makeup on. :)</li>
            <li> Great item, FAST shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more inclined to stick to that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 29 and love taking care of my skin ....</li>
            <li> Makes skin look healthy</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it......</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the texture.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> my skin looks better, my skin is brighter.</li>
            <li> I use it at night after cleaning my skin, using the Obaji products on top.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The results I have noticed from this serum are brighter, more youthful-looking skin.  </li>
            <li> I would love this product if Ole Henriksen didn&#x27;t use an orange pigment that is a known carcinogen.  </li>
            <li> all, this is a cosmetically elegant formulation, but i would rather pay more money to know what i&#x27;m getting.</li>
            <li> so I can get away with that for the most part.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how it works after another couple of weeks, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> It has a nice clean scent.  </li>
            <li> The Peter Thomas Roth Serum feels very light weight and easily absorbs into my skin, but this feels like a gel when it goes on.  </li>
            <li> The good thing is that it really works!</li>
            <li> this is really good, keeps skin in good conditions, it looks better next day and its not so oily so u can use it at daytime</li>
            <li> My first impression was how much I loved the scent.  </li>
            <li> Love this serum...goes on easy</li>
            <li> It is excellent for additional skin protection during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> I would be happier to trade off the bright, cheery color for the peace of mind of knowing I was not slathering a possible carcinogen on my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the rest of the Truth line (based on a sample I used and loved) and I really like it.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly into the skin and leaves no residue.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Once I stopped using it my skin cleared up and looked fine.</li>
            <li> They are pretty reasonably priced, smell good, work great, and are made with a lot of natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It took a little while, but then I noticed my skin is almost flawless.</li>
            <li> Then over time I saw my complexion become brighter and baby smooth.  </li>
            <li> A great overall product and may buy it again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it does seem to give my skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li> I inititally tried it a few years ago, but wasn&#x27;t impressed, so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, penetrates in, and doesn&#x27;t irritate.  </li>
            <li> Added this to my nightly routine and good results so far</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this product after I read all of the rave reviews.</li>
            <li> I had received a sample and was excited when I found this on line.</li>
            <li> I love this serum, its light weight and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and is completely non-irritating.  </li>
            <li> I got a full 1 oz bottle as part of hand held face scrubber.</li>
            <li> If it contained 20%, 15%, or even 10%--that would be good enough make a claim on the package.</li>
            <li> So now I use it first, then apply my normal night lotion on top.</li>
            <li> If I had oilier skin it might be enough on its own.</li>
            <li> However, I still think a lot of other Ole Henriksen products are great (I really like both the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> One pump is enough to cover my entire face, neck, and decollete area (a good reminder not to skip those areas!).  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed a positive difference in skin clarity (immediatly!).</li>
            <li> First, it smells divine-a citrus vanilla scent that&#x27;s fresh but not cloying.</li>
            <li> The serum has a light, nice scent and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel too tight after I put it on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying this serum won&#x27;t work for everyone--I personally know many who swear by its brightening prowess--but for those of you with sensitive skin, I beg of you--try a sample first!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted so badly to love it--and let me preface this by saying that I love every other Ole Henriksen product I&#x27;ve ever tried!!</li>
            <li> About myself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am almost thirty and used to tan frequently, however my skin doesn&#x27;t show much sun damage and is fairly healthy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend!!Love it!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> (- In the first month or so... then the glow started to dissapear, after still-continuous use.</li>
            <li> my doctor recommend me to use a higher sunblock.</li>
            <li> however when I used retinoids alone my skin still looked pretty crummy</li>
            <li> I use all ole products but this was the first that started the obsession.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C the skin absorbs is most likely not a benefit when you consider the poison the skin also absorbs from the pigment.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why, if you have the choice of 10% or 20% vitamin C, ALWAYS CHOOSE THE HIGHER STRENGTH.</li>
            <li> I have skin redness problem whenever I feel hot or dehydrated.  </li>
            <li> Such a nice surpise to find something that really works on older skin.</li>
            <li> and because I&#x27;ve really liked other products from Ole Henriksen.    </li>
            <li> so it is hard to pinpoint exactly what has caused my skin to look so good.</li>
            <li> It certainly brightens your skin.</li>
            <li> This product however does not seem to do much to boost the firmness of my skin, which was one of the reasons I got it.  </li>
            <li> looks, much  softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum on a whim as part of the \\&quot;Whole Truth\\&quot; kit (eye cream, cream, serum).</li>
            <li> I really like this serum and would definitly buy it again.</li>
            <li> so there wasn&#x27;t much to \\&quot;fix\\&quot; here except to increase the glow.</li>
            <li> and it goes FAST.</li>
            <li> but since I tend to have oily skin, it didn&#x27;t work out very well.  </li>
            <li> It has a citrus smell that I really like.</li>
            <li> I missed it too much.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I dont know if I see much of a difference though</li>
            <li> I have it almost gone but have not seen really any difference in my skin thought have read on</li>
            <li> I regret it so much</li>
            <li> It works very well at keeping my face hydrated and looking youthful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of disappointed to have spent over $200 for his products that didn&#x27;t have the best results!</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated a moisturizer on top is a must and one pump is plenty for my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> After a month of using Truth Serum, it&#x27;s like I have a whole new face.</li>
            <li> There is a slight warmth that comes with application which I don&#x27;t love</li>
            <li> I smooth it over my face/neck and once dry</li>
            <li> However, if you don&#x27;t mind the feel of a gel or slightly sticky skin you might like this more than I do.  </li>
            <li> I occasionally want to find something that is being touted as the &amp;#34;newest, latest and greatest&amp;#34;, but I always go back to this.  </li>
            <li> I only used this for 4 days and my skin feels brighter and super hydrated.  </li>
            <li> but I can get past it since my sensitive skin seems to love it!</li>
            <li> Will go back for more in the near future.</li>
            <li> like it because of the light Orange sense &amp; its NOT greasy at al like other serum.</li>
            <li> used to be a product junkie, and bought something new whenever I ran out.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t seen any new sun/pollution/environmental damage to my skin.  </li>
            <li> The orange scent dissipates within a few minutes, and you will be left with super smooth, soft, and hydrated skin all day.</li>
            <li> This product has completely re-texturized my skin!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re unsure about purchasing definitely get a sample first.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not sure this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> If u have sensitive skin like me, dont even try it !</li>
            <li> not a bad product, but next time I will order bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> The only real benefit was the glow.    </li>
            <li> Ole Henriksen Truth Serum is a soothing morning treatment for my 66 year old skin.  </li>
            <li> I am 34 years old with medium-light melasma and never-ending acne.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone 40 years old and over.</li>
            <li> The item arrived and the box was completely falling apart, almost like it had been chewed on by an animal.</li>
            <li> I does seem to give my skin a glow and help make it soft, but I don&#x27;t like the feel of this serum after applying  </li>
            <li> and I do not wake up with anything unexpected (breakouts, oil,</li>
            <li> it has made my skin clear and soft.</li>
            <li> Made me breakout, so I just use it near my eyes for added brightness</li>
            <li> I am fairly young</li>
            <li> Wish I had had this product 20 years ago, but better late than never.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then finish off with Clinque&#x27;s Moisture Surge Overnight Mask, My face stays soft and supple all day.</li>
            <li> I feel like one of the few people who really doesn&#x27;t like this product, but after trying it twice over the span of a few years, I can honestly say it does nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product, I actually notice a difference in appearance when I use it unlike so many other pricey beauty products.</li>
            <li> The bottle was just barely half full.</li>
            <li> It is like magic, seriously.</li>
            <li> My breakouts have calmed down (retnoids alone didn&#x27;t do this), pores look smaller, and makeup goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I apply his facial creme which is another highly recommended product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick or sticky, but absorbs instantly.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth full price, sending back immediately.</li>
            <li> &quot; It&#x27;s hard to comment on fine lines or wrinkles because I don&#x27;t have any</li>
            <li> I use a few of the Obaji products, but heard about this one and thought it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> If they could just take out the unnecessary pigment this product would be fantastic!  </li>
            <li> On application this serum initially feels a little sticky but quickly goes away.  </li>
            <li> Yes I will be a live long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked!I use a little before bed and a little more when I wake up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Second, it makes my skin, usually dry, very clear and soft.</li>
            <li> The only problem for me is that I&#x27;m only 21 years old...</li>
            <li> I deviated once from Ole Henricksen after my initial try but it was only because I was trying to use up old stuff/cut costs.</li>
            <li> I found out later from a skincare-smart sales associate that the vitamin C in this product is likely unstable, as the container it comes in is a clear glass bottle that likely lets some air in.</li>
            <li> First of all, at the age of 34, I have not had any issues with blemishes for quite a few years.</li>
            <li> I usually apply this right out of the shower, my face still damp.</li>
            <li> I have one of the biggest blemishes I&#x27;ve ever had and a few more small ones.</li>
            <li> Thin formula goes on easily and blends into the skin well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great serum that is less expensive than other brands.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in the hopes it would lighten the dark spots on my cheeks and help clear up my skin in general.  </li>
            <li> Not bad, not great--</li>
            <li> So far I have been using this product for about a week and have noticed that my melasma is a little bit lighter and after an initial break out (3 days)</li>
            <li> B000A0ADUW Ole Henriksen Blue Black Berry Enzyme Facial Mask, 3.5 Fluid Ounce]] and [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It is not greasy for long after its application.  </li>
            <li> but it was too harsh on my skin and left lasting red marks for a couple of days after use.  </li>
            <li> I do get patches of rough skin and the occasional blemish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take long to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Since that deviation I have not bought any other brand for my regular skin routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
            <li> Dry, flaky patches--</li>
            <li> I have been saving a lot of money going to Skin specialists, over the years with limited results and out a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Use only a little of both.</li>
            <li> After a month I went online and reordered The Three Little Miracles (Truth Serum, Invigorating Night Gel and Sheer Transformation).</li>
            <li> I see the different in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Same thing, it did nothing for my skin, and I noticed that a few pimples popped up</li>
            <li> do use a variety of other Ole Henricksen products (see below)</li>
            <li> the truth oil u only need a small amount of cream</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day especially after a late night out with lots of drinking...</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the tube squirts out a lot of product and makes me use quite a bit at a time.</li>
            <li> But still after few days, no more red cheeks.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have NOT experienced any breakouts like one of the reviewers noted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that Vitamin C can be irritating but the Vitamin C derivative in the Truth Serum has not irritated my sensitive skin at all.     </li>
            <li> Previously I had used OTC hydroquinone</li>
            <li> I also recommend the Black Currant Energizing Complexion Oil.  </li>
            <li> but I can tell a difference in how tight my skin feels after a couple days&#x27; use.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and eczema and dry skin all over lately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 with little to no signs of aging</li>
            <li> but my skin is a little brighter</li>
            <li> Been using it for about 4 months, everyday at nighttime before bed.</li>
            <li> You have to use the serum everyday and make it a routine before bed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing improve with my skin tone after few times that I start using it.  </li>
            <li> My husband also noticed the difference after just a few days.  </li>
            <li> Less breakouts as well!</li>
            <li> I have been using the products usually once every day for about 3-4 weeks</li>
            <li> I am disappointed though that it contains Yellow 6 a petroleum based dye that has a number of potential health concerns.</li>
            <li> so that is almost unbelievable to me.</li>
            <li> It had a really thick horrible consistency that felt as if caused more wrinkles when putting it on.</li>
            <li> I did not realize how irritating my previous products were for my aging skin and eyes.  </li>
            <li> After my face heals I may go back to trying the serum to see if it is in fact the problem, but for now......l&#x27;m really unhappy with the results-</li>
            <li> a little bit too expensive.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me (though I highly doubt that, considering some reviews I read after having an adverse reaction to this product) but my über-sensitive skin HATED this serum.</li>
            <li> I do not find it irritating.</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic improvement</li>
            <li> I might recommend this to a friend, but I won&#x27;t buy it again because it&#x27;s so expensive</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this serum made me break out within three nights of using it...BADLY, and I never break out.</li>
            <li> for all i know, there could be a mere 5-7% of vitamin C</li>
            <li> I have a lot of his products - obsessed with them.</li>
            <li> It is crazy.</li>
            <li> It was getting very uncomfortable</li>
            <li> The bad thing about this product is that it smells like floor cleaner.</li>
            <li> Try them; you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Use something in the line, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Now, let me state that I do have those annoying forehead wrinkles</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I do not see the results claimed in the description.</li>
            <li> Only been using it for 3 days but I can feel a difference already. There is a slight warmth that comes with application which I don&#x27;t love but I can get past it since my sensitive skin seems to love it! I have rosacea and eczema and dry skin all over lately. It was getting very uncomfortable so I tried this serum. I&#x27;m so glad I did! Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product.  It absorbs very quickly into the skin and leaves no residue.  Then over time I saw my complexion become brighter and baby smooth.  If you want healthy smooth and bright skin, get it.  This product however does not seem to do much to boost the firmness of my skin, which was one of the reasons I got it.  A great overall product and may buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is light and amazing.  Use it in conjunction with the oil.  You will not regret how wonderful your skin feels and looks.  Non irritating and makeup goes on so smoothly after.  Use only a little of both.</li>
            <li> Great spring tonic for my neck &amp; face...only used cocoa butter lotion before!  Then my mid sixties Bday rolled around &amp; my mirror began having a conversation with my skin!  I went out to see what women were talking about on Amazon and found \\&quot;Ole&#x27;s\\&quot; formula to be very interesting.  So for a month I have been faithful...and my skin is smoother &amp; blemishes are gone-gone-gone! Thank you Ole Henriksen!</li>
            <li> i have been using this product twice a day for a  month   i can tell a difference in the my skin looks, much  softer and smoother. Now people want to know what I  have doing for my skin.  will definitely keep using  it</li>
            <li> I watched Ole H. on QVC but his products, in my opinion, are over priced for the results you get! I&#x27;m kind of disappointed to have spent over $200 for his products that didn&#x27;t have the best results! I get better results using Oil of Olay for a much more affordable price!</li>
            <li> Well I like the product ! Been using it for about 4 months, everyday at nighttime before bed. My skin and neck areas have not looked so good. I have been saving a lot of money going to Skin specialists, over the years with limited results and out a lot of money. You have to use the serum everyday and make it a routine before bed. Love it !</li>
            <li> Excelente serum. Collagen and vit C</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend!!Love it!</li>
            <li> Given the ratings I&#x27;ve assigned the Transformation Creme, etc., it should be obvious that I&#x27;m a fan. Try them; you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  It is not greasy for long after its application.  It has a nice clean scent.  It makes my skin soft and smooth.  This is my second bottle.</li>
            <li> This makes your neck and face feel wonderful, renewed, healthy...and it is healthy.  Vitamin C is excellent for your face - it promotes more collagen!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this product after I read all of the rave reviews. My experience however has been much different than that of my Amazon peers. First of all, at the age of 34, I have not had any issues with blemishes for quite a few years. I have been using this product for a week and my skin is a disaster. I have one of the biggest blemishes I&#x27;ve ever had and a few more small ones. Yes!!! My skin does glow- but so do these pimples, like beacons in the night!!!! Coincidence? Probably not. After my face heals I may go back to trying the serum to see if it is in fact the problem, but for now......l&#x27;m really unhappy with the results- I&#x27;d say this is definitely not noncomodegenic!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it. Smells like oranges, has a lovely gel/oil feel, and both firms my face and makes it glow.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it does seem to give my skin a nice glow. However, I find that it&#x27;s not as moisturizing as I&#x27;d like. So now I use it first, then apply my normal night lotion on top.</li>
            <li> Added this to my nightly routine and good results so far</li>
            <li> I bought this serum on a whim as part of the \\&quot;Whole Truth\\&quot; kit (eye cream, cream, serum). I have been using the products usually once every day for about 3-4 weeks and I have noticed a positive difference in skin clarity (immediatly!). Less breakouts as well! I really like this serum and would definitly buy it again. Great value when looking at the results.&lt;br /&gt;The eye creme I did NOT like. It had a really thick horrible consistency that felt as if caused more wrinkles when putting it on.</li>
            <li> This IS a great serum that almost everyone should get great results from. The only problem for me is that I&#x27;m only 21 years old... so there wasn&#x27;t much to \\&quot;fix\\&quot; here except to increase the glow. It sure did that! (- In the first month or so... then the glow started to dissapear, after still-continuous use. Hmm.) I did not notice that this healed any of my occasional blemishes. The only real benefit was the glow.    It feels great going on and smells wonderful. It&#x27;s not thick or sticky, but absorbs instantly. I might recommend this to a friend, but I won&#x27;t buy it again because it&#x27;s so expensive and it goes FAST.</li>
            <li> Ole Henriksen Truth Serum is a soothing morning treatment for my 66 year old skin.  I smooth it over my face/neck and once dry I apply his facial creme which is another highly recommended product.  The wrinkles are just as prominent as ever but I use his product because the discolorations have faded and my skin feels refreshed after application.  Until I started using the serum I did not realize how irritating my previous products were for my aging skin and eyes.  This is my second purchase.  Using one or two squirts on your fingertips and only in the morning (as recommended) the serum should last about 10 weeks.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Works great for evening out skin tone and has a wonderful citrus smell.</li>
            <li> I went to Loe Henriksen Spa in West Hollywood about 5 years ago &amp; the facial lady gave me some sample... a year later I met Henriksen @ Nordstrom &amp; decided to give it a try... I&#x27;m hooked ever since...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it because of the light Orange sense &amp; its NOT greasy at al like other serum. I see the different in a few weeks. I use it twice a day especially after a late night out with lots of drinking... It surely helps!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $38 per oz, its 1 of the best price outthere that you can find for th eserum that actually works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended... Check out his Spa when you are in West hollywood/LA area :-)</li>
            <li> I am 34 years old with medium-light melasma and never-ending acne.  I purchased this in the hopes it would lighten the dark spots on my cheeks and help clear up my skin in general.  Previously I had used OTC hydroquinone but it was too harsh on my skin and left lasting red marks for a couple of days after use.  So far I have been using this product for about a week and have noticed that my melasma is a little bit lighter and after an initial break out (3 days) my skin has cleared up quite a bit.  It has a nice smell and is completely non-irritating.  I tried wearing it under my makeup but since I tend to have oily skin, it didn&#x27;t work out very well.  We&#x27;ll see how it works after another couple of weeks, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It makes my skin look smoother and brighter. I love it!</li>
            <li> This product has completely re-texturized my skin! I&#x27;ve always had \\&quot;okay\\&quot; skin. Not bad, not great--just okay. After a month of using Truth Serum, it&#x27;s like I have a whole new face. Pores--gone! Dry, flaky patches--nope! I can&#x27;t say enough about this stuff. I&#x27;m hooked!I use a little before bed and a little more when I wake up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have the skin of that girl women are jealous of because she can run to the grocery store with no makeup on. :)</li>
            <li> I feel like one of the few people who really doesn&#x27;t like this product, but after trying it twice over the span of a few years, I can honestly say it does nothing for my skin. I inititally tried it a few years ago, but wasn&#x27;t impressed, so I stopped using it. Last month I got some as a sample, and decided to give it another try. Same thing, it did nothing for my skin, and I noticed that a few pimples popped up and they wouldn&#x27;t go away. Once I stopped using it my skin cleared up and looked fine. If you&#x27;re unsure about purchasing definitely get a sample first.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing smell.  Thin formula goes on easily and blends into the skin well.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product.  I like the way it makes my skin look and feel. I hope for collagen...</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone 40 years old and over. It is remarkable and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> Great item, FAST shipping.</li>
            <li> The item arrived and the box was completely falling apart, almost like it had been chewed on by an animal. The bottle was just barely half full. Definitely not worth full price, sending back immediately.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It certainly brightens your skin.</li>
            <li> The bad thing about this product is that it smells like floor cleaner. The good thing is that it really works! The orange scent dissipates within a few minutes, and you will be left with super smooth, soft, and hydrated skin all day. It&#x27;s a great serum that is less expensive than other brands. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Have been using this one and off for years.  I occasionally want to find something that is being touted as the &amp;#34;newest, latest and greatest&amp;#34;, but I always go back to this.  Goes on smoothly, penetrates in, and doesn&#x27;t irritate.  Just use Ole&#x27;s moisturizer with the spf and I am good to go.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or greasy</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;m 25 with little to no signs of aging but I can tell a difference in how tight my skin feels after a couple days&#x27; use. Will probably use it forever.</li>
            <li> Amazing. My skin glows</li>
            <li> My sister introduced me to this item when I complimented how beautiful her skin looked.&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m using it and have noticed a difference in my as well.  Yes I will be a live long&lt;br /&gt;user.</li>
            <li> Love it! This is my skin smoothing, pore minimizing, glow serum.  I wish I could afford to bathe in it!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this because I just finished up a comparable product from Peter Thomas Roth ([[ASIN:B008UPFNTA Peter Thomas Roth Camu Camu Power Cx30 Vitamin C Brightening Serum, 1.7 Fluid Ounce]]) and because I&#x27;ve really liked other products from Ole Henriksen.    Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not sure this one is my favorite.  I does seem to give my skin a glow and help make it soft, but I don&#x27;t like the feel of this serum after applying  The Peter Thomas Roth Serum feels very light weight and easily absorbs into my skin, but this feels like a gel when it goes on.  Not only do I dislike the heavier, gelatinous feel, it also leaves my skin sticky to the touch.    Overall because of the feel of this serum I don&#x27;t think it is the one for me.  However, if you don&#x27;t mind the feel of a gel or slightly sticky skin you might like this more than I do.  However, since I like the feel and results of the Peter Thomas Roth version I&#x27;m more inclined to stick to that.  However, I still think a lot of other Ole Henriksen products are great (I really like both the [[ASIN:B000A0ADUW Ole Henriksen Blue Black Berry Enzyme Facial Mask, 3.5 Fluid Ounce]] and [[ASIN:B000UO3GGQ Ole Henriksen Sheer Transformation Age Defence, 1.7 Fluid Ounce]].</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 29 and love taking care of my skin ....well I&#x27;m not getting younger and I want to look great for longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start using this product every night and I start feeling my skin like silk. It looks amazing too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this product has Vitamin C my doctor recommend me to use a higher sunblock. So I was using 15 before and now I&#x27;m using 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to people who likes taking care of their skin and want&#x27;s to see big improves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it and I&#x27;ll get it again!</li>
            <li> Helps with my fair skin.</li>
            <li> About myself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am almost thirty and used to tan frequently, however my skin doesn&#x27;t show much sun damage and is fairly healthy. I do get patches of rough skin and the occasional blemish. When I get a blemish it tends to stay on my face as a red mark for quite sometime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Truth Serum:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truth Serum is one of my favorite things in the morning, along with a good cup of coffee. It has a citrus smell that I really like. I have used this product for about two years. The product seems to have an instant effect, I put it on and look awake. It absorbs very quickly.  My only complaint is that the tube squirts out a lot of product and makes me use quite a bit at a time. But it isn&#x27;t enough t deduct any stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use a variety of other Ole Henricksen products (see below) so it is hard to pinpoint exactly what has caused my skin to look so good. Since starting my skin looks radiant. My breakouts have calmed down (retnoids alone didn&#x27;t do this), pores look smaller, and makeup goes on smooth. I am in college at 30, and my classmates didn&#x27;t know I wasn&#x27;t their age until I told them. It&#x27;s a thing too, \\&quot;Did you know Michelle is 30!!\\&quot; It&#x27;s hard to comment on fine lines or wrinkles because I don&#x27;t have any and I don&#x27;t know if I would have any otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to be a product junkie, and bought something new whenever I ran out. I deviated once from Ole Henricksen after my initial try but it was only because I was trying to use up old stuff/cut costs. After a month I went online and reordered The Three Little Miracles (Truth Serum, Invigorating Night Gel and Sheer Transformation). I missed it too much. Since that deviation I have not bought any other brand for my regular skin routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin Regimen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Ole Henricksen I also use: Invigorating Night Gel, Sheer Transformation, and alternate between African Red Tea Foaming Cleanser and Truth to Go Wipes. I have used the power peel system (Ole Henricksen) three times and I do use retnoids, however when I used retinoids alone my skin still looked pretty crummy so I know that Ole Henricksen products are doing something!</li>
            <li> Love this serum...goes on easy you do not need a lot so it lasts. I use all ole products but this was the first that started the obsession. Makes skin look healthy n bright.. after u use this n the truth oil u only need a small amount of cream so everything lasts a while but your skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I had received a sample and was excited when I found this on line. I really like this product.  Finally something that  works and does not break out my skin. Will go back for more in the near future.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Will buy it again. You will see the result in 10 days.  This is second time I brought it</li>
            <li> worried about ur skin future... this is really good, keeps skin in good conditions, it looks better next day and its not so oily so u can use it at daytime</li>
            <li> I bought this with the rest of the Truth line (based on a sample I used and loved) and I really like it. First, it smells divine-a citrus vanilla scent that&#x27;s fresh but not cloying. Second, it makes my skin, usually dry, very clear and soft. I do not find it irritating. I&#x27;m using it in summer and it&#x27;s not making me oily and I do sometimes use a moisturizer with it (not Ole H)because it does not provide a lot of mositure. If I had oilier skin it might be enough on its own. I use it at night and I do not wake up with anything unexpected (breakouts, oil, puffiness)and it has made my skin clear and soft. I&#x27;m really loving this line.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months and I can tell a BIG difference in my skin. I have sensitive skin and have NOT experienced any breakouts like one of the reviewers noted. My skin feels nourished and looks healthy!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it......</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the texture.  It feels wonderful on my skin. I dont know if I see much of a difference though</li>
            <li> I got a full 1 oz bottle as part of hand held face scrubber. It smells wonderful, citrus with lemon and absorbs into the skin well. I have it almost gone but have not seen really any difference in my skin thought have read on Dr Oz website vitamin C is great for your skin. As other reviewers have stated a moisturizer on top is a must and one pump is plenty for my face and neck. For the price, I doubt I will purchase my next bottle.</li>
            <li> Got a sample, tried it.  Loved it! You will too!</li>
            <li> Great serum,  I&#x27;m seeing improve with my skin tone after few times that I start using it.  Try it you will be happy</li>
            <li> Made me breakout, so I just use it near my eyes for added brightness</li>
            <li> I love this serum, its light weight and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product. I have a mixt type of skin and after a couple of days of using this serum my skin looks better, my skin is brighter.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product, I actually notice a difference in appearance when I use it unlike so many other pricey beauty products. I am disappointed though that it contains Yellow 6 a petroleum based dye that has a number of potential health concerns. I would be happier to trade off the bright, cheery color for the peace of mind of knowing I was not slathering a possible carcinogen on my face. Yuk.</li>
            <li> a little bit too expensive. but the smell is great. not a bad product, but next time I will order bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> If u have sensitive skin like me, dont even try it ! Its the fifth day and i broke out in pimples and hives and it itches uncontrollably. I regret it so much and i just want to give a heads up before u try it!</li>
            <li> I use a few of the Obaji products, but heard about this one and thought it was worth a try.  Immediately I saw a difference in my skin.  It is tighter without being drying.  My husband also noticed the difference after just a few days.  I use it at night after cleaning my skin, using the Obaji products on top.  Such a nice surpise to find something that really works on older skin.</li>
            <li> Ole Henriksen truth serum:  The most wonderful product I have found.  I look forward to using it every morning and can see a difference in the texture of my skin.  At 64 that means a lot.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> The Truth Serum Collagen Booster is a good way to prevent sun and environmental damage to skin.  I use it every morning before I put on my sunscreen.  The serum has a light, nice scent and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel too tight after I put it on.  However, you would probably want to use some kind of moisturizer after applying the serum.  One pump is enough to cover my entire face, neck, and decollete area (a good reminder not to skip those areas!).  I am fairly young so I haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic improvement but my skin is a little brighter and I haven&#x27;t seen any new sun/pollution/environmental damage to my skin.  I&#x27;ve read that Vitamin C can be irritating but the Vitamin C derivative in the Truth Serum has not irritated my sensitive skin at all.     All of Ole Henriksen&#x27;s products are great!  They are pretty reasonably priced, smell good, work great, and are made with a lot of natural ingredients.  I also recommend the Black Currant Energizing Complexion Oil.  It is excellent for additional skin protection during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I was worried it would cause breakouts because it is a serum, not even close.  My skin has  glow about it.  Best skin care product I have ever found.</li>
            <li> Wish I had had this product 20 years ago, but better late than never.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take long to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this serum through a sample at a big name beauty store.  My first impression was how much I loved the scent.  It smells like the freshest oranges, yum!  On application this serum initially feels a little sticky but quickly goes away.  The results I have noticed from this serum are brighter, more youthful-looking skin.  I wish this was offered in a vat as I never want to be without it.  It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> I would love this product if Ole Henriksen didn&#x27;t use an orange pigment that is a known carcinogen.  If they could just take out the unnecessary pigment this product would be fantastic!  The Vitamin C the skin absorbs is most likely not a benefit when you consider the poison the skin also absorbs from the pigment.  :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google \\&quot;Yellow #6\\&quot; and you can see for yourself why this dye shouldn&#x27;t be in the product.</li>
            <li> Great product. It works very well at keeping my face hydrated and looking youthful. I usually apply this right out of the shower, my face still damp. I then finish off with Clinque&#x27;s Moisture Surge Overnight Mask, My face stays soft and supple all day.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me (though I highly doubt that, considering some reviews I read after having an adverse reaction to this product) but my über-sensitive skin HATED this serum. I wanted so badly to love it--and let me preface this by saying that I love every other Ole Henriksen product I&#x27;ve ever tried!! Unfortunately, this serum made me break out within three nights of using it...BADLY, and I never break out. I found out later from a skincare-smart sales associate that the vitamin C in this product is likely unstable, as the container it comes in is a clear glass bottle that likely lets some air in. Perhaps a packaging change to opaque plastic would help. I&#x27;m not saying this serum won&#x27;t work for everyone--I personally know many who swear by its brightening prowess--but for those of you with sensitive skin, I beg of you--try a sample first!!!</li>
            <li> Sure, this feels great and smooth, thanks to a beautifully composed texture. But what % of vitamin C is in it? If it contained 20%, 15%, or even 10%--that would be good enough make a claim on the package. But nowhere is this even stated-- for all i know, there could be a mere 5-7% of vitamin C and i wouldn&#x27;t know it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, Vitamin C destabilizes over time. That&#x27;s why, if you have the choice of 10% or 20% vitamin C, ALWAYS CHOOSE THE HIGHER STRENGTH. because eventually, the 20% will become 10%. Freshness and stability is paramount in C products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, this is a cosmetically elegant formulation, but i would rather pay more money to know what i&#x27;m getting.</li>
            <li> Noticing a brighter look to my complexion.</li>
            <li> A great serum. It took a little while, but then I noticed my skin is almost flawless. I am 52 so that is almost unbelievable to me. Now, let me state that I do have those annoying forehead wrinkles but I wear bangs so I can get away with that for the most part. I do want to let you know I use all of ole&#x27;s products. The sheer frans moist and the vit c moist together. I have a lot of his products - obsessed with them. A really good Li e for the money. Use something in the line, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I didnt buy mine from amazon. I got this from sephora for 200 points using my reward card. O.25 ounce.  I only used this for 4 days and my skin feels brighter and super hydrated.  I have skin redness problem whenever I feel hot or dehydrated.  But after I applied this serum, I dont  have redness anymore. It is like magic, seriously. I am also taking amino acid, collagen orally.that may have helped too. But still after few days, no more red cheeks. It is crazy.</li>
            <li> Best Vitamin C serum out there. Don&#x27;t live without it!</li>
