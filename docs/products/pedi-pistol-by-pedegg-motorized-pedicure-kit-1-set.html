    <ol>
            <li>I arrive at his time, very good, I recommend the product.</li>
            <li>it was very good</li>
            <li>Excellent product, very good price, I love, is as I saw it on the internet.</li>
            <li>Great set of accessories for the price.</li>
            <li>This is a great item.</li>
            <li>I am delighted with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, beautiful color, good material, it received in due time, very good price.</li>
            <li>I guess I was just expecting more.</li>
            <li>I like being able to care for my feet myself.  </li>
            <li>They look and feel much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok after awhile one of the attachments broke.</li>
            <li>You get what you paid for thats for sure.</li>
            <li>Five of the tools needed most where not in the box.</li>
            <li>Probably more than you need.</li>
            <li>Throw away the big,useless, underpowered unit and use the accessories with the better unit.</li>
            <li>The Pedi-Pistol sure looks like a good idea, and it also comes with a lot of attachments that would be very helpful (I think) --- if the Pedi had the power to run them.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t file very quickly or evenly.</li>
            <li>Now that it is in, it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>but you need a really steady hand to do a good job.</li>
            <li>I have informed inquiring friends that it is available on the Amazon website.</li>
            <li>there is nothing precise you can do.  </li>
            <li>this product have different items for all your needs and its makes her feet feels so much better and looks good to try it</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this product that I immediately opened it when it arrived</li>
            <li>but then I tried to use also - it is ok but really</li>
            <li>This got rid of it quickly.</li>
            <li>Not exactly what I had in mind but a good product.  </li>
            <li>If you have a unit that takes the standard round accessories, this is a great buy!</li>
            <li>As a senior who can&#x27;t bend over, I find this to be very helpful in being independent by shaping my own toenails.  </li>
            <li>I love it very very much and ships very past too love this web page !</li>
            <li>First of all it is under powered.  </li>
            <li>This is a great idea that falls a little short on delivery.</li>
            <li>You shove one of the attachments into the nose of this thing until it wont go in any farther, pull the trigger, and the piece wobbles around so much</li>
            <li>Yeah it may let you NOT bend over as much but does not have power to it and does not work well.</li>
            <li>but I was really looking for a scissors that had an extension to it.</li>
            <li>Most of the attachments really don&#x27;t are not useful.</li>
            <li>With the winter drying out my skin and because I walk around the house barefoot all the time I had developed a cslous that really hurt.  </li>
            <li>I went out and purchased new batteries ..</li>
            <li>Even with brand new batteries that I put in it, the power was so weak, it didn&#x27;t begin to erase my callouses and it was very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Product arrived very quickly but that was the only plus, the motor works once you put the batteries (not included) in , but as soon as you try to add one of the drill/file bits thats it, if you push it too far in the motor stops, if you pull it out a little it flies out, since it was only $12 i couldnt even be bothered to go to the hassle of trying to send it back, it just went straight in the trash</li>
            <li>this needs to go back to the drawing board for a new and improved model ...</li>
            <li>First I was surprised to find that what was sent to me, was black, not white as is mentioned.</li>
            <li>Secondly, the unit does not really spin fast enough to do the job properly.</li>

            <li> not worth the money even as low a price as i got it.</li>
            <li> If you have 20 minutes you might get one nail sanded down before the part falls out or flat wears out or the batteries run down.  </li>
            <li> It is quite a disappointment and cannot even decently file a nail without stopping and starting ...</li>
            <li> I actually got this for my Mother...too hard for her to use (she is 80)</li>
            <li> not worth the money.</li>
            <li> However, the attachments are not the ones typically seen with the product when it&#x27;s advertised.</li>
            <li> Just put a little pressure on your toe nail and it stops running.  </li>
            <li> I have tried different brands of batteries in this hoping I had weak batteries.</li>
            <li> Someone had to help me push in the little file connections, because I have arthritis in my fingers.</li>
            <li> can.&lt;br /&gt;complete waste of time</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste ur money!</li>
            <li> I need to use at least 20 words to describe what a piece of junk this is.  </li>
            <li> Oh, also, the instructions are very vague, and not much help.</li>
            <li> Took hours and still the results were poor.</li>
            <li> i was not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have a weak Pedi-Pistol!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, I just added this to my donate pile.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> doesnt work if any pressure put on it. not worth the money even as low a price as i got it.</li>
            <li> The Pedi Pistol Motorized Pedicure Kit does work as advertised. I have informed inquiring friends that it is available on the Amazon website.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see... I need to use at least 20 words to describe what a piece of junk this is.  First of all it is under powered.  Just put a little pressure on your toe nail and it stops running.  There are no instructions.  You can guess how to insert the batteries.  You shove one of the attachments into the nose of this thing until it wont go in any farther, pull the trigger, and the piece wobbles around so much there is nothing precise you can do.  Says on the box no bending -- That&#x27;s a lie.  How else are you going pick up the parts when they fall out of the gun?  Says on the box trims --  Another lie.  Sanding is not trimming.  Grinding is not trimming.  If you have 20 minutes you might get one nail sanded down before the part falls out or flat wears out or the batteries run down.  Don&#x27;t be like me and think about taking a chance that this will work for you because it wont.</li>
            <li> save your money I had a hip replacement and thought this might help with maintaining my hip precautions.  Very disappointed, I just added this to my donate pile.</li>
            <li> First I was surprised to find that what was sent to me, was black, not white as is mentioned. Secondly, the unit does not really spin fast enough to do the job properly. I guess I was just expecting more. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase it again.  Oh, also, the instructions are very vague, and not much help.</li>
            <li> Pedi-Pistol works for me. Beats going to the Nail Shop.  I like being able to care for my feet myself.  They look and feel much better.</li>
            <li> I actually got this for my Mother...too hard for her to use (she is 80) but then I tried to use also - it is ok but really not what I thought it would be...I thought there was an attachment for trimming nails.  Most of the attachments really don&#x27;t are not useful.</li>
            <li> Def. not worth the money. Yeah it may let you NOT bend over as much but does not have power to it and does not work well. I used it twice and now it just sits there....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok after awhile one of the attachments broke. It&#x27;s too bulky but it does get the work done. You get what you paid for thats for sure.</li>
            <li> Even with brand new batteries that I put in it, the power was so weak, it didn&#x27;t begin to erase my callouses and it was very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this product that I immediately opened it when it arrived but it didn&#x27;t even work!! AT ALL!! I went out and purchased new batteries .. AND NOTHING!!!! Don&#x27;t waste ur money!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t file very quickly or evenly. Took hours and still the results were poor. Five of the tools needed most where not in the box.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea that falls a little short on delivery. I do use it but you need a really steady hand to do a good job. Has lots of attachments. Probably more than you need. Still, I don&#x27;t regret the purchase.</li>
            <li> The Pedi-Pistol sure looks like a good idea, and it also comes with a lot of attachments that would be very helpful (I think) --- if the Pedi had the power to run them. I have tried different brands of batteries in this hoping I had weak batteries. No Luck. I have a weak Pedi-Pistol! It is quite a disappointment and cannot even decently file a nail without stopping and starting ... this needs to go back to the drawing board for a new and improved model ... I need a Pedi-Pistol that packs a punch! In the meantime, save your hard-earned cash, my friends, because this is quite a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> no power to do anything. waisted money</li>
            <li> If you have a unit that takes the standard round accessories, this is a great buy! Throw away the big,useless, underpowered unit and use the accessories with the better unit. Great set of accessories for the price.</li>
            <li> As a senior who can&#x27;t bend over, I find this to be very helpful in being independent by shaping my own toenails.  Someone had to help me push in the little file connections, because I have arthritis in my fingers. Now that it is in, it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> These items are helpful but I was really looking for a scissors that had an extension to it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived very quickly but that was the only plus, the motor works once you put the batteries (not included) in , but as soon as you try to add one of the drill/file bits thats it, if you push it too far in the motor stops, if you pull it out a little it flies out, since it was only $12 i couldnt even be bothered to go to the hassle of trying to send it back, it just went straight in the trash can.&lt;br /&gt;complete waste of time</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I had in mind but a good product.  The design is made in such a way as to make it easier to reach your feet without bending and contorting your body.  However, the attachments are not the ones typically seen with the product when it&#x27;s advertised.</li>
            <li> this product have different items for all your needs and its makes her feet feels so much better and looks good to try it i know your wifes or girlfriends will thank u for it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, very good price, I love, is as I saw it on the internet. I arrive at his time, very good, I recommend the product. Excellent product, beautiful color, good material, it received in due time, very good price. I am delighted with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a great item. With the winter drying out my skin and because I walk around the house barefoot all the time I had developed a cslous that really hurt.  This got rid of it quickly.</li>
            <li> it was very good I love it very very much and ships very past too love this web page !</li>
            <li> this was an item that is all plastic and just is a no functioning purchase. i was not happy with this purchase.</li>
