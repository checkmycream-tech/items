            <li>scholl fungal nail treatment was effective .</li>
            <li>Since it was hazardous and flammable, I immediately threw it away.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works really good.</li>
            <li>It does seems to be the best I have tried so far and will try it again , once this product is done .</li>
            <li>Easy to use and efficient!</li>
            <li>Works great and fast!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and quite effective.</li>
            <li>Ordered 2 more to maintain the result</li>
            <li>Bought 2 more bottles to continue treatment.</li>
            <li>Sunshine, sunshine and more sunshine.</li>
            <li>The more sunshine the better.</li>
            <li>it is okay</li>
            <li>maybe I need more time</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t see any results I got kerasal amd that works a lot better</li>
            <li>Works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did because it worked.</li>
            <li>and i have tried many others before.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I started noticing clearing in 48 hours on most of my nails.  </li>
            <li>(mostly Vinegar</li>
            <li>purchased this product to try, even though, my fungus has been growing on my toenails (except for one) for many years.  </li>
            <li>I have 4 more months to use it once a week</li>
            <li>This step seems to make the most progress and expose more nail to be treated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it continues, but I must admit it&#x27;s worked better than any product I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>Will continue using for one more week.</li>
            <li>I am pleased to say that I think it is working to correct my toe nails.  </li>
            <li>That was many years ago.  </li>
            <li>My nails look better than they ever have.  </li>
            <li>If you re-order, you will get more nail files which you probably don&#x27;t need...</li>
            <li>Perhaps my nails were more infected than is recommended in the included pamphlet for this product.</li>
            <li>Perhaps my nails were more infected than is recommended in the included pamphlet for this product.</li>
            <li>I have used Fungisil that works better</li>
            <li>Bottle opens at the top...</li>
            <li>hold the liquid part and then turn the top.  </li>
            <li>this idem works better then</li>
            <li>but I had a very significant case on just one toe</li>
            <li>Best treatment that I&#x27;ve used so far , I&#x27;ve used everything over the counter plus went to a podiatrist without much success .</li>
            <li>I truly believe this works and easy to use and remember as brushing your teeth :-)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has been 5 months since I started using this product and my nails have grown out healthy and strong.  </li>
            <li>Surprised that the item came from Europe but extremely happy I was able to get it.</li>
            <li>I am in the eighth week of treatment and the unsightly fungus on my left great toe is clearing nicely.  </li>
            <li>it treats those un sightly areas, feels better, not over priced, good fast delivery.</li>
            <li>pretty good look fantastic</li>
            <li>bought this Scholl Fungal Treatment, and determined that while the liquid itself is on par with everything else out there, the method of filing the nail first is what makes the delivery of any fungal medication much more effective.</li>
            <li>I am hopeful that both great toenails will be clear after I treat them another eight weeks.  </li>
            <li>The brush is easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>company was so easy to do business with too.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll try it for a few months more and hope for the best.</li>
            <li>There is no smell, it goes on easy.  </li>
            <li>STRONG recommended for every one.</li>
            <li>Made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>If it works GREAT, my toenails will finally see the light.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t truly rate it accurately.</li>
            <li>UV (light) kills the fungus,</li>
            <li>something that was important to me.  </li>
            <li>it actually worked great.</li>
            <li>After three weeks the nail was about 70% fungal free.</li>
            <li>The nail bed had a wave to it that with the nail file that comes with bottle the the nail bed became smooth and the waves went away.  </li>
            <li>I have a light case of toe fungus that has been growing, which is freaking me out.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The results on the right great toe look promising, but the fungus is still evident.  </li>
            <li>full kit&lt;br /&gt;- detailed instructions</li>
            <li>I really love this product, because of all of the fungal nail products I have tried, this one really works!</li>
            <li>the reviews, this clearly doesn&#x27;t work for everyone - but after 2 treatments and time to let the nails grow out, I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>.. clean as a whistle.  </li>
            <li>One thing that I found is that the instruction wilh the product is much more clear than the description you can get when you purchase, so you know more what you can expect from it.</li>
            <li>the wait is just your body growing clean nails</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>Your nails receive a healthy dose of Vitamin D keeping your new growth strong.</li>
            <li>I expecting more for the reviews but really doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>My feet actually look really good now</li>
            <li>if *symptoms have persisted for longer than 2 years; *discoloration has covered the whole surface of the nail ; *symptoms are shown in more than two toes/fingers&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>This product really works but you need to be patient and follow the instructions, I started using this treatment June 2014 and now 9 months after my toenail is 70% better</li>
            <li>The instrument toons are easy to follow and really help make the fungal infection disappear !</li>
            <li>I was leery of trying the other &amp;#34;no name&amp;#34; brands and read great reviews on this one.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was actually quick since shipped from overseas.</li>
            <li>i discontinued using this product and dipped my toes in vinegar to stop any fungus from spreading luckily</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference in the first 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought two of these because I did not notice too much of a change with the first bottle.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery,HAPPY NEW YEAR  100 % satisfactions ,Good working ,clear instruction easy working product.</li>
            <li>Rather than dropping more than $150 at the dermatologist or using some of the less well rated treatments, I took a chance and spent a bit of money for this system and the results are great!</li>
            <li>Since it is considered cosmetic and not covered by insurance, this seemed worth a try.</li>
            <li>I will probable continue to do the one problem nail a couple times a week just to make sure it gets a good dose, but I&#x27;ll have to come back here next year and either upgrade it or downgrade it based on the results.  </li>
            <li>but I have had periods of success before.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth the wait to get it.</li>
            <li>Is it worth contiuing/</li>
            <li>The nails are now clear and healthy after four weeks.</li>
            <li>It was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>(the vinegar was awesome, all the old and dead skin fell off in layers!)</li>
            <li>balabala, but inside description says it&#x27;s suitable for only two toes/fingers.</li>
            <li>He was right about the first part.</li>
            <li>This is the only topical product that appears to be combating the long-term and stubborn fungal infection on my great toes.</li>
            <li>Did not give 5 stars because I am still in the process of treatment but looks very promising.</li>
            <li>This is the first thing that really substantially worked!</li>
            <li>But the first time I unscrewed the bottle, about 1/3 of the liquid spilled out.</li>
            <li>The correct opening method would have been more obvious if the bottle was separate from the rest of the unit.</li>
            <li>I had two nails with some moderate whitishness, and they look better but not cured (which is consistent with what the mfr says you will see at this point in treatment).  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li>It must be ok for those with fungus, however it turned out my problem had nothing to do with fungus, so medically can&#x27;t say?  </li>
            <li>I had just gotten a prescription for the pills,  but why not try this first?</li>
            <li>There are many different fungus types you could have.</li>
            <li>It is the first time I found something that worked in my nail.</li>
            <li>I would suggest modifying the directions somewhat by filing more after the initial series of filing.</li>
            <li>I believe that most of the improvement in appearance is related to aggressive filing, removing the yellowed crumbly part and keeping the nails neat looking.</li>
            <li>I believe that most of the improvement in appearance is related to aggressive filing, removing the yellowed crumbly part and keeping the nails neat looking.</li>
            <li>The first bottle I used exactly as specified until it ran out.</li>
            <li>My fungal big toe on both feet are getting better.  </li>
            <li>Just follow the directions exactly as given.</li>
            <li>Be aware: the web description says it kills 99% of nail fungal...</li>
            <li>He said it most likely wouldn&#x27;t work, and nothing else would either.</li>
            <li>what happened at first i was using it on my most infected toe only and it seemed to be working</li>
            <li>After a month the fungus has stopped and I can clearly see where the healthy new nail is growing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In desperation, I searched Amazon for somethign with positive reviews, and found this.</li>
            <li>I really thought this was working &amp; even doubled up on the first part.</li>
            <li>What it wants is warm, moist and dark conditions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working very well.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t give the fungus what it wants.</li>
            <li>I bought an 8 months supply to see it it really works and</li>
            <li>It works really</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t file off too much at a time.....</li>
            <li>I hope this is the time it really does the trick but time alone</li>
            <li>and it proceeded to kill my whole nail, not get rid of the fungus.</li>
            <li>Thanks you</li>
            <li>I gave it 5 starts because it really works.</li>
            <li>It work fast.</li>
            <li>That said my results are better than I expected from a &amp;#34;patent&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Hasnt  done much for my fungus</li>
            <li>highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my sister, it works very well.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>I gave it a 5 star because it really works.</li>
            <li>It works fast.</li>
            <li>but they really did not work.</li>
            <li>It works very well, though it takes time.</li>
            <li>After a month, the infected tissue returned to a healthy pink color.</li>
            <li>The ONLY thing that will kill nail fungus completely (and I wish more people knew about it) is sunshine.</li>
            <li>I think it has worked better than any of the other fungal treatments I have used.</li>
            <li>and itr really improving my toe nail to look almost normal.</li>
            <li>tried it out on a mild infection but simply did not work, even though I followed the instructions to the letter.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It says it only works on nails with a new mild case and takes one year</li>
            <li>If this is working it&#x27;s because I am very diligent to the process and getting a good coat of the product down to the cuticle and the extreme side of the infected nail.</li>
            <li>Due to the top heavy nature of the container, it is easy to knock it over.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of treatments to get rid of a really persistent fungus that started a couple summers ago when I painted my toenails quite often but didn&#x27;t take off the old paint in between.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how fast it started to work.</li>
            <li>I am so relieved that my toenail is already halfway to normal grown out.</li>
            <li>Makes my nails look almost normal.... been using it for 2 months now</li>
            <li>The color is returning to normal.</li>
            <li>I hope to have healthy nails in a few months.</li>
            <li>Though normally I would not post a review before the results of the product could definitively be determined, several factors seem worth noting to those considering a purchase of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay, I have tried quite a few products, including the prescription pill (stopped the pill as I felt like,</li>
            <li>You needto stay on top of the &amp;#34;sanding&amp;#34; and keep the nails pruned back as far as possible to give it a chance to work.  </li>
            <li>The smallest nail is now clear and no longer yellow, and the other nails are progressing nicely too.</li>
            <li>The smallest nail is now clear and no longer yellow, and the other nails are progressing nicely too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go to a doctor right away next time.</li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitate to order from Ireland, thinking it would take too long, but I received it quickly so that I could use it within a week....</li>
            <li>Anyway the bottle is pretty tiny and if you have more than one nail it won&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>the bottle does not last long but so far it is okay still waiting for results</li>
            <li>I just need to be a little more patient and wait until my nail grow up completely.</li>
            <li>Fungi live off moisture.</li>
            <li>That is supposed to kill the fungus, then you just put the stuff on once a week, to prevent any new infection.  </li>
            <li>and the new nail is almost fully in.</li>
            <li>Am still using this product and hoping the results will live up to the advertisement.  </li>
            <li>I had an advanced case that I have been treating with over the counter remedies for years with no success.</li>
            <li>Please be aware that the included emery boards will not be enough.</li>
            <li>I spilled about a third of the liquid the first time I opened it.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>I also found this in the UK and it is the first product that actually works.  </li>
            <li>As of right now, my pinkie toenails are clear and both big toes are about 75% clear.</li>
            <li>I had mild infections in several toenails except for one nail that was growing funny - white and big.  </li>
            <li>This might work for some people, and I think it would have been fine for me if my case had been mild - but it appears my fungus grew resistant to this solution, and in fact I was getting worse.  </li>
            <li>My one nail that was growing odd also seems better but it definitely has a ways to go.  </li>
            <li>I found the Dr. Paul&#x27;s Gel paste much more effective, and much less expensive.</li>
            <li>Daily use for fours week&#x27;s &amp; weekly thereafter with strict following of instructions, General footwear &amp; shoe rotation &amp; socks that wick away moisture &amp; you will have nothing but success !</li>
            <li>After 10 days it is almost completely clear.  </li>
            <li>had 8 infected toenails and after 3 weeks, had 7 clear nails and was wearing sandals again!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think I see the nail growing out clear but after 5 months I am trying to be patient, like the directions said.</li>
            <li>the routine, it is clearly working.  </li>
            <li>It dries the nails out completely (moisture gone).</li>
            <li>Use suncream to prevent sunburn and get those feet out into as much sunshine as possible.</li>
            <li>I had fungus on all nails and after 12 months of as much sunshine as possible</li>
            <li>so far I have to continue using it and</li>
            <li>It does not works in all cases, only when the infection is not on the whole nail.  </li>
            <li>After showering, when the nail is soft, I used the metal burr and filed away at all parts of the nail that are thickened or discolored.</li>
            <li>I have tried this product for 3-4 weeks so far.</li>
            <li>Too early to say whether it works or not.  </li>
            <li>You just have to continue with the treatments and not give up too early.</li>
            <li>You just have to continue with the treatments and not give up too early.</li>
            <li>But so far, based on results, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>So far - filing away and seems to stop spread.  </li>
            <li>Now all my nails are growing better than ever, I hope few weeks later I can see all of them are cued.</li>
            <li>Get the nail as thin as you can so the cream will be effective.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and all in a portable little package!</li>
            <li>The included instructions depict nails that are only moderately infected and indicate that the product is not recommended if you have any more than a slight infection, i.e. a yellowing of the nail.</li>
            <li>After searching high and low, I stumbled across this while travelling in the UK and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I was really discouraged because I followed the instructions for a long time and nothing happened</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a complete kit and it is worth reading through the instructions CAREFULLY before starting treatment.</li>
            <li>I lost my entire big toe nail on the left foot and almost lost the one on right.</li>
            <li>AFTER 8 WEEKS OF CONTINUOUS USE: I have continued to file my nails down weekly and apply the liquid daily, and can definitely see that more than a third of the large toe nail bed is now pink, with the old, yellowed flaky part diminishing week by week (as I file it off).</li>
            <li>: I have continued to file my nails down weekly and apply the liquid daily, and can definitely see that more than a third of the large toe nail bed is now pink, with the old, yellowed flaky part diminishing week by week (as I file it off).</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t order just the liquid; the package includes the very rough nail files which are discarded after weekly use for the first 4 or 5 weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I searched high and low for this in the states and finally found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I rotate the Vinegar bath with a salt water bath and a (clear) listerine bath (I am planning to mix in a bleach solution bath and hydrogen peroxide bath shortly).  </li>
            <li>I started the program about 2 months ago and the nail bed is growing back clear.</li>
            <li>It will take months for the lost nail to grow back, but the fungus is clearly under control.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this item for one month, so it is too early to tell if it will provide a benefit.</li>
            <li>Have several weeks to go, but so far, works well.  </li>
            <li>product seems to work so far but only one week now, my problem is on Dec. 30</li>
            <li>Apparently mine is severe.</li>
            <li>so far, this is the only nail fungus treatment that makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Plenty of product to last the 9 months of complete &amp;#34;extinction&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m following the directions completely.  </li>
            <li>My guess is you can only get the fungus under control, maybe not ever completely get rid of it.  </li>
            <li>You will need several bottles of the liquid in order to complete the recommended treatment of up to 9 months to grow out the infected nail.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>That was nearly two years ago and the nail still hasn&#x27;t grown back in.</li>
            <li>There is not enough liquid to complete the treatment as described.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many homemade remedies including Vicks Vapor Rub and the worse, diluted Clorox.  </li>
            <li>In thirteen months, the top of the toenail is broken.</li>
            <li>Four months later with a little more very careful trimming</li>
            <li>Best stuff you can find to get rid of the nasty nail fungus THAT YOU GET FROM THE NEW BEAUTY SALON</li>
            <li>I used the first two bottles as directed, and now I use it every other or third day, also painting on a cheaper fungus prevention medicine on the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; nails to prevent re-infection.</li>
            <li>The contents of the tiny bottle are .12 ounce - that&#x27;s right - slightly over a tenth of an ounce.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>Really file your nail bed down before doing this treatment with a large rough file.  </li>
            <li>This does not smell at all an dries relativiely fast compared to the other ones.</li>
            <li>I now have about half an inch of clear nail below the previously infected area and am running out of my original product and just ordered a replacement product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a second dose - and to be honest, a rotary tool and some sanding bands - because the two nails that didn&#x27;t clear up were so thick that the little file simply could not file through them.  </li>
            <li>So far on 3rd stage and has made big difference.</li>
            <li>It will likely take  four to six bottles of Sholls Fungal Nail Treatment to complete the entire regimen for me as my nails were severely infected.</li>
            <li>I can now say, after a decade long battle against fungus, that my nails are clear.</li>
            <li>I tried this out after trying many other products that didn&#x27;t work, and this one is a failure as well.</li>
            <li>but I see a little different not as much</li>
    </ol>

            <li> scholl fungal nail treatment was effective .</li>
            <li> Since it was hazardous and flammable, I immediately threw it away.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works really good.</li>
            <li> It does seems to be the best I have tried so far and will try it again , once this product is done .</li>
            <li> Easy to use and efficient!</li>
            <li> Works great and fast!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and quite effective.</li>
            <li> Ordered 2 more to maintain the result</li>
            <li> Bought 2 more bottles to continue treatment.</li>
            <li> Sunshine, sunshine and more sunshine.</li>
            <li> The more sunshine the better.</li>
            <li> it is okay</li>
            <li> maybe I need more time</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t see any results I got kerasal amd that works a lot better</li>
            <li> Works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I did because it worked.</li>
            <li> and i have tried many others before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I started noticing clearing in 48 hours on most of my nails.  </li>
            <li> (mostly Vinegar</li>
            <li> purchased this product to try, even though, my fungus has been growing on my toenails (except for one) for many years.  </li>
            <li> I have 4 more months to use it once a week</li>
            <li> This step seems to make the most progress and expose more nail to be treated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it continues, but I must admit it&#x27;s worked better than any product I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> Will continue using for one more week.</li>
            <li> I am pleased to say that I think it is working to correct my toe nails.  </li>
            <li> That was many years ago.  </li>
            <li> My nails look better than they ever have.  </li>
            <li> If you re-order, you will get more nail files which you probably don&#x27;t need...</li>
            <li> Perhaps my nails were more infected than is recommended in the included pamphlet for this product.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my nails were more infected than is recommended in the included pamphlet for this product.</li>
            <li> I have used Fungisil that works better</li>
            <li> Bottle opens at the top...</li>
            <li> hold the liquid part and then turn the top.  </li>
            <li> this idem works better then</li>
            <li> but I had a very significant case on just one toe</li>
            <li> Best treatment that I&#x27;ve used so far , I&#x27;ve used everything over the counter plus went to a podiatrist without much success .</li>
            <li> I truly believe this works and easy to use and remember as brushing your teeth :-)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has been 5 months since I started using this product and my nails have grown out healthy and strong.  </li>
            <li> Surprised that the item came from Europe but extremely happy I was able to get it.</li>
            <li> I am in the eighth week of treatment and the unsightly fungus on my left great toe is clearing nicely.  </li>
            <li> it treats those un sightly areas, feels better, not over priced, good fast delivery.</li>
            <li> pretty good look fantastic</li>
            <li> bought this Scholl Fungal Treatment, and determined that while the liquid itself is on par with everything else out there, the method of filing the nail first is what makes the delivery of any fungal medication much more effective.</li>
            <li> I am hopeful that both great toenails will be clear after I treat them another eight weeks.  </li>
            <li> The brush is easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> company was so easy to do business with too.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll try it for a few months more and hope for the best.</li>
            <li> There is no smell, it goes on easy.  </li>
            <li> STRONG recommended for every one.</li>
            <li> Made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> If it works GREAT, my toenails will finally see the light.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t truly rate it accurately.</li>
            <li> UV (light) kills the fungus,</li>
            <li> something that was important to me.  </li>
            <li> it actually worked great.</li>
            <li> After three weeks the nail was about 70% fungal free.</li>
            <li> The nail bed had a wave to it that with the nail file that comes with bottle the the nail bed became smooth and the waves went away.  </li>
            <li> I have a light case of toe fungus that has been growing, which is freaking me out.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> The results on the right great toe look promising, but the fungus is still evident.  </li>
            <li> full kit&lt;br /&gt;- detailed instructions</li>
            <li> I really love this product, because of all of the fungal nail products I have tried, this one really works!</li>
            <li> the reviews, this clearly doesn&#x27;t work for everyone - but after 2 treatments and time to let the nails grow out, I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> .. clean as a whistle.  </li>
            <li> One thing that I found is that the instruction wilh the product is much more clear than the description you can get when you purchase, so you know more what you can expect from it.</li>
            <li> the wait is just your body growing clean nails</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> Your nails receive a healthy dose of Vitamin D keeping your new growth strong.</li>
            <li> I expecting more for the reviews but really doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> My feet actually look really good now</li>
            <li> if *symptoms have persisted for longer than 2 years; *discoloration has covered the whole surface of the nail ; *symptoms are shown in more than two toes/fingers&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> This product really works but you need to be patient and follow the instructions, I started using this treatment June 2014 and now 9 months after my toenail is 70% better</li>
            <li> The instrument toons are easy to follow and really help make the fungal infection disappear !</li>
            <li> I was leery of trying the other &amp;#34;no name&amp;#34; brands and read great reviews on this one.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was actually quick since shipped from overseas.</li>
            <li> i discontinued using this product and dipped my toes in vinegar to stop any fungus from spreading luckily</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference in the first 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought two of these because I did not notice too much of a change with the first bottle.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery,HAPPY NEW YEAR  100 % satisfactions ,Good working ,clear instruction easy working product.</li>
            <li> Rather than dropping more than $150 at the dermatologist or using some of the less well rated treatments, I took a chance and spent a bit of money for this system and the results are great!</li>
            <li> Since it is considered cosmetic and not covered by insurance, this seemed worth a try.</li>
            <li> I will probable continue to do the one problem nail a couple times a week just to make sure it gets a good dose, but I&#x27;ll have to come back here next year and either upgrade it or downgrade it based on the results.  </li>
            <li> but I have had periods of success before.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth the wait to get it.</li>
            <li> Is it worth contiuing/</li>
            <li> The nails are now clear and healthy after four weeks.</li>
            <li> It was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> (the vinegar was awesome, all the old and dead skin fell off in layers!)</li>
            <li> balabala, but inside description says it&#x27;s suitable for only two toes/fingers.</li>
            <li> He was right about the first part.</li>
            <li> This is the only topical product that appears to be combating the long-term and stubborn fungal infection on my great toes.</li>
            <li> Did not give 5 stars because I am still in the process of treatment but looks very promising.</li>
            <li> This is the first thing that really substantially worked!</li>
            <li> But the first time I unscrewed the bottle, about 1/3 of the liquid spilled out.</li>
            <li> The correct opening method would have been more obvious if the bottle was separate from the rest of the unit.</li>
            <li> I had two nails with some moderate whitishness, and they look better but not cured (which is consistent with what the mfr says you will see at this point in treatment).  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li> It must be ok for those with fungus, however it turned out my problem had nothing to do with fungus, so medically can&#x27;t say?  </li>
            <li> I had just gotten a prescription for the pills,  but why not try this first?</li>
            <li> There are many different fungus types you could have.</li>
            <li> It is the first time I found something that worked in my nail.</li>
            <li> I would suggest modifying the directions somewhat by filing more after the initial series of filing.</li>
            <li> I believe that most of the improvement in appearance is related to aggressive filing, removing the yellowed crumbly part and keeping the nails neat looking.</li>
            <li> I believe that most of the improvement in appearance is related to aggressive filing, removing the yellowed crumbly part and keeping the nails neat looking.</li>
            <li> The first bottle I used exactly as specified until it ran out.</li>
            <li> My fungal big toe on both feet are getting better.  </li>
            <li> Just follow the directions exactly as given.</li>
            <li> Be aware: the web description says it kills 99% of nail fungal...</li>
            <li> He said it most likely wouldn&#x27;t work, and nothing else would either.</li>
            <li> what happened at first i was using it on my most infected toe only and it seemed to be working</li>
            <li> After a month the fungus has stopped and I can clearly see where the healthy new nail is growing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In desperation, I searched Amazon for somethign with positive reviews, and found this.</li>
            <li> I really thought this was working &amp; even doubled up on the first part.</li>
            <li> What it wants is warm, moist and dark conditions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working very well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t give the fungus what it wants.</li>
            <li> I bought an 8 months supply to see it it really works and</li>
            <li> It works really</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t file off too much at a time.....</li>
            <li> I hope this is the time it really does the trick but time alone</li>
            <li> and it proceeded to kill my whole nail, not get rid of the fungus.</li>
            <li> Thanks you</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 starts because it really works.</li>
            <li> It work fast.</li>
            <li> That said my results are better than I expected from a &amp;#34;patent&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Hasnt  done much for my fungus</li>
            <li> highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister, it works very well.</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a 5 star because it really works.</li>
            <li> It works fast.</li>
            <li> but they really did not work.</li>
            <li> It works very well, though it takes time.</li>
            <li> After a month, the infected tissue returned to a healthy pink color.</li>
            <li> The ONLY thing that will kill nail fungus completely (and I wish more people knew about it) is sunshine.</li>
            <li> I think it has worked better than any of the other fungal treatments I have used.</li>
            <li> and itr really improving my toe nail to look almost normal.</li>
            <li> tried it out on a mild infection but simply did not work, even though I followed the instructions to the letter.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It says it only works on nails with a new mild case and takes one year</li>
            <li> If this is working it&#x27;s because I am very diligent to the process and getting a good coat of the product down to the cuticle and the extreme side of the infected nail.</li>
            <li> Due to the top heavy nature of the container, it is easy to knock it over.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of treatments to get rid of a really persistent fungus that started a couple summers ago when I painted my toenails quite often but didn&#x27;t take off the old paint in between.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised how fast it started to work.</li>
            <li> I am so relieved that my toenail is already halfway to normal grown out.</li>
            <li> Makes my nails look almost normal.... been using it for 2 months now</li>
            <li> The color is returning to normal.</li>
            <li> I hope to have healthy nails in a few months.</li>
            <li> Though normally I would not post a review before the results of the product could definitively be determined, several factors seem worth noting to those considering a purchase of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay, I have tried quite a few products, including the prescription pill (stopped the pill as I felt like,</li>
            <li> You needto stay on top of the &amp;#34;sanding&amp;#34; and keep the nails pruned back as far as possible to give it a chance to work.  </li>
            <li> The smallest nail is now clear and no longer yellow, and the other nails are progressing nicely too.</li>
            <li> The smallest nail is now clear and no longer yellow, and the other nails are progressing nicely too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go to a doctor right away next time.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitate to order from Ireland, thinking it would take too long, but I received it quickly so that I could use it within a week....</li>
            <li> Anyway the bottle is pretty tiny and if you have more than one nail it won&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> the bottle does not last long but so far it is okay still waiting for results</li>
            <li> I just need to be a little more patient and wait until my nail grow up completely.</li>
            <li> Fungi live off moisture.</li>
            <li> That is supposed to kill the fungus, then you just put the stuff on once a week, to prevent any new infection.  </li>
            <li> and the new nail is almost fully in.</li>
            <li> Am still using this product and hoping the results will live up to the advertisement.  </li>
            <li> I had an advanced case that I have been treating with over the counter remedies for years with no success.</li>
            <li> Please be aware that the included emery boards will not be enough.</li>
            <li> I spilled about a third of the liquid the first time I opened it.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I also found this in the UK and it is the first product that actually works.  </li>
            <li> As of right now, my pinkie toenails are clear and both big toes are about 75% clear.</li>
            <li> I had mild infections in several toenails except for one nail that was growing funny - white and big.  </li>
            <li> This might work for some people, and I think it would have been fine for me if my case had been mild - but it appears my fungus grew resistant to this solution, and in fact I was getting worse.  </li>
            <li> My one nail that was growing odd also seems better but it definitely has a ways to go.  </li>
            <li> I found the Dr. Paul&#x27;s Gel paste much more effective, and much less expensive.</li>
            <li> Daily use for fours week&#x27;s &amp; weekly thereafter with strict following of instructions, General footwear &amp; shoe rotation &amp; socks that wick away moisture &amp; you will have nothing but success !</li>
            <li> After 10 days it is almost completely clear.  </li>
            <li> had 8 infected toenails and after 3 weeks, had 7 clear nails and was wearing sandals again!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think I see the nail growing out clear but after 5 months I am trying to be patient, like the directions said.</li>
            <li> the routine, it is clearly working.  </li>
            <li> It dries the nails out completely (moisture gone).</li>
            <li> Use suncream to prevent sunburn and get those feet out into as much sunshine as possible.</li>
            <li> I had fungus on all nails and after 12 months of as much sunshine as possible</li>
            <li> so far I have to continue using it and</li>
            <li> It does not works in all cases, only when the infection is not on the whole nail.  </li>
            <li> After showering, when the nail is soft, I used the metal burr and filed away at all parts of the nail that are thickened or discolored.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product for 3-4 weeks so far.</li>
            <li> Too early to say whether it works or not.  </li>
            <li> You just have to continue with the treatments and not give up too early.</li>
            <li> You just have to continue with the treatments and not give up too early.</li>
            <li> But so far, based on results, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So far - filing away and seems to stop spread.  </li>
            <li> Now all my nails are growing better than ever, I hope few weeks later I can see all of them are cued.</li>
            <li> Get the nail as thin as you can so the cream will be effective.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and all in a portable little package!</li>
            <li> The included instructions depict nails that are only moderately infected and indicate that the product is not recommended if you have any more than a slight infection, i.e. a yellowing of the nail.</li>
            <li> After searching high and low, I stumbled across this while travelling in the UK and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I was really discouraged because I followed the instructions for a long time and nothing happened</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a complete kit and it is worth reading through the instructions CAREFULLY before starting treatment.</li>
            <li> I lost my entire big toe nail on the left foot and almost lost the one on right.</li>
            <li> AFTER 8 WEEKS OF CONTINUOUS USE: I have continued to file my nails down weekly and apply the liquid daily, and can definitely see that more than a third of the large toe nail bed is now pink, with the old, yellowed flaky part diminishing week by week (as I file it off).</li>
            <li> : I have continued to file my nails down weekly and apply the liquid daily, and can definitely see that more than a third of the large toe nail bed is now pink, with the old, yellowed flaky part diminishing week by week (as I file it off).</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t order just the liquid; the package includes the very rough nail files which are discarded after weekly use for the first 4 or 5 weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for this in the states and finally found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I rotate the Vinegar bath with a salt water bath and a (clear) listerine bath (I am planning to mix in a bleach solution bath and hydrogen peroxide bath shortly).  </li>
            <li> I started the program about 2 months ago and the nail bed is growing back clear.</li>
            <li> It will take months for the lost nail to grow back, but the fungus is clearly under control.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this item for one month, so it is too early to tell if it will provide a benefit.</li>
            <li> Have several weeks to go, but so far, works well.  </li>
            <li> product seems to work so far but only one week now, my problem is on Dec. 30</li>
            <li> Apparently mine is severe.</li>
            <li> so far, this is the only nail fungus treatment that makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Plenty of product to last the 9 months of complete &amp;#34;extinction&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m following the directions completely.  </li>
            <li> My guess is you can only get the fungus under control, maybe not ever completely get rid of it.  </li>
            <li> You will need several bottles of the liquid in order to complete the recommended treatment of up to 9 months to grow out the infected nail.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> That was nearly two years ago and the nail still hasn&#x27;t grown back in.</li>
            <li> There is not enough liquid to complete the treatment as described.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many homemade remedies including Vicks Vapor Rub and the worse, diluted Clorox.  </li>
            <li> In thirteen months, the top of the toenail is broken.</li>
            <li> Four months later with a little more very careful trimming</li>
            <li> Best stuff you can find to get rid of the nasty nail fungus THAT YOU GET FROM THE NEW BEAUTY SALON</li>
            <li> I used the first two bottles as directed, and now I use it every other or third day, also painting on a cheaper fungus prevention medicine on the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; nails to prevent re-infection.</li>
            <li> The contents of the tiny bottle are .12 ounce - that&#x27;s right - slightly over a tenth of an ounce.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Really file your nail bed down before doing this treatment with a large rough file.  </li>
            <li> This does not smell at all an dries relativiely fast compared to the other ones.</li>
            <li> I now have about half an inch of clear nail below the previously infected area and am running out of my original product and just ordered a replacement product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a second dose - and to be honest, a rotary tool and some sanding bands - because the two nails that didn&#x27;t clear up were so thick that the little file simply could not file through them.  </li>
            <li> So far on 3rd stage and has made big difference.</li>
            <li> It will likely take  four to six bottles of Sholls Fungal Nail Treatment to complete the entire regimen for me as my nails were severely infected.</li>
            <li> I can now say, after a decade long battle against fungus, that my nails are clear.</li>
            <li> I tried this out after trying many other products that didn&#x27;t work, and this one is a failure as well.</li>
            <li> but I see a little different not as much</li>
            <li> My package leaked about half the fluid in the mail and they sent me a new one immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions carefully, but the problem never completely went away, and returned completely within a month of the completion of the initial weekly applications.</li>
            <li> The only thing that worked for me in the past were the pills, but who wants liver damage?</li>
            <li> The little files included in the kit are ok after you use a big file to get them as thin as possible.  </li>
            <li> I have high hopes since other treatments are super expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a flip flop kind of lady, so when both my big toes started looking ugly</li>
            <li> And as stated above, had 7 clear within a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After two weeks, my old white dead part of the nail started peeling off.  </li>
            <li> I can tell that it is working because the fungi on my toenails has diminished, and the very slight amount that has grown in on the bottom of some nails looks normal.</li>
            <li> I have had no satisfactory treatment outcome from any other topical treatment, and I have tried several.</li>
            <li> My whole nail was black and now a quarter of it is black.</li>
            <li> is awkward  to use with the nail filer dispenser on top of it</li>
            <li> Used 1 year ago and nail was clear in a few months.  </li>
            <li> You do that for 9-12 months, which is how long it takes for your nail to fully grow out and replace the existing nail.  </li>
            <li> The treatment is long, but works</li>
            <li> This the second bottle I&#x27;ve used and not really seeing any improvement</li>
            <li> The first bottle was finished and it appeared to have stopped getting worse, halfway thru second bottle</li>
            <li> The description of this item is not clear.</li>
            <li> I had been considering expensive laser treatments because as a woman living in the Southwest where open-toed shoes are worn 10 months of the year, I was one of the lucky ones that this product actually helped.</li>
            <li> Will keep looking for a better product!  :(</li>
            <li> then maybe he wouldn&#x27;t of had to have nail surgery on his other big toe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing soaks for about two months now, and it&#x27;s doing a good job both between the toes (which was another ongoing issue) and on my one really bad nail, which is improving every few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Just use the files to scrape the nail once a week, swab on the medicine, and then let it dry.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t careful enough, as the brush may have re-introduced it to cured nails, I&#x27;m not certain.  </li>
            <li> My doctor informed me that it was very difficult to cure nail fungus, but I caught it early, and it seems to be growing out fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Now I have been using this product for five months and it APPEARS as though the fungus is dead and new nail is growing below the previously infected area.</li>
            <li> I purchased additional  inexpensive very coarse black boards that I didn&#x27;t mind disposing after one use.</li>
            <li> and here it is less than 3 months later</li>
            <li> &gt;* saw no change, mine is a mild case too, not half as bad as the image on teh box&lt;</li>
            <li> I have had a couple ugly nails for many years and even tried using a Dremel on my toenail.</li>
            <li> After ten years of an ugly, discolored, crumbly toenail, and taking the prescribed medicine that didn&#x27;t work, my toenail is now after one month 80-85% fungus free after using this stuff.</li>
            <li> The photograph does not effectively illustrate that the packaging is about 90% devoted to housing the nail files, with only the tiny bottle at the bottom holding the liquid treatment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Follow directions carefully and be patient.  </li>
            <li> Only a few files.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I was a participant in a medicine study, which almost cured them, but the study ended before they had grown out, and the fungus came back.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be helping some but not as much as I expected</li>
            <li> At the end I saw no real noticable difference.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why it is not available everywhere, i have only ever seen it in europe and now on amazon.</li>
            <li> but if you buy it BE CAREFUL NOT TO DROP IT .</li>
            <li> I literally spent hundreds of dollars trying to find a non perscription fix instead of the pills again.</li>
            <li> Hoping that attacking the fungus orally and topically will finally rid myself of my nasty big toe discoloration.  :)&lt;</li>
            <li> They decided after I received the order, it was not strong enough.  </li>
            <li> Poor fungus, won´t live long!</li>
            <li> First thing you notice is ugly yellow color turns white.  </li>
            <li> I did buy a few extra nail files at the store and ended up filing down the nail 7 or 8 times as opposed to the 5 times they recommend.</li>
            <li> Using this stuff (and any other liquid) feeds the fungi and grows within your nail.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, due to fungus on one toe nail.</li>
            <li> It seems so benign after other things I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> this works.. tried other things.</li>
            <li> hopefully it has some other active ingredient that you are paying for.</li>
            <li> The vial contains a very small amount of solution doesn&#x27;t last very long .Smells like alcohol</li>
            <li> recommend it strongly if you have a ugly toe nail.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t tell you active ingredient.</li>
            <li> had one nail that had to grow out (it did) - but initially, my two little toes, had very little improvement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had one toenail that had gotten dark.  </li>
            <li> I actually did the Clorox for at least 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I spent almost a year doing this &amp; it was a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I have been on pills and various other products but nothing has worked, but this stuff does!!!!</li>
            <li> I was holding it upside down and did not realize it.</li>
            <li> Otherwise any product can&#x27;t get down to the fungus under the nail bed.  </li>
            <li> Consider other options!</li>
            <li> Also several days after I ran out of this things seemed worse than when I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The file dispenser is clever but completely unnecessary and has to be thrown out at the end</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nevertheless, I have been following the weekly sanding and daily application for a few weeks and can see what I hope is clear pink nail bed at the base of the nails.</li>
            <li> I have previously tried both Lamisil and Penlac separately and they didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> i tried it since i was getting a bunch of things for tired feet, and within a few days, there were already clear signs that it was working.</li>
            <li> but after a few days i noticed that instead of killing the fungus on my other toes it was in actually making it worse my other uninfected nails started to turn yellowish</li>
            <li> and it is hard to get the brush into the fluid once it goes down past half way.</li>
            <li> as usual another product that has a lot of hype but no real benifits.</li>
            <li> Though there is pink healthy tissue at the base of each nail, the fungus still remains, so that they edges are yellowed, thick and crumbly.</li>
            <li> Though there is pink healthy tissue at the base of each nail, the fungus still remains, so that they edges are yellowed, thick and crumbly.</li>
            <li> The treatment process takes a little attention</li>
            <li> Due to the vigorous filing, my nails are actually quite small and thin, with noticeable yellowing and crumbly, flaky nail</li>
            <li> /&gt;Worth noting that this is NOT available in US stores and was shipped to me from Ireland!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing that seems to work for me is Vicks and that just holds things in check, and things rapidly get worse when I stop using that.  </li>
            <li> in just a few applications you start to see results.</li>
            <li> I take a soaking bath at least once a week and soak my feet for one hour at least once a week in 50% white vinegar and 50% rubbing alcohol and use a bath or dead shin stone to get the dead nail off.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dr. Scholls for a few weeks and my nails are hardening.  </li>
            <li> I used doctor prescribed pills 3 years ago and it cleaned up my toes but killed my intestines.</li>
            <li> It does take a few weeks</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost one year, I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll post an update in another few months.</li>
            <li> After the files are used up the dispenser will just be wasted space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was the very first product that mad a noticible difference!</li>
            <li> The only bad part is no nail polish until treatment is totally finished.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The quantity seems small, but you use very little.</li>
            <li> So I was very dissapointed when my bad toes began again.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what to do at this point for the nail fungas, but at this price I will not try this one again.</li>
            <li> unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> at begin,I thought it is useless for my nails , but I saw that it works on my bed bed nails after several weeks.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s working .</li>
            <li> Not sure why this is not sold in the US?</li>
            <li> I switched to soaks in 100% white vinegar, and that cleared up all but my worst toe, and did it fast and seemingly permanent.  </li>
            <li> , even the funky nail is hard to notice, but I can tell I&#x27;m not cured yet.  </li>
            <li> It was actually really hard to find one specifically for toe fungus.  </li>
            <li> After about a week, I could see a little reddish-pink to a nail that had been almost totally covered with ugly, fungal discoloration.</li>
            <li> This product has a picture guide to show if your nail is too bad to be fixed.  </li>
            <li> I have tried número use products over at least 10 years trying to fix one toenail.</li>
            <li> Afraid to take Lamisil tablets because of possible liver damage.  </li>
            <li> might as well give it a try before it&#x27;s too late.</li>
            <li> I found out after 20 years that the thick toenail was keeping the fungal cream from doing what it was suppose to do.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s slow but it works.</li>
            <li> I mean, why the hell not?</li>
            <li> The other products were just lame and basically just discolored the nail.</li>
            <li> I have tried the laser treatment (very expensive) and guess what the fungus came back!!!  </li>
            <li> My toe got worse not better.</li>
            <li> Progress is very slow since nails grow so slowly.    </li>
            <li> No good</li>
            <li> Be patient and watch for the clear regrowth at the base of your nails.</li>
            <li> I use a oil base anti fungal solution so as to keep the nail soft.</li>
            <li> The pills are very hard on your body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to judge this sort of product until you are done.  </li>
            <li> Then very slowly my nail started growing.  </li>
            <li> Progress is very slow since nails grow</li>
            <li> This item came broken and was leaking through the packaging envelope.</li>
            <li> That said, my nail fungus hasn&#x27;t gotten any worse either, so</li>
            <li> I think the secret is dedicated usage.</li>
            <li> I think the secret is dedicated usage.</li>
            <li> This one did with noticeable changes within a week or two and dramatic difference in 1 month.</li>
            <li> Given the very expensive alternatives, it&#x27;s a relatively small gamble.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My nail is not perfect</li>
            <li> I know it is expensive.  </li>
            <li> Sorry Scholl it just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy this because it was so expensive</li>
            <li> so ill tell you guys if it works ..</li>
            <li> My nails were damaged from fake nails.  </li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> so i was scared thinking all my toes were gonna get infected its weird</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Fungi Cure said NO odor and woah how wrong they were about that!</li>
            <li> The ingredients are bad</li>
            <li> My toe nail wasn&#x27;t even that bad.</li>
            <li> I had bad feet.</li>
            <li> Well my nail was worse than the worst picture</li>
            <li> It was painful but in the end didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was disappointed, and wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> ;, they have to be undercover :(  </li>
            <li> you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I plan to keep throwing a cocktail of nasty stuff at it.</li>
            <li> It works on taking ALL that terrible fungus out and off a nail!  </li>
            <li> I hate it&#x27;s way of misleading the customers!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> THE BEST PRODUCT FOR THIS PROBLEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I cannot empasize this enough.  Ordered 2 more to maintain the result</li>
            <li> I had an advanced case that I have been treating with over the counter remedies for years with no success. Since it is considered cosmetic and not covered by insurance, this seemed worth a try. It&#x27;s working very well. After treating for about 6 months the nail is about 85% restored. Bought 2 more bottles to continue treatment. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I tried this product, hoping it would bring the results promised - it didn&#x27;t. I was disappointed, and wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months, and it appears to be working! My doctor informed me that it was very difficult to cure nail fungus, but I caught it early, and it seems to be growing out fairly quickly. The quantity seems small, but you use very little. It&#x27;s almost like putting on nail polish.</li>
            <li> No good I expecting more for the reviews but really doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I followed these instructions to the detail and after the time was up my toenails have not improved. I have heard that Vick&#x27;s works so I am going to try that!</li>
            <li> This stuff contains liquid. Liquid contains moisture. Fungi live off moisture. Using this stuff (and any other liquid) feeds the fungi and grows within your nail. Trust me: I&#x27;ve used vicks, listerine, vinegar, the lot. The fungus never goes away. To understand your fungus problem you need to understand how fungus lives. Don&#x27;t give the fungus what it wants. What it wants is warm, moist and dark conditions. The ONLY thing that will kill nail fungus completely (and I wish more people knew about it) is sunshine. Sunshine, sunshine and more sunshine. The more sunshine the better. It dries the nails out completely (moisture gone). UV (light) kills the fungus, the heat from the sun (not warmth as inside shoes) kills the fungus. Your nails receive a healthy dose of Vitamin D keeping your new growth strong. Wear anti-fungal powder when wearing socks and shoes (when you have to). Use suncream to prevent sunburn and get those feet out into as much sunshine as possible. Even if it means having them out in public. If you don&#x27;t, the fungus will never go away. I had fungus on all nails and after 12 months of as much sunshine as possible they&#x27;re the pinkest they&#x27;ve ever been and all the fungus is growing out. I hope these tips help - I worked it all out but you don&#x27;t need to. Good luck :)</li>
            <li> Did not promised what it sells! I bought an 8 months supply to see it it really works and no change in the nail was ever seen. I was really discouraged because I followed the instructions for a long time and nothing happened</li>
            <li> It helps while you&#x27;re using it but as soon as you stop the fungus problem returns.</li>
            <li> I have had a couple ugly nails for many years and even tried using a Dremel on my toenail. This is the first thing that really substantially worked! My nail is not perfect but now it is not embarrassing and it is about as good as it can get!</li>
            <li> It works really gooooooooooood.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t miss this product because of price.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it strongly if you have a ugly toe nail.</li>
            <li> This product worked like a charm. I have been struggling with nail fungus for 10 years. Nothing worked for me until I tried this product. I highly&lt;br /&gt;recommend it.</li>
            <li> scholl fungal nail treatment was effective .</li>
            <li> After searching high and low, I stumbled across this while travelling in the UK and decided to give it a try. I mean, why the hell not? The only thing that worked for me in the past were the pills, but who wants liver damage? Not me! Anyhow, I used it religiously for the indicated period and noticed results after a month. I searched high and low for this in the states and finally found it on Amazon! As of right now, my pinkie toenails are clear and both big toes are about 75% clear. My girlfriend has had similar results. What can I say? It works for me.</li>
            <li> I lost my entire big toe nail on the left foot and almost lost the one on right. Got pedicure for a wedding NEVER EVER again.  This product has a picture guide to show if your nail is too bad to be fixed.  Well my nail was worse than the worst picture and it still worked for me. Follow directions carefully and be patient.  Don&#x27;t file off too much at a time.....ouch.  First thing you notice is ugly yellow color turns white.  Then very slowly my nail started growing.  Four months later with a little more very careful trimming I will be in good shape.  I know it is expensive.  I hope it works for you.</li>
            <li> This product showed results in just 2 weeks. I&#x27;m looking forward to the end result. This one is a winner.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this item for one month, so it is too early to tell if it will provide a benefit. But the first time I unscrewed the bottle, about 1/3 of the liquid spilled out. I was holding it upside down and did not realize it. The correct opening method would have been more obvious if the bottle was separate from the rest of the unit.</li>
            <li> Only a few files. They are not enough to finish de treatment indicated on the product</li>
            <li> I truly believe this works and easy to use and remember as brushing your teeth :-)  I have tried the laser treatment (very expensive) and guess what the fungus came back!!!  This is my second bottle and I intend to continue to use for one year.  My feet look terrific in flip flops</li>
            <li> it is okay so far I have to continue using it and the bottle does not last long but so far it is okay still waiting for results</li>
            <li> I have struggled with toenail fungus for years.  A few years ago I was a participant in a medicine study, which almost cured them, but the study ended before they had grown out, and the fungus came back.  I have been using this product now for 4 months. One of my smaller toenails has been cured entirely, and the others appear to have stopped the fungus and are growing it out.  I recommend persistence in using the product until it is fully gone.  I used the first two bottles as directed, and now I use it every other or third day, also painting on a cheaper fungus prevention medicine on the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; nails to prevent re-infection.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to judge this sort of product until you are done.  I had mild infections in several toenails except for one nail that was growing funny - white and big.  I&#x27;ve gone through the initial stage of treatment, and the nails that were pretty good look fantastic.. clean as a whistle.  I had two nails with some moderate whitishness, and they look better but not cured (which is consistent with what the mfr says you will see at this point in treatment).  My one nail that was growing odd also seems better but it definitely has a ways to go.  The initial stage is 4 weeks (I did about 5) of daily treatment.  That is supposed to kill the fungus, then you just put the stuff on once a week, to prevent any new infection.  You do that for 9-12 months, which is how long it takes for your nail to fully grow out and replace the existing nail.  I will probable continue to do the one problem nail a couple times a week just to make sure it gets a good dose, but I&#x27;ll have to come back here next year and either upgrade it or downgrade it based on the results.  Update: I adjusted this to 2 stars.  Progress dissappeared.  This might work for some people, and I think it would have been fine for me if my case had been mild - but it appears my fungus grew resistant to this solution, and in fact I was getting worse.  It&#x27;s possible I wasn&#x27;t careful enough, as the brush may have re-introduced it to cured nails, I&#x27;m not certain.  I switched to soaks in 100% white vinegar, and that cleared up all but my worst toe, and did it fast and seemingly permanent.  I&#x27;ve been doing soaks for about two months now, and it&#x27;s doing a good job both between the toes (which was another ongoing issue) and on my one really bad nail, which is improving every few weeks.  I rotate the Vinegar bath with a salt water bath and a (clear) listerine bath (I am planning to mix in a bleach solution bath and hydrogen peroxide bath shortly).  My feet actually look really good now (the vinegar was awesome, all the old and dead skin fell off in layers!), even the funky nail is hard to notice, but I can tell I&#x27;m not cured yet.  I plan to keep throwing a cocktail of nasty stuff at it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and seems to be helping. Testing on one foot to see if it works. I have high hopes since other treatments are super expensive.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you it works cause I still am treating my nail but I see a little different not as much maybe I need more time I hope it does work !</li>
            <li> It takes years to get rid of nail fungus and I have only had this product for months. It seems to be working but I have had periods of success before. I hope this is the time it really does the trick but time alone will determine that. I&#x27;ve used several prescription meds for years now and decided to try Scholl Fungal Nail Treatment as a last resort. Like I indicated earlier - it appears to be working.</li>
            <li> only have cons to report here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* followed all instructions to a T&lt;br /&gt;* saw no change, mine is a mild case too, not half as bad as the image on teh box&lt;br /&gt;* i&#x27;m on month 5 or 6 now, and it hasn&#x27;t improved.</li>
            <li> Best treatment that I&#x27;ve used so far , I&#x27;ve used everything over the counter plus went to a podiatrist without much success . This appears to be working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting compliments on my toenails without saying a word. I am wearing sandals and showing off my results. I have been&lt;br /&gt;recommending Dr Scholl&#x27;s Fungal Nail Treatment to all who compliment my nails.</li>
            <li> Worth the price. Made a huge difference. Please be aware that the included emery boards will not be enough. I purchased additional  inexpensive very coarse black boards that I didn&#x27;t mind disposing after one use. Keeping the nail surface abraided is KEY to getting this product to work. Be patient and watch for the clear regrowth at the base of your nails.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t do anything I try it for weeks and I didn&#x27;t see any results I got kerasal amd that works a lot better</li>
            <li> This stuff does not work. Used as directed for over a month and it proceeded to kill my whole nail, not get rid of the fungus.</li>
            <li> Did not give 5 stars because I am still in the process of treatment but looks very promising. Thanks you</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband, he have tried everything in his toe nail. When he started use it, we saw results in about 3 weeks&lt;br /&gt;Have to follow the instructions and put it twice or 3 times a day. After 3 months, he never have to put it again.</li>
            <li> Used 1 year ago and nail was clear in a few months.  Just purchased again because a different nail now has problems and I know it will work.</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 starts because it really works.It work fast.I definitely recommend this product,it does what it says.Very satisfied and I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because i was at a lost of what to do with this toenail fungus. It seems to be helping some but not as much as I expected but I am not done with the product yet . It does seems to be the best I have tried so far and will try it again , once this product is done .</li>
            <li> It does not works in all cases, only when the infection is not on the whole nail.  The treatment is long, but works</li>
            <li> So happy to have found this great product by Dr. Scholl.  I was leery of trying the other &amp;#34;no name&amp;#34; brands and read great reviews on this one.  I was a bit hesitate to order from Ireland, thinking it would take too long, but I received it quickly so that I could use it within a week....something that was important to me.  Have several weeks to go, but so far, works well.  Easy to use and all in a portable little package!</li>
            <li> as usual another product that has a lot of hype but no real benifits. I am not sure what to do at this point for the nail fungas, but at this price I will not try this one again. Sorry Scholl it just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> What can I say? After ten years of an ugly, discolored, crumbly toenail, and taking the prescribed medicine that didn&#x27;t work, my toenail is now after one month 80-85% fungus free after using this stuff. I was amazed...it actually worked great. Just use the files to scrape the nail once a week, swab on the medicine, and then let it dry. After about a week, I could see a little reddish-pink to a nail that had been almost totally covered with ugly, fungal discoloration. After three weeks the nail was about 70% fungal free. Experiencing is believing. I&#x27;m now  a believer.</li>
            <li> The vial contains a very small amount of solution doesn&#x27;t last very long .Smells like alcohol hopefully it has some other active ingredient that you are paying for.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Brother who was visiting and I think it is helping the problem.</li>
            <li> I just did not see any difference after one month of use, and strictly following the instructions. It&#x27;s a disappointment.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It says it only works on nails with a new mild case and takes one year but I had a very significant case on just one toe and here it is less than 3 months later and the new nail is almost fully in. I did buy a few extra nail files at the store and ended up filing down the nail 7 or 8 times as opposed to the 5 times they recommend. Highly impressed and strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If you have chronic, intransigent toenail fungus, here is how you get rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;I had toenail fungus for ten years. I tried every doctor prescribed Rx, everything listed on Amazon, and several treatments with a laser. From all of this experience I finally figured out what works.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this Scholl Fungal Treatment, and determined that while the liquid itself is on par with everything else out there, the method of filing the nail first is what makes the delivery of any fungal medication much more effective. But a regular nail file like they provide you with Scholls is inadequate for targeted nail removal. So I purchased an electric nail file from Amazon (niceEShop) for $5.98. After showering, when the nail is soft, I used the metal burr and filed away at all parts of the nail that are thickened or discolored. Then I applied an antifungal solution, either Scholls or another. I did this about 3 times per week. On days when I didn&#x27;t file, I scrubbed my toes with Pedifix fungal soap and a brush. I can now say, after a decade long battle against fungus, that my nails are clear.</li>
            <li> Rather than dropping more than $150 at the dermatologist or using some of the less well rated treatments, I took a chance and spent a bit of money for this system and the results are great! After a month the fungus has stopped and I can clearly see where the healthy new nail is growing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a complete kit and it is worth reading through the instructions CAREFULLY before starting treatment. That said my results are better than I expected from a &amp;#34;patent&amp;#34; medicine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth noting that this is NOT available in US stores and was shipped to me from Ireland!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It works&lt;br /&gt;- full kit&lt;br /&gt;- detailed instructions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The treatment process takes a little attention&lt;br /&gt;- May not be US safety certified&lt;br /&gt;- Took a while to get to me from Ireland&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got fungus? This will help</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> So far on 3rd stage and has made big difference. Can actually see it working. Works better than anything else I have tried. My whole nail was black and now a quarter of it is black. My nail is starting to come back to life. Shipping was actually quick since shipped from overseas.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, due to fungus on one toe nail. While it controlled and helped, it never cured it. It would seem almost gone, but never went away. Once I stopped using it, I&#x27;d have to order another one. Now that I&#x27;ve gone thru 3 of them, I ended up going to a doctor. So...it helped, but didn&#x27;t cure it. I won&#x27;t order it again - I&#x27;ll go to a doctor right away next time.</li>
            <li> I used this product until it was gone.  It did nothing to correct my nail fungus. It does not work at all.</li>
            <li> the best thing i have been using on mu feet nails, it start to work in 3 weeks and im just using it like a support twice a week tanks</li>
            <li> This product really works! I have tried número use products over at least 10 years trying to fix one toenail. I am so relieved that my toenail is already halfway to normal grown out. Thank you !&lt;br /&gt;My next step was going to try the laser but now I don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of treatments to get rid of a really persistent fungus that started a couple summers ago when I painted my toenails quite often but didn&#x27;t take off the old paint in between.  The sprays, creams and liquids at the store didn&#x27;t work.  Some of them were for foot fungus though and not for toe fungus.  It was actually really hard to find one specifically for toe fungus.  I didn&#x27;t want to buy this because it was so expensive but I&#x27;m glad I did because it worked.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, because of all of the fungal nail products I have tried, this one really works!</li>
            <li> THIS DIDN&#x27;T WORK AND NOTHING TOPICAL WILL. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON&#x27;T BUY IT.  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO TO A DR. FOR ADVICE.</li>
            <li> It works great and i have tried many others before. Makes my nails look almost normal.... been using it for 2 months now</li>
            <li> Hasnt  done much for my fungus</li>
            <li> I have tried this product for 3-4 weeks so far. The result remains to be seen. One thing that I found is that the instruction wilh the product is much more clear than the description you can get when you purchase, so you know more what you can expect from it.</li>
            <li> Surprised that the item came from Europe but extremely happy I was able to get it. It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Well I used this religiously every evening as directed until it ran out, filed occasionally.  I also used a product called &#x27;Fungusfix&#x27; in the mornings.  At the end I saw no real noticable difference.  The only thing that seems to work for me is Vicks and that just holds things in check, and things rapidly get worse when I stop using that.  Also several days after I ran out of this things seemed worse than when I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The file dispenser is clever but completely unnecessary and has to be thrown out at the end, I didn&#x27;t want to pay extra for that.  Anyway the bottle is pretty tiny and if you have more than one nail it won&#x27;t last long.  Afraid to take Lamisil tablets because of possible liver damage.  Will keep looking for a better product!  :(</li>
            <li> I had one toenail that had gotten dark.  After 10 days it is almost completely clear.  Worth the wait to get it.</li>
            <li> product seems to work so far but only one week now, my problem is on Dec. 30 I ordered this and it was $12.50 went to reorder today Jan. 15 and the price almost doubled to $22.00, don&#x27;t understand the price change in sixteen days.</li>
            <li> Works great and fast!</li>
            <li> Daily use for fours week&#x27;s &amp; weekly thereafter with strict following of instructions, General footwear &amp; shoe rotation &amp; socks that wick away moisture &amp; you will have nothing but success !</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions to the tee. After 6 months, no difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been six weeks since I started using this and it is working!  I&#x27;ve reordered enough to last a year so that I stick with it...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the effectiveness, yet. I have been using already 5 months...</li>
            <li> This is some great stuff. Easy to use and quite effective. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Product works if used properly and faithfully. Best , of its kind, I have ever used</li>
            <li> This product depends on the severity of the fungus.  Apparently mine is severe.</li>
            <li> so far, this is the only nail fungus treatment that makes a difference.</li>
            <li> It worked!  IT WORKED!  It worked for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had 8 infected toenails and after 3 weeks, had 7 clear nails and was wearing sandals again!&lt;br /&gt;I had one nail that had to grow out (it did) - but initially, my two little toes, had very little improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a second dose - and to be honest, a rotary tool and some sanding bands - because the two nails that didn&#x27;t clear up were so thick that the little file simply could not file through them.  The extra filing seemed to reduce the thickness and allow the second to penetrate the nail and start working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In defense of the product, there is an insert with pictures that states something like:  &amp;#34;If your nails look like &#x27;this&#x27; (and shows a picture), contact a doctor and do not use.  I used the product anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started noticing clearing in 48 hours on most of my nails.  And as stated above, had 7 clear within a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the reviews, this clearly doesn&#x27;t work for everyone - but after 2 treatments and time to let the nails grow out, I am very pleased.  VERY pleased.  I had been considering expensive laser treatments because as a woman living in the Southwest where open-toed shoes are worn 10 months of the year, I was one of the lucky ones that this product actually helped.</li>
            <li> tried it out on a mild infection but simply did not work, even though I followed the instructions to the letter.</li>
            <li> unbelievable.  Had had problem for several years, gone in 1 month.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me used 2 packages</li>
            <li> 3 weeks and this has been working like a charms  will keep updating</li>
            <li> in just a few applications you start to see results. i could not find anything like this in canada. i found it while i was looking for a foot cream in europe. i tried it since i was getting a bunch of things for tired feet, and within a few days, there were already clear signs that it was working. i can&#x27;t wait until a month from now to see how it works. don&#x27;t know why it is not available everywhere, i have only ever seen it in europe and now on amazon. might as well give it a try before it&#x27;s too late.</li>
            <li> Vendor was great, however; I&#x27;ve seen no noticeable change in my condition at this point and have been diligent with its use...as is the case with everything that I&#x27;ve purchased to &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; this problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks, starting my fourth week tonight!! I think it has worked better than any of the other fungal treatments I have used. This does not smell at all an dries relativiely fast compared to the other ones. Fungi Cure said NO odor and woah how wrong they were about that! This one is an excellent system. Comes with the nails files that you discard after using once a week. The instrument toons are easy to follow and really help make the fungal infection disappear ! In just two weeks I could see that the infection was starting to grow out and my nails were growing in healthier! I will continue to use this for the length of treatment...4 weeks of daily use then once a week for 9 months.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this one! Wish they sold it I stores in the USA but for some reason they don&#x27;t. The ingredients are bad (mostly Vinegar I read actually...) but it works awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister, it works very well. I was surprised how fast it started to work. Its a must have if you have Fungal nails.</li>
            <li> Too early to say whether it works or not.  The brush is easy to hold.  Oh, yes, there is NO odor to the solution.  It paints on like fingernail polish.  From reading the literature that came with this product, &amp;#34;You should consult your GP or podiatrist if *symptoms have persisted for longer than 2 years; *discoloration has covered the whole surface of the nail ; *symptoms are shown in more than two toes/fingers&amp;#34;.  You can contact the company at www.scholl.com.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product to try, even though, my fungus has been growing on my toenails (except for one) for many years.  If it works GREAT, my toenails will finally see the light.  It not &amp;#34;oh, well&amp;#34;, they have to be undercover :(  &amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Thank U.</li>
            <li> I found out after 20 years that the thick toenail was keeping the fungal cream from doing what it was suppose to do. I take a soaking bath at least once a week and soak my feet for one hour at least once a week in 50% white vinegar and 50% rubbing alcohol and use a bath or dead shin stone to get the dead nail off. Get the nail as thin as you can so the cream will be effective. I use a oil base anti fungal solution so as to keep the nail soft.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple OTC products that &amp;#34;guarantee&amp;#34; results. My toe nail wasn&#x27;t even that bad. None of the others worked. This one did with noticeable changes within a week or two and dramatic difference in 1 month. Plenty of product to last the 9 months of complete &amp;#34;extinction&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This item came broken and was leaking through the packaging envelope. Since it was hazardous and flammable, I immediately threw it away. It did ask for a replacement. I got a replacement in the mail and have been using it for quite some time and I have to say, this stuff is working. I have been on pills and various other products but nothing has worked, but this stuff does!!!! This product comes from England and I am wondering why they don&#x27;t sell it here in the US? I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the name brands an none of them helped. I have been using Dr. Scholls for a few weeks and my nails are hardening.  The color is returning to normal. I don&#x27;t understand why this product in not sold in the states.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and the second day she used it she dropped it on the floor -_- . Lol i cant say if it works or not but if you buy it BE CAREFUL NOT TO DROP IT . My mom bought again so ill tell you guys if it works .. IF she doesnt drop it lol</li>
            <li> I had bad feet. I always have. I used doctor prescribed pills 3 years ago and it cleaned up my toes but killed my intestines. So I was very dissapointed when my bad toes began again. I had used powder and spray daily since i stopped taking my pills, but fungus is a re-occuring issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried every over the counter item i could find. I literally spent hundreds of dollars trying to find a non perscription fix instead of the pills again. This was the very first product that mad a noticible difference! It does take a few weeks but that is a good sign! It means its killing the fungus UNDER your nails and the wait is just your body growing clean nails out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was 1/100 the price of perscription pills and doesnt turn your liver off. I would absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li> It really works.  Wish is was sold in the USA.  Read the directions and stay with it!</li>
            <li> This product really works but you need to be patient and follow the instructions, I started using this treatment June 2014 and now 9 months after my toenail is 70% better I just need to be a little more patient and wait until my nail grow up completely. I&#x27;m just starting my third bottle.😊</li>
            <li> I really thought this was working &amp; even doubled up on the first part. About nine+ months later in the once a week phase it started all coming back. I spent almost a year doing this &amp; it was a waste of time.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. Doesn&#x27;t tell you active ingredient.</li>
            <li> i have only been using this product a couple of weeks and itr really improving my toe nail to look almost normal. i had been using kerstil which was the only thing helping, after i had gone to three different foot doctors. kerstil kept it under control, but this product is awesome. i use it every couple of days..  you wont be disappointed. i would recommend</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost one year, I use it everyday. Be patient it&#x27;s slow but it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months.  It seems to not work as well as any others that I&#x27;ve tried.  I must have that 0.1% type of nail fungus.  That said, my nail fungus hasn&#x27;t gotten any worse either, so I&#x27;ll probably re-order when it&#x27;s used up.</li>
            <li> Scholl Fungal Nail Treatment does not work at all for me.  Was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for months and see no difference in my nails.  Is it worth contiuing/</li>
            <li> It must be ok for those with fungus, however it turned out my problem had nothing to do with fungus, so medically can&#x27;t say?  Delivery was good however and product made it to my house, but problem was cured without the product, so it sits in my med cabinet.</li>
            <li> This is the only topical product that appears to be combating the long-term and stubborn fungal infection on my great toes. I am in the eighth week of treatment and the unsightly fungus on my left great toe is clearing nicely.  The results on the right great toe look promising, but the fungus is still evident.  I am hopeful that both great toenails will be clear after I treat them another eight weeks.  After ten years of fighting this fungus, I am relieved to find something that appears to be working.  It will likely take  four to six bottles of Sholls Fungal Nail Treatment to complete the entire regimen for me as my nails were severely infected. I have had no satisfactory treatment outcome from any other topical treatment, and I have tried several.</li>
            <li> I found this after trying numerous products over the last two years.  After two weeks, my old white dead part of the nail started peeling off.  The nails are now clear and healthy after four weeks. Now, I just have to wait for them to grow out. I had just gotten a prescription for the pills,  but why not try this first? The pills are very hard on your body. The only bad part is no nail polish until treatment is totally finished.&lt;br /&gt;The company was so easy to do business with too.  My package leaked about half the fluid in the mail and they sent me a new one immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been 5 months since I started using this product and my nails have grown out healthy and strong.  I have 4 more months to use it once a week and I will be done!  I noticed a huge difference in the first 2 weeks so if it is not working for you it may be that you have a different strain of fungus.  They are not a one size fits all.  There are many different fungus types you could have. Anyway, I am extremely happy with the results!</li>
            <li> It is the first time I found something that worked in my nail. I have been trying everything to treat my toe nail. Nothing worked. What helped too, are the good instructions Scholl fungal nail provides. Easy to use and efficient! I good job Dr Scholl.!</li>
            <li> Seems like it&#x27;s working. I started the program about 2 months ago and the nail bed is growing back clear. I would suggest modifying the directions somewhat by filing more after the initial series of filing. This step seems to make the most progress and expose more nail to be treated.</li>
            <li> This the second bottle I&#x27;ve used and not really seeing any improvement but I&#x27;ll try it for a few months more and hope for the best.</li>
            <li> I can tell that it is working because the fungi on my toenails has diminished, and the very slight amount that has grown in on the bottom of some nails looks normal. I&#x27;m hoping it continues, but I must admit it&#x27;s worked better than any product I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> at begin,I thought it is useless for my nails , but I saw that it works on my bed bed nails after several weeks. Now all my nails are growing better than ever, I hope few weeks later I can see all of them are cued.</li>
            <li> After only 3 weeks the nail fungus seems to be on the decline.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, this product will work well enough to rid me of it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s working . I have been using it since it arrived. Haven&#x27;t noticed any change . Will continue using for one more week.</li>
            <li> Item as described... Delivered as promised... Thank you!..</li>
            <li> Well packaged. I have been looking for the product. If you are diligent in using it; it will heal your nails.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of months now.  I am pleased to say that I think it is working to correct my toe nails.  I hope to have healthy nails in a few months.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for three months and it has not made any difference.  Its cheaper to go to a Chiropodist. I have now tried several different products over the last three years and none of them work. Any Chiropodist will tell you they are all rubbish.</li>
            <li> Best stuff you can find to get rid of the nasty nail fungus THAT YOU GET FROM THE NEW BEAUTY SALON THAT YOU WENT TO!!!</li>
            <li> The package was opened and had some cotton pieces inside. I still wonder why.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using this product.  It takes 9 months to know that it worked for me so can&#x27;t say anymore about this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a flip flop kind of lady, so when both my big toes started looking ugly I freaked out.  That was many years ago.  My advice to anyone is avoid those pedicure bath tubs!  This is where I got it.  Anyway, I was on oral meds a couple of times and it seemed to work but the fungus came back after a year or so.  I&#x27;ve tried many homemade remedies including Vicks Vapor Rub and the worse, diluted Clorox.  I actually did the Clorox for at least 6 months.  It was painful but in the end didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m trying this product.  My nails look better than they ever have.  It seems so benign after other things I&#x27;ve tried.  There is no smell, it goes on easy.  It does not burn.  I&#x27;m following the directions completely.  If I need to use this stuff forever I will.  My guess is you can only get the fungus under control, maybe not ever completely get rid of it.  This is what I think but I&#x27;m not a doctor.  I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because I&#x27;m still in the second month of trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice to anyone starting out.  Really file your nail bed down before doing this treatment with a large rough file.  The little files included in the kit are ok after you use a big file to get them as thin as possible.  Otherwise any product can&#x27;t get down to the fungus under the nail bed.  Good luck to all of you!.  My mom always said wear flip flops in the bathroom at the pool.  She didn&#x27;t know to warn me about salon nail baths.  But if she had known, she would have.</li>
            <li> Though normally I would not post a review before the results of the product could definitively be determined, several factors seem worth noting to those considering a purchase of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The photograph does not effectively illustrate that the packaging is about 90% devoted to housing the nail files, with only the tiny bottle at the bottom holding the liquid treatment.&lt;br /&gt;2. The contents of the tiny bottle are .12 ounce - that&#x27;s right - slightly over a tenth of an ounce.&lt;br /&gt;3. Due to the top heavy nature of the container, it is easy to knock it over. I spilled about a third of the liquid the first time I opened it.&lt;br /&gt;4. You will need several bottles of the liquid in order to complete the recommended treatment of up to 9 months to grow out the infected nail.&lt;br /&gt;5. You can&#x27;t order just the liquid; the package includes the very rough nail files which are discarded after weekly use for the first 4 or 5 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;6. If you re-order, you will get more nail files which you probably don&#x27;t need...&lt;br /&gt;7. Shipping can be quite costly (if you&#x27;re in the U.S.) since it comes from Ireland. I use Amazon Prime, so that was not an obstacle for me.&lt;br /&gt;8. The included instructions depict nails that are only moderately infected and indicate that the product is not recommended if you have any more than a slight infection, i.e. a yellowing of the nail. This fact is not revealed on line, so you don&#x27;t know about it until you open the box and read the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I have been following the weekly sanding and daily application for a few weeks and can see what I hope is clear pink nail bed at the base of the nails. Due to the vigorous filing, my nails are actually quite small and thin, with noticeable yellowing and crumbly, flaky nail edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I have a glimmer of hope that I can finally eradicate the fungus, I will go ahead and order a second bottle. Given the very expensive alternatives, it&#x27;s a relatively small gamble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have taken \\&quot;before\\&quot; photographs of the infected nails, and will take another set of images after 1 month, then again at 2 months to determine whether there is indeed progress. Maybe by summer time, I can wear sandals.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE AFTER 8 WEEKS OF CONTINUOUS USE: I have continued to file my nails down weekly and apply the liquid daily, and can definitely see that more than a third of the large toe nail bed is now pink, with the old, yellowed flaky part diminishing week by week (as I file it off). The smallest nail is now clear and no longer yellow, and the other nails are progressing nicely too. I think the secret is dedicated usage. You just have to continue with the treatments and not give up too early. Progress is very slow since nails grow so slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UDPATE AFTER 6 MONTHS OF CONTINUOUS USE: After continuing with the daily application and weekly filing, I saw no additional progress. Though there is pink healthy tissue at the base of each nail, the fungus still remains, so that they edges are yellowed, thick and crumbly. I believe that most of the improvement in appearance is related to aggressive filing, removing the yellowed crumbly part and keeping the nails neat looking. Perhaps my nails were more infected than is recommended in the included pamphlet for this product. I&#x27;m still looking for the final solution...ed nails, and will take another set of images after 1 month, then again at 2 months to determine whether there is indeed progress.

            <li> In the process of using this product. So far so good. It takes a while for this to work according to the instructions.</li>
            <li> I also found this in the UK and it is the first product that actually works.  I used it for 7 days as instructed and it totally cleared the fungus.</li>
            <li> This is the tird bottle I am trying for three fingernails. The first bottle was finished and it appeared to have stopped getting worse, halfway thru second bottle I think I see the nail growing out clear but after 5 months I am trying to be patient, like the directions said.</li>
            <li> Okay, I have tried quite a few products, including the prescription pill (stopped the pill as I felt like, while taking the pill, it was as though someone was punching my kidneys). The other products were just lame and basically just discolored the nail. Now I have been using this product for five months and it APPEARS as though the fungus is dead and new nail is growing below the previously infected area. I now have about half an inch of clear nail below the previously infected area and am running out of my original product and just ordered a replacement product. If this is working it&#x27;s because I am very diligent to the process and getting a good coat of the product down to the cuticle and the extreme side of the infected nail. I guess I am saying I am following the directions. I&#x27;ll post an update in another few months. But so far, based on results, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 5 star because it really works. It works fast. It was well worth the wait. Thankyou.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t buy it and save your money. Take your time looking around and find the product that will work for you.</li>
            <li> guys you have to remember you have to throw away shoes socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thats why it comes back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend tooj pills and never came back.</li>
            <li> This has been a great product for keeping the fungus at bay.  I will reorder.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions carefully, but the problem never completely went away, and returned completely within a month of the completion of the initial weekly applications. I found the Dr. Paul&#x27;s Gel paste much more effective, and much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have used this for over a year (multiple purchases). The first bottle I used exactly as specified until it ran out. The second bottle I used daily after filing the nails. In thirteen months, the top of the toenail is broken. It appears the fungus remains, although to a lesser degree.</li>
            <li> I have been using it as directed and the product is working.  My fungal big toe on both feet are getting better.  My nails were damaged from fake nails.  The nail bed had a wave to it that with the nail file that comes with bottle the the nail bed became smooth and the waves went away.  The nail fungal is almost gone.  I will recommend this product to anyone.  I have been using products recommended by friends but they really did not work.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Go to your podiatrist - that&#x27;s the only thing that will work.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell. So far - filing away and seems to stop spread.  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend who did not actually use the product.  They decided after I received the order, it was not strong enough.  I can&#x27;t truly rate it accurately.</li>
            <li> It works but not as well as I thought. I have used Fungisil that works better but I can no longer find it.&lt;br /&gt;Scholls is awkward  to use with the nail filer dispenser on top of it and it is hard to get the brush into the fluid once it goes down past half way.</li>
            <li> Excellent affordable product, works as it says on the tin(bottle ) in this case, overtime it treats those un sightly areas, feels better, not over priced, good fast delivery.</li>
            <li> this works.. tried other things. this works.</li>
            <li> Thank YOU for good product.Fast delivery,HAPPY NEW YEAR  100 % satisfactions ,Good working ,clear instruction easy working product.STRONG recommended for every one.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works really good. I´ve tried others and this can not be compared. Poor fungus, won´t live long!</li>
            <li> My husband uses this and wishes he had known about it sooner then maybe he wouldn&#x27;t of had to have nail surgery on his other big toe. That was nearly two years ago and the nail still hasn&#x27;t grown back in.</li>
            <li> I just started application of this product on April 22.  I&#x27;ll update my review based on how well it works over time.  I&#x27;m also taking oral Lamisil.  I have previously tried both Lamisil and Penlac separately and they didn&#x27;t work.  Hoping that attacking the fungus orally and topically will finally rid myself of my nasty big toe discoloration.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application directions are to use this product daily for 4 weeks; following which it is used on weekly basis.  The applicator also has a nifty nail file dispenser, which is used to remove the week prior&#x27;s application buildup.  After the files are used up the dispenser will just be wasted space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest gripe is that there is zero indication on the packaging and reading material about what the actual liquid applicant is!  This is a non-US product so it&#x27;s not accountable to FDA packaging guidelines.  I can only assume this is Penlac.  I don&#x27;t like not knowing what I&#x27;m putting on my toenail.  This product makes me appreciate the FDA and our US laws.</li>
            <li> This is an AMAZING product!  It works on taking ALL that terrible fungus out and off a nail!  Just wished that it was sold in the U.S.  *Side note:  Bottle opens at the top...hold the liquid part and then turn the top.  Follow all directions, especially about cleaning and filing nail once a week.</li>
            <li> 3 weeks int the routine, it is clearly working.  You needto stay on top of the &amp;#34;sanding&amp;#34; and keep the nails pruned back as far as possible to give it a chance to work.  Comes from Ireland for some reason. Not sure why this is not sold in the US?</li>
            <li> I bought this product, hoping that it would help me with my problem but it has not worked for a minute. I would not redcommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Bottom line on this product:  There is not enough liquid to complete the treatment as described.  I&#x27;m not going to spend the money to buy several of these!  Consider other options!</li>
            <li> I have a light case of toe fungus that has been growing, which is freaking me out. I tried this out after trying many other products that didn&#x27;t work, and this one is a failure as well. My toe got worse not better.</li>
            <li> Takes a while but the gunk on my big toe is almost gone. Recommended, takes about 3 months to work.</li>
            <li> It works very well, though it takes time. Just follow the directions exactly as given.</li>
            <li> Be aware: the web description says it kills 99% of nail fungal...balabala, but inside description says it&#x27;s suitable for only two toes/fingers. What to return, no way, you have to pay international postage! I hate it&#x27;s way of misleading the customers!</li>
            <li> Am still using this product and hoping the results will live up to the advertisement.  I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and followed the directions and it took care of my Toe nail Fungus as advertised.  Worked great.  I highly recommend.  I&#x27;ve tried all the over the counter products sold here in the US and none did the job. Took a while to get this product because it came from the UK.  Wish stores carried this product here in the US.</li>
            <li> this idem works better then anything else I have tried</li>
            <li> Used two bottles on four toenails.  Did not have any effect whatsoever.  Useless.</li>
            <li> The description of this item is not clear. It says nail treatment, but once you read the instructions inside the box it tells you it only works when the nail infections has just started. If the infection go to the beginnning of the nail, they treatment is not guaranteed. I still dont know if it works.</li>
            <li> I tried a topical treatment that I bought from a podiatrist. He said it most likely wouldn&#x27;t work, and nothing else would either. He was right about the first part. The fungus continued to progress, week after week. In desperation, I searched Amazon for somethign with positive reviews, and found this. Within two weeks, I could see  improvement. After a month, the infected tissue returned to a healthy pink color. It will take months for the lost nail to grow back, but the fungus is clearly under control. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought two of these because I did not notice too much of a change with the first bottle.</li>
            <li> So i have now finished using this product heres what happened at first i was using it on my most infected toe only and it seemed to be working so i kept using it. Then i decided i would use it on all my nails so that way i can kill all the fungus on all my toe nails. but after a few days i noticed that instead of killing the fungus on my other toes it was in actually making it worse my other uninfected nails started to turn yellowish so i was scared thinking all my toes were gonna get infected its weird how that happened after that i discontinued using this product and dipped my toes in vinegar to stop any fungus from spreading luckily it didnt spread and for any of you giving this product a try dont apply on all your toes only infected once i warn you .</li>
