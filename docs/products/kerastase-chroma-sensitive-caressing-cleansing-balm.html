            <li>This product is excellent if you have color treated hair, perhaps even too good.</li>
            <li>A great product to use a couple of times a week instead of shampoo.</li>
            <li>Great savings here at Amazon over salon prices at Gene Juarez.</li>

            <li>It has made an amazing difference in retaining my color.</li>
            <li>Scrub good and experience the magic  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing, i love that its sulphate free.  </li>
            <li>Some hair specialist recommended me this product and my highlights are now more ash</li>
            <li>and I had to squeeze the pump too many times to get any product out .</li>
            <li>I like this product better than competitors like Wen.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo for holding the color in my hair</li>
            <li>I wish this had a more appealing scent.</li>
            <li>Better than any &amp;#34;non-poo&amp;#34; shampoo...</li>
            <li>Perfect for my dry, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>My highlights continue to look really bright using this shampoo as well - you can feel how gentle the product is.     </li>
            <li>Love the light fragrance.</li>
            <li>and I love how clean my hair feels.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks really great after I use this - easy to comb through, soft to the touch, not weighed down, good hair movement.  </li>
            <li>I love this, its my first use</li>
            <li>light and sweet.</li>
            <li>This is great for color-treated hair including my dry hair.</li>
            <li>It is a shampoo/conditioner in one, but it is very light and gentle.</li>
            <li>I do feel like my hair looks good for only done day.  </li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t look at good the second day...</li>
            <li>By day three, your hair will look a bit flat and it will take 3-4 \\&quot;pumps\\&quot; of product times two washes to get good results.</li>
            <li>My advice is to minimize styling product usage at first so this product can clean hair rather than product.  </li>
            <li>They recommend alternating this with your regular shampoo but this balm is so amazing I&#x27;m tempted to use it every time I wash.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Honest, you don&#x27;t even need to use conditioner with it -- and that&#x27;s an even bigger plus as the sweaty season approaches.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft and smooth, and helps preserve my color.</li>
            <li>It also had a great scent, and although pricey it does last a long time.</li>
            <li>It works great, but it&#x27;s a bit pricey when there are other products that do the same thing.</li>
            <li>I really do like this product.</li>
            <li>Now it gently fades, instead of rapidly fading.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice cumulative effect: My hair is usually prone to split ends and that problem has subsided noticeably since I started using this product three months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>, I normally require a conditioner</li>
            <li>I do not feel this product is hydrating enough and worth the price.</li>
            <li>Compare with wen pretty much the same!</li>
            <li>I have super long hair</li>
            <li>I use this for the first several washings after getting lowlights, then use it about once per week after (and I no longer wash my hair every day).</li>
            <li>but I went without, put some kerastase elixir in my wet hair and it combed through super well.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised,</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li>I use it for the first few days after color to lock it in.  </li>

            <li> I have fine straight hair and it left my hair flat and looking dirty.</li>
            <li> Kerastase has created a really terrific shampoo for anyone with dry, color-treated or otherwise fragile hair who&#x27;s trying to achieve shine and softness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s not the real product, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is pricey as you don&#x27;t get much product for your money at all.</li>
            <li> stars because it is not really that different from Loreal&#x27;s Hydracharge Cleansing, which is $6 and has a similar ingredient list.</li>
            <li> Since that I started to use it notice the change, maintaining the color until a new application, i.e. past 20 or 30 days.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair only every other day.  </li>
            <li> and I have oily roots dry ends which can be a challenge...</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my hair feel, but my family hate the smell.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try less shampooing and move to cleansing conditioner instead.</li>
            <li> Although I need to use quite a few pumps (it comes little by little) and my hair is thick and long, i thought it would tangle my hair like any shampoo does</li>
            <li> It used to fade and look dried out, but now I can go 6 weeks between coloring (I&#x27;m in my 50s</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or limp!</li>
            <li> Ridiculously expensive product that nonetheless works really well to protect expensive hair color.  </li>
            <li> This was suggested from my hairstylist but not impressed with this product, need to wash hair everyday</li>
            <li> and I was tired to trying over and over.  </li>
            <li> It was weird washing my hair with this</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Kerastase has discontinued it and the prices have skyrocketed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to space shampoos over the recommended (for color-treated hair) three days.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

            <li> This stuff is completely amazing.      It is a cleansing balm that does not lather up a lot, it has the consistency of a conditioner.  I have super long hair so I was worried I would need a lot of product for a wash.  Not the case - the balm distributes well through the hair.  I can feel my hair getting hydrated as I spread it from scalp to ends.    No need for a conditioner when using this stuff either - it serves as a conditioner as well as a cleanser. My highlights continue to look really bright using this shampoo as well - you can feel how gentle the product is.     My hair looks really great after I use this - easy to comb through, soft to the touch, not weighed down, good hair movement.  They recommend alternating this with your regular shampoo but this balm is so amazing I&#x27;m tempted to use it every time I wash.  If not for the price, I would!!</li>
            <li> This made my hair fall out in chunks while in the shower! I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s not the real product, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, i love that its sulphate free.  I just finished washing my hair and I love how clean my hair feels.  I was surprised, Although I need to use quite a few pumps (it comes little by little) and my hair is thick and long, i thought it would tangle my hair like any shampoo does but it did not, it washed well and my hair even felt hydrated and shinny, I normally require a conditioner but I went without, put some kerastase elixir in my wet hair and it combed through super well.  I love this, its my first use but i will continue to use this along with my regular bain de force and masquintense. Oh and it smeels great! light and sweet.</li>
            <li> This was suggested from my hairstylist but not impressed with this product, need to wash hair everyday ifyou use this otherwise they just get oily.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for Pearly hair. Since that I started to use it notice the change, maintaining the color until a new application, i.e. past 20 or 30 days.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my dry, color-treated hair. Love the light fragrance. And it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or limp! I LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li> I use this for the first several washings after getting lowlights, then use it about once per week after (and I no longer wash my hair every day). It has made an amazing difference in retaining my color. It used to fade and look dried out, but now I can go 6 weeks between coloring (I&#x27;m in my 50s so have gray).</li>
            <li> The best shampoo and cond in one ! Scrub good and experience the magic  rinse well you will love it!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try less shampooing and move to cleansing conditioner instead. I also like the fact that there r no parabens. I do not feel this product is hydrating enough and worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products and I was tired to trying over and over.  Some hair specialist recommended me this product and my highlights are now more ash and I love it!!</li>
            <li> A great product to use a couple of times a week instead of shampoo. It makes my hair feel soft and smooth, and helps preserve my color. It also had a great scent, and although pricey it does last a long time.</li>
            <li> Horrible. I actually threw it away after two uses . I have fine straight hair and it left my hair flat and looking dirty. It was weird washing my hair with this it was like using conditioner and I had to squeeze the pump too many times to get any product out .</li>
            <li> It is that I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Ridiculously expensive product that nonetheless works really well to protect expensive hair color.  I use it for the first few days after color to lock it in.  My advice is to minimize styling product usage at first so this product can clean hair rather than product.  I like this product better than competitors like Wen.</li>
            <li> I really do like this product. It is a shampoo/conditioner in one, but it is very light and gentle. If you have built up product in your hair, you&#x27;ll need to use a clarifying shampoo, because this stuff won&#x27;t do it. This product is excellent if you have color treated hair, perhaps even too good. I was staining my pillow case for weeks because this product did not bleed any of the dye out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because it is not really that different from Loreal&#x27;s Hydracharge Cleansing, which is $6 and has a similar ingredient list. It works great, but it&#x27;s a bit pricey when there are other products that do the same thing.</li>
            <li> This is great for color-treated hair including my dry hair. I don&#x27;t know how it works but you use it without conditioner and still manage to have hair that&#x27;s soft. My only complaint is that it is pricey as you don&#x27;t get much product for your money at all. But I still recommend and plan to repurchase.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent. Unfortunately Kerastase has discontinued it and the prices have skyrocketed.</li>
            <li> I read about this product in a magazine.  I do like the shampoo, however it is a pump style bottle and not the easiest to get out the product out.  I do feel like my hair looks good for only done day.  I wash my hair only every other day.  My hair doesn&#x27;t look at good the second day...</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo for holding the color in my hair</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my hair feel, but my family hate the smell.  I wish this had a more appealing scent.</li>
            <li> Compare with wen pretty much the same!</li>
            <li> Better than any &amp;#34;non-poo&amp;#34; shampoo...my hair looked great after using!  And it was not greasy...and I have oily roots dry ends which can be a challenge...</li>
            <li> Keep the red in my hair when I shampoo. Now it gently fades, instead of rapidly fading. Worth the price. Great savings here at Amazon over salon prices at Gene Juarez. It is non-sudsing, so follow the directions.</li>
            <li> Kerastase has created a really terrific shampoo for anyone with dry, color-treated or otherwise fragile hair who&#x27;s trying to achieve shine and softness. Honest, you don&#x27;t even need to use conditioner with it -- and that&#x27;s an even bigger plus as the sweaty season approaches. It also has a nice cumulative effect: My hair is usually prone to split ends and that problem has subsided noticeably since I started using this product three months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside: It&#x27;s difficult to space shampoos over the recommended (for color-treated hair) three days. By day three, your hair will look a bit flat and it will take 3-4 \\&quot;pumps\\&quot; of product times two washes to get good results. Guess that&#x27;s the price of no sulfates.</li>
