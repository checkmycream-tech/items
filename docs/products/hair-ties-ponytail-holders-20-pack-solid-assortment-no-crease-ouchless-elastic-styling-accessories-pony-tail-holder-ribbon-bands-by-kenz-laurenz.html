            <li>The packaging was cute..</li>
            <li>I really like the concept of the ponytail holders, but they don&#x27;t work great with my hair thickness.</li>
            <li>Love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put them out in my room, on top of the plastic bag</li>
            <li>: )  </li>
            <li>They are cute though, and they hold my hair well.</li>
            <li>Love these hair ties,great color variety.</li>
            <li>I love sleep, so waking up in the morning to do my hair.....</li>
            <li>Love these bands, they are super comfy and love the assortment of colors.</li>

            <li>So far they are just as good and about a 4th of the price.</li>
            <li>No tangle, does&#x27;nt break hair, fun!</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>bold--</li>
            <li>This seller offers many colors and patterns.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, a reviewer here noted she&#x27;d tried the more expensive ones and these were just as good, so here I am!  </li>
            <li>favorite part, next to the cuteness factor, is that they don&#x27;t leave a crease in your hair after wearing it up all day or night!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be gifting some to girlfriends and ordering more in prints next...</li>
            <li>In the store you have to pay more for these individually.</li>
            <li>She said you pay so much for your hair</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>in a loose ponytail by wrapping one of these around 2 times, easily.</li>
            <li>The stretch out a little too much when I use them, but otherwise I love.</li>
            <li>durable and serve their purpose, but stretch out easily after use whereas other brands do not.</li>
            <li>I got it for a secret Santa thing and my person loved it.</li>
            <li>why are you ruining it with those cheap ties then pulled a few of these out from her smock and said she got them on amazon.</li>
            <li>According to her, they&#x27;re more durable than other hair ties and they don&#x27;t mess up her hair as much?</li>
            <li>Purchased these for my 2 year old niece, both she and her mom loves them.</li>
            <li>Lol I get headaches when my heavy thick hair gets too long</li>
            <li>I can barely wrap them around my pony tale</li>
            <li>I felt they were to loose for a normal rotation  on a ponytail, I thought I would never finish with the going around rotation.</li>

            <li> I felt they were to loose for a normal rotation  on a ponytail, I thought I would never finish with the going around rotation.</li>
            <li> I flat ironed my hair and put it up in a pony tail before I went to sleep......and drum roll please....</li>
            <li> They are not tight without a few wraps</li>
            <li> Have been using only two for the last month and so far they haven&#x27;t broken yet.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used one in my hair wet</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> Think she was talking about they don&#x27;t tangle her hair or damage her hair as much as other hair ties...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really small and don&#x27;t work to hold my hair back</li>
            <li> Or, I can get a tight ponytail, by carefully looping one around 3 times.</li>
            <li> As someone who loses hair ties constantly, this packed has lasted me for a while...</li>
            <li> although i&#x27;m down to like 4 now...</li>
            <li> I bought these because reviewers said they didn&#x27;t leave a mark after you took out the ponytail, but they&#x27;ve left a mark every time for me so far :(  </li>
            <li> yet so I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;d be recommended</li>
            <li> I always buy my no crease hair ties on amazon and opted for these since they are cheaper than the ones I usually buy.</li>
            <li> I was at the hair salon the other day and the girl who washes my hair reprimanded me for wearing those thin elastic bands in my hair.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to, I tried these bad boys out last night,</li>
            <li> can wrap my thick, Afghan hair (and lots of it!!)</li>
            <li> Not impressed with these  </li>
            <li> well lets just say I hate doing it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> These are a good quality but I cannot use them  I can barely wrap them around my pony tale 2x  They are not tight without a few wraps</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly. Works great!</li>
            <li> I was at the hair salon the other day and the girl who washes my hair reprimanded me for wearing those thin elastic bands in my hair. She said you pay so much for your hair why are you ruining it with those cheap ties then pulled a few of these out from her smock and said she got them on amazon. I went online and purchased my own, they are amazing! They look great in my hair and they don&#x27;t create those big annoying bumps. This seller offers many colors and patterns. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> durable and serve their purpose, but stretch out easily after use whereas other brands do not.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with these  I felt they were to loose for a normal rotation  on a ponytail, I thought I would never finish with the going around rotation.</li>
            <li> These are the best hair ties! The packaging was cute..I would like to see some pattern options in the future. Other than that they are perfect!!</li>
            <li> I ordered a 20-pack and only received 19 in the bag.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves these-they came in quickly and she said they&#x27;re perfect! According to her, they&#x27;re more durable than other hair ties and they don&#x27;t mess up her hair as much? Think she was talking about they don&#x27;t tangle her hair or damage her hair as much as other hair ties...whatever she meant, I&#x27;m glad she was happy with these!</li>
            <li> The stretch out a little too much when I use them, but otherwise I love. And no creases left in my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the concept of the ponytail holders, but they don&#x27;t work great with my hair thickness.</li>
            <li> So happy with this purchase!  I sorted through a ton of different types of hair ties and reviews before deciding on these and I&#x27;m grateful for the value of what I received!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some more expensive ones claimed to prevent headaches...? Lol I get headaches when my heavy thick hair gets too long but it&#x27;s not from my style of hair tie, ha!  Thankfully, a reviewer here noted she&#x27;d tried the more expensive ones and these were just as good, so here I am!  Smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happily received all of the colors in the rainbow, lol, and I am one happy lady!  I&#x27;m uploading a photo so you can see my assortment of solid colors; all 20 included!  Bright, shimmery, some soft and some bold-- Love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can wrap my thick, Afghan hair (and lots of it!!) in a loose ponytail by wrapping one of these around 2 times, easily. Or, I can get a tight ponytail, by carefully looping one around 3 times. It does take a minute to pull it all through but I understand these do stretch a bit, after a week or two of use, so no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part, next to the cuteness factor, is that they don&#x27;t leave a crease in your hair after wearing it up all day or night! I haven&#x27;t used one in my hair wet yet so I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;d be recommended but I&#x27;ll update this review after some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the stench factor-- Yes, they stink like they came out of a factory in China. I put them out in my room, on top of the plastic bag they came in, next to a carbon filter. After a couple of days, no smell whatsoever...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy the filter here on Amazon and you can read my review and see how else I use it, if you like:&lt;br /&gt;https://www.amazon.com/review/R1DH5VZRNQX726/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this is helpful!  : )  I&#x27;ll be gifting some to girlfriends and ordering more in prints next...</li>
            <li> Totally cute, and all the colors are really nice. Have been using only two for the last month and so far they haven&#x27;t broken yet.</li>
            <li> Great colors and sturdy!</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my 2 year old niece, both she and her mom loves them. They don&#x27;t pull your hair out.</li>
            <li> I got it for a secret Santa thing and my person loved it. Best thing ever</li>
            <li> I bought these because reviewers said they didn&#x27;t leave a mark after you took out the ponytail, but they&#x27;ve left a mark every time for me so far :(  They are cute though, and they hold my hair well. I will definitely continue to use them, just not for the reason I had hoped!</li>
            <li> Love these bands, they are super comfy and love the assortment of colors.</li>
            <li> Love these hair ties,great color variety.</li>
            <li> I always buy my no crease hair ties on amazon and opted for these since they are cheaper than the ones I usually buy. So far they are just as good and about a 4th of the price. 4/5 stars since some of the colors I may not use.</li>
            <li> Just as expected. My wife uses these all the time and loves them.</li>
            <li> Seriously love these!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t hold my hair as well as I had hoped.  Nice colors, but I wish they weren&#x27;t shimmery.</li>
            <li> love these hair ties, unfortunately so do my cats...</li>
            <li> Work great!!  Won&#x27;t damage hair.  Love!</li>
            <li> I love sleep, so waking up in the morning to do my hair.....well lets just say I hate doing it. Now I don&#x27;t have to, I tried these bad boys out last night, I flat ironed my hair and put it up in a pony tail before I went to sleep......and drum roll please....no creases in the morning, just had to brush and go. Also, the ties do not get tangled in your hair so it doesn&#x27;t hurt coming out.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really small and don&#x27;t work to hold my hair back</li>
            <li> These are great and a great value. In the store you have to pay more for these individually. As someone who loses hair ties constantly, this packed has lasted me for a while...although i&#x27;m down to like 4 now...</li>
            <li> love these!! they work just like emi jays, and one individual hair tie lasts you a while!</li>
            <li> Quantity and quality for the price are great!</li>
            <li> No tangle, does&#x27;nt break hair, fun!</li>
            <li> Work fine and do not break off my hair.</li>
            <li> Love these Hair ties, and were a great price for lots of pretty colors</li>
