            <li>Good bang for the buck.</li>

            <li>Good stuff but not excelent</li>
            <li>Tools seem to be of good quality.</li>
            <li>Excellent for travel or as primary set.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good</li>
            <li>I expect it will hold up to good use.</li>
            <li>It seems to be of good quality</li>
            <li>Cool package and all the tools are great quality!</li>
            <li>He is very pleased.  </li>
            <li>He has not used the tools yet because the set was purchased for his travel, but I am sure he will be happy with the function of all pieces in the set.</li>
            <li>Very pleased that it made him happy :-)</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Really nice set and appears to be of good quality.</li>
            <li>the manicure tools are nice looking and of good quality.  </li>
            <li>quality of the items is not the best, but they all do the job just fine, and the quality is not terrible.  </li>
            <li>I love this manicure set!</li>
            <li>but this is the first one I&#x27;ve been so impressed with I had to review.</li>
            <li>Perfect size to fit easily in a travel bag.</li>
            <li>The implements are fabulous and work great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s an amazing deal for the price, which is unbeatable for this combination of items.</li>
            <li>Nice groomer set.</li>
            <li>Nice looking set.  </li>
            <li>The ear scoop is a nice alternative to q-tips.</li>
            <li>Everything I need, nice and compact.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s nice enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has everything you could need, and fits nicely in a purse.</li>
            <li>The case is nice and all the tools work well except the nail clippers.</li>
            <li>The nail file was nice.</li>
            <li>A nice case too.</li>
            <li>Like I said, it&#x27;s a nice concept to have grooming tools in an easy-carry case, but this seemed thrown together without thought for quality.</li>
            <li>I have to say I&#x27;m impressed with the high quality materials.</li>
            <li>High quality case; great product!</li>
            <li>The quality of the case and the contents is very good and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>I love the essentials &amp; they are well fitted to the carrying case for ease of transport for those moments when you just need to clean yourself or your loved ones :)</li>
            <li>The answer is fantastic!</li>
            <li>There are better options out there.</li>
            <li>I love the synthetic leather pouch they include.</li>
            <li>Truthfully, there&#x27;s a couple of things in here that I don&#x27;t know what they are.  </li>
            <li>The scissors are wonderful, and the file actually files.</li>
            <li>Well, almost always. :)</li>
            <li>I have not been using this more than a week or so now,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure to order more of these.</li>
            <li>what more do you need?</li>
            <li>Very solid and works great!  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>awesome quality and only the essentials.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scissors should have been secured better so they didn&#x27;t slide around.</li>
            <li>Not terrible, but wasn&#x27;t really that great either.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure he will enjoy it and have many years of usage.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great choice for a frequent traveler like myself!  </li>
            <li>The zipper gets stuck near the end and the tools, LOL, they are like tools your expect to see in a doll house.</li>
            <li>Really good quality tools in a very compact case.</li>
            <li>However, the tweezers don&#x27;t work very well and the nail clippers aren&#x27;t as good as others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The set is very compact and the tools are good quality.</li>
            <li>but HeadBlade does not make it easy.</li>
            <li>Its easy to use</li>
            <li>They have a strong metallic smell that stays on your hands when you use them.</li>
            <li>Since I keep this in my purse for emergencies, it is fine.  </li>
            <li>Judged on function, everything in the kit is fine.</li>
            <li>and it was fine.  </li>
            <li>these grab just fine</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my son and am super pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>This is the best little manicure set.  </li>
            <li>This little tool is the perfect alternative.</li>
            <li>Perfect for travel and everyday carry in a man bag, i.e. in my case a briefcase/attache.</li>
            <li>Nice to get a quality product at a reasonable price for a change.  </li>
            <li>and I actually enjoy the result.</li>
            <li>It has a nice compact design, so it doesn&#x27;t take much space on the shelf or in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in all, a nice kit, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>case itself seemed cheaply made</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s sort of a nice thing -- you can replace any of the items (if they&#x27;re the same size) if you want and still have it all packaged nicely.  </li>
            <li>The hangnail tool is very useful and is really helping me to get my nails looking nice again.</li>
            <li>everything you need in a small case;  awesome.</li>
            <li>cheap but not bad at all</li>
            <li>I can say all the tools are high quality and the case is full zip, nice leather feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a straight guy, but I&#x27;d look sexy if these fit me.</li>
            <li>Its amazing how much better the items work than the chinese junk sold at wallyworld.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been one to clean the cuticles, but I might just have to have my wife show me the ropes.</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy more of these as needed.</li>
            <li>I realize they are not very expensive, but the quality is more like something you might find in a dollar store and a fairer price might be $5.99.</li>
            <li>Case is great but the tools inside seem to be a little bit on the cheap side.</li>
            <li>I was relatively happy when this kit arrived; the tools were sharp and not too chintzy for the price.</li>
            <li>how great could it be for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Received quickly.</li>
            <li>The fact that the zipper came apart so quickly Causes the kit to lose another star.</li>
            <li>Super sleek set.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scissors are quite nice - I have big fingers and still found them comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>The tweezers were certainly adequate.</li>
            <li>well designed and the tools are certainly a good value for the dollar - I&#x27;ve seen more expensive kits that had components not this nice.</li>
            <li>what that was for, is used to cut that rough cuticle skin off (again, didn&#x27;t really know what a cuticle was or how this tool was used at first, but now I can say it works incredibly well).</li>
            <li>They have large finger holes, which make them comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>The only positive thing I can really say about this set is, it&#x27;s a GREAT size for purse or travel.</li>
            <li>Great little kit for carrying in pocket or purse.</li>
            <li>great little kit, dont be suprised by the price</li>
            <li>Great little set for the price.  </li>
            <li>Great compact little manicure set.</li>
            <li>Quality construction utensils and case, nice compact slim profile, utensils perfomed on par with their respective duty.</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s well worth the money and is a well designed and useful kit.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.  </li>
            <li>There are 6 different tools in the case, each with its own leather holder.</li>
            <li>Sharp tools and good quality stitching on the case.</li>
            <li>As soon as my wife shows me what each one is for, I&#x27;ll get right on it.  </li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>Well made, compact, contains all the right essentials.</li>
            <li>Everything else is pretty much &amp;#34;functional&amp;#34; but nothing special.</li>
            <li>The price: Cheap compared to so many other grooming</li>
            <li>Very nice, though I wish the case had just a little more room in it - things fit very tightly in it.</li>
            <li>They do cost more, but it&#x27;s worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li>It can be taken anywhere and makes it more likely that you will pull it out and work with</li>
            <li>Any clippers bought at a local store will work much better.</li>
            <li>parts.&lt;br /&gt;Scissor are pretty sharp!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly was I needed.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 18 year old son as one of those items to go in his graduation gift box of treasures filled with life&#x27;s &amp;#34;must</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m keeping it, but the zipper came apart the first day.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good set- the scissors are a little flimsy, though, but they are sharp and cut nicely.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not durable, the closed zip is opening easily with hand but generally its nice.</li>
            <li>Everything is what they said it was, the items are nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>He mentioned how sharp the tools were and how nice the set was.</li>
            <li>, I find it much more useful than I expected.</li>
            <li>The small carrying case is a nice black leather, which looks good as well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Wish the nail cutter was a bit larger and stronger as I have strong nails</li>
            <li>The parts feel a little cheap in some ways, but they hold up fine and work</li>
            <li>Nice little kit.</li>
            <li>This is a nice little set, considering the price.</li>
            <li>Nice little leather zipper case and</li>
            <li>Right up there with high end, and high price, kits.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.</li>
            <li>they will think I spent a lot more than I did (unless they read this).</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone who wants a step up in quality.</li>
            <li>I picked up some Tweezerman pieces and I am much happier with those.</li>
            <li>Process: Extremely fast shipping which arrived before the estimated date.</li>
            <li>Overall, the set appears to be cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know much else to say about it</li>
            <li>It inclues everything you need in a manicure set and it is very compact.</li>
            <li>He says the whole set is well made.  </li>
            <li>Very compact and has everything you need...</li>
            <li>and she really likes it.</li>
            <li>Very convenient when travels...</li>
            <li>They are miniature versions of a real size tools.</li>
            <li>The clippers are pretty flimsy and I don&#x27;t think they will hold up very well under normal use.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to buy this kind of stuff online, this one you will love it.</li>
            <li>: Each piece comes with a simple, unique mechanical look to it while maintaining a certain edge of style.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Buying this manicure set has helped me clean my hands after those dirty days and keep my nails looking great.</li>
            <li>but I wanted a useful product small enough to carry with good quality tools.</li>
            <li>(I just keep them clean and very short) and</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and the quality of the kit is far higher than the price would lead you to believe.</li>
            <li>I gather the last utensil is to clean your ears - we&#x27;ll see about that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice little kit!</li>
            <li>Super sharp, super compact.</li>
            <li>The clipper is strong and sharp enough to cut nails cleanly.</li>
            <li>The product is made in China, there are probably better more expensive manicures than this one.</li>
            <li>High quality, inexpensive</li>
            <li>I will say that all of the items are of shockingly high quality materials.  </li>
            <li>High quality tools here.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this kit.</li>
            <li>High quality hardware, sleek holder, husband LOVES it.</li>
            <li>Love these little sets.  </li>
            <li>After searching reviews here and youtube videos to find out what I&#x27;m actually supposed to do with all these things, I have to say, they are worth the couple bucks.  </li>
            <li>Nice high quality case, very sharp and solid, Doesn&#x27;t feel like it is going to fall apart in your hands like some others do.</li>
            <li>The cuticle cutter is nice and sharp but a little small for good manicuring.  </li>
            <li>Nice little kit does the job especially like the metal nail file</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s his own personal little kit</li>
            <li>Also, I love the leather case...looks expensive and feels and smells like genuine leather.</li>
            <li>He was a bit confused with the tools for grooming the cuticles, but after a brief explanation about them, he was really happy with the set.</li>
            <li>The nail clippers have a bit of an odd feel, but function fine.</li>
            <li>Love the case and design - all the right tools - the machining just seems a little rough or sharp on the edges - needs some more polish on edges of clippers, especially.</li>
            <li>just so I could have these handy when I finish getting dirty and need to clean up for a formal occasion.  </li>
            <li>The file folds into its handle, and the tip is pointed enough to clean under nails but blunt enough not to hurt.</li>
            <li>Clippers in particular are not sharp.</li>
            <li>The Nautica case was a bit bulky, but the HeadBlade case is small enough to tuck into even a front jean pocket and I am able to store it in my dopp kit, so that I can readily find it.  </li>
            <li>A little smaller than I thought, but it&#x27;s a great little product.  </li>
            <li>I realize they are small to fit into the case but it made them much less easy to use.</li>
            <li>The tools are sharp, but a little flimsy and they&#x27;re fine for occasional light use.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to call the kit fancy, but it was sufficient.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mean to be reviewing myself more than the product, because it seems this must be a common issue and many men, like myself, have never gotten or given a manicure before.</li>
            <li>It has all the essentials and is small and easy to pack for travel or put in the bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality set of essential grooming tools.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend this highly as a gift or for personal use.</li>
            <li>The little scissors work great too...perfect for hair trimming (I have a thick coarse beard and they trim it with ease).  </li>
            <li>While this is a minor annoyance since I keep the kit at my desk, I&#x27;d really prefer one that zipped up.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love having a day  of planting, running, playing basketball that gets everything dirty, so It was nice having some clean nails (and a hand</li>
            <li>It is small enough to fit well into his travel bag and the leather case is masculine and understated -- just as a young man would like it to be.</li>
            <li>Each piece functions very well and will likely last years without breaking.&lt;br /&gt;Aesthetics</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a simple but complete, high quality personal grooming kit, I recommend this 100%.</li>
            <li>file,will pul to finish off the nails after clipping so there are no sharp</li>
            <li>NOT sharp, creates a ragged edge on the nail.  </li>
            <li>The case itself is small (easily fits in the palm of my hand or in the corner of my Dopp kit), has a good zipper (usually the weak point in small, cheap cases) and is made from a durable leather-like material.</li>
            <li>The tools are made of a dull, cheap looking metal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have all these little tools in one small set.</li>
            <li>I have used each tool in this kit except the tweezers, each is a quality instrument that executes its intended purpose as well as a far more expensive tool.</li>
            <li>The nail cutter and small scissor was razor sharp, I was suprised how easy it cut through my nails.</li>
            <li>Everything you could need for on-the-go hygiene in a smart little package.&lt;br</li>

            <li> The items are good quality.</li>
            <li> Good stuff but not excelent</li>
            <li> Tools seem to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> Excellent for travel or as primary set.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good</li>
            <li> I expect it will hold up to good use.</li>
            <li> It seems to be of good quality</li>
            <li> Cool package and all the tools are great quality!</li>
            <li> He is very pleased.  </li>
            <li> He has not used the tools yet because the set was purchased for his travel, but I am sure he will be happy with the function of all pieces in the set.</li>
            <li> Very pleased that it made him happy :-)</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Really nice set and appears to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> the manicure tools are nice looking and of good quality.  </li>
            <li> quality of the items is not the best, but they all do the job just fine, and the quality is not terrible.  </li>
            <li> I love this manicure set!</li>
            <li> but this is the first one I&#x27;ve been so impressed with I had to review.</li>
            <li> Perfect size to fit easily in a travel bag.</li>
            <li> The implements are fabulous and work great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s an amazing deal for the price, which is unbeatable for this combination of items.</li>
            <li> Nice groomer set.</li>
            <li> Nice looking set.  </li>
            <li> The ear scoop is a nice alternative to q-tips.</li>
            <li> Everything I need, nice and compact.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s nice enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has everything you could need, and fits nicely in a purse.</li>
            <li> The case is nice and all the tools work well except the nail clippers.</li>
            <li> The nail file was nice.</li>
            <li> A nice case too.</li>
            <li> Like I said, it&#x27;s a nice concept to have grooming tools in an easy-carry case, but this seemed thrown together without thought for quality.</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m impressed with the high quality materials.</li>
            <li> High quality case; great product!</li>
            <li> The quality of the case and the contents is very good and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> I love the essentials &amp; they are well fitted to the carrying case for ease of transport for those moments when you just need to clean yourself or your loved ones :)</li>
            <li> The answer is fantastic!</li>
            <li> There are better options out there.</li>
            <li> I love the synthetic leather pouch they include.</li>
            <li> Truthfully, there&#x27;s a couple of things in here that I don&#x27;t know what they are.  </li>
            <li> The scissors are wonderful, and the file actually files.</li>
            <li> Well, almost always. :)</li>
            <li> I have not been using this more than a week or so now,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure to order more of these.</li>
            <li> what more do you need?</li>
            <li> Very solid and works great!  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> awesome quality and only the essentials.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scissors should have been secured better so they didn&#x27;t slide around.</li>
            <li> Not terrible, but wasn&#x27;t really that great either.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure he will enjoy it and have many years of usage.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great choice for a frequent traveler like myself!  </li>
            <li> The zipper gets stuck near the end and the tools, LOL, they are like tools your expect to see in a doll house.</li>
            <li> Really good quality tools in a very compact case.</li>
            <li> However, the tweezers don&#x27;t work very well and the nail clippers aren&#x27;t as good as others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The set is very compact and the tools are good quality.</li>
            <li> but HeadBlade does not make it easy.</li>
            <li> Its easy to use</li>
            <li> They have a strong metallic smell that stays on your hands when you use them.</li>
            <li> Since I keep this in my purse for emergencies, it is fine.  </li>
            <li> Judged on function, everything in the kit is fine.</li>
            <li> and it was fine.  </li>
            <li> these grab just fine</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son and am super pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> This is the best little manicure set.  </li>
            <li> This little tool is the perfect alternative.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel and everyday carry in a man bag, i.e. in my case a briefcase/attache.</li>
            <li> Nice to get a quality product at a reasonable price for a change.  </li>
            <li> and I actually enjoy the result.</li>
            <li> It has a nice compact design, so it doesn&#x27;t take much space on the shelf or in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in all, a nice kit, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> case itself seemed cheaply made</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s sort of a nice thing -- you can replace any of the items (if they&#x27;re the same size) if you want and still have it all packaged nicely.  </li>
            <li> The hangnail tool is very useful and is really helping me to get my nails looking nice again.</li>
            <li> everything you need in a small case;  awesome.</li>
            <li> cheap but not bad at all</li>
            <li> I can say all the tools are high quality and the case is full zip, nice leather feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a straight guy, but I&#x27;d look sexy if these fit me.</li>
            <li> Its amazing how much better the items work than the chinese junk sold at wallyworld.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to clean the cuticles, but I might just have to have my wife show me the ropes.</li>
            <li> I will certainly buy more of these as needed.</li>
            <li> I realize they are not very expensive, but the quality is more like something you might find in a dollar store and a fairer price might be $5.99.</li>
            <li> Case is great but the tools inside seem to be a little bit on the cheap side.</li>
            <li> I was relatively happy when this kit arrived; the tools were sharp and not too chintzy for the price.</li>
            <li> how great could it be for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Received quickly.</li>
            <li> The fact that the zipper came apart so quickly Causes the kit to lose another star.</li>
            <li> Super sleek set.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scissors are quite nice - I have big fingers and still found them comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> The tweezers were certainly adequate.</li>
            <li> well designed and the tools are certainly a good value for the dollar - I&#x27;ve seen more expensive kits that had components not this nice.</li>
            <li> what that was for, is used to cut that rough cuticle skin off (again, didn&#x27;t really know what a cuticle was or how this tool was used at first, but now I can say it works incredibly well).</li>
            <li> They have large finger holes, which make them comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> The only positive thing I can really say about this set is, it&#x27;s a GREAT size for purse or travel.</li>
            <li> Great little kit for carrying in pocket or purse.</li>
            <li> great little kit, dont be suprised by the price</li>
            <li> Great little set for the price.  </li>
            <li> Great compact little manicure set.</li>
            <li> Quality construction utensils and case, nice compact slim profile, utensils perfomed on par with their respective duty.</li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s well worth the money and is a well designed and useful kit.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.  </li>
            <li> There are 6 different tools in the case, each with its own leather holder.</li>
            <li> Sharp tools and good quality stitching on the case.</li>
            <li> As soon as my wife shows me what each one is for, I&#x27;ll get right on it.  </li>
            <li> Just right.</li>
            <li> Well made, compact, contains all the right essentials.</li>
            <li> Everything else is pretty much &amp;#34;functional&amp;#34; but nothing special.</li>
            <li> The price: Cheap compared to so many other grooming</li>
            <li> Very nice, though I wish the case had just a little more room in it - things fit very tightly in it.</li>
            <li> They do cost more, but it&#x27;s worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> It can be taken anywhere and makes it more likely that you will pull it out and work with</li>
            <li> Any clippers bought at a local store will work much better.</li>
            <li> parts.&lt;br /&gt;Scissor are pretty sharp!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly was I needed.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 18 year old son as one of those items to go in his graduation gift box of treasures filled with life&#x27;s &amp;#34;must</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping it, but the zipper came apart the first day.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good set- the scissors are a little flimsy, though, but they are sharp and cut nicely.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not durable, the closed zip is opening easily with hand but generally its nice.</li>
            <li> Everything is what they said it was, the items are nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> He mentioned how sharp the tools were and how nice the set was.</li>
            <li> , I find it much more useful than I expected.</li>
            <li> The small carrying case is a nice black leather, which looks good as well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Wish the nail cutter was a bit larger and stronger as I have strong nails</li>
            <li> The parts feel a little cheap in some ways, but they hold up fine and work</li>
            <li> Nice little kit.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little set, considering the price.</li>
            <li> Nice little leather zipper case and</li>
            <li> Right up there with high end, and high price, kits.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast.</li>
            <li> they will think I spent a lot more than I did (unless they read this).</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone who wants a step up in quality.</li>
            <li> I picked up some Tweezerman pieces and I am much happier with those.</li>
            <li> Process: Extremely fast shipping which arrived before the estimated date.</li>
            <li> Overall, the set appears to be cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know much else to say about it</li>
            <li> It inclues everything you need in a manicure set and it is very compact.</li>
            <li> He says the whole set is well made.  </li>
            <li> Very compact and has everything you need...</li>
            <li> and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> Very convenient when travels...</li>
            <li> They are miniature versions of a real size tools.</li>
            <li> The clippers are pretty flimsy and I don&#x27;t think they will hold up very well under normal use.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to buy this kind of stuff online, this one you will love it.</li>
            <li> : Each piece comes with a simple, unique mechanical look to it while maintaining a certain edge of style.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Buying this manicure set has helped me clean my hands after those dirty days and keep my nails looking great.</li>
            <li> but I wanted a useful product small enough to carry with good quality tools.</li>
            <li> (I just keep them clean and very short) and</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and the quality of the kit is far higher than the price would lead you to believe.</li>
            <li> I gather the last utensil is to clean your ears - we&#x27;ll see about that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice little kit!</li>
            <li> Super sharp, super compact.</li>
            <li> The clipper is strong and sharp enough to cut nails cleanly.</li>
            <li> The product is made in China, there are probably better more expensive manicures than this one.</li>
            <li> High quality, inexpensive</li>
            <li> I will say that all of the items are of shockingly high quality materials.  </li>
            <li> High quality tools here.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this kit.</li>
            <li> High quality hardware, sleek holder, husband LOVES it.</li>
            <li> Love these little sets.  </li>
            <li> After searching reviews here and youtube videos to find out what I&#x27;m actually supposed to do with all these things, I have to say, they are worth the couple bucks.  </li>
            <li> Nice high quality case, very sharp and solid, Doesn&#x27;t feel like it is going to fall apart in your hands like some others do.</li>
            <li> The cuticle cutter is nice and sharp but a little small for good manicuring.  </li>
            <li> Nice little kit does the job especially like the metal nail file</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s his own personal little kit</li>
            <li> Also, I love the leather case...looks expensive and feels and smells like genuine leather.</li>
            <li> He was a bit confused with the tools for grooming the cuticles, but after a brief explanation about them, he was really happy with the set.</li>
            <li> The nail clippers have a bit of an odd feel, but function fine.</li>
            <li> Love the case and design - all the right tools - the machining just seems a little rough or sharp on the edges - needs some more polish on edges of clippers, especially.</li>
            <li> just so I could have these handy when I finish getting dirty and need to clean up for a formal occasion.  </li>
            <li> The file folds into its handle, and the tip is pointed enough to clean under nails but blunt enough not to hurt.</li>
            <li> Clippers in particular are not sharp.</li>
            <li> The Nautica case was a bit bulky, but the HeadBlade case is small enough to tuck into even a front jean pocket and I am able to store it in my dopp kit, so that I can readily find it.  </li>
            <li> A little smaller than I thought, but it&#x27;s a great little product.  </li>
            <li> I realize they are small to fit into the case but it made them much less easy to use.</li>
            <li> The tools are sharp, but a little flimsy and they&#x27;re fine for occasional light use.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to call the kit fancy, but it was sufficient.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean to be reviewing myself more than the product, because it seems this must be a common issue and many men, like myself, have never gotten or given a manicure before.</li>
            <li> It has all the essentials and is small and easy to pack for travel or put in the bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality set of essential grooming tools.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend this highly as a gift or for personal use.</li>
            <li> The little scissors work great too...perfect for hair trimming (I have a thick coarse beard and they trim it with ease).  </li>
            <li> While this is a minor annoyance since I keep the kit at my desk, I&#x27;d really prefer one that zipped up.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love having a day  of planting, running, playing basketball that gets everything dirty, so It was nice having some clean nails (and a hand</li>
            <li> It is small enough to fit well into his travel bag and the leather case is masculine and understated -- just as a young man would like it to be.</li>
            <li> Each piece functions very well and will likely last years without breaking.&lt;br /&gt;Aesthetics</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a simple but complete, high quality personal grooming kit, I recommend this 100%.</li>
            <li> file,will pul to finish off the nails after clipping so there are no sharp</li>
            <li> NOT sharp, creates a ragged edge on the nail.  </li>
            <li> The case itself is small (easily fits in the palm of my hand or in the corner of my Dopp kit), has a good zipper (usually the weak point in small, cheap cases) and is made from a durable leather-like material.</li>
            <li> The tools are made of a dull, cheap looking metal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have all these little tools in one small set.</li>
            <li> I have used each tool in this kit except the tweezers, each is a quality instrument that executes its intended purpose as well as a far more expensive tool.</li>
            <li> The nail cutter and small scissor was razor sharp, I was suprised how easy it cut through my nails.</li>
            <li> Everything you could need for on-the-go hygiene in a smart little package.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not as firm a grab as a really high quality tweezer, but I&#x27;ll use these for now and if they stop grabbing well, as I find second rate tweezers often do, I&#x27;ll replace them in the set, but keep the set the way it is.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a teenager and has everything, so this was something small and personal that he appreciated</li>
            <li> They are poorly made and don&#x27;t cut cleanly.</li>
            <li> All the tools have a &#x27;heavy&#x27;, high quality feel to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The nail clippers are sort of the same -- they cut just fine, but not as cleanly as a really expensive pair.  </li>
            <li> The nail clippers in particular are to small.  </li>
            <li> Frankly I&#x27;m not sure how these got rated so high.</li>
            <li> They are pretty weak too.</li>
            <li> The nail clippers are functional and actually cut through the nail, unlike some other sets.</li>
            <li> scissors are short and sharp, with curved, pointed tips.</li>
            <li> a masculine looking package that packs small and has needed grooming items.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are your average, angled tweezers, albeit with the same high-quality feel to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not particularly fond of the file though since it tends to be a bit loose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a typical guy, had no idea what any of these tools were actually used for.  </li>
            <li> was a little on the short side.  </li>
            <li> The nail clippers leave your nails jagged and rough requiring you to have to file every time you clip.</li>
            <li> Scissors aren&#x27;t quite as sturdy as I expected but they are sufficient.</li>
            <li> Yes, the v-shaped tool (after having absolutely no idea</li>
            <li> I just put a rubber band around it to keep it closed.</li>
            <li> The pieces in this kit seem high quality but it is not great for beginners because there is no instruction included</li>
            <li> that said, all the other tools included are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As stated by the other reviews, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Had to return one upon receipt due to a faulty zipper on the case, but got a replacement</li>
            <li> Feels sturdy and sharp</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not exactly fancy about my nails</li>
            <li> The scissors were not that sharp.  </li>
            <li> all tools are sharp.</li>
            <li> The nail clippers seemed sharp enough but left my finger nails in desperate need of filing and left me fearing they would split.  </li>
            <li> I like the nifty little scissors, which are as sharp as you can want.  </li>
            <li> It is very small and portable, the zippered case helps avoid the problem my current kit has with tools falling out.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly with the exception of the cuticle trimmer</li>
            <li> It was also very small and practical to make it possible to carry discretely.</li>
            <li> The previous reviews are correct.</li>
            <li> The packing looks cool, however the quality of instruments is bad.</li>
            <li> My bathroom can be a mess</li>
            <li> The clippers are a little funky.</li>
            <li> This little kit has everything you need in a neat little zip up pouch.</li>
            <li> The nail file was a little too small to wield with any sort of finesse and even the nicely sharp cuticle trimmer</li>
            <li> This little guy does the job.  </li>
            <li> This kit has all of the little tools that i have needed.</li>
            <li> dirt.&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers, for pulling off dead skin, sometimes cleaning the nails with the edg, plucking eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;Nail</li>
            <li> Having been using the china junk ones you get for $1 off a street vendor, I did not know what I was missing.</li>
            <li> After a few months, the kit is holding up well.</li>
            <li> I have bought quite a few items on Amazon</li>
            <li> Q-tips can actually make ear wax issues worse, along with being wasteful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However I think this entire kit is poorly made.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have some trouble getting the clippers in and out.</li>
            <li> And the case is small and compact</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a tiny bit difficult to pull devices out of their elastic hold straps.</li>
            <li> A small manicure set for travel.  </li>
            <li> I also like the small leather case.  </li>
            <li> Small footprint makes packing a snap.</li>
            <li> These implements are too small and delicate for a man.</li>
            <li> Just work slowly and don&#x27;t get too close to your eardrum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very small packaging and appears to be quality materials.</li>
            <li> The nail clipper seems weak and struggles to cut nails.  </li>
            <li> Tearing cuticles or trying to clean grease out from under them is annoying and painful.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s tough to complain.</li>
            <li> Poor Construction and quality.</li>
            <li> The zipper on the case was broken when I took it out of the packaging.  </li>
            <li> With a broken zipper..</li>
            <li> I hate them, so I gave them away, not worth returning.</li>
            <li> but this is just mediocre.</li>
            <li> Turns out I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Sadly this kit was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I always had dirty nails and often would bite my nails to trim them.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t find out how bad they were until well after the return date.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product, it is badly made, the zipper was damaged.  </li>
            <li> nail clippers were quite literally the worst I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect.  Arrived fast.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good set- the scissors are a little flimsy, though, but they are sharp and cut nicely. I like the cuticle- knife, it&#x27;s great to remove this annoying skin from around the nails- before I bought this I didn&#x27;t even know such a thing existed...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! Everything is what they said it was, the items are nice and sharp. And the case is small and compact</li>
            <li> High quality, inexpensive, I find it much more useful than I expected. I take it in my travel bag everywhere. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Great quality and price, would recommend. The case keeps it all in one place.</li>
            <li> everything you need in a small case;  awesome.</li>
            <li> Read great reviews. Thought...how great could it be for such a reasonable price. The answer is fantastic! Really good quality tools in a very compact case. I am thinking of buying this as a gift for others this Christmas...they will think I spent a lot more than I did (unless they read this).</li>
            <li> Case is great but the tools inside seem to be a little bit on the cheap side. The nail clippers leave your nails jagged and rough requiring you to have to file every time you clip. There are better options out there. They do cost more, but it&#x27;s worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> I have used each tool in this kit except the tweezers, each is a quality instrument that executes its intended purpose as well as a far more expensive tool.</li>
            <li> Quality construction utensils and case, nice compact slim profile, utensils perfomed on par with their respective duty. Perfect for travel and everyday carry in a man bag, i.e. in my case a briefcase/attache. Good bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy here, I grew up playing baseball and working outside. I always had dirty nails and often would bite my nails to trim them.Now, later in life, I decided to go with my girlfriend to get a manicure. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love having a day  of planting, running, playing basketball that gets everything dirty, so It was nice having some clean nails (and a hand massage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ON TO THE PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;Buying this manicure set has helped me clean my hands after those dirty days and keep my nails looking great. I love the synthetic leather pouch they include. I think this is what  makes the kit. Putting everything in a convenient location. It can be taken anywhere and makes it more likely that you will pull it out and work with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-1 STAR Why am I giving one star off? The clippers are a little funky. They are pretty weak too. Any clippers bought at a local store will work much better. The product is made in China, there are probably better more expensive manicures than this one. For the price and my use, it does the job and I would recommend this product for someone looking an all in one manicure set for around ten bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, all the other tools included are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I believe the tools are used for:&lt;br /&gt;The tool with the flattened spoon- used for pushing cuticles in&lt;br /&gt;The fork tool is for sliding over your nail to remove fallen nails and dirt.&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers, for pulling off dead skin, sometimes cleaning the nails with the edg, plucking eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;Nail file,will pul to finish off the nails after clipping so there are no sharp parts.&lt;br /&gt;Scissor are pretty sharp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Nail clippers broke after one month.</li>
            <li> Best manicure set I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
            <li> Nice little kit. Truthfully, there&#x27;s a couple of things in here that I don&#x27;t know what they are.  But the quality of the devices and case is good. It&#x27;s just a tiny bit difficult to pull devices out of their elastic hold straps.</li>
            <li> This set is not all that great.  The nail clipper seems weak and struggles to cut nails.  The cuticle cutter is nice and sharp but a little small for good manicuring.  Everything else is pretty much &amp;#34;functional&amp;#34; but nothing special.</li>
            <li> All pieces are good quality. Well packaged. Great for travel. Recommended to guys.</li>
            <li> Nice groomer set. Has everything needed. Although The ear cleaner takes some getting used to. The nail clippers cut well and the cuticle trimmer works great. The little scissors work great too...perfect for hair trimming (I have a thick coarse beard and they trim it with ease).  Also, I love the leather case...looks expensive and feels and smells like genuine leather. Perfect for travel...highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The pieces are well-made and solid.  As soon as my wife shows me what each one is for, I&#x27;ll get right on it.  Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Stocking stuffer...a hit!  For the price I feel the items are great!</li>
            <li> Very nice set. Nice high quality case, very sharp and solid, Doesn&#x27;t feel like it is going to fall apart in your hands like some others do. I bought this for myself but would have no problem giving it as a gift.</li>
            <li> NOT sharp, creates a ragged edge on the nail.  These were a gift and I didn&#x27;t find out how bad they were until well after the return date.</li>
            <li> Great value for the money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have all these little tools in one small set. However, the tweezers don&#x27;t work very well and the nail clippers aren&#x27;t as good as others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit to keep my fingers trimmed. I have to say I&#x27;m impressed with the high quality materials. The nail cutter and small scissor was razor sharp, I was suprised how easy it cut through my nails. Having been using the china junk ones you get for $1 off a street vendor, I did not know what I was missing. I thought having to struggle a but before the nail cutter clipped through was the norm. I would recommend to anyone who wants a step up in quality.</li>
            <li> Great grooming set. Wish the nail cutter was a bit larger and stronger as I have strong nails but it does the job. Having a nail file to use afterwards helps. The ear wax remover is good to have too. Definitely recommended for men.</li>
            <li> Looks to be of decent quality however there are no instructions on what some of the odd looking tools are or how they are supposed to be used.  Scissors aren&#x27;t quite as sturdy as I expected but they are sufficient.</li>
            <li> Nice little kit does the job especially like the metal nail file</li>
            <li> Great manicure set. I would recomend it!</li>
            <li> Exactly was I needed.  Excellent quality and love the case.</li>
            <li> These boots make me hornyy just by looking at them. Although I bought the nail clippers not these. lol  I&#x27;m a straight guy, but I&#x27;d look sexy if these fit me.</li>
            <li> Nice looking set.  Good tweezers, cuticle tool and ear spoon.  File is quite good.  Scissors and nail clippers a bit on the flimsy side.  Clippers in particular are not sharp. Good case.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a quality product but this is just mediocre. Something you&#x27;d find at CVS. I picked up some Tweezerman pieces and I am much happier with those.</li>
            <li> Worked for a couple months, lost its force to cut</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  A small manicure set for travel.  The qualify of the tools is superb and the case is also.  Just right.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little set, considering the price. The contents definitely serve their purpose. The nail clippers are functional and actually cut through the nail, unlike some other sets. The scissors are wonderful, and the file actually files. Very happy with this set. Be advised that it&#x27;s bit smaller than it seems; the case is only slightly larger than a deck of cards. Good buy, anyway.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these sets - one for a gift and one for myself. The previous reviews are correct. The items are good quality. I recommend this set.</li>
            <li> Poor Construction and quality.</li>
            <li> This little kit has everything you need in a neat little zip up pouch. My husband was always complaining he could never find clippers, tweezers, etc. when he needed them, so I bought this as a gift for him. Now it&#x27;s his own personal little kit and he always knows where it is. Well, almost always. :)</li>
            <li> Since I keep this in my purse for emergencies, it is fine.  The clippers chip my nails on one side. But, I like having all of the pieces in one kit.</li>
            <li> Good stuff but not excelent</li>
            <li> Wife bought me this kit to keep my grubby fingers trimmed.  I will say that all of the items are of shockingly high quality materials.  Its amazing how much better the items work than the chinese junk sold at wallyworld. i would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Nautica set that came in a wooden box.  I still have the box, but lost all of the stuff.  In comparing it to the Nautica set, it feels very solid and well constructed, like the Nautica.  I also like the small leather case.  The Nautica case was a bit bulky, but the HeadBlade case is small enough to tuck into even a front jean pocket and I am able to store it in my dopp kit, so that I can readily find it.  All in all, it&#x27;s well worth the money and is a well designed and useful kit.</li>
            <li> The pieces in this kit seem high quality but it is not great for beginners because there is no instruction included and I don&#x27;t know how to use them, beyond just the clipper and file. I don&#x27;t mean to be reviewing myself more than the product, because it seems this must be a common issue and many men, like myself, have never gotten or given a manicure before. I am looking forward to figuring out how to use this set for a great look on my nails but HeadBlade does not make it easy.</li>
            <li> The price: Cheap compared to so many other grooming kits.&lt;br /&gt;The quality: Right up there with high end, and high price, kits. Each piece functions very well and will likely last years without breaking.&lt;br /&gt;Aesthetics: Each piece comes with a simple, unique mechanical look to it while maintaining a certain edge of style. The small carrying case is a nice black leather, which looks good as well.&lt;br /&gt;The Process: Extremely fast shipping which arrived before the estimated date. No issues whatsoever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note* I have not been using this more than a week or so now, but during this time I have been using each piece regularly. Will update if anything changes!</li>
            <li> This is the best little manicure set.  The case is perfect to keep everything tidy and fits in any bag.  The implements are fabulous and work great.</li>
            <li> Sadly this kit was disappointing.  It is very small and portable, the zippered case helps avoid the problem my current kit has with tools falling out.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly with the exception of the cuticle trimmer I was disappointed.  The nail clippers seemed sharp enough but left my finger nails in desperate need of filing and left me fearing they would split.  The nail file was a little too small to wield with any sort of finesse and even the nicely sharp cuticle trimmer was a little on the short side.  I realize they are small to fit into the case but it made them much less easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love the case and design - all the right tools - the machining just seems a little rough or sharp on the edges - needs some more polish on edges of clippers, especially.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence...  As a travel grooming kit, it&#x27;s got everything I need and it all seems functional. The nail clippers have a bit of an odd feel, but function fine. After a few months, the kit is holding up well. Judged on function, everything in the kit is fine. The parts feel a little cheap in some ways, but they hold up fine and work well so it&#x27;s tough to complain.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting one for my son and husband. It has all the essentials and is small and easy to pack for travel or put in the bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my nephew. He&#x27;s a teenager and has everything, so this was something small and personal that he appreciated</li>
            <li> My husband had been wanting a manicure set so I bought this one for him.  He is very pleased.  Nice little kit!</li>
            <li> These implements are too small and delicate for a man. The nail clippers in particular are to small.  The cuticle cutter handle is just made of plastic.  Overall, the set appears to be cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 20-something son and he loves it. Really nice set and appears to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> As stated by the other reviews, you get what you pay for. The tools are sharp, but a little flimsy and they&#x27;re fine for occasional light use. If you&#x27;re a compulsive cuticle groomer, though, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> After looking at my local drugstore for a mens grooming kit, and being underwhelmed by the selection I ordered this. I can say all the tools are high quality and the case is full zip, nice leather feel. Small footprint makes packing a snap. I carry this in my EDC bag</li>
            <li> Awesome grooming kit! Well made, compact, contains all the right essentials. I bought this for my 18 year old son as one of those items to go in his graduation gift box of treasures filled with life&#x27;s &amp;#34;must have essentials&amp;#34;. He loves it. So did everyone who saw it... I&#x27;m sure to order more of these.</li>
            <li> I love this manicure set! It&#x27;s compact for my purse, but the tools work so well for my nails. Good price too! Don&#x27;t know much else to say about it: it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Love these little sets.  Had to return one upon receipt due to a faulty zipper on the case, but got a replacement and it was fine.  I just keep one in each car.</li>
            <li> Great little kit for carrying in pocket or purse. Tools seem to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> what more do you need? a masculine looking package that packs small and has needed grooming items. a gift for my brother and he loves it</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product, it is badly made, the zipper was damaged.  I do not recommend the manicure set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a typical guy, had no idea what any of these tools were actually used for.  I purchased them just so I could have these handy when I finish getting dirty and need to clean up for a formal occasion.  After searching reviews here and youtube videos to find out what I&#x27;m actually supposed to do with all these things, I have to say, they are worth the couple bucks.  Yes, the v-shaped tool (after having absolutely no idea what that was for, is used to cut that rough cuticle skin off (again, didn&#x27;t really know what a cuticle was or how this tool was used at first, but now I can say it works incredibly well).</li>
            <li> The quality of the case and the contents is very good and the price was reasonable. I got this set for my son and he is happy with it. It is small enough to fit well into his travel bag and the leather case is masculine and understated -- just as a young man would like it to be.</li>
            <li> This is a great portable kit! I use it to take to work, and all the tools are well constructed. I will certainly buy more of these as needed.</li>
            <li> Great compact Manicure set. Perfect for those that travel. It inclues everything you need in a manicure set and it is very compact.</li>
            <li> great little kit, dont be suprised by the price</li>
            <li> As advertised. Clippers that cut and a file that files! Excellent set!</li>
            <li> Perfect for the price.</li>
            <li> cheap but not bad at all</li>
            <li> Best grooming kit I&#x27;ve ever had. I keep it in my gym bag and use the ear cleaner, cuticle blade and nail clip often. They&#x27;re great. Sharp tools and good quality stitching on the case.</li>
            <li> High quality tools here.  Worth the money.  Ear wax tool works well and so does the ingrown hair tool and clippers.  I would highly recommend this kit.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this.  He says the whole set is well made.  The ear scoop is a nice alternative to q-tips.</li>
            <li> The only positive thing I can really say about this set is, it&#x27;s a GREAT size for purse or travel. The shipping and packaging was perfect too. The tools are made of a dull, cheap looking metal. They have a strong metallic smell that stays on your hands when you use them. The clippers are pretty flimsy and I don&#x27;t think they will hold up very well under normal use. I realize they are not very expensive, but the quality is more like something you might find in a dollar store and a fairer price might be $5.99. I hate them, so I gave them away, not worth returning. Frankly I&#x27;m not sure how these got rated so high.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Terrific service. Thank you!</li>
            <li> The packing looks cool, however the quality of instruments is bad.</li>
            <li> Great Product...  Very compact and has everything you need...</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I thought, but it&#x27;s a great little product.  Very solid and works great!  No problems with it and I would recommend it to everyone!  Two thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> The zipper on the case was broken when I took it out of the packaging.  No response from the manufacturer to correct the problem.</li>
            <li> Great little set for the price.  Received quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality set of essential grooming tools.  Excellent for travel or as primary set.</li>
            <li> Super sharp, super compact. The no-fuss mens handshake maintenance kit that WORKS!</li>
            <li> My bathroom can be a mess so I need something to keep my gear together.  This little guy does the job.  I know where it&#x27;s at, I can travel with it, and it gets the job done in manly fashion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping it, but the zipper came apart the first day. I just put a rubber band around it to keep it closed. All the tools are very nice quality.</li>
            <li> I was relatively happy when this kit arrived; the tools were sharp and not too chintzy for the price. I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to call the kit fancy, but it was sufficient. That&#x27;d give the kit 4 stars in my book. Then the case zipper came apart and won&#x27;t go back together. While this is a minor annoyance since I keep the kit at my desk, I&#x27;d really prefer one that zipped up. The fact that the zipper came apart so quickly Causes the kit to lose another star.</li>
            <li> I love the essentials &amp; they are well fitted to the carrying case for ease of transport for those moments when you just need to clean yourself or your loved ones :)</li>
            <li> Gave to granddaughter and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> Everything I need, nice and compact. Sturdy feel to the tools.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Feels sturdy and sharp</li>
            <li> It does what it says it should do. I have no problems with this item which were ordered for two guy&#x27;s travel cases.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s nice enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The zipper of the case it&#x27;s not durable, the closed zip is opening easily with hand but generally its nice.</li>
            <li> very small packaging and appears to be quality materials.</li>
            <li> Cool package and all the tools are great quality!</li>
            <li> Perfect size, just as a expect to be! Sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to buy this kind of stuff online, this one you will love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son and am super pleased with the product.  Very nice zippered case and the manicure tools are nice looking and of good quality.  Nice to get a quality product at a reasonable price for a change.  Would recommend this highly as a gift or for personal use.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband as a Christmas gift. He likes it a lot! Very convenient when travels...</li>
            <li> This has everything you could need, and fits nicely in a purse. I love it.</li>
            <li> Purchased HeadBlade The Groomster Manicure Set for musician son because he is always meeting people; this set was to keep his appearance, especially his hands groomed.</li>
            <li> The case is nice and all the tools work well except the nail clippers. They are poorly made and don&#x27;t cut cleanly.</li>
            <li> I have bought quite a few items on Amazon but this is the first one I&#x27;ve been so impressed with I had to review. The case itself is small (easily fits in the palm of my hand or in the corner of my Dopp kit), has a good zipper (usually the weak point in small, cheap cases) and is made from a durable leather-like material. There are 6 different tools in the case, each with its own leather holder. All the tools have a &#x27;heavy&#x27;, high quality feel to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scissors are short and sharp, with curved, pointed tips. They have large finger holes, which make them comfortable to use. The clipper is strong and sharp enough to cut nails cleanly. The file folds into its handle, and the tip is pointed enough to clean under nails but blunt enough not to hurt. The tweezers are your average, angled tweezers, albeit with the same high-quality feel to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not exactly fancy about my nails (I just keep them clean and very short) and I didn&#x27;t think I would use or like the cuticle tool. Turns out I was wrong. Its easy to use and I actually enjoy the result. Tearing cuticles or trying to clean grease out from under them is annoying and painful. This tool keeps both from happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last tool is an &amp;#34;ear spoon&amp;#34;, like those used in Asia and Viking Age Scandinavia. Q-tips can actually make ear wax issues worse, along with being wasteful. This little tool is the perfect alternative. Just work slowly and don&#x27;t get too close to your eardrum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item from ShaveNow for $16.50. The shipping was fast and the quality of the kit is far higher than the price would lead you to believe. If you&#x27;re looking for a simple but complete, high quality personal grooming kit, I recommend this 100%.</li>
            <li> Love it. Wonderful quality at a great price. What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> High quality hardware, sleek holder, husband LOVES it.</li>
            <li> The scissors were not that sharp.  It&#x27;s not as good and I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great choice for a frequent traveler like myself!  Everything you could need for on-the-go hygiene in a smart little package.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the items is not the best, but they all do the job just fine, and the quality is not terrible.  I&#x27;m picky about tweezers -- these grab just fine but it&#x27;s not as firm a grab as a really high quality tweezer, but I&#x27;ll use these for now and if they stop grabbing well, as I find second rate tweezers often do, I&#x27;ll replace them in the set, but keep the set the way it is.  That&#x27;s sort of a nice thing -- you can replace any of the items (if they&#x27;re the same size) if you want and still have it all packaged nicely.  I like the nifty little scissors, which are as sharp as you can want.  The nail clippers are sort of the same -- they cut just fine, but not as cleanly as a really expensive pair.  But if you&#x27;re not doing a manicure, they do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an amazing deal for the price, which is unbeatable for this combination of items.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband and he loves it. He was a bit confused with the tools for grooming the cuticles, but after a brief explanation about them, he was really happy with the set. The set is very compact and the tools are good quality. He has not used the tools yet because the set was purchased for his travel, but I am sure he will be happy with the function of all pieces in the set.</li>
            <li> Great compact little manicure set. Cannot be beat for the price. Although it&#x27;s a relatively &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; set, it feels anything but. There&#x27;s a quality weight to all the tools and they work great!</li>
            <li> Everything but the nail clippers are  great.  The clippers however are too short to provide proper leverage for tougher things like toe nails.  I would not recommend</li>
            <li> awesome quality and only the essentials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tools all perform how they supposed to; scissors cut, file files, tweetzers pluck, etc.  High quality case; great product!</li>
            <li> Super sleek set. Nice little leather zipper case and all tools are sharp. I will buy this again in the future for my sons. Perfect size to fit easily in a travel bag.</li>
            <li> Very nice set.  My husband keeps it in his travel case because it is compact but still contains everything he needs.</li>
            <li> Was an urgently needed give that came in just in time... With a broken zipper.. Ugh.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that fits on the shelf in the medicine cabinet or in my travel bag. This did the trick nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well designed and the tools are certainly a good value for the dollar - I&#x27;ve seen more expensive kits that had components not this nice. It has a nice compact design, so it doesn&#x27;t take much space on the shelf or in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scissors are quite nice - I have big fingers and still found them comfortable to use. The tweezers were certainly adequate. The nail file was nice. I like the folding blade design and the tip is perfect for cleaning the nails. I&#x27;ve never been one to clean the cuticles, but I might just have to have my wife show me the ropes. I gather the last utensil is to clean your ears - we&#x27;ll see about that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a nice kit, reasonably priced. I expect it will hold up to good use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this set to help get my nails back into shape after years of biting them. I recently managed to stop biting my nails so I actually needed a kit like this. This kit has all of the little tools that i have needed. All of the tools work well. I am not particularly fond of the file though since it tends to be a bit loose. The hangnail tool is very useful and is really helping me to get my nails looking nice again.</li>
            <li> This will be a gift for my grandson.  It seems to be of good quality and I&#x27;m sure he will enjoy it and have many years of usage. A nice case too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 2-star just because I like the idea and concept.&lt;br /&gt;However I think this entire kit is poorly made.&lt;br /&gt;The nail clippers were quite literally the worst I&#x27;ve ever used. It took a lot of effort to get them to clip my nails and it almost felt like the edges of the cutter weren&#x27;t aligned properly.&lt;br /&gt;The scissors should have been secured better so they didn&#x27;t slide around. I would have preferred the pointed end to slide into a stationary, sewn-in sheath.&lt;br /&gt;The case itself seemed cheaply made and I wasn&#x27;t impressed by the quality. It arrived with frayed thread in the stitching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like this! Like I said, it&#x27;s a nice concept to have grooming tools in an easy-carry case, but this seemed thrown together without thought for quality.</li>
            <li> Looked awesome until I opened it. The zipper gets stuck near the end and the tools, LOL, they are like tools your expect to see in a doll house. They are miniature versions of a real size tools.</li>
            <li> Not terrible, but wasn&#x27;t really that great either. In the end you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas. He mentioned how sharp the tools were and how nice the set was. Very pleased that it made him happy :-)</li>
            <li> This was an Xmas gift for my son in Canada so I did not see it myself but I wanted a useful product small enough to carry with good quality tools. He was delighted with it and said it was very good quality. It was also very small and practical to make it possible to carry discretely. This item did meet my expectations. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very nice, though I wish the case had just a little more room in it - things fit very tightly in it. I have some trouble getting the clippers in and out.</li>
