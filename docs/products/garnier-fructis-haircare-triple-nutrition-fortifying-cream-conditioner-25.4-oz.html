            <li>Works great with my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m african-american with relaxed hair and it works beautifully and it smells really good.</li>
            <li>I will repurchase for sure!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light scented conditioner which is really nice.</li>
            <li>Good for the price, wonderful way to get the things you use everyday.</li>
            <li>Feels good, smells good, leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has the mixtures of oil in it.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner, as well as Fall Fight conditioner by Garnier.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The conditioner seemed okay.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner smells awesome even after your hair is dry.</li>
            <li>My hair is silky smooth and doesn&#x27;t have any tangles :-)</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about the conditioner was the overpowering scent that smells kind of like pineapple.</li>
            <li>Like most or all of Garnier conditioners, it has an apple scent, but again, super light scented.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the ends and mid portion of my hair.</li>
            <li>I might have to use it again to be sure that it&#x27;s moisturizing because with the shampoo I could tell a difference right away.</li>
            <li>I really like the shampoo, as that is moisturizing for sure.  </li>
            <li>Although the price is good for the big size of product, you end up using more conditioner than you would a high quality conditioner.</li>
            <li>It is definitely the best quality product you can find outside of a salon.</li>
            <li>I have dry hair from over processing and lots of highlights, dying, etc, so I need a good conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying it and the price has no competition.</li>
            <li>Makes hair smooth and uncredibly soft !!&#x27;</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell good, but it makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Price was right, shipping fast, item arrived undamaged.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>

            <li>Works perfectly no complaints great product.</li>
            <li>This conditioner makes my roots really greasy if I apply it anywhere near my scalp.</li>
            <li>done only when used in large amounts.  </li>
            <li>leave&#x27;s my hair silky soft.</li>
            <li>I feel this condition breakdown my hair and make it feel soft and moisturized from the 1st use.  </li>
            <li>The item pictured and described is the original Triple Nutrition conditioner in the green bottle, which is silicone-free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay scent, but I usually wear natural essential</li>
            <li>I usually use Wen products because they are more natural, but they dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have thick long hair, so I need a decent conditioner to get the tangles out after shampooing and this one works just fine.  </li>
            <li>I have natural, African American hair and truly was surprised how this makes my hair feel....</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Versus other high quality conditioners, I feel like Garnier gets the job</li>

            <li> Great conditioner ! Makes hair smooth and uncredibly soft !!&#x27; Definitely worth trying it and the price has no competition. At drugstore is around $10 this big package.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this purchase and it is a great value. I would highly recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> It makes my dry hair feel soft and silky. It is definitely the best quality product you can find outside of a salon.</li>
            <li> As an African-American woman, I traditionally shop in the ethnic section for hair care items.  Well, I must say, Garnier is now my new go to product! This conditioner smells awesome even after your hair is dry. Leaves your hair oh so silky. I&#x27;m a believer.  Will buy again and again.  I use the conditioner with the matching shampoo from this line; both are great!</li>
            <li> I have never tried this conditioner before, but I must say I will buy it again, leave&#x27;s my hair silky soft. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair, so I need a decent conditioner to get the tangles out after shampooing and this one works just fine.  This company has great hair products and I do recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this conditioner online, but did buy it in the store. It&#x27;s a very light scented conditioner which is really nice. Like most or all of Garnier conditioners, it has an apple scent, but again, super light scented. I love this conditioner, as well as Fall Fight conditioner by Garnier. No complaints on this one.</li>

            <li> The item pictured and described is the original Triple Nutrition conditioner in the green bottle, which is silicone-free. The item shipped is the reformulated version in the yellow bottle, which contains amodimethicone, a silicone. The picture and ingredients are not accurate.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday for my longer hair. Works very well.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing. Smells great</li>
            <li> This is now the only conditioner I use. My hair has never been softer. I&#x27;m asking people to feel my hair all the time and they are always amazed. I&#x27;m a believer to the triple nutrition.</li>
            <li> It seems to work.  I really like the shampoo, as that is moisturizing for sure.  I always try to pair my shampoos and conditioners.  The first thing I noticed about the conditioner was the overpowering scent that smells kind of like pineapple. It&#x27;s an okay scent, but I usually wear natural essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick so I could really tell a difference with the shampoo.  I usually use Wen products because they are more natural, but they dry out my hair.  The conditioner seemed okay.  I might have to use it again to be sure that it&#x27;s moisturizing because with the shampoo I could tell a difference right away.</li>
