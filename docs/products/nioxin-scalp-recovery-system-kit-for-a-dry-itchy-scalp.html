            <li>A drop or 2 works like magic.  </li>
            <li>My scalp has never felt better and my dryness is getting better with each use.</li>
            <li>When it comes to your hair don&#x27;t cut corners -spend the money and buy from reputable dealer.</li>
            <li>Love Nioxin, this product hasn&#x27;t worked for me.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure that helped.</li>
            <li>I love this product line.  </li>
            <li>I give it 2 stars because it smells ok.</li>
            <li>In about 2 to 3 weeks my scalp was healthy again.</li>
            <li>Love it, hope the price was better.</li>
            <li>This size it is perfect to try in you , so if works for you you can buy the bigger one and if not you dont lose a big thing, buy the way, it had been wonderful to my :)</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t sure, just by the conditioner and try it for a month.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products and nothing worked</li>
            <li>but I love this one.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad that I found it.</li>
            <li>Really love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the product i received was authentic or not.</li>
            <li>and I like nioxin better.</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>My husband asked if the concept was a scalp peel :)  </li>
            <li>I wanted to give the Nioxin one more try before giving up.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner makes your hair SO soft and smooth, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>It seems to work better that the alternative dandruff shampoos that we tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sold on it and will be buying more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while, and I&#x27;m glad I was able to purchase online</li>
            <li>She recommended this shampoo and conditioner and I am so glad she did ...</li>
            <li>Besides the hair looks shiny but not greasy and healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hopeful that continued use could reduce the itch even more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see her scratch any more like before or flakes on her clothes.</li>
            <li>Much better than just using tea tree shampoo from Paul Mitchell.</li>
            <li>Look up product diversion for more info.</li>
            <li>It smells great and is sulphate free and gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li>The product is not as strong as you would get in the salon.</li>
            <li>After only 1 shampoo , my scalp look amazing and along the way my hair is looking more and more better</li>
            <li>leave in treatment is fine.</li>
            <li>Conditioner is fine, but I do not need it every wash.  </li>
            <li>Excellent results in just a few days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m itch free.  </li>
            <li>This has helped reduce the flakes significantly as well as the itch.</li>
            <li>But this system keeps my head clean all week.</li>
            <li>Great product for dry, itchy, flaky, dandruff type scalp.</li>
            <li>I thought it would have that cool minty feel and smell</li>
            <li>It smells nice, leaves your hair soft and easier to manage and has a cooling menthol feeling as you&#x27;re washing your hair which I like.</li>
            <li>It really made my scalp healthy.</li>
            <li>This right here has had me dandruff free, scalp is not read or flaky anymore.</li>
            <li>I use the shampoo only on my scalp and make sure to rub it in generously, and then use the conditioner all over but more towards my ends.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>Best sleep I&#x27;ve had in years too, not waking up scratching my scalp and feeling icky!</li>
            <li>No more itching, crusties or flakes at all , like magic - and my hair feels light and clean and easy to comb and brush, not gummy!</li>
            <li>Intense itching and gazillions of crusties, not just light, flaky dandruff.</li>
            <li>The serum alone was worth the price.</li>
            <li>This product is worth the money and has helped increase my self confidence.</li>
            <li>Hands down amazing!</li>
            <li>It works very well, for me, I&#x27;ve tried several methods and techniques to recover my scalp, I suffered for long time and it is the best product I&#x27;ve ever found...</li>
            <li>but wow wow it makes ur scalp tingle and feel sooo amazing while ur working it in, it mositures without leaving it greasy.</li>
            <li>My scalp was really itchy, like super itchy</li>
            <li>The shampoo/conditioner tends to be drying for me and would be okay too use occasionally.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well, and it worked for a while.</li>
            <li>It did exactly what it was supposed</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and now i&#x27;m back to my salon shampoo! :)</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I had an eczema break out on my forehead but after that one time it never happened again.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says: Soothes the redness, flaking, and moisturizes the flakes away.  </li>
            <li>I think the nioxin works so much better because of the extra leave in scalp treatment.</li>
            <li>By the fourth day (two applications) I had more flakes than EVER</li>
            <li>but it does a good job for a few days.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I really liked the clean, cooling feeling but felt that it left my hair a bit dry.  </li>
            <li>I had tried pretty much everything.</li>
            <li>As dry scalp is my issue, the serum is great for my dry scalp.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very dry, so not sure this is the best answer.  </li>
            <li>My hair is short, fine, thinning.  </li>
            <li>Head n shoulders worked for regular dandruff when I was younger, Selsun Blue was ok, I even tried a prescribed French medicine (stocked up bottles on my trip in France and used it successfully for 2 years before it stopped working).  </li>
            <li>I have color-treated and fine hair and have been fighting dandruff for years, especially after a coloring.</li>
            <li>This product made a huge difference in my daily life.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my psoriasis and it really helps.  </li>
            <li>I started getting so much dandruff out of no</li>
            <li>And lets talk about the conditioner the directions say apply on scalp which is unusual</li>
            <li>It is nothing like the store bought treatments which haven&#x27;t done much for us.</li>
            <li>This product works very well for me.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t really used a conditioner before</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>All the bacteria has died thanks to this</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner was very runny compared to the system 2 kit I have used.</li>
            <li>The recovery serum really does help.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But the real knockout is the soothing serum.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and I buy just the shampoo much of the time, as they other is not always needed, but great to have for the first knock down.</li>
            <li>I went back to my original products for two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Tried so many products for dry scalp - from organic all natural to drugstore</li>
            <li>I have a pretty sensitive scalp</li>
            <li>The bottles were only 3/4 full.</li>
            <li>This is so effective for me that I can go 2 or 3 days without showering (when I&#x27;m lazy) without having dandruff or an itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li>I have sebhorric dermatitis, I wanted to love this product, it cut down the flakes, but they are still there.</li>
            <li>I also applied the cream to some particularly dryer spots up towards my forehead/part.</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin!!</li>
            <li>Good news is a little goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li>I only use it twice a week because my other shampoo/conditioner leave my hair more managable.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Use daily for first week and by week 2 you are clear.  </li>
            <li>The Nioxin Recovery System Kit is an okay shampoo and conditioner, but they are not really helping my itchy, dry scalp at all.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better that any other dandruff treatment (and I&#x27;ve use almost every single one).</li>
            <li>My mammaw recently was diagnosed with lupus and started losing her hair; her scalp was very itchy.  </li>
            <li>This has completely eliminated all itching and flaking.</li>
            <li>Took about two weeks to completely work.</li>
            <li>Really all I had to do was to buy a different shampoo</li>
            <li>I recently developed a severe case of dermatitis in my scalp and started using the scalp recovery kit.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>skin condition has improved considerably and I plan to continue using the shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>My scalp was getting really flaky and was starting to turn to eczema with hair coming out!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried nioxin and zinplex so far</li>
            <li>(I only used it every 2nd or 3rd day), my scalp cleared and is nearly itch free.</li>
            <li>My scalp stopped itching completely.  </li>
            <li>I use it at least once a month to make sure I don&#x27;t have a reoccurrence.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also leaving my scalp pretty dry within a couple hours of washing my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product that has ever worked for me and it even smells decent.</li>
            <li>I still have almost full bottles but bought this set on sale because I don&#x27;t want to even risk running out of this little miracle product....</li>
            <li>Normally if I don&#x27;t shower every day I&#x27;d get itchy scalp the following day.  </li>
            <li>but nothing major.</li>
            <li>I greased my scalp, hot treatments and other treatments that did not work.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product last summer because my scalp had become so dry and flaky from the sun and dry air.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t any  better than head and shoulders or any other  brand,has the same amount of active ingredients.  </li>
            <li>But buy a decent conditioner because the Nizoral will dry your hair out.</li>
            <li>I have tried a number of different products ranging from otc to rx with pretty minimal results.</li>
            <li>high end dandruff shampoo, it wont dry or damage color treated hair.</li>
            <li>My problem was dry ITCY scalp and it only got worse, better when I started to use coconut oil very nite n shampooed in a.m.</li>
            <li>but it was never dry</li>
            <li>and I have noticed complete itch relief, although still minor flaks.</li>
            <li>I first started using Scalp Recovery last year after going through several other products over the years that only worked for a short time.  </li>
            <li>Not sure was right choice for problem.</li>
            <li>We have tried several shampoos for dandruff and it only works the first few washes.</li>
            <li>I am a person of color and have experienced dry and itchy scalp so bad the flakes were everywhere.</li>

            <li> Much better than just using tea tree shampoo from Paul Mitchell.</li>
            <li> Look up product diversion for more info.</li>
            <li> It smells great and is sulphate free and gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li> The product is not as strong as you would get in the salon.</li>
            <li> After only 1 shampoo , my scalp look amazing and along the way my hair is looking more and more better</li>
            <li> leave in treatment is fine.</li>
            <li> Conditioner is fine, but I do not need it every wash.  </li>
            <li> Excellent results in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m itch free.  </li>
            <li> This has helped reduce the flakes significantly as well as the itch.</li>
            <li> But this system keeps my head clean all week.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry, itchy, flaky, dandruff type scalp.</li>
            <li> I thought it would have that cool minty feel and smell</li>
            <li> It smells nice, leaves your hair soft and easier to manage and has a cooling menthol feeling as you&#x27;re washing your hair which I like.</li>
            <li> It really made my scalp healthy.</li>
            <li> This right here has had me dandruff free, scalp is not read or flaky anymore.</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo only on my scalp and make sure to rub it in generously, and then use the conditioner all over but more towards my ends.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Best sleep I&#x27;ve had in years too, not waking up scratching my scalp and feeling icky!</li>
            <li> No more itching, crusties or flakes at all , like magic - and my hair feels light and clean and easy to comb and brush, not gummy!</li>
            <li> Intense itching and gazillions of crusties, not just light, flaky dandruff.</li>
            <li> The serum alone was worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the money and has helped increase my self confidence.</li>
            <li> Hands down amazing!</li>
            <li> It works very well, for me, I&#x27;ve tried several methods and techniques to recover my scalp, I suffered for long time and it is the best product I&#x27;ve ever found...</li>
            <li> but wow wow it makes ur scalp tingle and feel sooo amazing while ur working it in, it mositures without leaving it greasy.</li>
            <li> My scalp was really itchy, like super itchy</li>
            <li> The shampoo/conditioner tends to be drying for me and would be okay too use occasionally.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well, and it worked for a while.</li>
            <li> It did exactly what it was supposed</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and now i&#x27;m back to my salon shampoo! :)</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I had an eczema break out on my forehead but after that one time it never happened again.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says: Soothes the redness, flaking, and moisturizes the flakes away.  </li>
            <li> I think the nioxin works so much better because of the extra leave in scalp treatment.</li>
            <li> By the fourth day (two applications) I had more flakes than EVER</li>
            <li> but it does a good job for a few days.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I really liked the clean, cooling feeling but felt that it left my hair a bit dry.  </li>
            <li> I had tried pretty much everything.</li>
            <li> As dry scalp is my issue, the serum is great for my dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very dry, so not sure this is the best answer.  </li>
            <li> My hair is short, fine, thinning.  </li>
            <li> Head n shoulders worked for regular dandruff when I was younger, Selsun Blue was ok, I even tried a prescribed French medicine (stocked up bottles on my trip in France and used it successfully for 2 years before it stopped working).  </li>
            <li> I have color-treated and fine hair and have been fighting dandruff for years, especially after a coloring.</li>
            <li> This product made a huge difference in my daily life.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my psoriasis and it really helps.  </li>
            <li> I started getting so much dandruff out of no</li>
            <li> And lets talk about the conditioner the directions say apply on scalp which is unusual</li>
            <li> It is nothing like the store bought treatments which haven&#x27;t done much for us.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t really used a conditioner before</li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> All the bacteria has died thanks to this</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner was very runny compared to the system 2 kit I have used.</li>
            <li> The recovery serum really does help.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But the real knockout is the soothing serum.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> and I buy just the shampoo much of the time, as they other is not always needed, but great to have for the first knock down.</li>
            <li> I went back to my original products for two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Tried so many products for dry scalp - from organic all natural to drugstore</li>
            <li> I have a pretty sensitive scalp</li>
            <li> The bottles were only 3/4 full.</li>
            <li> This is so effective for me that I can go 2 or 3 days without showering (when I&#x27;m lazy) without having dandruff or an itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have sebhorric dermatitis, I wanted to love this product, it cut down the flakes, but they are still there.</li>
            <li> I also applied the cream to some particularly dryer spots up towards my forehead/part.</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin!!</li>
            <li> Good news is a little goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> I only use it twice a week because my other shampoo/conditioner leave my hair more managable.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> Use daily for first week and by week 2 you are clear.  </li>
            <li> The Nioxin Recovery System Kit is an okay shampoo and conditioner, but they are not really helping my itchy, dry scalp at all.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better that any other dandruff treatment (and I&#x27;ve use almost every single one).</li>
            <li> My mammaw recently was diagnosed with lupus and started losing her hair; her scalp was very itchy.  </li>
            <li> This has completely eliminated all itching and flaking.</li>
            <li> Took about two weeks to completely work.</li>
            <li> Really all I had to do was to buy a different shampoo</li>
            <li> I recently developed a severe case of dermatitis in my scalp and started using the scalp recovery kit.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> skin condition has improved considerably and I plan to continue using the shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> My scalp was getting really flaky and was starting to turn to eczema with hair coming out!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nioxin and zinplex so far</li>
            <li> (I only used it every 2nd or 3rd day), my scalp cleared and is nearly itch free.</li>
            <li> My scalp stopped itching completely.  </li>
            <li> I use it at least once a month to make sure I don&#x27;t have a reoccurrence.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also leaving my scalp pretty dry within a couple hours of washing my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product that has ever worked for me and it even smells decent.</li>
            <li> I still have almost full bottles but bought this set on sale because I don&#x27;t want to even risk running out of this little miracle product....</li>
            <li> Normally if I don&#x27;t shower every day I&#x27;d get itchy scalp the following day.  </li>
            <li> but nothing major.</li>
            <li> I greased my scalp, hot treatments and other treatments that did not work.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product last summer because my scalp had become so dry and flaky from the sun and dry air.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t any  better than head and shoulders or any other  brand,has the same amount of active ingredients.  </li>
            <li> But buy a decent conditioner because the Nizoral will dry your hair out.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of different products ranging from otc to rx with pretty minimal results.</li>
            <li> high end dandruff shampoo, it wont dry or damage color treated hair.</li>
            <li> My problem was dry ITCY scalp and it only got worse, better when I started to use coconut oil very nite n shampooed in a.m.</li>
            <li> but it was never dry</li>
            <li> and I have noticed complete itch relief, although still minor flaks.</li>
            <li> I first started using Scalp Recovery last year after going through several other products over the years that only worked for a short time.  </li>
            <li> Not sure was right choice for problem.</li>
            <li> We have tried several shampoos for dandruff and it only works the first few washes.</li>
            <li> I am a person of color and have experienced dry and itchy scalp so bad the flakes were everywhere.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but it works for my dandruff (which can be embarrassingly bad at times).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can feel the quality in the shampoo and conditioner: thicker and richer than regular store bought formulas with a pleasant clean</li>
            <li> I tried several more expensive salon formulations that were better for the texture of my hair but did little to relieve the dandruff and itch.it got so bad after being indoors this winter that I would bend over the toilet and give my head a hard brushing to relieve the itch and brush out most of the crusts and flakes before I got dressed to go anywhere.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit of shampoo goes a long way</li>
            <li> Immediate help for itchy and dry and red scalp.</li>
            <li> The shampoo does help reduce my dry flakes and the itching, but only if it&#x27;s used every day.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised because it has the same active ingredient that I&#x27;ve used in other shampoos (pyrithione zinc).  </li>
            <li> I had a problem with my hair for long time.</li>
            <li> This product did not come with any instructions which is a big minus.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to run out of the recovery serum long before the shampoo and conditioner are gone.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with dry scalp, almost looked like cradle cap but was not, tried 2 other scalp treatments with no success,  used Nioxin for 7 days and scalp was completely clear.  </li>
            <li> Drugstore buys like Head and Shoulders and Selsun Blue helped the dandruff a little but left my hair feeling gummy and tangled.</li>
            <li> The product is meant to treat extremely dry scalp yet no instructions were printed on the bottles or box and there were no instructions included.  </li>
            <li> I needed help for my dry itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> This is applied to your dry hair/scalp.  </li>
            <li> Nioxin was suggested by my doctor for dry scalp flakes.  </li>
            <li> so thought I would try this for my itchy flaky dry scalp.</li>
            <li> My daughter has itchy, dry scalp and gets flakes.</li>
            <li> I tried head and shoulders and it did not work even though it contains the same active ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad dandruff pretty much since my teens (I&#x27;m now 28).  </li>
            <li> and it made my scalp dry and itchy!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair everyday and constantly have flakes.</li>
            <li> It helps for a little bit, but the itch always comes back soon</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like other dandruff shampoos so that is why I gave it a couple stars.</li>
            <li> After several consecutive uses of this Nioxin my scalp no longer itches, flakes are gone, and I have no more pockets of dry scaly scalp prone to bleeding.  </li>
            <li> and it seems, like with other products I&#x27;ve used, my scalp has gotten used to it.</li>
            <li> it works but think you need to use other meds also</li>
            <li> I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> SO, if head and shoulders doesn&#x27;t work for you, this will not either.&lt;br /&gt;The two other components to this kit are the leave in treatment and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have been able to go 2 days before I&#x27;m going crazy again!  </li>
            <li> Over this winter time, my scalp got EXTREMELY itchy, and I&#x27;d be scratching layers of dandruff off.  </li>
            <li> I hope my scalp never gets immune to it like it did with the other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to bust out the big guns though and buy Nizoral when my dandruff suddenly got worse.</li>
            <li> The conditioner especially seems to help moisturize the scalp which is hard to find in a product.</li>
            <li> The formula was slightly off and the labels that were pasted on the bottles were a little off center and bled ink.</li>
            <li> One day I just looked in the mirror and realized that there was no more flakiness or dry skin.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I&#x27;ll have to move to something else and possibly return to this later.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this if you&#x27;ve struggled to figure out what was wrong.</li>
            <li> my hairdresser exclaimed over my scalp, it was an oozing, crusty mess.</li>
            <li> actually makes my scalp worse.</li>
            <li> I have been rinsing with apple cider vinegar for a few years now, having given up on every brand you can buy at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I can dab and massage a few drops of this onto my scalp trouble spots.  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d have to wait a few days or even a week to notice results, but it worked after one use.  </li>
            <li> and I had to apply leave-in conditioner to my dried out hair.  </li>
            <li> I used the shampoo/conditioner every couple days or whenever I wanted to wash my hair (which I don&#x27;t do everyday).</li>
            <li> Using these products over the past few months has reduced my discomfort by 90%.  </li>
            <li> Any &amp;#34;salon only&amp;#34; brand sold outside of the salon is usually extremely old or fake (think a knock of purse fake).</li>
            <li> If you have bad dandruff it is at least worth a try.</li>
            <li> If you have really bad dandruff or a really itchy scalp - go with the Nizoral over this.</li>
            <li> No more itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> and I have used it for the past couple of years.</li>
            <li> Improved my scalp 100%, no more itching or flaking or crusty build up!  </li>
            <li> Tiny bottle is a miracle cure when bad flare up happens.  </li>
            <li> but not long term relief which I am looking for  :(</li>
            <li> Sorry if that&#x27;s gross or TMI but anyone who suffers with this understands.</li>
            <li> nothing helped i even tired the T-gel shampoo which smelled lioe gasoline.</li>
            <li> After 3 days of using the three-step system, my scalp dryness became much worse.</li>
            <li> The ACV works well, but not great.</li>
            <li> It was too thin of a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Yes, it all is expensive but it works beyond hope.  </li>
            <li> I was having such problems with redness and horrible itchiness in my scalp</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it hasn&#x27;t helped and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I suffer from Seborrheic Dermatitis.  </li>
            <li> These fake products are often diluted or not even the advertised product at all and can contain lots of bacteria!</li>
            <li> that adds to my bad scalp.</li>
            <li> and I had really bad dandruff.</li>
            <li> The itching was driving me crazy!  </li>
            <li> It dired the crap out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Very expensive!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this for my psoriasis and it really helps.  The conditioner especially seems to help moisturize the scalp which is hard to find in a product.</li>
            <li> My scalp was very itchiy , after using this product, it feels great.</li>
            <li> My mammaw recently was diagnosed with lupus and started losing her hair; her scalp was very itchy.  I bought her this, and her hair is growing back!  No more itchy scalp.  This stuff is awesome</li>
            <li> I have seen dermatologists &amp; tried everything they recommended including prescription &amp; OTC. A high-end hair salon owner who has the same scalp problems showed me these products. I couldn&#x27;t afford her prices so I went home &amp; ordered online. These are by far the best results I have ever had!!!!!  This is the best find of ALL!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works amazing! I started getting so much dandruff out of no were and nothing helped i even tired the T-gel shampoo which smelled lioe gasoline. It dired the crap out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This is amazing  high end dandruff shampoo, it wont dry or damage color treated hair. And lets talk about the conditioner the directions say apply on scalp which is unusual but wow wow it makes ur scalp tingle and feel sooo amazing while ur working it in, it mositures without leaving it greasy. Hands down amazing!</li>
            <li> The product is not as strong as you would get in the salon. I don&#x27;t know why but for reason the stuff they use on me at the salon is much better.</li>
            <li> After 3 days of using the three-step system, my scalp dryness became much worse. I discontinued use and used T-Sal instead which worked wonders.</li>
            <li> The Nioxin Recovery System Kit is an okay shampoo and conditioner, but they are not really helping my itchy, dry scalp at all. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now, 4 times a week, and my scalp is still itchy and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leave in treatment is fine. It helps for a little bit, but the itch always comes back soon after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone had mentioned that there were no directions, but the back of the bottles each had directions on them, you just have to peel back the second label for them.</li>
            <li> Nioxin Scalp Recovery does just that! Immediate help for itchy and dry and red scalp. Use daily for first week and by week 2 you are clear.  Conditioner is fine, but I do not need it every wash.  Tiny bottle is a miracle cure when bad flare up happens.  A drop or 2 works like magic.  Yes, it all is expensive but it works beyond hope.  A tiny bit of shampoo goes a long way and I buy just the shampoo much of the time, as they other is not always needed, but great to have for the first knock down.</li>
            <li> actually makes my scalp worse.</li>
            <li> I have been rinsing with apple cider vinegar for a few years now, having given up on every brand you can buy at the drugstore. The ACV works well, but not great. This has completely eliminated all itching and flaking. I find that when traveling it&#x27;s enough to just use the treatment step so I don&#x27;t have to pack it all.</li>
            <li> I find it works excellent for dandruff.  It is nothing like the store bought treatments which haven&#x27;t done much for us.</li>
            <li> it seems to be getting my problem under control. I still have dermsitis but not as cakey</li>
            <li> This stuff works! The serum alone was worth the price.</li>
            <li> As dry scalp is my issue, the serum is great for my dry scalp.  The shampoo/conditioner tends to be drying for me and would be okay too use occasionally. The reason I am only giving 4 stars is product is not for my type of hair.</li>
            <li> It does not work as good for me, but smells good</li>
            <li> Tried so many products for dry scalp - from organic all natural to drugstore but this is the only one that worked! Took about two weeks to completely work.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin. I blow dry my hair everyday and constantly have flakes. I started using this and the flakes have gone away. I only use it twice a week because my other shampoo/conditioner leave my hair more managable.</li>
            <li> excellent product, shipping timely.</li>
            <li> The only product that I have found to control my seborrehic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> Great products and they get the job done!! My scalp has never felt better and my dryness is getting better with each use.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well, and it worked for a while. It smells great and is sulphate free and gentle on my hair. I had to bust out the big guns though and buy Nizoral when my dandruff suddenly got worse. If you have really bad dandruff or a really itchy scalp - go with the Nizoral over this. But buy a decent conditioner because the Nizoral will dry your hair out.</li>
            <li> I will never buy online shampoo ever again. The formula was slightly off and the labels that were pasted on the bottles were a little off center and bled ink. When it comes to your hair don&#x27;t cut corners -spend the money and buy from reputable dealer.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for me. I am an African American woman and I dye my hair a lot so that adds to my bad scalp. But this system keeps my head clean all week. I wash my hair once a week.</li>
            <li> Love Nioxin, this product hasn&#x27;t worked for me.  It smells nice, lathers up nicely. I really wanted to like it but I&#x27;ve had no relief from my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Totally got rid of my flaky scalp! The shampoo lathered up well and no medicine smell. Now I use it once a week to maintain flake-free hair.</li>
            <li> This product made a huge difference in my daily life.  I have tried a number of different products ranging from otc to rx with pretty minimal results. After several consecutive uses of this Nioxin my scalp no longer itches, flakes are gone, and I have no more pockets of dry scaly scalp prone to bleeding.  At this point it is only necessary to use the system every 3 or so washes.  This product is worth the money and has helped increase my self confidence.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair product!!! It did exactly what it was supposed to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!!! Works great and feels amazing! :)</li>
            <li> Nioxin Scalp Recovery System is excellent for both my husband and myself.  I had an issue with dry scalp, almost looked like cradle cap but was not, tried 2 other scalp treatments with no success,  used Nioxin for 7 days and scalp was completely clear.  My husband started using it while I was and now he uses it also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad dandruff pretty much since my teens (I&#x27;m now 28).  I first started using Scalp Recovery last year after going through several other products over the years that only worked for a short time.  I purchased this locally from Ulta, not Amazon. I began using it every 2 days and my dandruff literally vanished after a week.  I thought I&#x27;d finally found the miracle cure to this ongoing problem.  I was a bit surprised because it has the same active ingredient that I&#x27;ve used in other shampoos (pyrithione zinc).  I hadn&#x27;t really used a conditioner before so I&#x27;m sure that helped. Dandruff would come back periodically but continued use over the next several months kept it under control.  One thing I learned in that time was to pay attention to the expiration date on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward a year later and it seems, like with other products I&#x27;ve used, my scalp has gotten used to it. Scalp Recovery lasted alot longer than others.  It&#x27;s still excellent at cleansing the scalp but the dandruff isn&#x27;t going away anymore.  It&#x27;s also leaving my scalp pretty dry within a couple hours of washing my hair.  It was an excellent product while it was working but unfortunately I&#x27;ll have to move to something else and possibly return to this later.</li>
            <li> This is great treatment for your scalp. I had a problem with my hair for long time. I used Nioxin shampoo and after one time it help me.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended</li>
            <li> I love this product line.  I was having such problems with redness and horrible itchiness in my scalp but this takes care of it 99% of the time!</li>
            <li> My scalp was really itchy, like super itchy but it was never dry and I had a bit of flakes here and there but nothing major. I decided to give this thing a try but it didn&#x27;t work. My head was still itchy. I was using pantene before this product thinking I had a scalp problem so I bought this nioxin product but it was the same issue. Really all I had to do was to buy a different shampoo and that&#x27;s it. My head is not itchy anymore. I give it 2 stars because it smells ok.</li>
            <li> Improved my scalp 100%, no more itching or flaking or crusty build up!  This is the best product ever! Thanks!</li>
            <li> it works but think you need to use other meds also</li>
            <li> I recently developed a severe case of dermatitis in my scalp and started using the scalp recovery kit.&lt;br /&gt;My skin condition has improved considerably and I plan to continue using the shampoo and conditioner&lt;br /&gt;along with the soothing serum that came with it. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> The system is great! The shampoo and conditioner work well together and the spot/leave-in treatment is excellent!!</li>
            <li> My problem was dry ITCY scalp and it only got worse, better when I started to use coconut oil very nite n shampooed in a.m.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t any  better than head and shoulders or any other  brand,has the same amount of active ingredients.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am a person of color and have experienced dry and itchy scalp so bad the flakes were everywhere. It didn&#x27;t matter what shampoo and conditioner I used it continued. I greased my scalp, hot treatments and other treatments that did not work. I came across this and decided to give it a try. In about 2 to 3 weeks my scalp was healthy again. I have been using this for 3 months now and I have not had to grease my scalp at all. The only thing I do when it come to oil in my hair is use oil sheen and that&#x27;s it. I will always use this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for psoriasis and seb dermatitis. You can tell a difference after ONE use.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry, itchy, flaky, dandruff type scalp. I use it every other day. I thought it would have that cool minty feel and smell but it doesnt. No tingles either but I believe it works so I gave it the 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> Fast service. Great price!  Will use again</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my dauther after she had tried everything from Walmart; and this worked great!  After 3 uses, the itchy stopped.  Love it, hope the price was better.</li>
            <li> This size it is perfect to try in you , so if works for you you can buy the bigger one and if not you dont lose a big thing, buy the way, it had been wonderful to my :)</li>
            <li> Very good scalp system. I have been using this product 3 times a week for 3 weeks and I have noticed complete itch relief, although still minor flaks. I will continue to use thesearch products!</li>
            <li> I have a pretty sensitive scalp so I always use salon quality shampoo but I had run out and got some cvs cheaper brand and it made my scalp dry and itchy! My scalp was getting really flaky and was starting to turn to eczema with hair coming out!!, one treatment of this cured it! and now i&#x27;m back to my salon shampoo! :)</li>
            <li> Excellent results in just a few days.</li>
            <li> It did not work for me. Still have to deal with itchy scalp and dandruff.</li>
            <li> The only thing that has worked for me. I&#x27;ve used Tar, the brown creamy hair shampoo the doctor prescribed for me and nothing worked for me. This right here has had me dandruff free, scalp is not read or flaky anymore. All the bacteria has died thanks to this</li>
            <li> I have sebhoreic dermaititus and this is the only shampoo system that keeps it under control.  I can find good pricing and delivery options.</li>
            <li> Helps but did not solve problem.  Still have itchy scalp.  Not sure was right choice for problem.</li>
            <li> Works for me. If you aren&#x27;t sure, just by the conditioner and try it for a month.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products and nothing worked but I love this one.</li>
            <li> The shampoo in this kit has the same ingredients as head and shoulders (1% pyrithicone zinc). SO, if head and shoulders doesn&#x27;t work for you, this will not either.&lt;br /&gt;The two other components to this kit are the leave in treatment and conditioner. The leave in treatment has 0.1% of pyrithicone zinc and the conditioner has 0.5% of the same ingredient (don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;d need an ingredient for dandruff relief in something you apply to the ends of your hair...).&lt;br /&gt;Will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> It helps, but has not cleared up the problems I have with my scalp. Resorting to a dermatologist and a biopsy.</li>
            <li> Works better than I anticipated! I no longer need to go to the dermatologist to obtain a prescription for Clobex! This works awesome and I&#x27;m so glad that I found it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year. Really love it. I&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing has worked for me except this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product, for me it&#x27;s better that any other dandruff treatment (and I&#x27;ve use almost every single one). I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have sebhorric dermatitis, I wanted to love this product, it cut down the flakes, but they are still there. Save your money and just buy scalpirin (sp?) at the drugstore it is the third bottle in this system which has hydrocortisone in it and use put it on your scalp after shower.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look beautiful.</li>
            <li> This product did not come with any instructions which is a big minus.  The product is meant to treat extremely dry scalp yet no instructions were printed on the bottles or box and there were no instructions included.  You can&#x27;t expect optimum results if the products does not include detailed instructions when the product is a 3 step process.</li>
            <li> The bottles were only 3/4 full. The treatment was not as I ecpected it to be. The shampoo and conditioner was very runny compared to the system 2 kit I have used. The system 2 conditioner gave a tingling sensation but this conditioner just sat there on my scalp. It was too thin of a conditioner. I don&#x27;t know if the product i received was authentic or not. I am going to purchase it on ebay and see how it turns out. Mind you on ebay the kit is being sold for almost $60+ dollars. This was only $25.00.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo for seborrheic dermatitis. The first time I used it I had an eczema break out on my forehead but after that one time it never happened again. It doesn&#x27;t make the itching, flaking, tenderness and crawly feeling (that comes with scalp eczema) go away permanently but it does a good job for a few days. It smells nice, leaves your hair soft and easier to manage and has a cooling menthol feeling as you&#x27;re washing your hair which I like. I&#x27;ve tried nioxin and zinplex so far and I like nioxin better. I would say stay away from zinplex.</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied. I suffered with itchy scalp and open wounds for over 10 years. I had tried pretty much everything. Within 10 days of using this (I only used it every 2nd or 3rd day), my scalp cleared and is nearly itch free. Once is a blue moon I&#x27;ll have an itchy spot, but if I use the serum it goes away immediately. Highly recommend this if you&#x27;ve struggled to figure out what was wrong. Yes, I had seen about three doctors over the years with no luck.</li>
            <li> I needed help for my dry itchy scalp.  The itching was driving me crazy!  The shampoo does help reduce my dry flakes and the itching, but only if it&#x27;s used every day.  I have been able to go 2 days before I&#x27;m going crazy again!  My hair is very dry, so not sure this is the best answer.  The recovery serum really does help.  My hair is short, fine, thinning.  I&#x27;m going to run out of the recovery serum long before the shampoo and conditioner are gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used this product for my eczema. Works very well.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but it works for my dandruff (which can be embarrassingly bad at times).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can feel the quality in the shampoo and conditioner: thicker and richer than regular store bought formulas with a pleasant clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real knockout is the soothing serum.  This is applied to your dry hair/scalp.  When my dandruff has acted up and I notice I&#x27;m flaking out I can dab and massage a few drops of this onto my scalp trouble spots.  It does exactly what it says: Soothes the redness, flaking, and moisturizes the flakes away.  I feel instant relief from the itching and the flakes are gone.  Sorry if that&#x27;s gross or TMI but anyone who suffers with this understands.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Dandruff was gone after 3 uses.  I tried head and shoulders and it did not work even though it contains the same active ingredient.  I think the nioxin works so much better because of the extra leave in scalp treatment.</li>
            <li> I guess everyone is different and everyone has different skin types, but I have basically tried everything for my seborrheic dermatitis.  Head n shoulders worked for regular dandruff when I was younger, Selsun Blue was ok, I even tried a prescribed French medicine (stocked up bottles on my trip in France and used it successfully for 2 years before it stopped working).  Over this winter time, my scalp got EXTREMELY itchy, and I&#x27;d be scratching layers of dandruff off.  The French medicine stopped working, and I didn&#x27;t know what to do, so I decided to give this a go.  WOW!  I thought I&#x27;d have to wait a few days or even a week to notice results, but it worked after one use.  My scalp stopped itching completely.  Normally if I don&#x27;t shower every day I&#x27;d get itchy scalp the following day.  Not with this.  This is so effective for me that I can go 2 or 3 days without showering (when I&#x27;m lazy) without having dandruff or an itchy scalp.  I&#x27;m itch free.  I&#x27;m only using the shampoo and conditioner; I haven&#x27;t even used the treatment because I haven&#x27;t needed to use it yet.  Very effective product.  I hope my scalp never gets immune to it like it did with the other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The picture is misleading. The item shipped is only a 3 piece set, not the 7 pieces pictured. Its a good product but it should be properly advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is picture of the correct item sent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Nioxin-Scalp-Recovery-Kit-Conditioner/dp/B005OUU5YW/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_bt_6</li>
            <li> Finally! This is the only product that has ever worked for me and it even smells decent. I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Nioxin was suggested by my doctor for dry scalp flakes.  The first time I used it I really liked the clean, cooling feeling but felt that it left my hair a bit dry.  I waited a couple of days and tried again.  By the fourth day (two applications) I had more flakes than EVER and I had to apply leave-in conditioner to my dried out hair.  My husband asked if the concept was a scalp peel :)  I went back to my original products for two weeks.  I wanted to give the Nioxin one more try before giving up.  This time it actually caused flakes &amp; SCABS.  I have never had issues with any shampoo, conditioner (dandruff or otherwise).  BEWARE if you have sensitive skin!!</li>
            <li> Did not help my scalp issues. I like Nioxin shampoo and scalp therapy for thinning hair so thought I would try this for my itchy flaky dry scalp. Unfortunately it hasn&#x27;t helped and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like other dandruff shampoos so that is why I gave it a couple stars. The leave in scalp treatment feels good going on and soothes my scalp temporarily but not long term relief which I am looking for  :(</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product last summer because my scalp had become so dry and flaky from the sun and dry air. I used the shampoo/conditioner every couple days or whenever I wanted to wash my hair (which I don&#x27;t do everyday). I also applied the cream to some particularly dryer spots up towards my forehead/part. I use the shampoo only on my scalp and make sure to rub it in generously, and then use the conditioner all over but more towards my ends. The conditioner makes your hair SO soft and smooth, it&#x27;s great! One day I just looked in the mirror and realized that there was no more flakiness or dry skin. This product works miracles!</li>
            <li> This has been helpful for my daughter&#x27;s persistent dandruff.  We bought it on the recommendation of her pediatrician.  It seems to work better that the alternative dandruff shampoos that we tried.</li>
            <li> Of course you need to follow the directions.  If you don&#x27;t, you wont notice the difference in your scalp.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> After only 1 shampoo , my scalp look amazing and along the way my hair is looking more and more better</li>
            <li> Very expensive!!! But it does work for itchy scalp. i have no problems since using it. Good news is a little goes a long way with this product. It helps I have very short hair. I&#x27;m sold on it and will be buying more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while, and I&#x27;m glad I was able to purchase online, I recommend it, it does work</li>
            <li> My dandruff is non-existent since I started using this product and I had really bad dandruff. It really made my scalp healthy. I use it at least once a month to make sure I don&#x27;t have a reoccurrence. If you have bad dandruff it is at least worth a try.</li>
            <li> I used this with the treatment and I&#x27;m so happy that the flakes are all gone.  I only use it once the a while now just to keep them from coming back.</li>
            <li> I have color-treated and fine hair and have been fighting dandruff for years, especially after a coloring. Drugstore buys like Head and Shoulders and Selsun Blue helped the dandruff a little but left my hair feeling gummy and tangled. I tried several more expensive salon formulations that were better for the texture of my hair but did little to relieve the dandruff and itch.it got so bad after being indoors this winter that I would bend over the toilet and give my head a hard brushing to relieve the itch and brush out most of the crusts and flakes before I got dressed to go anywhere. And I would even wake up &#x27;picking crust&#x27; off my scalp with my nails. Intense itching and gazillions of crusties, not just light, flaky dandruff. The last time I was at the salon my hairdresser exclaimed over my scalp, it was an oozing, crusty mess. She recommended this shampoo and conditioner and I am so glad she did ...ONE washing and conditioning was all it took! No more itching, crusties or flakes at all , like magic - and my hair feels light and clean and easy to comb and brush, not gummy! I still have almost full bottles but bought this set on sale because I don&#x27;t want to even risk running out of this little miracle product....Best sleep I&#x27;ve had in years too, not waking up scratching my scalp and feeling icky!</li>
            <li> This was delivered on time and it works great.</li>
            <li> After the first use I saw the results were excellent. Besides the hair looks shiny but not greasy and healthy. Very good results.</li>
            <li> It works very well, for me, I&#x27;ve tried several methods and techniques to recover my scalp, I suffered for long time and it is the best product I&#x27;ve ever found... but you must follow the instruction letter by letter</li>
            <li> Continues to be a great product and I have used it for the past couple of years. I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I suffer from Seborrheic Dermatitis.  I never had dandruff or a flacking scalp, When I went to the dermatologist  they said there was nothing they could do. Using these products over the past few months has reduced my discomfort by 90%.  I&#x27;m hopeful that continued use could reduce the itch even more.</li>
            <li> My daughter has itchy, dry scalp and gets flakes. We have tried several shampoos for dandruff and it only works the first few washes. This has helped reduce the flakes significantly as well as the itch. I don&#x27;t see her scratch any more like before or flakes on her clothes. Definitely need to use the leave in treatment after washing with the shampoo and conditioner. It makes her hair soft and smells great!</li>
            <li> My scalp issues are going away. Not total relief, but an improvement. Much better than just using tea tree shampoo from Paul Mitchell.</li>
            <li> Any &amp;#34;salon only&amp;#34; brand sold outside of the salon is usually extremely old or fake (think a knock of purse fake). Look up product diversion for more info. These fake products are often diluted or not even the advertised product at all and can contain lots of bacteria!</li>
