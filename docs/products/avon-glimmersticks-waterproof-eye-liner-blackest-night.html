            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Avon waterproof eyeliner!!!</li>
            <li>This is a good waterproof eyeliner.</li>
            <li>The Waterproof ones are great for summer time, and they come in a nice variety of colors.  </li>
            <li>I love glimmersticks!  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t wear this eyeliner on a warm day or to a funeral.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more of the marker kind.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner applies smoothly and has a good color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, but doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I had purchased this many years ago from avon and was pleased to see it on amazon.</li>
            <li>Love the ease of use.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Avon Glimmersticks</li>
            <li>I love that I can get Avon Glimmersticks cheaper on Amazon</li>
            <li>and I get them delivered free with my Amazon Prime!</li>
            <li>love this item.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure glad they did.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite eye liner product.  </li>
            <li>goes on easily</li>
            <li>They are so easy to put on, and you don&#x27;t need to sharpen them like a pencil.  </li>
            <li>It stays on all day and comes off really easily with a dab of coconut oil.</li>
            <li>It smudges and transfers easily to your lower lash line.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how they manage to make a product that truly is waterproof yet washes off easily</li>
            <li>highly recommend for a good waterproof eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Shipping time was fine.</li>
            <li>But other than that, it&#x27;s great :)</li>
            <li>It gives a nice defined line that stays put but is easy to smudge intentionally for a different look.</li>
            <li>I love to get the best value, so instead of just going to the store and grabbing an eyeliner, I did some research and found Avon Glimmersticks to be one of the highest rated AND lease expensive eye liners.</li>
            <li>I did get the right product.</li>
            <li>This goes on smooth both on skin directly and over eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>Product is mediocre at best.</li>
            <li>First time using this color</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to spend a whole lot of time on it</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and I have used them all.</li>
            <li>However, as other reviewers have mentioned, it does smudge easily.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Eyeliner applies creamily and smoothly, but creased within a few hours.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and many eyeliners will leave small blisters along the inner edge of my eyelids, despite the fact that I don&#x27;t apply eyeliner there.</li>
            <li>They go on smooth, with very little pressure (not like others I&#x27;ve bought).  </li>
            <li>The price is fines...but wait, there is one MAJOR problem.</li>
            <li>I used mine for the first time today, and while the stick is smaller than pencil, a little bit goes a long way</li>

            <li> Stays on all day with little to no smudging!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is pointless for me to buy this.</li>
            <li> Usually have to write on paper before applying.</li>

            <li> but it&#x27;s very difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> For now on I will skip the waterproof, unless I received a bad batch.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I did get the right product. Shipping time was fine. The price is fines...but wait, there is one MAJOR problem. Thee purpose of me buying this was for it to be waterproof. It&#x27;s not waterproof!!! It&#x27;s is pointless for me to buy this. Hence, if you are searching for a waterproof eyeliner - this one is NOT it.</li>
            <li> I love to get the best value, so instead of just going to the store and grabbing an eyeliner, I did some research and found Avon Glimmersticks to be one of the highest rated AND lease expensive eye liners. I used mine for the first time today, and while the stick is smaller than pencil, a little bit goes a long way and you don&#x27;t have to deal with sharpening and pencil shavings. It&#x27;s not infallible. It can smudge and when it does, it&#x27;s difficult to get off. But it stayed on all day. It looks great and is an unbeatable price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, but doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly. I made the mistake of thinking it was pencil but it&#x27;s more of the marker kind.</li>
            <li> This is a good waterproof eyeliner. It doesn&#x27;t run or smear (unless you have it on for an EXTREMELY long time. It came in the mail faster than expected. I was expecting it to come on the 21st, but it came on the 17th! How awesome is that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would of given it 5 stars. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars was because the eyeliner pen was a little too slim for me, since I&#x27;m used to the slightly thicker eyeliner pencils. But other than that, it&#x27;s great :)</li>
            <li> I had purchased this many years ago from avon and was pleased to see it on amazon. the color is dark black. it lasts all day. goes on easily</li>
            <li> I love glimmersticks!  They are so easy to put on, and you don&#x27;t need to sharpen them like a pencil.  They go on smooth, with very little pressure (not like others I&#x27;ve bought).  The Waterproof ones are great for summer time, and they come in a nice variety of colors.  If I could only have one item of make-up, this would be it.</li>
            <li> I used to use this stuff all the time and it stayed on no matter what....but this one runs of my face and smears after a few minutes of wearing it, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love the ease of use. It glides on with no resistance. Gave a 4 Star rating because it is not as Black upon application to lids, as I expected. Wish the Black pigment was richer in its intensity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about my makeup. I don&#x27;t like to spend a whole lot of time on it and once it&#x27;s done I don&#x27;t do touchups throughout the day. This goes on smooth both on skin directly and over eyeshadow. It gives a nice defined line that stays put but is easy to smudge intentionally for a different look. It stays on all day and comes off really easily with a dab of coconut oil.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner applies smoothly and has a good color. However, as other reviewers have mentioned, it does smudge easily. I wouldn&#x27;t wear this eyeliner on a warm day or to a funeral.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Avon Glimmersticks Waterproof eyeliner. I have very sensitive skin and many eyeliners will leave small blisters along the inner edge of my eyelids, despite the fact that I don&#x27;t apply eyeliner there. I NEVER have this issue with Avon Glimmersticks. The Waterproof Glimmersticks have great staying power and never smudge or smear the way some brands will. The colors are vibrant and I have used them all. I love that I can get Avon Glimmersticks cheaper on Amazon than I can at Avon.com and I get them delivered free with my Amazon Prime! I will continue to purchase them here at these prices!</li>
            <li> love this item.  can&#x27;t live without it. highly recommend for a good waterproof eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I like it but it&#x27;s not water proof.</li>
            <li> Eyeliner applies creamily and smoothly, but creased within a few hours. It smudges and transfers easily to your lower lash line. I would not repurchase. Product is mediocre at best. I have normal/dry skin and my eyelids are not that oily.</li>
            <li> The waterproof AVON Glimmersticks stays on longer but it&#x27;s very difficult to apply.  My eyes are red from pushing so hard. Usually have to write on paper before applying. For now on I will skip the waterproof, unless I received a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day with little to no smudging! This will definitely be repurchased when I run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Avon waterproof eyeliner!!! I don&#x27;t know how they manage to make a product that truly is waterproof yet washes off easily but I&#x27;m sure glad they did.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eye liner product.  First time using this color and I really like it. Recd in very good condition.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is the best and i have tried several!!! Girls, if you want a great waterproof eyeliner, this is what you want to purchase!</li>
