            <li>ago!&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is appealing, somewhat sexy, but a little cloying.</li>

            <li>My father really likes this scent.</li>
            <li>I really like it  </li>
            <li>I was very eager to order a bottle of Wild Country when it went to $3.00 shipped on sale.</li>
            <li>When I got it, it had a distinct alcohol smell to it that many fake $5 \\&quot;street scents\\&quot; have that are being sold on the tables in Manhattan</li>
            <li>OK I know I&#x27;m not a man, but I hate the smell of womens perfume, and love the smell of mens cologne and the ruggedness of it</li>

            <li> I have been using this cologne for 20yrs or more</li>
            <li> when Avon stopped carrying it at one point, so I ordered it from here. The scent wasn&#x27;t that bad and it didn&#x27;t irritate my nose (I have allergies). Would reccomend as a gift if looking into Avon cologne.</li>
            <li> OK I know I&#x27;m not a man, but I hate the smell of womens perfume, and love the smell of mens cologne and the ruggedness of it and this stuff is perfect!</li>
            <li> Very good cologne. I had a bottle of the after shave in my medicine cabinet that my nephew found after he started to shave and he loved it. So I ordered him a bottle of the cologne for Christmas and he wears it every day. Not a bad price either. I got him another bottle for his birthday and he couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Husband wanted this as a change from his present cologne</li>
            <li> really like it arrived safe and sound. no problems, packaging done excellent, will recommend to  others, I buy a lot</li>
            <li> I have been using Wild Country products for several years.  I really like it  Been around for several years now.</li>
            <li> Boy, does this bring back memories!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this fragrance, because back in the late 70&#x27;s my cousin wore it. That was 35 years ago!&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is appealing, somewhat sexy, but a little cloying. Overall a very good fragrance.</li>
            <li> purchased for my husband as this is one of his favorite scents .... he actually asked me to order it for him</li>
            <li> would recommend to anyone very good and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I like this product but to me it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as I remember Wild Country cologne smelling years ago. The Wild Country body talc does smell as good as I remember it smelling, which I also ordered.</li>
