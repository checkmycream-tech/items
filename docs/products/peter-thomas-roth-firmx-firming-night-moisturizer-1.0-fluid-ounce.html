            <li>This effective and gentle cream is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Not as good as most PTR products.</li>
            <li>Plumps and smooths skin better than la mer or la prarie imo at a much better price point.</li>
            <li>It all counts and we all need to urge the companies we purchase from to be better stewards of our planet.</li>
            <li>and it seems to do a better job for me</li>
            <li>I have tried a ton of other brands and this has been the best.  </li>
            <li>Worth the investment :)</li>
            <li>but I feel confident that I&#x27;m on the right track.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly see and feel a new supple firmness in my skin.</li>

            <li>That&#x27;s when I really saw a difference.</li>
            <li>and I can really tell it makes my face look tighter and smoother.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to all of you who reviewed.</li>
            <li>you may want to use very sparingly.</li>
            <li>The clear top is totally superfluous.  </li>
            <li>Wastes valuable natural resources to make the clear top, which is only decorative (and very striking), and not functional.  </li>
            <li>Keep in mind, it is the middle of the road in price,and I am still looking for that right one that does the trick!</li>
            <li>I am 64 and live in the desert.&lt;br /&gt;Two strikes.</li>
            <li>I gave it a three because it doesn&#x27;t live up to 5 star ratings i read.</li>
            <li>I actually got it because of positive reviews on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised at how well this works.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I think it is making my face break out.  I have used it for a week.</li>
            <li> This effective and gentle cream is wonderful. Plumps and smooths skin better than la mer or la prarie imo at a much better price point.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product line by a local spa.  I have used it now for about seven years.  I like the product.  The cream keeps my skin hydrated and looking younger than my age</li>
            <li> Im only using it for a few days, so I wont know ...but so far its not greasy, not too sheer. makes my skin feel good.  I will let you know in a week or two!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m halfway through this FIRMx by P.T. Roth. It seems to clog  my pores/- combination skin. I am 64 and live in the desert.&lt;br /&gt;Two strikes. I&#x27;m only using it on my neck and tops of my hands before bed now. Seems to be alright for that purpose. I haven&#x27;t noticed&lt;br /&gt;any real anti-aging going on with this cream. I won&#x27;t be buying it again. I gave it a three because it doesn&#x27;t live up to 5 star ratings i read. Keep in mind, it is the middle of the road in price,and I am still looking for that right one that does the trick!</li>
            <li> At this price, I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase if I didn&#x27;t think it helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excessive packaging however.  The clear top is totally superfluous.  Wastes valuable natural resources to make the clear top, which is only decorative (and very striking), and not functional.  The added weight and size increases amount of fuel and space needed for shipping.  It all counts and we all need to urge the companies we purchase from to be better stewards of our planet.</li>
            <li> I read quite a bit of information on all the ingredients which are proven to improve skin-care currently (like Retinol, AHAs, Beta-hydroxy acid, Hydroquinone, L-Ascorbic Acid - only form of vitamin C proven to stimulate collagen, Hyaluronic acid, PEPTIDES and Alpha-Lipoic Acid (or miracle in a jar). I had purchased Peter Thomas Roth Glycolic Acid 10% Hydrating Gel (very thin layer on clean skin every other evening), &amp; the Retinol Fusion for p.m. I also bought the Neuroliquid Moisturizing Hydra-Gel for day use. I felt great about all three products but I didn&#x27;t think I had a &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; solution so gave in to the Firmx. That&#x27;s when I really saw a difference. I don&#x27;t know if it is the ONLY one helping but ????  The only thing I&#x27;m going to research next is how I can get all of these ingredients for a lot less money!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is great for preventative maintenance</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for two years on a daily basis. Great value from this supplier.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year now and I can really tell it makes my face look tighter and smoother.  I will continue to use this!!!</li>
            <li> I am surprised at how well this works.  I could see a noticeable difference after about a week or two.  I have tried a ton of other brands and this has been the best.  I actually got it because of positive reviews on Amazon.  Thanks to all of you who reviewed.</li>
            <li> everyone compliments my skin and it&#x27;s because I have faithfully used the Firmx products for 3 years</li>
            <li> Best yet from Peter Thomas for anti wrinkle.</li>
            <li> good service and good quality item</li>
            <li> Great product, goes along with other PTR products I use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE IT!!! I could see the difference in my skin after 2 weeks of using this product.  My face got tighter and my friends asked me if I got botox. It really works!!</li>
            <li> Outstanding product !!! Worth the investment :)</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after one use. I am 57 and started noticing some sagging in the jawline and neck area. I can honestly see and feel a new supple firmness in my skin. I will reorder this product.</li>
            <li> Not as good as most PTR products. I&#x27;ve been using Algenist  lift and firm and it seems to do a better job for me</li>
            <li> My reviews are few and far between - but this product warrants a couple of minutes of my time.  I live in the desert of Arizona and have TERRIBLY DRY SKIN - this moisturizer has hydrated my skin like none other!  It&#x27;s only been about two weeks since I started using it so I can&#x27;t say if I&#x27;m seeing a firmer tone, yet but I feel confident that I&#x27;m on the right track.  If you&#x27;re breakout prone you may want to use very sparingly.</li>
