            <li>I bought one bottler and then bought three more.</li>
            <li>many of them organic-</li>
            <li>This means that more comes out of the dropper than I sometimes intend, but it&#x27;s not a deal-breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I am in love with this Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>That being said, here&#x27;s why I love this serum by Elleda.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pumps tend to give you more air than serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will give it more time though.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The more organic products I use, the better for my body.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C is one of my favorite things for skincare.</li>
            <li>I do love how it feels on the skin.</li>
            <li>LOVE vitamin C</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>i am so glad this product found me if i could give this product a 10 star review</li>
            <li>this can be used on men and woman so if i were u i would run and buy as many bottles of this</li>
            <li>98%natural ingredients it has everything you need for a healthy skin and glow</li>
            <li>love that this product is made in the USA in a FDA-approved facility.  </li>
            <li>I definitely love this product.  </li>
            <li>what more needs to be said....</li>
            <li>I love this serum for so many reasons -</li>
            <li>Part of the reason I decided to try this Serum is because right off the bat it makes me feel like I&#x27;m doing something good for my skin</li>
            <li>One unexpected result from using the Vitamin C 20% Serum is that this was surprisingly moisturizing!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy it has a decent amount of Vitamin C (20%).</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and has a very light scent to which does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li>I have pretty good skin to begin with.</li>
            <li>it is exactly as it states good product</li>
            <li>Elleda&#x27;s serum is a pretty good one</li>

            <li>All of those things made me excited about trying this product.</li>
            <li>Originally purchased this for a gift and ended up keeping it for myself.  </li>
            <li>While I did receive the product to review, I will only be completely honest in my reviews!</li>
            <li>I love that it contains mostly organic and natural ingredients too.</li>
            <li>This product is full of rich vitamins and botanicals.</li>
            <li>I do buy two bottles one for me and one for my daughter , my daughter has been telling me for month s how great this for your skin , And she was right Ihave only been using this for about a week</li>
            <li>Compared to my other serums this is absolutely the best one that I have tried.</li>
            <li>nothing special</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>When given the product at no cost to give my true thoughts, I jumped at the chance to do so.</li>
            <li>so I have more control over how much I use.  </li>
            <li>The problem with this is that the lotions most people use doesn’t really do anything.</li>
            <li>Everyone I bought it for wants more.</li>
            <li>Only time can tell though, I&#x27;ll have to leave a more detailed review after using it for a while. :)</li>
            <li>I use it primarily for the smile line around my mouth.</li>
            <li>Packaged well, full bottle no leaks</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone who wants softer, smoother, healthy skin.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and arrived in safe packaging.</li>
            <li>It is just easier to use it on the full face.</li>
            <li>, if you need a serum for a full face treatment then this is the brand to go with.</li>
            <li>I also liked how it made my face feel so soft.</li>
            <li>There is no bad smell either.  </li>
            <li>Ferulic acid is good for dark spots, so you may see better results than with serums that don&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li>It has no bad smell to it</li>
            <li>The Serum includes Aloe and Jojoba - making it a flawless hydrator and the preferred natural moisturizer for dry skin.&amp;#34; on the packaging.</li>
            <li>Aloe, vitamin E and jojoba oil makes the skin flawless, hydrates and are natural moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve actually worked for me and I&#x27;ve been very happy with my current product regimen.</li>
            <li>With it absorbing so quickly I was able to use it under sunscreen and make-up as soon as it had absorbed.</li>
            <li>but in a serum which is more potent and concentrated mixed with Vitamin E , Jojoba Oil and Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li>It absorbs well and dries quickly</li>
            <li>Seems like it would be greasy but absorbs quickly and no residue.</li>
            <li>Skins absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s good for reducing fine lines and brightening your skin over all, among other things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love their high quality products and their prices.</li>
            <li>But like car insurance, just because you&#x27;re happy with what you have doesn&#x27;t mean that you shouldn&#x27;t shop around every so often just to see if there&#x27;s something better out there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>bye,bye to dull dry lack luster skin , and say hey there to vibrant glowing hydrated even toned beautiful healthy skin!!!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>If this claim is true the smell is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The added bonus to this product, when one considers that the skin is largest organ in the body, capable of absorbing large amounts of toxins and chemicals, having an organic solution such as this is wonderful.</li>
            <li>My skin is acne-prone yet also dry, and this is one of the first serums I have tried that I have actually liked, rather than just was okay with.</li>
            <li>So new goal is to make sure that I am always moisturized</li>
            <li>/&gt;It came very quickly, was sealed very well and was undamaged in any way,&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a oil, so you don&#x27;t need to much and will spread around easy.</li>
            <li>It gets absorbed quickly and there have not been any side effects.</li>
            <li>And yet it still absorbed into my skin quickly, and did not irritate it, as some skin care products do.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly; I apply my moisturizer right over it almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>Elleda Vitamin C 20% Serum is made with 20% Vitamin C, which helps stimulate collagen to renew skin cell production, which helps reveal younger, more smoother skin, reducing fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Soaks in fast and leaves skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>I got this a few days days ago, I&#x27;m already seeing great results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many serums and I&#x27;ve got to say that my skin has never felt so soft.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing any non Vitamin C serums again in the future!</li>
            <li>I wake up with fresh and firmer skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Product provided complimentary for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li>The serum sinks into my skin and leaves it looking smooth and almost matte, which I liked.</li>
            <li>You have a winner on your hands and so far I love what I am experiencing with Elleda&#x27;s Organic Vitamin C 20% Serum.</li>
            <li>Our formula is blended with plant derived powerful moisture-binding ingredients that keep skin plump and hydrated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: Weeks later, I am loving this</li>
            <li>far it is safe</li>
            <li>I do not like the smell of it, but as soon as it is absorbed</li>
            <li>The serum is made in fresh batches and is only effective when used fresh.</li>
            <li>Let the serum get absorbed into the skin, then apply moisturizer and always wear a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Honestly, very much worth it.</li>
            <li>Fun</li>
            <li>I have tried others but I feel like this one particularly reduces my fine lines.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, it absorbs pretty quickly and the scent disappears.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it is made right here in the U.S.A</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t oily or sticky and it absorbs right away.</li>
            <li>This serum is the right consistency &amp; I smell no odor.  </li>
            <li>I am always interested in skin care products that use mostly, or all , natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great little vitamin C pack!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It absorbs into the skin quickly and leaves me skin feeling smooth and soft --not sticky or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This serum actually smells pleasant because it&#x27;s natural, so I have no problem using it.  </li>
            <li>I use the C Serum specifically on my forehead because I was born with these wrinkles on my forehead and they are beginning to be more apparent.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any reduction in my breakouts, but when I did breakout, pimples shrunk more quickly, and black heads fade more readily.  </li>
            <li>The scent was a little off for me, but I just put a drop of lavender or lemon balm essential oils with it and it smells great!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s always good knowing that I can use something as natural as possible to rejuvenate and restore my skin.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you are working with clean dry skin.</li>
            <li>I am excited to start using this to help minimize the fine lines that are starting to come with my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Serums are hyper-concentrated skincare products that give the most intense anti-aging ingredients, such as antioxidants, and you do not need a lot of this product to get the full benefits.  </li>
            <li>It helps with fine lines wrinkles and even helped clear up acne and heal acne scars I have.</li>
            <li>There was a slight exfoliant effect during cleansing that removed the dry patchy skin to help my face look and feel it&#x27;s best.</li>
            <li>, I was also happy to see it was paraben and sulfate free, I opened the sealed dropper bottle and applied it to my face, it feels very liquid in comparison to other similar products I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>As far as brightening any hyper-pigmentation, I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference</li>
            <li>It left my skin nice and smooth and feeling like I just had a facial at a salon.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and smooth after using this Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>Thanks Elleda!</li>
            <li>This is something I am adding to my morning routine because it leaves me with a refreshing feeling and imporvmeent in my facial skin.</li>
            <li>: I received one or more of the products mentioned above in exchange for review.</li>
            <li>Glass bottles are very eco-friendly, easier to recycle and does not have any harmful chemicals that can be absorbed into the product.  </li>
            <li>Serums do not hydrate the top layer of your skin, because they have penetrated deeply into your dermal layer, so you should always follow up with a facial lotion or cream to lock in the serum nutrients, hydrate the top layer of your skin and seal in that moisture.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I think I first read about this product in a magazine and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>Then simply add your favorite moisturizer or makeup.</li>
            <li>Two giant things I love</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft, smooth and &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve been getting compliments.  </li>
            <li>This is my first ever purchase from ELLEDA skin care.</li>
            <li>I am sure if will not be the last.</li>
            <li>Smelled funny and made me break out.</li>
            <li>She has many facial wrinkles and brown spots.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!    </li>
            <li>So when i use this stuff on a daily basis it is almost like magic.</li>
            <li>absolutely love serums especially the organic ones.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I finally decided to take care of my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now, and the results are pretty speedy</li>
            <li>It makes your face feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>You have to use product eating healthy and exercise alone were not enough.</li>
            <li>Have you looked at the ingredients in all the top of the line facial creams and serums?</li>
            <li>It gets absorbed by the skin really fast.</li>
            <li>I love asian..</li>
            <li>Definitely will order more.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and soft</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more of this vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>The serum feels good, not oily but not too harsh.</li>
            <li>I will update this review after I&#x27;ve tried it for a few weeks in order to give a fair review.</li>
            <li>With the dropper I&#x27;m able to get the amount I need and apply it easily without spending a ton of time pumping out little bitty amounts of serum.</li>
            <li>slightly leary since many got free samples whereas I paid.</li>
            <li>I have some wrinkles and breaks due to some irritations and this was pretty nice.</li>
            <li>helping keep your skin full of moisture along with helps your other moisturizers be more effective.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m noticing a significant difference, but I do like it so far.  </li>
            <li>Most women are afraid of getting wrinkles and saggy skin, so this serum is a great way to take care of your face and neck.</li>
            <li>so thats a big plus go&#x27;s on your face just great and dry fast</li>
            <li>I been using the vitamin C only 3 weeks ago, so far I liked the results.</li>
            <li>Just put a small amount on and it will spread nicely absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling greasy or oily afterwards.</li>
            <li>It also is pretty strong smelling which can be a big trigger for migraines for me.</li>
            <li>I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li>Would definitely purchase again at full price!</li>
            <li>It definitely tightens my skin so it feels like I&#x27;ve just washed off a clay mask--soft, smooth, clean and clear.</li>
            <li>I had a rather large breakout</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you should wait until you actually see the wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li>, now I have not notice any signs of fine lines leaving but it has only been a week , I do like like these  product  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s working for not only smoothing out fine lines but plumping your skin.</li>
            <li>Serums are made with smaller molecules than lotions and creams, so they are able to quickly penetrate deeply into the lower layers of your skin, which absorbs the beneficial nutrients to help target the skin concern that the serum is designed to treat.  </li>
            <li>you get older, at first you might not notice the changes in your skin</li>
            <li>, it kind off put me off a little, maybe it is coming from the witch hazel</li>
            <li>With regular use you&#x27;ll see fine lines disappear, an evening of skin tone, and sun damaged skin much improved.</li>
            <li>Arginine ~ an essential amino acid, an antioxidant that aids in building collagen    Ferulic Acid~ made from rice brain oil, this is a very potent antioxidant and helps aid other antioxidant ingredients, stabilizes Vitamin C from oxidation    Organic Jojoba Oil ~ a natural emollient that has a similar structure to your own sebum</li>
            <li>Have you had a hard time finding a good serum for your face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have used tea vitamin c oil for several years and it is a huge help.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very affordable price.</li>
            <li>This is a non-oily, fast absorbing serum.  </li>
            <li>The benefits are real.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much of a noticeable difference yet, but my family says that there is</li>
            <li>This also works very well with the rest of the products I use in my &amp;#34;beauty regimen&amp;#34; and has seemed to support and improve their functions also.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>The serum is in a amber glass bottle, which is optimal, as it filters out damaging blue and UV light which in turn will extend the shelf life of the serum.  </li>
            <li>thanks -</li>
            <li>Really helps out with the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite ready to wear anything strapless yet</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>After a few uses, my skin began to look dewy and healthy, but it did not break me out (and even seemed to lighten some scarring and stuff), so I will most likely repurchase.</li>
            <li>real human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I really needed this</li>
            <li>,it is very helpful as it does tighten skin to prevent wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I really like this product because it has helped me with the scars on my hands.</li>
            <li>Has helped my bruises not happen so much, since I lack calcium from not drinking milk.</li>
            <li>Fast,</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very pleasing</li>
            <li>I applied before makeup and it really protected my skin.</li>
            <li>Thank you for your product; price is sooo reasonable.</li>
            <li>I really like the Elleda organic vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll let me save you the time they all contain vitamin C. Vitamin C has so many benefits to the skin, it fights free radicals, it restores skin will make old acne scars disappear, it acts as an antioxidant, I makes skin firm by producing collagen, it also protects your skin from the harmful rays of the sun</li>
            <li>When you use the Serum you don&#x27;t need much since it&#x27;s oily, so you would just rub it into the skin area you chose and massage it, don&#x27;t just rub it or you will look greasy</li>
            <li>and nobody wants that.</li>
            <li>I really recommended protects the skin.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very convenient to use.</li>
            <li>I really like Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t really notice unless looking for it.</li>
            <li>and i have to say i really did not know about this product</li>
            <li>I have tried a couple others that are similar but this scent is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I find this serum to be good, and I recommend that you at least consider it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used other serums that are much better.</li>
            <li>I used the product faithfully for 3 months and can say that my skin tone has brightened, and the dark spots are starting to fade (great for adult acne).  </li>
            <li>love the product, it leaves my skin very smooth and soft, and the little lines around the eyes are starting to fade.</li>
            <li>This was always dark, but now is getting very light.</li>
            <li>It is very reassuring to read &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; on the main ingredients in Elleda&#x27;s Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s only been three full days, the combination of this and a drop or so of Rosehip Oil has really made a change.</li>
            <li>I would say this tilts towards the cosmetic and recommend it for immediate results, but would suggest finding something to use with it that contains more active ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved the way it smoothed tiny lines and seemed to refine my pores so they were much less noticeable.</li>
            <li>Elleda Vitamin C serum is a watery serum and you must shake the bottle first as natural ingredients do separate.  </li>
            <li>~ it is just the official botanical name and the ingredient list is quite small, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>I am in my late 20&#x27;s, fair dry, sensitive skin with hyper-pigmentation, sun damage, and light acne scaring (</li>
            <li>Although skeptical by nature and more or less convinced that most miracle topical restoratives are scams, for the most part, I&#x27;ve been lucky with my cosmetic choices.</li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly and no residue left.</li>
            <li>I have mild Rosacea, and while it is not gone it is definitely &#x27;calmed&#x27; with vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Organic Vitamin C 20% Serum is simple enough to use but the results are stunning to behold.</li>
            <li>but my hands appear much older than that, since I&#x27;ve worked with them all my life, and gone though weight loss.  </li>
            <li>, it absorbed fast and hopefully make me look younger</li>
            <li>This bottle is a lot bigger than what I expected and it was packaged nice when I received it in the mail.</li>
            <li>No seriously that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>have been lucky and graced with skin that helps make me look younger</li>
            <li>not only does it make face soft and smooth but it has also has shrunk my pores</li>
            <li>I got this for my wife who is 72 years young and live in Florida where the summer temps get really hot at times.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend Elleda Vitamin C Serum to anyone who has aging skin, and/or age spots.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommed this item.</li>
            <li>The Vitamin C potency is high as well.</li>
            <li>I was given the opportunity to try and test this product - highly recommend based on quality and performance.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended to others.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend. .</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to you all, my family, and friends.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m turning 31 soon, so I decided that it&#x27;s high time</li>
            <li>I will being using it from now on and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Received</li>
            <li>This is a very light serum and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin at all.</li>
            <li>My skin feels a little more vibrant and fresher.</li>
            <li>The bottle also comes with a nifty little squeeze-dropper top.</li>
            <li>And my skin looked more vibrant after a few days of usage.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue, and works well under my makeup or other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>really, This serum is made with 72% certified organic ingredients, and is 98% naturally derived.</li>
            <li>but I think as a serum to add to your regular skin-care routine it proved complimentary.</li>
            <li>Starting to take care of the skin as early as possible is always better.</li>
            <li>and I usually use a full dropper full over my face after the shower.</li>
            <li>After a couple minutes I put on my moisturizer like normal.</li>
            <li>and I can go ahead with my normal skincare routine.  </li>
            <li>I put it on everyday after my shower and I love how my skin feels.</li>
            <li>I did receive this free to test, and I never expected such results!  </li>
            <li>I did not get the irritation I normally get from makeup when it is humid.</li>
            <li>Mimics your body&#x27;s natural oils and absorbs deeply and quickly to moisturize all skin types    </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll finish the bottle but will switch back to the previous one i was using which also had an oilier texture that i liked.</li>
            <li>I have some fine lines and some little showing of wrinkles from expression lines, but it really works on my flaws.</li>
            <li>There is a very slight scent of cloves, but this fades quickly as the product is absorbed.</li>
            <li>I have used other Vitamin C Serums, and this one is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I am still trying this new product.</li>
            <li>I have issues with enlarged pores, some fine lines and wrinkles, and some dark spots that need help.</li>
            <li>The antioxidants of all antioxidants ~ prevents free radical formation, protects the upper skin layer from initial harmful UV radiation and prevents the deterioration of fats in your cell membranes.  </li>
            <li>I only got to use a few times cause my daughter overed on it since she liked the way it worked on her skin.</li>
            <li>i for 1 am very sensitive it would break me out...</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin which cannot tolerate some Vitamin C serums, but this one is fine.&lt;br /&gt;~</li>
            <li>, it does not easily glides, feels more like water, but it has a strong scent, not an unpleasant scent but very strong</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and glowing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried oils and balms and salves and lotions and creams, all claiming to smooth out the complexion, lighten dark blemishes, and strip away the years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and so far, not only do I enjoy using it but am also amazed on how it&#x27;s transformng my skin to fresher, younger looking!</li>
            <li>process to apply this product is pretty simple.</li>
            <li>: Did you know that the reason that this is stored in a dark bottle rather then the see through bottle is because vitamin C looses its potency when light is exposed to it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have that many signs of aging yet, but I would really like to look younger for a long long time.</li>
            <li>and I notice a brightening effect on my face which Im really happy about as I have been struggling with dull and dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li>IT SINKS IN QUICKLY.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and almost feel like it tightens up my skin a little.</li>
            <li>The labeling is clear and informative.</li>
            <li>My friend has acne scars and she hopes this will help her clear her</li>
            <li>: I’d clear it for all types.</li>
            <li>It even helped clear up my face.</li>
            <li>No harsh chemical.</li>
            <li>My face is so soft.</li>
            <li>So far i like the serum..its not irrating my skin. ...</li>
            <li>too early to tell what the effects will be on my skin will be tho.</li>
            <li>I also noticed my adult acne diminished when I put this one.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s because I have sensitive skin that I am having issues with it.</li>
            <li>This serum contains 72% organic and 98% natural ingredients, with antioxidant vitamin-rich botanicals.      </li>
            <li>Nourishes your skin, leaving it feeling soft and silky    Hyaluronic Acid ~  </li>
            <li>Protects and revives your skin with natural healing properties    </li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s not doing wonders for the creases around my eyes, I&#x27;m hoping that it is at least helping to prevent more.</li>
            <li>It also makes your face incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li>have used this product for nearly a week now</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive</li>
            <li>I can see the completely result</li>
            <li>I also got it for my 73 year old mother</li>
            <li>is so soft</li>
            <li>so far</li>
            <li>i thought it would be all natural and safer to use some have allergies to the acid and cant use without a breakout...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Elleda&#x27;s Organic Vitamin C 20% Serum, containing 72% organic ingredients and 98% natural.</li>
            <li>After the serum, I layer a heavy cream over a light moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>My face is so clear and soft.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because the ingredients are all natural and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft and has lighten some sun spots that I have.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this Organic Vitamin C Serum to anyone who wants to help fade some wrinkles.</li>
            <li>made my skin so soft and</li>
            <li>The hyaluric acid binds with your skins natural moisture</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s 72% Organic, 98% Natural, made in the USA and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>I had never tried a serum like this before, so I was somewhat surprised at the thickness of it.</li>
            <li>One went as far as to say &amp;#34;whatever</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft, but firmer and fuller.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many but the few that I do have, I have noticed a big difference in appearance.</li>
            <li>It is a nice thin serum which is a welcomed changes from think greasy/oily/dense serums that I tried before.  </li>
            <li>The reviews were so positive that I was skeptical, but this is a wonderful product, and I actually came back and bought a few for friends.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great because it is a serum that last at least 2 months and a half day and night use.</li>
            <li>Also a tip wet your face with water first to dampen your skin or wash your face first but don&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li>also love that the very last statement on the directions is  &amp;#34; Always apply with excessive self love&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This type of skincare is in my interest because it&#x27;s more on the natural side, promoting ingredients the earth provides to help repair our skin from harsh environmental factors instead of using products containing ingredients with names unknown to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>started noticing the dark spots getting lighter right away.  </li>
            <li>I also appreciate that Elleda does not use any parabens in their Vitamin C serum and it is made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using it on the back of my hands because I feel like my hands are aging prematurely from being outside in the garden so much.</li>
            <li>I have had no side effects or issues especially around my sensitive areas,  near my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li>I have recently tried several serums (retinol, vitamin C, hyaluronic), and find that vitamin C serums have really helped with tone and &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, I use it twice a day and a bottle lasts EASILY over a month, if not two.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have major wrinkles</li>
            <li>Everyone now has major concerns of ageing and want to find something that will help it.</li>
            <li>I am a bit late in reviewing this product since I have been using it for almost a month now and am 100%satisfied with it.no other serum has provided the kind of nourishment to my skin the way this serum has ...</li>
            <li>I am 59 years old and it seems to help the overall appearance of my complexion.</li>
            <li>I only use 1 drop at a time and massage directly to skin.</li>
            <li>The product left my skin feeling soft and supple.</li>
            <li>The serum has a thin consistency and is easily absorbed into the skin, it is also gentle on my sensitive skin and has not caused any redness or breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was expecting a citrus smell but it kind of had a faint clove type smell.</li>
            <li>I have used several different brands but this is going to be one of my new favorites</li>
            <li>WitchHazel ~ an anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial (soothes and heals the skin), astringent (due to the large quantity of tannins), and locks in moisture to your skin.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for a few days in conjunction with other skin-care products and my complexion is getting whiter and more even.</li>
            <li>I have used the vit C a few times and noticed the difference right away.</li>
            <li>I received this C Serum from Elleda a few days ago and started using it right away.</li>
            <li>however I am now in my late 30’s and am starting to form fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have had several blue light and fraxel laser treatments in the past but this works just as well for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>if you are used to odorless to very light serums, you may notice that this one smells a little different, a little like bacon to some people.  </li>
            <li>To deal with this, most people just ignore it and accept the slow advance of old age, however other people turn to lotions to improve their skin and bring it back to life.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is it smells kind of weird.</li>
            <li>Now I know that the word acid may seem scary but this kind of acid wont eat up your skin, it will only help and nourish it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very self-conscious about wearing anything strapless because of all the dark spots on my chest and shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I then heat a compress with hot water, apply it to my face for a few minutes</li>
            <li>I wanted to give it a few months to work first before I wrote anything, so in a nutshell-</li>
            <li>It does dry quick though I will have to give it a plus for that, and also doesn’t feel heavy or greasy against my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin felt much less dry and tight, but it appeared smoother and more supple.</li>
            <li>The product might be a little strong for me because my skin gets red after application and it also burns a little.</li>
            <li>I am developing age spots on my face, and hopefully I will be able to slow down the process if I use Vitamin C serum and moisturizers as regularly as I can.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use very much for it to work, so a little bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>shelf life of this bottle shows that it is good for two years, plenty of time to use your product without it going bad.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> this Vit C serum is a smooth applying serum.</li>
            <li> You will have to moisturize after as it is not a moisturizer, but is a great step prior to your moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This made my face feel refreshed and smooth, made some of my blemishes lighten even go away.</li>
            <li> and this is packaged in an amber glass bottle with an included dropper for precise dispensing.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m wearing makeup, I do just the light moisturizer</li>
            <li> It has a light floral scent sort of like roses.</li>
            <li> Smooth,</li>

            <li> My preference is entire face/neck.beside this organic no bad reaction reaction for Me but great tesult..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to keep using this vitamin c serum to see how it can enhance my skin</li>
            <li> All of those things made me excited about trying this product.</li>
            <li> Originally purchased this for a gift and ended up keeping it for myself.  </li>
            <li> While I did receive the product to review, I will only be completely honest in my reviews!</li>
            <li> I love that it contains mostly organic and natural ingredients too.</li>
            <li> This product is full of rich vitamins and botanicals.</li>
            <li> I do buy two bottles one for me and one for my daughter , my daughter has been telling me for month s how great this for your skin , And she was right Ihave only been using this for about a week</li>
            <li> Compared to my other serums this is absolutely the best one that I have tried.</li>
            <li> nothing special</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> When given the product at no cost to give my true thoughts, I jumped at the chance to do so.</li>
            <li> so I have more control over how much I use.  </li>
            <li> The problem with this is that the lotions most people use doesn’t really do anything.</li>
            <li> Everyone I bought it for wants more.</li>
            <li> Only time can tell though, I&#x27;ll have to leave a more detailed review after using it for a while. :)</li>
            <li> I use it primarily for the smile line around my mouth.</li>
            <li> Packaged well, full bottle no leaks</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone who wants softer, smoother, healthy skin.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and arrived in safe packaging.</li>
            <li> It is just easier to use it on the full face.</li>
            <li> , if you need a serum for a full face treatment then this is the brand to go with.</li>
            <li> I also liked how it made my face feel so soft.</li>
            <li> There is no bad smell either.  </li>
            <li> Ferulic acid is good for dark spots, so you may see better results than with serums that don&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li> It has no bad smell to it</li>
            <li> The Serum includes Aloe and Jojoba - making it a flawless hydrator and the preferred natural moisturizer for dry skin.&amp;#34; on the packaging.</li>
            <li> Aloe, vitamin E and jojoba oil makes the skin flawless, hydrates and are natural moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve actually worked for me and I&#x27;ve been very happy with my current product regimen.</li>
            <li> With it absorbing so quickly I was able to use it under sunscreen and make-up as soon as it had absorbed.</li>
            <li> but in a serum which is more potent and concentrated mixed with Vitamin E , Jojoba Oil and Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well and dries quickly</li>
            <li> Seems like it would be greasy but absorbs quickly and no residue.</li>
            <li> Skins absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s good for reducing fine lines and brightening your skin over all, among other things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love their high quality products and their prices.</li>
            <li> But like car insurance, just because you&#x27;re happy with what you have doesn&#x27;t mean that you shouldn&#x27;t shop around every so often just to see if there&#x27;s something better out there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> bye,bye to dull dry lack luster skin , and say hey there to vibrant glowing hydrated even toned beautiful healthy skin!!!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> If this claim is true the smell is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The added bonus to this product, when one considers that the skin is largest organ in the body, capable of absorbing large amounts of toxins and chemicals, having an organic solution such as this is wonderful.</li>
            <li> My skin is acne-prone yet also dry, and this is one of the first serums I have tried that I have actually liked, rather than just was okay with.</li>
            <li> So new goal is to make sure that I am always moisturized</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came very quickly, was sealed very well and was undamaged in any way,&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a oil, so you don&#x27;t need to much and will spread around easy.</li>
            <li> It gets absorbed quickly and there have not been any side effects.</li>
            <li> And yet it still absorbed into my skin quickly, and did not irritate it, as some skin care products do.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly; I apply my moisturizer right over it almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> Elleda Vitamin C 20% Serum is made with 20% Vitamin C, which helps stimulate collagen to renew skin cell production, which helps reveal younger, more smoother skin, reducing fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Soaks in fast and leaves skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I got this a few days days ago, I&#x27;m already seeing great results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many serums and I&#x27;ve got to say that my skin has never felt so soft.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing any non Vitamin C serums again in the future!</li>
            <li> I wake up with fresh and firmer skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Product provided complimentary for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li> The serum sinks into my skin and leaves it looking smooth and almost matte, which I liked.</li>
            <li> You have a winner on your hands and so far I love what I am experiencing with Elleda&#x27;s Organic Vitamin C 20% Serum.</li>
            <li> Our formula is blended with plant derived powerful moisture-binding ingredients that keep skin plump and hydrated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: Weeks later, I am loving this</li>
            <li> far it is safe</li>
            <li> I do not like the smell of it, but as soon as it is absorbed</li>
            <li> The serum is made in fresh batches and is only effective when used fresh.</li>
            <li> Let the serum get absorbed into the skin, then apply moisturizer and always wear a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Honestly, very much worth it.</li>
            <li> Fun</li>
            <li> I have tried others but I feel like this one particularly reduces my fine lines.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, it absorbs pretty quickly and the scent disappears.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it is made right here in the U.S.A</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t oily or sticky and it absorbs right away.</li>
            <li> This serum is the right consistency &amp; I smell no odor.  </li>
            <li> I am always interested in skin care products that use mostly, or all , natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great little vitamin C pack!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It absorbs into the skin quickly and leaves me skin feeling smooth and soft --not sticky or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This serum actually smells pleasant because it&#x27;s natural, so I have no problem using it.  </li>
            <li> I use the C Serum specifically on my forehead because I was born with these wrinkles on my forehead and they are beginning to be more apparent.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any reduction in my breakouts, but when I did breakout, pimples shrunk more quickly, and black heads fade more readily.  </li>
            <li> The scent was a little off for me, but I just put a drop of lavender or lemon balm essential oils with it and it smells great!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s always good knowing that I can use something as natural as possible to rejuvenate and restore my skin.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you are working with clean dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am excited to start using this to help minimize the fine lines that are starting to come with my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Serums are hyper-concentrated skincare products that give the most intense anti-aging ingredients, such as antioxidants, and you do not need a lot of this product to get the full benefits.  </li>
            <li> It helps with fine lines wrinkles and even helped clear up acne and heal acne scars I have.</li>
            <li> There was a slight exfoliant effect during cleansing that removed the dry patchy skin to help my face look and feel it&#x27;s best.</li>
            <li> , I was also happy to see it was paraben and sulfate free, I opened the sealed dropper bottle and applied it to my face, it feels very liquid in comparison to other similar products I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> As far as brightening any hyper-pigmentation, I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference</li>
            <li> It left my skin nice and smooth and feeling like I just had a facial at a salon.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and smooth after using this Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> Thanks Elleda!</li>
            <li> This is something I am adding to my morning routine because it leaves me with a refreshing feeling and imporvmeent in my facial skin.</li>
            <li> : I received one or more of the products mentioned above in exchange for review.</li>
            <li> Glass bottles are very eco-friendly, easier to recycle and does not have any harmful chemicals that can be absorbed into the product.  </li>
            <li> Serums do not hydrate the top layer of your skin, because they have penetrated deeply into your dermal layer, so you should always follow up with a facial lotion or cream to lock in the serum nutrients, hydrate the top layer of your skin and seal in that moisture.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I think I first read about this product in a magazine and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> Then simply add your favorite moisturizer or makeup.</li>
            <li> Two giant things I love</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft, smooth and &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve been getting compliments.  </li>
            <li> This is my first ever purchase from ELLEDA skin care.</li>
            <li> I am sure if will not be the last.</li>
            <li> Smelled funny and made me break out.</li>
            <li> She has many facial wrinkles and brown spots.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!    </li>
            <li> So when i use this stuff on a daily basis it is almost like magic.</li>
            <li> absolutely love serums especially the organic ones.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I finally decided to take care of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now, and the results are pretty speedy</li>
            <li> It makes your face feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> You have to use product eating healthy and exercise alone were not enough.</li>
            <li> Have you looked at the ingredients in all the top of the line facial creams and serums?</li>
            <li> It gets absorbed by the skin really fast.</li>
            <li> I love asian..</li>
            <li> Definitely will order more.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and soft</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more of this vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> The serum feels good, not oily but not too harsh.</li>
            <li> I will update this review after I&#x27;ve tried it for a few weeks in order to give a fair review.</li>
            <li> With the dropper I&#x27;m able to get the amount I need and apply it easily without spending a ton of time pumping out little bitty amounts of serum.</li>
            <li> slightly leary since many got free samples whereas I paid.</li>
            <li> I have some wrinkles and breaks due to some irritations and this was pretty nice.</li>
            <li> helping keep your skin full of moisture along with helps your other moisturizers be more effective.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m noticing a significant difference, but I do like it so far.  </li>
            <li> Most women are afraid of getting wrinkles and saggy skin, so this serum is a great way to take care of your face and neck.</li>
            <li> so thats a big plus go&#x27;s on your face just great and dry fast</li>
            <li> I been using the vitamin C only 3 weeks ago, so far I liked the results.</li>
            <li> Just put a small amount on and it will spread nicely absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling greasy or oily afterwards.</li>
            <li> It also is pretty strong smelling which can be a big trigger for migraines for me.</li>
            <li> I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li> Would definitely purchase again at full price!</li>
            <li> It definitely tightens my skin so it feels like I&#x27;ve just washed off a clay mask--soft, smooth, clean and clear.</li>
            <li> I had a rather large breakout</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you should wait until you actually see the wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li> , now I have not notice any signs of fine lines leaving but it has only been a week , I do like like these  product  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s working for not only smoothing out fine lines but plumping your skin.</li>
            <li> Serums are made with smaller molecules than lotions and creams, so they are able to quickly penetrate deeply into the lower layers of your skin, which absorbs the beneficial nutrients to help target the skin concern that the serum is designed to treat.  </li>
            <li> you get older, at first you might not notice the changes in your skin</li>
            <li> , it kind off put me off a little, maybe it is coming from the witch hazel</li>
            <li> With regular use you&#x27;ll see fine lines disappear, an evening of skin tone, and sun damaged skin much improved.</li>
            <li> Arginine ~ an essential amino acid, an antioxidant that aids in building collagen    Ferulic Acid~ made from rice brain oil, this is a very potent antioxidant and helps aid other antioxidant ingredients, stabilizes Vitamin C from oxidation    Organic Jojoba Oil ~ a natural emollient that has a similar structure to your own sebum</li>
            <li> Have you had a hard time finding a good serum for your face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used tea vitamin c oil for several years and it is a huge help.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very affordable price.</li>
            <li> This is a non-oily, fast absorbing serum.  </li>
            <li> The benefits are real.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much of a noticeable difference yet, but my family says that there is</li>
            <li> This also works very well with the rest of the products I use in my &amp;#34;beauty regimen&amp;#34; and has seemed to support and improve their functions also.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> The serum is in a amber glass bottle, which is optimal, as it filters out damaging blue and UV light which in turn will extend the shelf life of the serum.  </li>
            <li> thanks -</li>
            <li> Really helps out with the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite ready to wear anything strapless yet</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, my skin began to look dewy and healthy, but it did not break me out (and even seemed to lighten some scarring and stuff), so I will most likely repurchase.</li>
            <li> real human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I really needed this</li>
            <li> ,it is very helpful as it does tighten skin to prevent wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it has helped me with the scars on my hands.</li>
            <li> Has helped my bruises not happen so much, since I lack calcium from not drinking milk.</li>
            <li> Fast,</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very pleasing</li>
            <li> I applied before makeup and it really protected my skin.</li>
            <li> Thank you for your product; price is sooo reasonable.</li>
            <li> I really like the Elleda organic vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll let me save you the time they all contain vitamin C. Vitamin C has so many benefits to the skin, it fights free radicals, it restores skin will make old acne scars disappear, it acts as an antioxidant, I makes skin firm by producing collagen, it also protects your skin from the harmful rays of the sun</li>
            <li> When you use the Serum you don&#x27;t need much since it&#x27;s oily, so you would just rub it into the skin area you chose and massage it, don&#x27;t just rub it or you will look greasy</li>
            <li> and nobody wants that.</li>
            <li> I really recommended protects the skin.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> I really like Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t really notice unless looking for it.</li>
            <li> and i have to say i really did not know about this product</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple others that are similar but this scent is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I find this serum to be good, and I recommend that you at least consider it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used other serums that are much better.</li>
            <li> I used the product faithfully for 3 months and can say that my skin tone has brightened, and the dark spots are starting to fade (great for adult acne).  </li>
            <li> love the product, it leaves my skin very smooth and soft, and the little lines around the eyes are starting to fade.</li>
            <li> This was always dark, but now is getting very light.</li>
            <li> It is very reassuring to read &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; on the main ingredients in Elleda&#x27;s Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s only been three full days, the combination of this and a drop or so of Rosehip Oil has really made a change.</li>
            <li> I would say this tilts towards the cosmetic and recommend it for immediate results, but would suggest finding something to use with it that contains more active ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved the way it smoothed tiny lines and seemed to refine my pores so they were much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Elleda Vitamin C serum is a watery serum and you must shake the bottle first as natural ingredients do separate.  </li>
            <li> ~ it is just the official botanical name and the ingredient list is quite small, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s, fair dry, sensitive skin with hyper-pigmentation, sun damage, and light acne scaring (</li>
            <li> Although skeptical by nature and more or less convinced that most miracle topical restoratives are scams, for the most part, I&#x27;ve been lucky with my cosmetic choices.</li>
            <li> It soaks in quickly and no residue left.</li>
            <li> I have mild Rosacea, and while it is not gone it is definitely &#x27;calmed&#x27; with vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Organic Vitamin C 20% Serum is simple enough to use but the results are stunning to behold.</li>
            <li> but my hands appear much older than that, since I&#x27;ve worked with them all my life, and gone though weight loss.  </li>
            <li> , it absorbed fast and hopefully make me look younger</li>
            <li> This bottle is a lot bigger than what I expected and it was packaged nice when I received it in the mail.</li>
            <li> No seriously that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> have been lucky and graced with skin that helps make me look younger</li>
            <li> not only does it make face soft and smooth but it has also has shrunk my pores</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife who is 72 years young and live in Florida where the summer temps get really hot at times.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend Elleda Vitamin C Serum to anyone who has aging skin, and/or age spots.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommed this item.</li>

            <li> I highly recommended to others.</li>

            <li> I will being using it from now on and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Received</li>
            <li> This is a very light serum and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin at all.</li>
            <li> My skin feels a little more vibrant and fresher.</li>
            <li> The bottle also comes with a nifty little squeeze-dropper top.</li>
            <li> And my skin looked more vibrant after a few days of usage.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue, and works well under my makeup or other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> really, This serum is made with 72% certified organic ingredients, and is 98% naturally derived.</li>
            <li> but I think as a serum to add to your regular skin-care routine it proved complimentary.</li>
            <li> Starting to take care of the skin as early as possible is always better.</li>
            <li> and I usually use a full dropper full over my face after the shower.</li>
            <li> After a couple minutes I put on my moisturizer like normal.</li>
            <li> and I can go ahead with my normal skincare routine.  </li>
            <li> I put it on everyday after my shower and I love how my skin feels.</li>
            <li> I did receive this free to test, and I never expected such results!  </li>
            <li> I did not get the irritation I normally get from makeup when it is humid.</li>
            <li> Mimics your body&#x27;s natural oils and absorbs deeply and quickly to moisturize all skin types    </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll finish the bottle but will switch back to the previous one i was using which also had an oilier texture that i liked.</li>
            <li> I have some fine lines and some little showing of wrinkles from expression lines, but it really works on my flaws.</li>
            <li> There is a very slight scent of cloves, but this fades quickly as the product is absorbed.</li>
            <li> I have used other Vitamin C Serums, and this one is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I am still trying this new product.</li>
            <li> I have issues with enlarged pores, some fine lines and wrinkles, and some dark spots that need help.</li>
            <li> The antioxidants of all antioxidants ~ prevents free radical formation, protects the upper skin layer from initial harmful UV radiation and prevents the deterioration of fats in your cell membranes.  </li>
            <li> I only got to use a few times cause my daughter overed on it since she liked the way it worked on her skin.</li>
            <li> i for 1 am very sensitive it would break me out...</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin which cannot tolerate some Vitamin C serums, but this one is fine.&lt;br /&gt;~</li>
            <li> , it does not easily glides, feels more like water, but it has a strong scent, not an unpleasant scent but very strong</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft and glowing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried oils and balms and salves and lotions and creams, all claiming to smooth out the complexion, lighten dark blemishes, and strip away the years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and so far, not only do I enjoy using it but am also amazed on how it&#x27;s transformng my skin to fresher, younger looking!</li>
            <li> process to apply this product is pretty simple.</li>
            <li> : Did you know that the reason that this is stored in a dark bottle rather then the see through bottle is because vitamin C looses its potency when light is exposed to it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that many signs of aging yet, but I would really like to look younger for a long long time.</li>
            <li> and I notice a brightening effect on my face which Im really happy about as I have been struggling with dull and dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> IT SINKS IN QUICKLY.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and almost feel like it tightens up my skin a little.</li>
            <li> The labeling is clear and informative.</li>
            <li> My friend has acne scars and she hopes this will help her clear her</li>
            <li> : I’d clear it for all types.</li>
            <li> It even helped clear up my face.</li>
            <li> No harsh chemical.</li>
            <li> My face is so soft.</li>
            <li> So far i like the serum..its not irrating my skin. ...</li>
            <li> too early to tell what the effects will be on my skin will be tho.</li>
            <li> I also noticed my adult acne diminished when I put this one.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because I have sensitive skin that I am having issues with it.</li>
            <li> This serum contains 72% organic and 98% natural ingredients, with antioxidant vitamin-rich botanicals.      </li>

            <li> Protects and revives your skin with natural healing properties    </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s not doing wonders for the creases around my eyes, I&#x27;m hoping that it is at least helping to prevent more.</li>
            <li> It also makes your face incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li> have used this product for nearly a week now</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive</li>
            <li> I can see the completely result</li>
            <li> I also got it for my 73 year old mother</li>
            <li> is so soft</li>
            <li> so far</li>
            <li> i thought it would be all natural and safer to use some have allergies to the acid and cant use without a breakout...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Elleda&#x27;s Organic Vitamin C 20% Serum, containing 72% organic ingredients and 98% natural.</li>
            <li> After the serum, I layer a heavy cream over a light moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> My face is so clear and soft.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because the ingredients are all natural and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so soft and has lighten some sun spots that I have.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this Organic Vitamin C Serum to anyone who wants to help fade some wrinkles.</li>
            <li> made my skin so soft and</li>
            <li> The hyaluric acid binds with your skins natural moisture</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s 72% Organic, 98% Natural, made in the USA and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> I had never tried a serum like this before, so I was somewhat surprised at the thickness of it.</li>
            <li> One went as far as to say &amp;#34;whatever</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft, but firmer and fuller.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have many but the few that I do have, I have noticed a big difference in appearance.</li>
            <li> It is a nice thin serum which is a welcomed changes from think greasy/oily/dense serums that I tried before.  </li>
            <li> The reviews were so positive that I was skeptical, but this is a wonderful product, and I actually came back and bought a few for friends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great because it is a serum that last at least 2 months and a half day and night use.</li>
            <li> Also a tip wet your face with water first to dampen your skin or wash your face first but don&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li> also love that the very last statement on the directions is  &amp;#34; Always apply with excessive self love&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This type of skincare is in my interest because it&#x27;s more on the natural side, promoting ingredients the earth provides to help repair our skin from harsh environmental factors instead of using products containing ingredients with names unknown to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> started noticing the dark spots getting lighter right away.  </li>
            <li> I also appreciate that Elleda does not use any parabens in their Vitamin C serum and it is made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using it on the back of my hands because I feel like my hands are aging prematurely from being outside in the garden so much.</li>
            <li> I have had no side effects or issues especially around my sensitive areas,  near my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> I have recently tried several serums (retinol, vitamin C, hyaluronic), and find that vitamin C serums have really helped with tone and &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, I use it twice a day and a bottle lasts EASILY over a month, if not two.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have major wrinkles</li>
            <li> Everyone now has major concerns of ageing and want to find something that will help it.</li>
            <li> I am a bit late in reviewing this product since I have been using it for almost a month now and am 100%satisfied with it.no other serum has provided the kind of nourishment to my skin the way this serum has ...</li>
            <li> I am 59 years old and it seems to help the overall appearance of my complexion.</li>
            <li> I only use 1 drop at a time and massage directly to skin.</li>
            <li> The product left my skin feeling soft and supple.</li>
            <li> The serum has a thin consistency and is easily absorbed into the skin, it is also gentle on my sensitive skin and has not caused any redness or breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was expecting a citrus smell but it kind of had a faint clove type smell.</li>
            <li> I have used several different brands but this is going to be one of my new favorites</li>
            <li> WitchHazel ~ an anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial (soothes and heals the skin), astringent (due to the large quantity of tannins), and locks in moisture to your skin.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days in conjunction with other skin-care products and my complexion is getting whiter and more even.</li>
            <li> I have used the vit C a few times and noticed the difference right away.</li>
            <li> I received this C Serum from Elleda a few days ago and started using it right away.</li>
            <li> however I am now in my late 30’s and am starting to form fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have had several blue light and fraxel laser treatments in the past but this works just as well for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> if you are used to odorless to very light serums, you may notice that this one smells a little different, a little like bacon to some people.  </li>
            <li> To deal with this, most people just ignore it and accept the slow advance of old age, however other people turn to lotions to improve their skin and bring it back to life.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is it smells kind of weird.</li>
            <li> Now I know that the word acid may seem scary but this kind of acid wont eat up your skin, it will only help and nourish it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very self-conscious about wearing anything strapless because of all the dark spots on my chest and shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I then heat a compress with hot water, apply it to my face for a few minutes</li>
            <li> I wanted to give it a few months to work first before I wrote anything, so in a nutshell-</li>
            <li> It does dry quick though I will have to give it a plus for that, and also doesn’t feel heavy or greasy against my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin felt much less dry and tight, but it appeared smoother and more supple.</li>
            <li> The product might be a little strong for me because my skin gets red after application and it also burns a little.</li>
            <li> I am developing age spots on my face, and hopefully I will be able to slow down the process if I use Vitamin C serum and moisturizers as regularly as I can.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use very much for it to work, so a little bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> shelf life of this bottle shows that it is good for two years, plenty of time to use your product without it going bad.</li>
            <li> Some time I mix with some other natural oils and apply all over body.</li>
            <li> This particular brand contains vitamin e, which hazel and jojoba oil to name a few.</li>
            <li> Elleda&#x27;s Organic Vitamin C 20% Serum contains a few main ingredients: Vitamin C and E, Aloe, Witch Hazel, Hyaluronic Acid and Jojoba Oil.</li>
            <li> I also suffer from adult acne and this product has helped with taking away the redness and brightening up my dark acne scars.</li>
            <li> and I do mean very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It has nearly cleared up my breakouts using it once per day and the wrinkles on my neck seem to be less noticable.</li>
            <li> It helps a lot not only for wrinkles and scars but also for dry skins.thanks to this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was not obligated to write a review, neither positive nor negative.</li>
            <li> She received Organic Vitamin C Serum a week ago and she already said that she feels her skin feels soft and tight.</li>
            <li> I will say that due to several issues, I do use this serum on my entire face.</li>
            <li> I started using it on my forehead as it was very dry and flaky and this product took the that all away and has left my skin</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s hard to find anything to really make a difference.</li>
            <li> My skin felt a little hot for a few minutes but after that subsided, my skin took on a brighter complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ingredient list has some long names, but don&#x27;t be fooled</li>
            <li> The product was promptly shipped and arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> and I have neglected my skin for too long already.</li>
            <li> This product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure yet how to come to a conclusion about this product seeing as though I haven&#x27;t tested it for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> It actually reminded me of a clove cigarette that my co-worker smokes, minus the tobacco smell.</li>
            <li> The down fall is the bottle is really too small to last longer than a couple weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Which this is generally not the case for me as I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> This serum goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I find it absorbs quickly, so no left over residue or getting all over my clothing and other stuff.</li>
            <li> I takes my skin all dry and itch</li>
            <li> My husband has dry cracked hands and we tried everything to heal them.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> Her skin is mostly dry</li>
            <li> It smells good,but after I use it my skin feels dry.</li>
            <li> I had really dry skin on my hands</li>
            <li> I am hoping it will help with my dry patchy skin around my mouth and nose..</li>
            <li> You only need 3 pumps of this serum to cover your face and neck, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use but a just a few drops so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> My skin has become sensitive to this &amp; cannot wear freely any longer. :(</li>
            <li> it cause ive very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and the Vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> This product made my skin very dry</li>
            <li> A little drying...have to mix with Argan mixed with it when I use it.</li>
            <li> And I had absolutely no issues or unsatisfactory results.</li>
            <li> actually seemed to help lock in moisture beneath the everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been trying this product for a few days, but I&#x27;ve already noticed some benefits.</li>
            <li> this works exactly as expected and described</li>
            <li> My only wish is that they listed the information about how it &amp;#34;Contains a CLINICAL blend that gives you firm, hydrated and supple skin.</li>
            <li> After 3 days, I don&#x27;t notice anything different on my over 50 skin.hopefully in a few weeks I will modify the review to say it works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few days, and the orange-y smell and texture leave my skin smoother</li>
            <li> Only had it for a few days, so I haven&#x27;t seen anything drastic, but I do like the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> how silky this feels when applying however the smell of it isn&#x27;t what I had expected coming from a vitamin C product.</li>
            <li> It makes her skin soft and little by little her dark spots are getting lighter.</li>
            <li> I age, I realize I can reduce the signs somewhat but finding the right product can be difficult.</li>
            <li> It only takes a very small amount to cover your entire face.  </li>
            <li> i had previously used a different organic vitamin C serum and using this one gave me a slight burning sensation when putting it on.  </li>
            <li> Truly, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> There is very little scent to this serum and it can be used with any other product that you&#x27;re currently using for your skin.  </li>
            <li> not a first time user i like</li>
            <li> I have used other vitamin C out there</li>
            <li> For those of you interested, this product is made in the USA and very awesomely not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> I use this serum every other day at night before I put on my night time moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked, and you can see my other reviews to know that I&#x27;m a</li>
            <li> The liquid is not too thin yet not thick either.</li>
            <li> My hands are very dry and have a few sun spots.</li>
            <li> It is a convenient dropper bottle with dark bottle.</li>
            <li> It plums and hydrates my skin and the effects last for at least 48 hours.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a dropper and comes in a dark brown bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She says that her dark spots are getting lighter.</li>
            <li> the dark spot scars becomes lighten.im also worried about having wrinkles as im always stressed at work</li>
            <li> The serum comes in a dark glass bottle with eye dropper.</li>
            <li> That makes it very difficult to get the amount you need if you are using it on the full face.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m slowing down the aging process now after finding it.</li>
            <li> As we age, collagen breaks down and wrinkles appear.</li>
            <li> I gave half of the bottle to my friend and she loves it too.</li>

            <li> I used a few weeks and saw a difference.</li>
            <li> Put a few drops of the serum onto your fingers and massage it in.</li>
            <li> Its sad when your child says your getting old because of your lines around your eyes.  </li>
            <li> In just a few hours I noticed that the discoloration of my skin is visibly reduced and my acne scars are not noticeable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe, but it&#x27;s very bitter smelling.</li>
            <li> This had no strong odor that I could detect.    </li>

            <li> I had acne pretty bad</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty bad</li>
            <li> Elleda sent me their Vitamin C serum to try out so for the past few weeks I have added it to my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> Wash your face and pat it dry, take 2-3 drops of the serum and apply a thin layer on you face, morning and evening.</li>
            <li> I have anxiety and when i am really stressed out i get a really bad rash on my face.</li>
            <li> I have to wear sunscreen though if I use at day time, but I usually don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> used this product continuously morning and night for a few weeks without any breakouts or redness!</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> Ill definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about 2 weeks now and my skin is staying firm and supple!</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to review another skincare product this past month.</li>
            <li> I paid less than $20.00!!</li>
            <li> The serum is on the thinner side so it is hard to apply with a dropper bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to see the change since it does take time and the change is gradual</li>
            <li> Hard to place - smells like cinnamon with undertones of witch hazel.</li>
            <li> -These are common side effects for me</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s and waging a war on wrinkles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late twenties</li>
            <li> My hands feel a lot smoother, and I think the sun spots are slowly fading.</li>
            <li> I just want to put it on thick and often.  </li>
            <li> This product has a thick consistency and you don&#x27;t need a lot of it, just 2-3 drops (maybe a size of a dime).</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past 2 weeks and it has changed the way my skin feels and looks already!</li>
            <li> Use this in very small amount in lines areas on youre face and on ypure neck.</li>
            <li> Bad batch or it simply does not have any effect on me?&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was timely.</li>
            <li> It is a little awkward trying to put the product on your face with a dropper.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a longtime skincare and beauty fan, but I was very late to the &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; game.  </li>
            <li> When the serum is applied to the skin though, it does not feel as thin as it does when it comes out of the dropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It’s thin, but has a gel feel going on.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption:</li>
            <li> and I must say I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> My family also tells me that it smells like a faint medicinal plant (I cannot smell, so I have to take their word for it).</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t shy about telling me the truth.</li>
            <li> so was skeptical to try</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C is enriched with Vitamin E and contains a concentrated base of hyaluronic acid , which helps \\&quot;plump\\&quot; up your skin cells and improves the firmness, tone and evens out the color of your skin.    </li>
            <li> I have got this product base on reviews  .This</li>
            <li> It keeps that awful thing at bay.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use it at night time with my mix of argan oil, hemp seed oil and essential oils for ultimate serum on face. It is a convenient dropper bottle with dark bottle. I gave half of the bottle to my friend and she loves it too. It did not break me out and I feel my skin being nourished and smoother than it used to be. I have to wear sunscreen though if I use at day time, but I usually don&#x27;t. Overall, happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The product is as advertised, delivered promptly, packaged appropriately, and nicely priced.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I am so glad I found it - I cannot tell the difference between this and the &amp;#34;big name&amp;#34; C serums.  My 50+ skin loves it</li>
            <li> *Disclaimer* I was sent this product for free for review purposes. ALL opinions and thoughts are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Vitamin C 20% Serum for 2 weeks now and my skin has never felt better. I&#x27;ve tried many serums and I&#x27;ve got to say that my skin has never felt so soft. My skin also seems to have a glow to it. One unexpected result from using the Vitamin C 20% Serum is that this was surprisingly moisturizing! Which this is generally not the case for me as I have very dry skin. I almost feel like I don&#x27;t need to use a moisturizer. In combination with a moisturizer my skin is perfectly hydrated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downside to this serum is the scent. It&#x27;s hard to describe, but it&#x27;s very bitter smelling. Thankfully, it absorbs pretty quickly and the scent disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so in love with this product. Compared to my other serums this is absolutely the best one that I have tried. I honestly don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing any non Vitamin C serums again in the future!</li>
            <li> not a first time user i like it cause ive very dry skin</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Use it daily.</li>
            <li> I bought this to compliment the microdermabrasion crystals I was using.  I love the way it makes my skin feel.  I have noticed a difference in just a few applications.  My skin looks brighter and healthier.  It only takes a very small amount to cover your entire face.  There is no bad smell either.  I definitely recommend this product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using the serum for a week now and love the way it makes my skin feel.  I am 59 years old and it seems to help the overall appearance of my complexion.</li>
            <li> It is a nice thin serum which is a welcomed changes from think greasy/oily/dense serums that I tried before.  It left my skin nice and smooth and feeling like I just had a facial at a salon. Although a purchased this product through a promotion, I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Love this serum. Comes with dropper for easy amount use each time. I only use 1 drop at a time and massage directly to skin. It soaks in quickly and no residue left. I wear under my make up. Some time I mix with some other natural oils and apply all over body. I think my skin feel smoother and also gives my skin a healing power over acne scar. If use day time, I tend to apply sun screen to protect from sun sensitivity with vit C product. No harsh chemical. Great product!</li>
            <li> I got to try this (free) for my review. And I am so lucky I did! I love it!  My skin is glowing!  I have pretty good skin to begin with. So it&#x27;s hard to find anything to really make a difference. But this does! My face is so soft. And I swear I look younger.  Great product! A must have.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS MORNING AND NIGHT UNDER MY REGULAR MOISTURIZER.  IT SINKS IN QUICKLY.  MY FINE LINES AND WRINKLES ARE GOING AWAY.</li>
            <li> I received ELLEDA Vitamin C Serum two weeks ago as a promotion to try it out and then review it. I have not stopped using it and I absolutely love this product. First off this product is cruelty free, as well as paraben and sulfate free!! And it is made right here in the U.S.A..&lt;br /&gt; I saw and felt a difference in my skin after only three days of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Each night I apply the serum after I wash my face and use toner. I then heat a compress with hot water, apply it to my face for a few minutes and then I put several drops on my fingertips and massage the serum onto my face. It has made my skin firmer and brighter and is almost like I had a face lift! I love the way this feels, it smoothes right into my skin and leaves no oily residue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend Elleda Vitamin C Serum to anyone who has aging skin, and/or age spots.  #elleda</li>
            <li> Elleda sent me their Vitamin C serum to try out so for the past few weeks I have added it to my skin care routine. I&#x27;ve been using it every morning. I love that it absorbs quickly, with two kids, I do not have a lot of time to spend in the bathroom, taking care of my skin. My skin feels so soft and smooth after using this Vitamin C serum. I have noticed that my skin tone looks more even and my freckles are less pronounced. I also appreciate that Elleda does not use any parabens in their Vitamin C serum and it is made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using it on the back of my hands because I feel like my hands are aging prematurely from being outside in the garden so much. My hands are very dry and have a few sun spots.My hands feel a lot smoother, and I think the sun spots are slowly fading. My hands look like they are in their 20s now (how they should look) instead of looking like they are in their 40s or 50s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I do not like is the dropper bottle. The serum is on the thinner side so it is hard to apply with a dropper bottle. When the serum is applied to the skin though, it does not feel as thin as it does when it comes out of the dropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product to facilitate this review. This did not affect my opinions. All opinions are 100% my own. I was not obligated to write a review, neither positive nor negative.</li>
            <li> smells good and easy to use my skin looks better already! - must order another bottle soon! gifts for everyone!</li>
            <li> This product is great because it comes with a neat dropper and its a high grade serum that intensely works to minimize wrinkles when used am and pm I noticed about a 25 percent difference in my forehead lines.I received this as part of a free promotion</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> So far i like the serum..its not irrating my skin. ...too early to tell what the effects will be on my skin will be tho.</li>
            <li> Discounted price.  Great little vitamin C pack!</li>
            <li> I am a bit late in reviewing this product since I have been using it for almost a month now and am 100%satisfied with it.no other serum has provided the kind of nourishment to my skin the way this serum has ... Totally 100%satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s, fair dry, sensitive skin with hyper-pigmentation, sun damage, and light acne scaring (the works!).&lt;br /&gt;I used this product continuously morning and night for a few weeks without any breakouts or redness! -These are common side effects for me so it was a great sign that the Elleda Vitamin C serum didn&#x27;t illicit any of these responses.&lt;br /&gt;My routine went as follows: wash face,  alcohol-free toner, Vitamin C serum, moisturizer, sunblock. And I had absolutely no issues or unsatisfactory results. I have very dry skin and the Vitamin C serum actually seemed to help lock in moisture beneath the everyday moisturizer. My skin also felt softer to the touch after applying it. As far as brightening any hyper-pigmentation, I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference but I think as a serum to add to your regular skin-care routine it proved complimentary. I would definitely recommend it especially at it&#x27;s very affordable price. Thanks Elleda!</li>
            <li> This is a non-oily, fast absorbing serum.  It has ferulic acid in it, so if you are used to odorless to very light serums, you may notice that this one smells a little different, a little like bacon to some people.  Ferulic acid is good for dark spots, so you may see better results than with serums that don&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li> Very good stuff I really love that its not oily at all so it was great on my skin got this product to review so very happy to have gotten this product at a great price.  It has no bad smell to it so thats a big plus go&#x27;s on your face just great and dry fast</li>
            <li> I do not have any wrinkles but wanted to tone my skin. I have used other vitamin C out there and I believe this one make my skin tighter which is what I wanted. I also noticed my adult acne diminished when I put this one. Thank you for the great product.I will but this from now on.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 3 days twice a day and very happy what I have seen already besides my skin feeling so soft and my make up looks flawless! I am posting before and after just 3 days in and will update more as time goes on. #elleda</li>
            <li> This is an awesome Serum. It came well packaged and the build quality is outstanding. I feel results after a few uses. Great day.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. It is easy to apply and has a very light scent to which does not bother me at all. I like how it is a very thin serum and not thick and goopy. This is something I am adding to my morning routine because it leaves me with a refreshing feeling and imporvmeent in my facial skin. I highly recommed this item.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased to get to review this product. I had heard a lot of good things about vitamin C and using it on your skin. I have been applying it every night before bedtime and I can tell you I have seen a huge improvement in my skins appearance. I had acne pretty bad and I can say that my face looks 50% better after using this product.</li>
            <li> I love this vitamin C serum! I started using it on my forehead as it was very dry and flaky and this product took the that all away and has left my skin feel so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this product again. You don&#x27;t have to use but a just a few drops so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week and I must say I am not impressed. I takes my skin all dry and itch and I keep getting a rash on my face from it. I think it&#x27;s because I have sensitive skin that I am having issues with it.</li>
            <li> I am in love with Vitamin C Serum.  If I could buy it by the quart or gallon I would be a very happy consumer.  Truly, a little goes a long way. I just want to put it on thick and often.  Hands and neck and chest need anti-aging help too.  There is a pleasant feeling upon application, it feels &#x27;clean&#x27;.  The benefits are real.  I see a difference.</li>
            <li> This serum is great! It makes my skin so soft and glowing! I love that I can put it on under my makeup and its not oily! The scent was a little off for me, but I just put a drop of lavender or lemon balm essential oils with it and it smells great!</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty bad and so I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a product to improve it. I&#x27;ve tried oils and balms and salves and lotions and creams, all claiming to smooth out the complexion, lighten dark blemishes, and strip away the years. Although skeptical by nature and more or less convinced that most miracle topical restoratives are scams, for the most part, I&#x27;ve been lucky with my cosmetic choices. They&#x27;ve actually worked for me and I&#x27;ve been very happy with my current product regimen. But like car insurance, just because you&#x27;re happy with what you have doesn&#x27;t mean that you shouldn&#x27;t shop around every so often just to see if there&#x27;s something better out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this, had heard good things about it from friends, and was intrigued. It comes in a handsomely styled box with details on purpose, instructions, and ingredients. The bottle is attractive and professional looking with the labeling reiterating the literature found on the box. The bottle also comes with a nifty little squeeze-dropper top. The labeling is clear and informative. The serum feels good, not oily but not too harsh. My family also tells me that it smells like a faint medicinal plant (I cannot smell, so I have to take their word for it). My skin feels a little more vibrant and fresher. Do I look younger? Not sure. I don&#x27;t see much of a noticeable difference yet, but my family says that there is and I trust them. They aren&#x27;t shy about telling me the truth. This also works very well with the rest of the products I use in my &amp;#34;beauty regimen&amp;#34; and has seemed to support and improve their functions also. For those of you interested, this product is made in the USA and very awesomely not tested on animals. Overall, quite happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this for free in exchange for a genuine critique of the product.</li>
            <li> Face feels firm after applying serum</li>
            <li> Blah..nothing special</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been trying this product for a few days, but I&#x27;ve already noticed some benefits. I had a rather large breakout so was skeptical to try but it seems to have cleared it up. I will update this review after I&#x27;ve tried it for a few weeks in order to give a fair review.</li>
            <li> I use this serum every other day at night before I put on my night time moisturizer. It rejuvenates my skin and boosts the collagen exchange. I wake up with fresh and firmer skin. Taking care of my skin became my priority after I turned 28. I don&#x27;t think you should wait until you actually see the wrinkles and fine lines. Starting to take care of the skin as early as possible is always better. I am developing age spots on my face, and hopefully I will be able to slow down the process if I use Vitamin C serum and moisturizers as regularly as I can.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice and light and doesnt irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Ingredients: Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe, Vitamins C &amp; E, MSM, Botanical Hyaluronic Acid, Witch Hazel, Carbomer (2s)-2-Amino-5-guanidinopentanoic Acid, Ferulic Acid, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Jojoba Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin in an amber glass bottle with eye-dropper. Product is processed and packaged in the USA. Product is 72% Organic. Product is cruelty free. It is paraben free. Once opened product is good for 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Product: This product is a gel-like serum. One eye-dropperful is enough for face and neck. There is a very slight scent of cloves, but this fades quickly as the product is absorbed. It goes on easily and is absorbed quickly. Immediately I felt a cooling, soothing sensation. My skin felt much less dry and tight, but it appeared smoother and more supple. With it absorbing so quickly I was able to use it under sunscreen and make-up as soon as it had absorbed. I loved the way it smoothed tiny lines and seemed to refine my pores so they were much less noticeable. The hyaluronic acid adds moisture to my skin and helps it retain that moisture. The ingredients promote collagen production and work as strong antioxidants. The antioxidants work to reduce the damage from environmental factors. Even after cleansing my skin felt smooth. There was a slight exfoliant effect during cleansing that removed the dry patchy skin to help my face look and feel it&#x27;s best. Daily or twice daily use seemed to boost these effects. While your results may not be identical to mine, I recommend this product to restore and repair the damage done from stress and the environment and to provide continuous antioxidant protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can purchase this product on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received one or more of the products mentioned above in exchange for review. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. #elleda</li>
            <li> Excellent products thanks 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟</li>
            <li> This is very nice and makes my skin feel hydrated. I have noticed my skin is a little brighter after use.</li>
            <li> My husband has dry cracked hands and we tried everything to heal them.&lt;br /&gt;We started covering his hands in this vitamin C serum with a plastic bag overnight and there was immediate results in the morning! He has moisture and some of the cracks were beginning to heal.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what is but vitamin C is great at moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Elleda Vitamin C 20% Serum is made with 20% Vitamin C, which helps stimulate collagen to renew skin cell production, which helps reveal younger, more smoother skin, reducing fine lines and wrinkles.  Vitamin C will also help reduce wrinkles and fade hyper-pigmentation from sun damage and acne scars.  It contains eight times the amount of antioxidant protection which will help fight and reduce the skin damage from free radicals.  Elleda Vitamin C serum is a watery serum and you must shake the bottle first as natural ingredients do separate.  The Vitamin C is enriched with Vitamin E and contains a concentrated base of hyaluronic acid , which helps \\&quot;plump\\&quot; up your skin cells and improves the firmness, tone and evens out the color of your skin.    The serum is in a amber glass bottle, which is optimal, as it filters out damaging blue and UV light which in turn will extend the shelf life of the serum.  Glass bottles are very eco-friendly, easier to recycle and does not have any harmful chemicals that can be absorbed into the product.  Elleda Vitamin C serum has a traditional eye dropper applicator as well, so I can control the amount of serum to use.  Elleda Vitamin C 20%  serum absorbs very quickly into my skin and my skin&#x27;s surface is silky and smooth.  This had no strong odor that I could detect.    The ingredient list has some long names, but don&#x27;t be fooled ~ it is just the official botanical name and the ingredient list is quite small, which is nice.  I am also pleased to see that Elleda does not use Sodium Benzoate as a preservative.  There is a lot of controversy over the usage of that ingredient when used with products that have Vitamin C in it, and I am always pleased when a company does not include that in their Vitamin C skincare products.    What is a Serum?  It is important to know what a serum is and what are the expectations of a serum.  Serums are hyper-concentrated skincare products that give the most intense anti-aging ingredients, such as antioxidants, and you do not need a lot of this product to get the full benefits.  Serums are made with smaller molecules than lotions and creams, so they are able to quickly penetrate deeply into the lower layers of your skin, which absorbs the beneficial nutrients to help target the skin concern that the serum is designed to treat.  Serums do not hydrate the top layer of your skin, because they have penetrated deeply into your dermal layer, so you should always follow up with a facial lotion or cream to lock in the serum nutrients, hydrate the top layer of your skin and seal in that moisture.  Elleda Vitamin C 20% Serum is designed to reducing fine lines and wrinkles and improving the skin tone, color, texture and elasticity.    What is in Elleda&#x27;s Vitamin C 20% Serum?  This serum contains 72% organic and 98% natural ingredients, with antioxidant vitamin-rich botanicals.      Vitamin C ~ antioxidant protection from damaging free radicals, lightens hyper-pigmentation, firmer skin by encouraging collagen production.  Stimulates collagen production to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles    Vitamin E ~ The antioxidants of all antioxidants ~ prevents free radical formation, protects the upper skin layer from initial harmful UV radiation and prevents the deterioration of fats in your cell membranes.  Nourishes your skin, leaving it feeling soft and silky    Hyaluronic Acid ~  Hydrates skin cells to freshen your complexion.  It attracts and retains more than thousand times their weight in water    Arginine ~ an essential amino acid, an antioxidant that aids in building collagen    Ferulic Acid~ made from rice brain oil, this is a very potent antioxidant and helps aid other antioxidant ingredients, stabilizes Vitamin C from oxidation    Organic Jojoba Oil ~ a natural emollient that has a similar structure to your own sebum allows this oil to absorb easily into your skin.  Mimics your body&#x27;s natural oils and absorbs deeply and quickly to moisturize all skin types    WitchHazel ~ an anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial (soothes and heals the skin), astringent (due to the large quantity of tannins), and locks in moisture to your skin.  Helps aid a variety of skin conditions, including acne and eczema.

            <li> I really enjoy this product. It makes my skin soft and smooth. I love the texture, the smell isn&#x27;t the best but it isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> Love!!!!  Great product!!!</li>
            <li> Great product with reasilable price! I like it</li>
            <li> I ordered this serum as a sample for review and evaluation and I love it. I have tried a couple others that are similar but this scent is by far my favorite. It has an herbal smell to it that I just love. It comes with a dropper lid and I usually use a full dropper full over my face after the shower. It isn&#x27;t oily or sticky and it absorbs right away. After a couple minutes I put on my moisturizer like normal. It hasn&#x27;t caused me any irritation and it gives my skin a nice health glow. I love that it contains mostly organic and natural ingredients too. Overall I am very happy and I use this every day.</li>
            <li> This product made my skin very dry and I did not notice any improvement. I have used other serums that are much better. I would never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m noticing a significant difference, but I do like it so far.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now and I will probably order again.  Although it&#x27;s not doing wonders for the creases around my eyes, I&#x27;m hoping that it is at least helping to prevent more.</li>
            <li> I think I first read about this product in a magazine and decided to try it.  I wanted to give it a few months to work first before I wrote anything, so in a nutshell- BUY  AS MANY AS YOU CAN AFFORD!  I used the product faithfully for 3 months and can say that my skin tone has brightened, and the dark spots are starting to fade (great for adult acne).  It also makes your face incredibly soft.  I didn&#x27;t notice any reduction in my breakouts, but when I did breakout, pimples shrunk more quickly, and black heads fade more readily.  It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> The product is great! My skin feels hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have made vitamin c serum part of my everyday skin care routine. This particular brand contains vitamin e, which hazel and jojoba oil to name a few. That means that it is very good for nourishing your skin. I mix this into my night time moisturizer so that it can sit on my skin longer. This is also great to use for when I use my derma stamp pen because it is on the thicker end compared to many serums. It plums and hydrates my skin and the effects last for at least 48 hours. I believe this is a great serum that has many uses.&lt;br /&gt;*Product provided complimentary for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li> Works great! I noticed smoother skin texture after the second use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle. I love the quality and price point of this product!</li>
            <li> thanks - this works exactly as expected and described</li>
            <li> A little drying...have to mix with Argan mixed with it when I use it.</li>
            <li> Fighting free radicals and encouraging collagen production become increasingly important in my skincare regiment as I age. So is the quality of my skin care. It is very reassuring to read &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; on the main ingredients in Elleda&#x27;s Vitamin C serum. The Vitamin C potency is high as well. It took me a bit to get used to using the dropper for as I am used to a pump bottle. The serum sinks into my skin and leaves it looking smooth and almost matte, which I liked. Because it doesn&#x27;t sit on top of the skin, I was able to put on my moisturizers, primer and makeup as normal and nothing caked. Very pleased with the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Discount given for review. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s and waging a war on wrinkles so when I was offered this Vitamin C  from Adella for the purpose of  testing and review I was happy to test it out.&lt;br /&gt;It came very quickly, was sealed very well and was undamaged in any way,&lt;br /&gt;It has a dropper and comes in a dark brown bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It does have an odd odor, but not over powering, it also claims to have 8X the anti oxidant protection. If this claim is true the smell is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for nearly a week now and I can tell you I am sold on it. It has dramatically reduced my crows feet.&lt;br /&gt;I also love that the very last statement on the directions is  &amp;#34; Always apply with excessive self love&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a nice product!  Really helps out with the skin.</li>
            <li> I am a lover of serums that help my skin look and feel great to begin with. When given the product at no cost to give my true thoughts, I jumped at the chance to do so. Vitamin C is incredible for the skin anyway but in a serum which is more potent and concentrated mixed with Vitamin E , Jojoba Oil and Hyaluronic Acid. You have a winner on your hands and so far I love what I am experiencing with Elleda&#x27;s Organic Vitamin C 20% Serum.</li>
            <li> This is an update..... When a month had gone by, using this every day, the fine lines were diminished but the dime size age spot on the side of my forehead, was seemingly unchanged. Well after 2 months +/- the age spot is starting to not only change but it appears to be peeling away!!! I am 58 this yr, have had this for 20 years. This was always dark, but now is getting very light.</li>
            <li> The smell was good i really i love the result every morning. Best Vitamin C Serum I have tried , I love the fresh smell for a facial moisturizer because I feel like it helps me to wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> ~ NO parabens, NO alcohol, Made in the USA, Made with Organic Ingredients ~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying out a lot of these serums and this one is just as good or even better than the others. I have extensive sun damage on my face (I cover it up with lots of concealer) as well as on my chest and shoulders.  I&#x27;m very self-conscious about wearing anything strapless because of all the dark spots on my chest and shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started noticing the dark spots getting lighter right away.  I don&#x27;t need to wear as much makeup anymore which is nice.  I&#x27;m not quite ready to wear anything strapless yet but hope to in the coming weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for testing purposes. All of my reviews are honest and unbiased.</li>
            <li> My skin has become sensitive to this &amp; cannot wear freely any longer. :(</li>
            <li> Great product! Very pleased with results!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Organic Vitamin C 20% Serum for three nights and two days. I feel as if I can already see and feel a difference in my skin. It is definitely noticeable. The best part: it is as easy as wash your face, pat it dry, and apply the Elleda Vitamin C 20% Serum! Then simply add your favorite moisturizer or makeup. Two giant things I love; It&#x27;s made in the freaking USofA and it&#x27;s not tested on animals. My only wish is that they listed the information about how it &amp;#34;Contains a CLINICAL blend that gives you firm, hydrated and supple skin. Our formula is blended with plant derived powerful moisture-binding ingredients that keep skin plump and hydrated. The Serum includes Aloe and Jojoba - making it a flawless hydrator and the preferred natural moisturizer for dry skin.&amp;#34; on the packaging. I would definitely recommend this serum to friends and family!</li>
            <li> So far so good! Nice product. No complaints!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost two weeks now. It&#x27;s been amazing! I&#x27;ve had constant breakouts on my neck and jaw line for months. Nothing has helped...until I started using this serum! It has nearly cleared up my breakouts using it once per day and the wrinkles on my neck seem to be less noticable. I&#x27;m excited to keep using this vitamin c serum to see how it can enhance my skin even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product for free for review though BuView.com. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> My skin loves this serum.  I apply it right out of the shower when my skin is still warm.  It absorbs well and dries quickly and I can go ahead with my normal skincare routine.  I also recently started putting it on my nails, I read somewhere it will strengthen my nails.  It comes with a dropper so I have more control over how much I use.  It doesn&#x27;t take much.  There is very little scent to this serum and it can be used with any other product that you&#x27;re currently using for your skin.  I was able to get this serum for free so I could test it out and offer my honest and unbiased opinions.  I don&#x27;t have any complaints, so far so good.  My skin feels soft, smooth and &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve been getting compliments.  I love compliments.</li>
            <li> love the product, it leaves my skin very smooth and soft, and the little lines around the eyes are starting to fade. I been using it for less than a month and people are already complimenting on my skin. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the quality  of this Hyaluroic acid serum. This is my first ever purchase from ELLEDA skin care. I am sure if will not be the last. I am always interested in skin care products that use mostly, or all , natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Hyaluroic acid for several months now. It has become part of my routine, which used to be moisturizer only. Now I apply vitamin C serum  before moisturizing. My skin has never looked better without makeup. I have mild Rosacea, and while it is not gone it is definitely &#x27;calmed&#x27; with vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum has no discernible smell too it. It absorbs quickly; I apply my moisturizer right over it almost immediately.  I have had no side effects or issues especially around my sensitive areas,  near my eyes and mouth. I was given the opportunity to try and test this product - highly recommend based on quality and performance.</li>
            <li> Works great, no smell. Seems like it would be greasy but absorbs quickly and no residue. Comes in an eye-dropper type dispenser. A little goes a long way, I use it twice a day and a bottle lasts EASILY over a month, if not two.</li>
            <li> Liked the way it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li> The Organic vitamin C serum was delivered nicely sealed and packaged, and as described on product page.  We purchased this serum in a promotion for testing and review.  We found the serum can increase collagen cell formation and help you get younger and smoother looking skin.  It also can protect skin from harmful UV rays.  I especially love this brand because it is Organic, and natural</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It feels refreshing on my face. I like the way my skin feels and looks since I&#x27;ve been using it. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Smelled funny and made me break out. Maybe I got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> ( I was given this product for free and this is my own honest opinion )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you get older, at first you might not notice the changes in your skin but soon it will show all over. To deal with this, most people just ignore it and accept the slow advance of old age, however other people turn to lotions to improve their skin and bring it back to life. The problem with this is that the lotions most people use doesn’t really do anything. I felt this way to be honest until I tried Elleda’s Organic Vitamin C 20% Serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elleda’s Organic Vitamin C 20% Serum is simple enough to use but the results are stunning to behold. By simply applying to your face, within 20 minutes you will start to feel the effects of the serum working and you will see a noticeable change in the areas you applied. It took only one try with Elleda’s Organic Vitamin C 20% Serum for me to be a believer. As always, it is up to you to try out their product and see for yourself. To me, I can say that Elleda’s Organic Vitamin C 20% Serum works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highyly recommend Elleda’s Organic Vitamin C 20% Serum.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for maybe three days now, it has made my skin softer and also not so blotchy. The only downfall is it smells kind of weird. So I only use maybe 3 or 4 drops in my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was using Obagi vitamin c 20% serum and thought I could save some money with this product. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!  I don&#x27;t feel the tingle that I did with Obagi. This product is like water. It&#x27;s garbage!</li>
            <li> I have used many vitamin c products before to deal with pimples. This product works well and helped to eleviate redness and swelling</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife who is 72 years young and live in Florida where the summer temps get really hot at times. She has many facial wrinkles and brown spots. She received Organic Vitamin C Serum a week ago and she already said that she feels her skin feels soft and tight. It&#x27;s not greasy and smell nice. She has been using it every morning and night. She says that her dark spots are getting lighter.</li>
            <li> My skin is acne-prone yet also dry, and this is one of the first serums I have tried that I have actually liked, rather than just was okay with. After a few uses, my skin began to look dewy and healthy, but it did not break me out (and even seemed to lighten some scarring and stuff), so I will most likely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I hope this works. After 3 days, I don&#x27;t notice anything different on my over 50 skin.hopefully in a few weeks I will modify the review to say it works.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m slightly leary since many got free samples whereas I paid.</li>
            <li> The reviews were so positive that I was skeptical, but this is a wonderful product, and I actually came back and bought a few for friends. The customer service is excellent.  My question was answered in minutes by the owner.  I have only used this a few days, and the orange-y smell and texture leave my skin smoother and my skin feels tighter.  I&#x27;m hooked, and you can see my other reviews to know that I&#x27;m a real human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Weeks later, I am loving this and so are my friends--I decided to stock up and ordered even more--this is not like me, but I actually wanted my mother and sister to try it. It definitely tightens my skin so it feels like I&#x27;ve just washed off a clay mask--soft, smooth, clean and clear. Everyone I bought it for wants more.</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells good. Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling too oily. Haven&#x27;t noticed immediate results but my skin seems brighter since using it</li>
            <li> It does what it says it will do. I have some fine lines and some little showing of wrinkles from expression lines, but it really works on my flaws.</li>
            <li> I have got this product base on reviews  .This product itself is so good, I like the texture ( happy it is not oily) it absorbs so quickly and you can notice results after a few days. I highly recommended to others.</li>
            <li> I am still trying this new product. working great and will share the results when I use it more often.</li>
            <li> Just got this today and I already love it! It smells wonderful and it makes my skin so soft! I will be buying again &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive so I&#x27;m always doing research before using any facial product .So far it is safe haven&#x27;t feel any irratation.&lt;br /&gt;I loved it as it is an organic product and doesn&#x27;t have strong chemical ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I used this for my acne scars and&lt;br /&gt;After using a couple of days I can see the completely result the dark spot scars becomes lighten.im also worried about having wrinkles as im always stressed at work so I really needed this,it is very helpful as it does tighten skin to prevent wrinkles.It helps a lot not only for wrinkles and scars but also for dry skins.thanks to this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would lovely recommend this to friends and anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided in review purposes.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look healthier and younger looking. Love this product, will be ordering some more.</li>
            <li> I liked how this stuff works it is exactly as it states good product</li>
            <li> Great Serum!! I can already notice a difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance!!  I will continue to use and cant wait to see more results! The benefits of this serum are great!! Highly recommended!!    **received product free to test and review, My opinions are my own&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> seems to work very well, happy with the ingredients. The product was promptly shipped and arrived earlier than expected. Good price as well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these vitamin c serums that i am always blabbing about them. So most of my family members and friends want to try them. I gave this one to my friend because she loved the results that i was having. I have anxiety and when i am really stressed out i get a really bad rash on my face. So when i use this stuff on a daily basis it is almost like magic. It keeps that awful thing at bay. My friend has acne scars and she hopes this will help her clear her scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: She has been using this for a few weeks and she can already start to see a change in her skin. Her skin is mostly dry and she has noticed that her skin seems to be more moisturized than before. Her scars are still there but they seem to be healing.</li>
            <li> MAKES SKIN FEEL SO MUCH BETTER AND LOOK HEALTHEIR</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used a serum like this before, but thought I would give it a go. Only had it for a few days, so I haven&#x27;t seen anything drastic, but I do like the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. With regular use you&#x27;ll see fine lines disappear, an evening of skin tone, and sun damaged skin much improved. Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it has helped me with the scars on my hands. I have some wrinkles and breaks due to some irritations and this was pretty nice. Only time can tell though, I&#x27;ll have to leave a more detailed review after using it for a while. :)</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product bec</li>
            <li> I order 2C,I well get 1 gift it ,is 3C !!why I jest get 2C ??why. Why</li>
            <li> I personally love this vitamin C product. I have tried others but I feel like this one particularly reduces my fine lines. It goes on smooth and almost feel like it tightens up my skin a little. I use it morning and night under my facial cream. I also got it for my 73 year old mother and I think she is looking fabulous!</li>
            <li> it was okay.  it wasn&#x27;t free.</li>
            <li> I got this Item on a promotional price&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love serums especially the organic ones. As find them less harmful on my skin and what I like about this product is that its not even sticky at all and I notice a brightening effect on my face which Im really happy about as I have been struggling with dull and dark spots on my face. I am truly in love with this product. I higly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Product has an obvious plumping effect. I use it primarily for the smile line around my mouth. I also noticed that my complexion lightens because of the vitamin C in the product. Happy about it so far.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product at a reduced price to try and give my review of the product to the company who sells it. My skin feels very smooth and hydrated. I put it on everyday after my shower and I love how my skin feels. Great product</li>
            <li> good product very happy</li>
            <li> Love it! Very good quality product.  Ill definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> i had previously used a different organic vitamin C serum and using this one gave me a slight burning sensation when putting it on.  i&#x27;ll finish the bottle but will switch back to the previous one i was using which also had an oilier texture that i liked.</li>
            <li> I have used other Vitamin C Serums, and this one is fantastic. I have noticed a difference in how my face and hands look, and my skin appears to be healthier. The added bonus to this product, when one considers that the skin is largest organ in the body, capable of absorbing large amounts of toxins and chemicals, having an organic solution such as this is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Great seller. I love their high quality products and their prices.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about 2 weeks now and my skin is staying firm and supple! I love the light scent of it! The dropper makes dispensing the serum easy and non-messy. I love the effects this Organic Vitamin C Serum gives without any stickiness!!</li>
            <li> Great serum here, its just Vitamin C so it works great on your skin as is, or add it into some facial product, sunscreen, BB cream, and so on. It&#x27;s a oil, so you don&#x27;t need to much and will spread around easy. Soaks in fast and leaves skin feeling smooth. Great for people who hate drinking milk, or taking pills. Has helped my bruises not happen so much, since I lack calcium from not drinking milk. I used this up in about 2 months and totally noticed it helping my skin after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I have to tell you, I LOVE this serum already. I am so glad I finally decided to take care of my skin. I just turned 25 and I have neglected my skin for too long already. I love this organic vitamin c serum. I feel like I&#x27;m slowing down the aging process now after finding it. I do not like the smell of it, but as soon as it is absorbed and you put your makeup on it goes away. My face and neck feel a lot softer than before after using for a couple weeks in the morning and before I go to bed. I respect the fact that it is not tested on animals as well. I am using all organic makeup as well and they go hand in hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m very happy with the Organic Vitamin C serum. I definitely recommend and would purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;**This product was received either at no or low cost for review, inspection and testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one for changing up my skin routine, but I&#x27;d been looking to make a change and incorporate a Vitamin C serum and decided to give Elleda&#x27;s product a shot. So glad that I did so. Even though it&#x27;s only been three full days, the combination of this and a drop or so of Rosehip Oil has really made a change. My skin feels nourished and healthy. You may consider me a happy and well contented customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I received no compensation or discount for my review.</li>
            <li> The Organic Vitamin C Serum gives firmer, hydrated and supple skin. Aloe, vitamin E and jojoba oil makes the skin flawless, hydrates and are natural moisturizer for dry skin. The serum is made in fresh batches and is only effective when used fresh. The serum helps reduce wrinkles and the diminished appearance of sun spots and acne scars. Wash your face and pat it dry, take 2-3 drops of the serum and apply a thin layer on you face, morning and evening. Let the serum get absorbed into the skin, then apply moisturizer and always wear a sunscreen. The serum is paraben and sulphate free; and not tested on animals. Works on all skin types!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great because it is a serum that last at least 2 months and a half day and night use. It&#x27;s organic which is a plus because it doesn&#x27;t use harsh chemicals for the skin. Your skin will love the vitamin c</li>
            <li> I got this product few days ago, and I was impressed with the results!!! There is no lie about  what this amazing serum.&lt;br /&gt;It works for me. I always thought that, the more money you pay for a product the better it is, that could be true,  but not in this case..I paid less than $20.00!! and the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum on the backs of my hands and around my nails.  I&#x27;m in my late twenties but my hands appear much older than that, since I&#x27;ve worked with them all my life, and gone though weight loss.  It&#x27;s helped dramatically reduce the appearance of wrinkles and puffiness.  I&#x27;m not one to use lotions/creams or any kind of that stuff because I can&#x27;t take the odor.  This serum actually smells pleasant because it&#x27;s natural, so I have no problem using it.  I don&#x27;t use it on my face, but that might possibly change in the future.  You don&#x27;t have to use very much for it to work, so a little bottle lasts a long time.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now, and the results are pretty speedy; I&#x27;m only about halfway through a bottle.  I did receive this free to test, and I never expected such results!  I am very happy I decided to give this a chance.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C 20% serum is delightful. Cleanse your face, put 2 to 3 drops in your hand and smooth over your face using upward swipes. Then let the serum soak into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have major wrinkles but I do have crows feet that I would like to make disappear. The product left my skin feeling soft and supple. I will continue use and leave follow feedback on the efficacy of the product after I have had a chance to use it over a prolonged period of time.</li>
            <li> All I can say is...I just love it. Great for the body, fantastic on neck and awesome for the face! Sat..bye,bye to dull dry lack luster skin , and say hey there to vibrant glowing hydrated even toned beautiful healthy skin!!! I love this seller!!! Great price. Fast, and I do mean very fast delivery. Packaged well, full bottle no leaks, everything jus perfect. I will continue to buy from this seller.q</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is a must. Start at any age and reap the benefits. This product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love using this Vitamin C serum. It isn&#x27;t greasy. It gets absorbed quickly and there have not been any side effects. It&#x27;s hard to see the change since it does take time and the change is gradual I would need to have a before and after picture. But it&#x27;s always good knowing that I can use something as natural as possible to rejuvenate and restore my skin. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Love my Vitamin C Serum.  This serum is the right consistency &amp; I smell no odor.  It doesn&#x27;t sting or make your eyes water!  My skin soaks it up.  Not sticky or oily.  I received this Vitamin C Serum at reduced price for an honest opinion. Thank You!</li>
            <li> Everyone should try this..This serum goes a long way! Use this in very small amount in lines areas on youre face and on ypure neck. My preference is entire face/neck.beside this organic no bad reaction reaction for Me but great tesult.. rejuvenate my skin this great deal for a price.i will continue applying this to maintain my youth and vitality.. I got this under promotional item with my Honest review and own opinion</li>
            <li> I was very happy to be selected to participate in a review of this product, I got it free in exchange of my opinion, my first impression as I received it well packaged and sealed was that of trust, not only was it an organic product but it is also made in the USA, never tested on animals and made on an FDA approved facility, I was also happy to see it was paraben and sulfate free, I opened the sealed dropper bottle and applied it to my face, it feels very liquid in comparison to other similar products I&#x27;ve used, it does not easily glides, feels more like water, but it has a strong scent, not an unpleasant scent but very strong, it kind off put me off a little, maybe it is coming from the witch hazel, it absorbed fast and hopefully make me look younger 😜</li>
            <li> This is a great organic product. Paraben and sulfate free and made in the usa. All of those things made me excited about trying this product. I couldn&#x27;t have been more happy that I ordered this. Wonderful for reducing fine lines and wrinkles. I don&#x27;t have many but the few that I do have, I have noticed a big difference in appearance. My skin glows when I use this. Vitamin C is one of the best things you can use on your face. I was given this product as a free sample to try to get my honest opinion. All thoughts expressed are of my personal usage of the product.</li>
            <li> I only gave it a 4 star because I think I need to use it longer to see if there is a visible difference in my skin.  I do like the way my skin absorbs the serum.</li>
            <li> The box was open when I received my package. It smells good,but after I use it my skin feels dry. Maybe because I just start to use it my skin is not used to this serum yet,I will continue to use it. After I use it for a while my skin becomes smoother and healthier. You just need to continue using it then you will find the difference.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! Non greasy. Smooth. Skins absorbs quickly. Originally purchased this for a gift and ended up keeping it for myself.  I am only on day two and I cannot get enough of this. I love the way my skin feels. I use this product morning and evening.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way. No need to pour a ton on your face.&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;I use the leftovers on my hands and they also feel better already.&lt;br /&gt;It is very pleasing and I would highly recommend. .</li>
            <li> I do buy two bottles one for me and one for my daughter , my daughter has been telling me for month s how great this for your skin , And she was right Ihave only been using this for about a week and I have noticed a smoothness to my face and neck t is so soft , now I have not notice any signs of fine lines leaving but it has only been a week , I do like like these  product  so far and I would get again just for the smooth skin in fact I want to get some for my sister who cares more about her skin then I DID ,</li>
            <li> This is a great price for an organic Vit C serum.&lt;br /&gt;This one from Elleda is a light serum with a nice light scent --not overpowered or harsh.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs into the skin quickly and leaves me skin feeling smooth and soft --not sticky or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it after you wash and tone your face, but before your moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to try a Vit C serum, I highly recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made in the USA, not tested on animals, no parabens and sulfate free.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good for reducing fine lines and brightening your skin over all, among other things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product to try for free. I was not required to write a review but I chose to anyway :)</li>
            <li> Elleda Vitamin C worked wonderfully for me. I applied before makeup and it really protected my skin. I did not get the irritation I normally get from makeup when it is humid. And I really enjoyed the apothecary look as well as dropper for easy application. And my skin looked more vibrant after a few days of usage. And it is not tested on animals, paraben and sulfate free. I will be purchasing and encourage you to try it and see the difference.</li>
            <li> Everyone now has major concerns of ageing and want to find something that will help it. This stuff does the trick. It makes your face feel tighter and not as droopy like. This is easy to use and apply. Just put a small amount on and it will spread nicely absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling greasy or oily afterwards. It makes your face feel soft and smooth. It helps with fine lines wrinkles and even helped clear up acne and heal acne scars I have. It has evened out my complexion and gives my face a healthy glow. I am so happy I received this as a gift to share my experiences of using it with everyone.</li>
            <li> Organic Vitamin C 20% Serum hydrates my skin and gives it a smooth complexion. PARABEN AND SULFATE FREE, NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS, MADE IN THE USA are ALL Bonuses in my book!</li>
            <li> My face has more clarity since using the Vitamin Serum!  Soaks into skin quickly!</li>
            <li> I have used tea vitamin c oil for several years and it is a huge help. This bottle is a lot bigger than what I expected and it was packaged nice when I received it in the mail. I have used several different brands but this is going to be one of my new favorites</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still giving it a chance; I think I&#x27;m seeing a difference. I am putting moisturizer on after. I do notice my skin looks better but really want to give it more time.  Thank you for your product; price is sooo reasonable. I will be purchasing it again I&#x27;m sure. I will let you know how I do with it as time goes on. Caron</li>
            <li> Love how my skin glows after using this. I use a few drops on my face around my eyes and mouth after my shower and after using my clarsonic. My skin looks healthy.</li>
            <li> Love! This oil is so moisturizing and does not leave an oily reside!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:45b22795ebeed0ba4e2e44a2d1afe1ed]] I was extremely impressed with this serum- top notch, noticeable results. While I did receive the product to review, I will only be completely honest in my reviews! #elleda</li>
            <li> This has cleared up my skin. After using it I can see that my skin can adhere to the makeup better and it looks better and more alive. I realize how important a skin care regime is. You have to use product eating healthy and exercise alone were not enough. #elleda</li>
            <li> I really like the Elleda organic vitamin C serum. When I use it, it makes my face smooth, clearer and healthy looking. This has helped my face to not be so oily. It is quite moisturizing. I also suffer from adult acne and this product has helped with taking away the redness and brightening up my dark acne scars. Always apply this after you have washed your face and the key to optimal results is to use it in the morning and at night. This works great in conjunction with a hyaluronic acid serum, which you would put on your face after you have put on this vitamin c serum. You only need 3 pumps of this serum to cover your face and neck, so a little goes a long way. This is an excellent product. I received this product at a discounted price so that I may give you all my honest and unbiased opinion. I highly recommend it to you all, my family, and friends.</li>
            <li> Have you looked at the ingredients in all the top of the line facial creams and serums? We&#x27;ll let me save you the time they all contain vitamin C. Vitamin C has so many benefits to the skin, it fights free radicals, it restores skin will make old acne scars disappear, it acts as an antioxidant, I makes skin firm by producing collagen, it also protects your skin from the harmful rays of the sun you will still need sunscreen but combining the two are perfect before being exposed to the sun to help protect your skin. This dparticular vitamin C serum is so great because it has 20% concentration which is the recommended dosage. Also a tip wet your face with water first to dampen your skin or wash your face first but don&#x27;t dry, next apply your serum, then apply your moisturizer with sunscreen would be best.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have been using it for the past 2 weeks and it has changed the way my skin feels and looks already!</li>
            <li> This product makes your skin much more softer than it already was. I used a few weeks and saw a difference. I would definitely want to continue to use it and I would recommend it to anyone who wants softer, smoother, healthy skin. I started using mines the day after i received it. In the morning after I wash, I would massage the serum on my hands and let it absorb in. I repeated this at night as well. When you use the Serum you don&#x27;t need much since it&#x27;s oily, so you would just rub it into the skin area you chose and massage it, don&#x27;t just rub it or you will look greasy and nobody wants that. #elleda</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m turning 31 soon, so I decided that it&#x27;s high time I start taking a much better care of my skin. I don&#x27;t have that many signs of aging yet, but I would really like to look younger for a long long time. Most women are afraid of getting wrinkles and saggy skin, so this serum is a great way to take care of your face and neck. This product has a thick consistency and you don&#x27;t need a lot of it, just 2-3 drops (maybe a size of a dime). It gets absorbed by the skin really fast. I have only been using this product for a few days in conjunction with other skin-care products and my complexion is getting whiter and more even. I can also feel it tightening. I&#x27;m very glad I got a sample of this product for testing and reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel great. I had really dry skin on my hands so I figured I would put it to the test. I have been using Honest Company healing balm with no luck. I have used the vit C a few times and noticed the difference right away. The down fall is the bottle is really too small to last longer than a couple weeks of use. I have started using it with my lotion and mixing the two to make it last longer. But I do like the way my skin feels, will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and so far, not only do I enjoy using it but am also amazed on how it&#x27;s transformng my skin to fresher, younger looking! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Received this product from the company to review it and tried it immediately upon receipt. I love it!! Would definitely purchase again at full price!</li>
            <li> I liked the serum. My face was very smooth to the touch. Just didn&#x27;t notice all lot of difference when I did not use it.</li>
            <li> A bit watery, but I did see a difference.  Only wish the solution was thicker so it last longer.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, you can see that it works in just a few applications. I will being using it from now on and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd time using it...but I was pleased that my face didn&#x27;t break out. I am hoping it will help with my dry patchy skin around my mouth and nose..I will know more within a week.  I just wish the bottle was bigger.</li>
            <li> Great face serum that doesn&#x27;t damage or hurt or cause a reaction on my sensitive skin! Highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Received this item for testing and review purposes!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I gifted this to my mom. And she loves it. She has already repurchased this product. It makes her skin soft and little by little her dark spots are getting lighter.</li>
            <li> this Vit C serum is a smooth applying serum. It absorbs quickly and is a great addition to your skin case. It will help improve the quality of your skin. I personally think serums are an essential part of my skin regimen. There is no scent and it does not cause any irritation to the skin. You will have to moisturize after as it is not a moisturizer, but is a great step prior to your moisturizer. I like that it has a dropper and I use about 3-4 drops day and night. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts or opinions.</li>
            <li> This made my face feel refreshed and smooth, made some of my blemishes lighten even go away. I only got to use a few times cause my daughter overed on it since she liked the way it worked on her skin.</li>
            <li> This serum is ok i dont like the acid it contains i thought it would be all natural and safer to use some have allergies to the acid and cant use without a breakout... i for 1 am very sensitive it would break me out...</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to review another skincare product this past month. It&#x27;s Elleda&#x27;s Organic Vitamin C 20% Serum, containing 72% organic ingredients and 98% natural. This type of skincare is in my interest because it&#x27;s more on the natural side, promoting ingredients the earth provides to help repair our skin from harsh environmental factors instead of using products containing ingredients with names unknown to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Elleda&#x27;s Organic Vitamin C 20% Serum contains a few main ingredients: Vitamin C and E, Aloe, Witch Hazel, Hyaluronic Acid and Jojoba Oil. The Vitamin C aids in the production of collagen, a protein in our skin that connects cells. As we age, collagen breaks down and wrinkles appear. Vitamin E nourishes the skin along with the aloe and jojoba oil. The Hyaluronic Acid aids in retaining water (moisture) in our skin, keeping it looking and feeling revived and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve used this product for a little over two weeks. I apply it day and night, following a skin cleansing routine but before my daily moisturizer of coconut oil. After using this product for two days, I noticed an immediate change. My skin felt a little hot for a few minutes but after that subsided, my skin took on a brighter complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m unsure yet how to come to a conclusion about this product seeing as though I haven&#x27;t tested it for a long period of time. I do, however, love the way my skin appears and feels. I plan to continue using this product. If you&#x27;d like to learn more about Elleda&#x27;s Organic Vitamin C 20% Serum, go here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bridget</li>
            <li> NIce lightweight Vit. C serum......I bought one bottler and then bought three more. A great bargain!</li>
            <li> I got this a few days days ago, I&#x27;m already seeing great results. My skin is so smooth and just look fresh! I find it absorbs quickly, so no left over residue or getting all over my clothing and other stuff. Which is a big plus. Honestly, very much worth it. Great product for smoother healthier looking skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a month now and I can definitely see that it has helped lighten the brown spots on my face caused by years of sun exposure in my youth.  This is the only Vitamin-C serum that I have found to make a noticeable difference.  I have had several blue light and fraxel laser treatments in the past but this works just as well for a fraction of the cost.  I will definitely continue to reorder this product!</li>
            <li> Perfect serum that I got in my whole life. And I&#x27;m asian I love asian..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a longtime skincare and beauty fan, but I was very late to the &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; game.  I have recently tried several serums (retinol, vitamin C, hyaluronic), and find that vitamin C serums have really helped with tone and &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.  There are a lot of good ingredients- many of them organic- and this is packaged in an amber glass bottle with an included dropper for precise dispensing.  My only issue is that this product is looser than I prefer.  It&#x27;s just about the consistency of water.  This means that more comes out of the dropper than I sometimes intend, but it&#x27;s not a deal-breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use, I wash my face, then apply toner, then apply this serum while my face is still damp.  After the serum, I layer a heavy cream over a light moisturizer.  If I&#x27;m wearing makeup, I do just the light moisturizer and then my makeup routine (starting with a primer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS: organic herbal infusion ,organic aloe barbedensis,leaf extract, sodium ascorbyl phosphate (vitamin c )methylsulfonylmethane cassia angustifolia seed polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronicacid) hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel) d-alpha tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e) carbomer(2s)-2-amino-5-guanidinopentanoic acid ferulic acid kosher vegetable glycerin organic simmondsia chinensis (jojoba oil) phenoxyethanol ethyl hexyl glycerin</li>
            <li> My face is so clear and soft. Bright. I love this vitamin c. Smells great and light. I will buy again. I did receive for review</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 days now and almost immediately I felt a difference in my skin. I have used the serum on my face nightly and my skin feels increasing more smooth and tighter. I purchased this product because the ingredients are all natural and not tested on animals. Shipping was fast and arrived in safe packaging.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this Vitamin C Serum. I won&#x27;t go through the entire list of benefits for the serum. If you are reading this review then you probably already know what this serum can do and how to use it. I will say that due to several issues, I do use this serum on my entire face. I have issues with enlarged pores, some fine lines and wrinkles, and some dark spots that need help. It is just easier to use it on the full face. That being said, here&#x27;s why I love this serum by Elleda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a dropper! No seriously that&#x27;s it. Most of the serums come with a pump of some kind. That makes it very difficult to get the amount you need if you are using it on the full face. With the dropper I&#x27;m able to get the amount I need and apply it easily without spending a ton of time pumping out little bitty amounts of serum. There are also no air bubbles. The pumps tend to give you more air than serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you need a serum for a full face treatment then this is the brand to go with. They know how to deliver on what you need and give you the product in the easiest way to use it and reap the benefits.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see  or feel any difference on my skin after 3 weeks of use. Will give it more time though. Bad batch or it simply does not have any effect on me?&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was timely. Packaging was nice.</li>
            <li> Product for review: I love this stuff. Your face feels great after use.</li>
            <li> I been using the vitamin C only 3 weeks ago, so far I liked the results. I really recommended protects the skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this serum! It smells so good! It has a light floral scent sort of like roses. I like that it has a dropper so it&#x27;s very convenient to use. It leaves my skin so soft and has lighten some sun spots that I have. I was video chatting with my sister and she told me I looked like I was glowing. I use the serum every night before bed. I did receive it to review but I would definitely recommend it to others</li>
            <li> Love this product and for a great price!</li>
            <li> Diminished the dark circles under my eyes in just a few days, and makes my skin feel tight within minutes of use.</li>
            <li> The product might be a little strong for me because my skin gets red after application and it also burns a little. It also is pretty strong smelling which can be a big trigger for migraines for me. The product packaging is sturdy and attractive and it seems to be a good quality so i still feel like it deserves 4 stars....but for those with sensitive skin and/or are sensitive to heavy smells, this may not be the product for you.</li>
            <li> I love it.. make massive difference on my skin.  it makes make skin baby skin.. i use twice daily in the morning and in the night before i go bed. I love it. It does the job got massive discount on this product.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Would recommend.  Does not sting or irritate.  Great price</li>
            <li> Great product.  Definitely will order more.</li>
            <li> I really like Vitamin C Serum so when I was offered this Organic Vitamin C Serum for a great deal, to try and share my honest opinion about it, I ordered immediately. The more organic products I use, the better for my body. I received this C Serum from Elleda a few days ago and started using it right away. I use the C Serum specifically on my forehead because I was born with these wrinkles on my forehead and they are beginning to be more apparent. In just the few days of using it, my lines have become a little less noticeable. Trust me, they are there and ALWAYS will be, but when I don&#x27;t have any expression on my face, I shouldn&#x27;t have to see these wrinkles. I definitely recommend this Organic Vitamin C Serum to anyone who wants to help fade some wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is one of my favorite things for skincare. It truly makes a difference in the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; of my skin. Elleda&#x27;s serum is a pretty good one and I&#x27;m happy it has a decent amount of Vitamin C (20%). The serum comes in a dark glass bottle with eye dropper. The liquid is not too thin yet not thick either. It definitely is thicker than water though which I like because I need control over where I place products. I do notice a very faint scent of citrus like most vitamin c serums although it&#x27;s so faint you won&#x27;t really notice unless looking for it. I do love how it feels on the skin. It absorbs very quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue, and works well under my makeup or other moisturizers. This is a very light serum and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin at all. My skin does feel smoother in the areas where I put this on almost right away which is nice. I was able to receive a promotional product although my thoughts and opinions are always completely my own and unbiased.</li>
            <li> I know this is for your face but I dap a little under and around my eyes and I&#x27;m seeing a difference, it&#x27;s working for not only smoothing out fine lines but plumping your skin. My face feels smooth and soft I love this feel!</li>
            <li> How do you compare the hundreds of skin care products? I&#x27;m a regular tester, so I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations. I hope these help you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Fragrance: Hard to place - smells like cinnamon with undertones of witch hazel. No added fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: Slippery and moist. It’s thin, but has a gel feel going on.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption: Smooth, soft.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: I’d clear it for all types. Not oily or drying. I have very sensitive skin which cannot tolerate some Vitamin C serums, but this one is fine.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: No.&lt;br /&gt;~ Packaging: Amber glass bottle with glass squeeze dropper.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* Skin is visibly smoother and there is a noticeable reduction in depth of fine wrinkles. This is what got it its five-star rating.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid are the mainstays of this serum. These will both help your skin long-term. I would say this tilts towards the cosmetic and recommend it for immediate results, but would suggest finding something to use with it that contains more active ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li> LOVE vitamin C serum!&lt;br /&gt;This made my skin so soft and supple!&lt;br /&gt;No residue at all!</li>
            <li> This serum is great. Love it</li>
            <li> Great product have noticed a differance in no time</li>
            <li> #elleda Organic Vitamin C 20% Serum helps improve your skin’s elasticity and help prevent skin dehydration. The serum is 20% concentration making the Vitamin C is maximized so it will do its job faster. Now I know that the word acid may seem scary but this kind of acid wont eat up your skin, it will only help and nourish it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process to apply this product is pretty simple. Just make sure you are working with clean dry skin. Put a few drops of the serum onto your fingers and massage it in. I am excited to start using this to help minimize the fine lines that are starting to come with my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how silky this feels when applying however the smell of it isn&#x27;t what I had expected coming from a vitamin C product. I was expecting a citrus smell but it kind of had a faint clove type smell. It actually reminded me of a clove cigarette that my co-worker smokes, minus the tobacco smell. It does dry quick though I will have to give it a plus for that, and also doesn’t feel heavy or greasy against my skin. The hyaluric acid binds with your skins natural moisture helping keep your skin full of moisture along with helps your other moisturizers be more effective.&lt;br /&gt;I have been lucky and graced with skin that helps make me look younger however I am now in my late 30’s and am starting to form fine lines around my eyes. Its sad when your child says your getting old because of your lines around your eyes.  So new goal is to make sure that I am always moisturized and I think this serum can help tighten those lines up and help diminish the aging appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shelf life of this bottle shows that it is good for two years, plenty of time to use your product without it going bad. Fun Fact: Did you know that the reason that this is stored in a dark bottle rather then the see through bottle is because vitamin C looses its potency when light is exposed to it.</li>
            <li> Part of the reason I decided to try this Serum is because right off the bat it makes me feel like I&#x27;m doing something good for my skin - it&#x27;s 72% Organic, 98% Natural, made in the USA and not tested on animals. Two thumbs up for all of that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the results I&#x27;ve seen so far. I had never tried a serum like this before, so I was somewhat surprised at the thickness of it. And yet it still absorbed into my skin quickly, and did not irritate it, as some skin care products do. I did notice that that the serum seemed to absorb the best, and make my skin feel the best, when I applied it right after washing my face with warm water, as the directions indicate.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all!</li>
            <li> i was given this Organic Vitamin C 20% Serum for a low cost for my review and i have to say i really did not know about this product but i have to say since using it i have so changed my mind...not only does it make face soft and smooth but it has also has shrunk my pores i am so glad this product found me if i could give this product a 10 star review i so would it is amazing!!! this can be used on men and woman so if i were u i would run and buy as many bottles of this as u can it is the best!!! i have to add this did not break out my face when using this i got only great results from this products because everything is 72% organic and 98%natural ingredients it has everything you need for a healthy skin and glow</li>
            <li> I love this serum!  I noticed an immediate difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance, and thought that it was just me. However, within days of using it in the morning and evening, I had three people comment on how beautiful my skin was looking. One went as far as to say &amp;#34;whatever you&#x27;re doing keep it up&amp;#34;. Since this is the only thing that&#x27;s changed in my skin care regimen, it has to be this.  My skin feels soft, but firmer and fuller. I will definitely be purchasing more of this vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> Serum worked as described. It even helped clear up my face. I also liked how it made my face feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Have you had a hard time finding a good serum for your face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried Elleda Vitamin C 20% Serum.  The company claims that this product will leave your skin noticeable changed in under 10 minutes and that the Vitamin C will help improve skin&#x27;s elasticity and help prevent dehydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this product is made in the USA in a FDA-approved facility.  The company does not test on animals and the product itself is sulfate and paraben free. This product is full of rich vitamins and botanicals. It is also great for any skin types.  The directions say to apply liberally to the skin, which I did. I enjoyed the sweet smell of oranges, which was not overpowering.  The product also includes hyaluronic acid which helps to keep skin smooth and plump.  In just a few hours I noticed that the discoloration of my skin is visibly reduced and my acne scars are not noticeable.  I definitely love this product.  I only wish that the bottle was a bit bigger.  It is a little awkward trying to put the product on your face with a dropper.  I give the product a 9 out of 10. Elleda would have received a 10 out of 10 if it was easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Made in the USA! what more needs to be said....&lt;br /&gt;but really, This serum is made with 72% certified organic ingredients, and is 98% naturally derived. The serum has a thin consistency and is easily absorbed into the skin, it is also gentle on my sensitive skin and has not caused any redness or breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I find this serum to be good, and I recommend that you at least consider it.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> I love this serum for so many reasons - it&#x27;s light once applied and feels good on. No animal testing. Made in the USA. It&#x27;s ORGANIC! and did I mention? It just feels good...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I age, I realize I can reduce the signs somewhat but finding the right product can be difficult. While I did receive this product to try and then review, I chose it for the reasons above. I like that this formula delivers as promised and has gone beyond that for my individual needs. Adding Vitamin C 20% Serum to my daily beauty regimen is a win-win-win for me. YAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#elleda</li>
