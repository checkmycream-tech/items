            <li>so I&#x27;m silky smooth for bed.</li>
            <li>and afterwards it feels smooth and cool.&lt;br /&gt;Going to have to buy one for my dad and brother to try.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fact that it is organic and natural makes me feel good about using it too.</li>
            <li>Have tried many, many other brands and this gave best results, by far, for me.</li>
            <li>gets absorbed, this is more than just a great alternative to big brand shaving creams, it is the more responsible purchase for a happier, healthier you.</li>
            <li>My daughter highly recommends I try it and buy us our own jar.</li>
            <li>I am so excited that I was chosen to test this for quality and express my experience with this shaving cream product.  </li>
            <li>I had to rinse the cream from my razor with hot water though to make sure it was thoroughly removed.  </li>
            <li>I am excited I was chosen to review this product for my true and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t get the same dryness feeling after shaving, the leather is rich, and smells good</li>
            <li>Although the price tag may be considered somewhat high for a shave product; it is my honest belief that the benefits that this shave cream provides is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>However, I still give this 3 stars because it is good enough to keep as a back-up for if/</li>
            <li>I hope that the company extends their product line to more grooming essential products for men as this is definitely a sure thing.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, the cream gives me a mild stinging sensation which stays with me until I finish shaving and rinse my face.</li>
            <li>OK, it&#x27;s not complete magic</li>
            <li>just like the other reviews said, this is amazing and works as advertised!</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and really makes for a noticeably closer shave.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this product feels like silk going on your face and leaves my skin soft and suptle.</li>
            <li>It is the smoothest shave ever, even better than the old fashioned cup of soap and brush.  </li>
            <li>I was so glad that this product is natural and uses organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Family members with sensitive skin who dread shaving love this.</li>
            <li>It glides on and my razor glides right along my legs without any issue.</li>
            <li>the folks behind this product seem to be very proud and just plain nice!</li>
            <li>It left my legs smoothly shaved, moisturized and nick free.  </li>
            <li>I switched to this from The Art of Shaving, in an attempt to save a little money but still stay with something that I thought would give a nice, clean, &amp;#34;luxurious&amp;#34; shave.  </li>
            <li>The jar contains 8 fl oz of a white cream, thicker than lotion, but much more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect since this is my first time with a creme.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than the regular shaving creams and gels.  </li>
            <li>but there can be a bit of tugging on the first pass.</li>
            <li>I told him to use the hot water and it worked with his razor as well.  </li>
            <li>It makes the skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It leaves smooth and soft effect on the face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but a quarter size is more than enough for each leg.</li>
            <li>Other than that I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>I said, not total magic but</li>
            <li>A super smooth and close shave, and immensely hydrating</li>
            <li>It is thick and cream with a very nice smell.  </li>
            <li>This shaving cream leaves my skin super soft!</li>
            <li>I might even get lucky a little more often.</li>
            <li>The packaging is pretty decent.</li>
            <li>Since I have a lot of allergies in the family I have to be very concerned with the smell of products.</li>
            <li>I then, applied the cream as instructed, and went through quite a long process for my first shave with the Candid Essential shave cream.</li>
            <li>He really likes it.</li>
            <li>The scent is soft yet fresh and yummy.</li>
            <li>The lotion feels way better than any other shaving creams that I have used.</li>
            <li>He said the razor glided smoothly over his face and his only complaint was it stuck in his razor (he rinses with warm water).  </li>
            <li>The shave turns out okay, but it is not very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s highly recommended.</li>
            <li>when I forget to reorder my normal.</li>
            <li>let the price stop you from buying this product, because you only need a small amount to get a good shave and it doesn’t cause razor burn.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews on products that I use.</li>
            <li>But I couldn&#x27;t use the product more than a few times.  </li>
            <li>I aslo noticed a burning sensation right after applying the cream, which has continued on several minutes after the shave.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and cannot use a lot of products because they give me pumps.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I used a hot steam towel to aid in softening my facial hair.</li>
            <li>If instead you are willing to try something different because you have sensitive skin (but still want a close shave) then give this a chance.</li>
            <li>I shaved my legs with it both in the shower and did touch-ups, and I was so pleased to report NO razor burn or nicks even when using it on dry legs with a wet razor.</li>
            <li>The product goes a long way and allows you to see what your shaving unlike most shaving creams due to it being a non-foaming cream.</li>
            <li>FOUR stars for smooth, clean shave with very little drag.</li>
            <li>For those with sensitive skin this product is gentle enough so that you can shave and repeat two or three times without worrying about skin irritation.</li>
            <li>I found my skin was baby soft after just 2 passes</li>
            <li>Bought this for my boyfriend who has always suffered fron sensitive skin, to the point it hurt me to look at his skin.</li>
            <li>The only other issue I had, is that this cream can really clog a DE razor very fast.</li>
            <li>1st - Apply hot water to the area you are shaving to open up the pores on your skin 2nd</li>
            <li>He loves it not only for the close shave he gets, it helps with his occational ingrown hairs, it softens his skin, leaves no irritation, but is also all natural.</li>
            <li>He has sensitive skin and said it left his face conditioned.  </li>
            <li>This satisfaction is magnified because it is an all natural product, as I have shifted a majority of what I use and eat to be as such.</li>
            <li>Unlike most other shaving creams this does not form a thick lather when you apply it to your face.</li>
            <li>The first impression I got out of it, was that it felt like a conditioner, only a little thicker.</li>
            <li>This has a slight &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; or extreme cool feeling that irritates my skin.  </li>

            <li> I aslo noticed a burning sensation right after applying the cream, which has continued on several minutes after the shave.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and cannot use a lot of products because they give me pumps.</li>

            <li> If instead you are willing to try something different because you have sensitive skin (but still want a close shave) then give this a chance.</li>
            <li> I shaved my legs with it both in the shower and did touch-ups, and I was so pleased to report NO razor burn or nicks even when using it on dry legs with a wet razor.</li>
            <li> The product goes a long way and allows you to see what your shaving unlike most shaving creams due to it being a non-foaming cream.</li>
            <li> FOUR stars for smooth, clean shave with very little drag.</li>
            <li> For those with sensitive skin this product is gentle enough so that you can shave and repeat two or three times without worrying about skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I found my skin was baby soft after just 2 passes</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend who has always suffered fron sensitive skin, to the point it hurt me to look at his skin.</li>
            <li> The only other issue I had, is that this cream can really clog a DE razor very fast.</li>

            <li> He loves it not only for the close shave he gets, it helps with his occational ingrown hairs, it softens his skin, leaves no irritation, but is also all natural.</li>

            <li> This satisfaction is magnified because it is an all natural product, as I have shifted a majority of what I use and eat to be as such.</li>
            <li> Unlike most other shaving creams this does not form a thick lather when you apply it to your face.</li>
            <li> The first impression I got out of it, was that it felt like a conditioner, only a little thicker.</li>
            <li> This has a slight &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; or extreme cool feeling that irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li> This shaving cream works very well as a protective, slick lubricant.  </li>
            <li> This container will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> However, I would be remissed and doing the next consumer an extreme injustice if I did not express my immense satisfaction for this product.</li>

            <li> Once you get used to the thin lather and start shaving you&#x27;ll find that this shaving cream does its job very well.  </li>
            <li> If you like a really thick, old school shaving cream on your face that you apply with a shaving brush then this product is probably not for you.</li>
            <li> My only word of advice to this particular firm is don&#x27;t fix what isn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was given a sample of this product in exchange for my honest review. It&#x27;s primarily meant for men, but as a woman, I was thoroughly impressed with this shaving cream! The jar contains 8 fl oz of a white cream, thicker than lotion, but much more moisturizing. It is non-foaming and very lightly scented, not &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;, but a welcome change from the overbearing floral or fruity scents of women&#x27;s shaving cream. I shaved my legs with it both in the shower and did touch-ups, and I was so pleased to report NO razor burn or nicks even when using it on dry legs with a wet razor. A super smooth and close shave, and immensely hydrating, I will be tossing my pink can! The only thing I&#x27;d change about it would be to make the packaging a pump so it&#x27;s less messy.</li>
            <li> Well, I haven&#x27;t tried this product myself yet, but my husband and daughter love it. I bought it for my husband as a stocking stuffer. He loves it not only for the close shave he gets, it helps with his occational ingrown hairs, it softens his skin, leaves no irritation, but is also all natural. A huge bonus. My daughter highly recommends I try it and buy us our own jar.</li>
            <li> Great shaving cream, I don&#x27;t get the same dryness feeling after shaving, the leather is rich, and smells good</li>
            <li> really conditions the face,lather well and use light strokes with razor for a perfect and clean shave</li>
            <li> I switched to this from The Art of Shaving, in an attempt to save a little money but still stay with something that I thought would give a nice, clean, &amp;#34;luxurious&amp;#34; shave.  I used this a couple times and decided it is not worth the saved money.  This has a slight &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; or extreme cool feeling that irritates my skin.  The shave turns out okay, but it is not very comfortable.  I decided to switch back to what I know works for me.  However, I still give this 3 stars because it is good enough to keep as a back-up for if/when I forget to reorder my normal.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the product. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of nice shave products and was looking forward to this one. All of the ingredients it contains sounded wonderful. However the ingredient that numbs your face was overpowering, I couldn&#x27;t feel my skin. I would return  it if I could</li>
            <li> just like the other reviews said, this is amazing and works as advertised! i get baby face after shaving</li>
            <li> The lotion feels way better than any other shaving creams that I have used. The product goes a long way and allows you to see what your shaving unlike most shaving creams due to it being a non-foaming cream. I can never go back to any thing else. Recommend for all</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and cannot use a lot of products because they give me pumps. I love the fact that this product feels like silk going on your face and leaves my skin soft and suptle. My wife appreciates the smoothness as well</li>
            <li> Your shaving cream is fabulous.  It is the smoothest shave ever, even better than the old fashioned cup of soap and brush.  It is a great lotion for my face.  I could not ask for more.  I give it five stars easily.  The only issue will be how to get it through TSA security.  I will have to get a small jar and put some into it for this.  Thank you for such a great product.</li>
            <li> I am so excited that I was chosen to test this for quality and express my experience with this shaving cream product.  I was so glad that this product is natural and uses organic ingredients.  It is thick and cream with a very nice smell.  Since I have a lot of allergies in the family I have to be very concerned with the smell of products. This product had a light smell that did not affect any ones allergies in the family.  I liked the way it went smoothly on my legs and did not leave any residue after rinsing off.  I will be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> Causes me great discomfort. Unable to use it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect since this is my first time with a creme. I have to say it works wonders. I have very sensitive skin and my face typically burns after a shave but with this cream there is no pull on the hairs so it&#x27;s real simple to shave. I am glad I tried it and I will continue to use to from here on out. It&#x27;s highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream leaves my skin super soft! It makes the razor glide very easily and I hardly have to use any. This container will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than the regular shaving creams and gels.  Have to see how it lives up after a few months of usage.</li>
            <li> Recived a late . Didnt work well</li>
            <li> I always had a problem with skin irritation after I shaved. I have tried different razors including electric, but nothing worked. I probably spent hundreds of dollars on shaving cream and razors, but always had the same results.&lt;br /&gt;I would often skip a couple of days of shaving to give my face a rest, but sometimes people at work would ask how come I didn’t shave this morning.&lt;br /&gt;Don’t let the price stop you from buying this product, because you only need a small amount to get a good shave and it doesn’t cause razor burn. It also smells good.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to a can of shaving cream.  This works much better.</li>
            <li> Good shaving cream but not that much foaming... It keeps skin moisturized and silky</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product. It glides on smoothly and really makes for a noticeably closer shave. The fact that it is organic and natural makes me feel good about using it too. Since about 80% of everything we put on our body (like lotion, makeup, etc.) gets absorbed, this is more than just a great alternative to big brand shaving creams, it is the more responsible purchase for a happier, healthier you.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I have never been able to get a closer and smoother shave than with this creme. This smell is great too. Wish you had more stuff for men. Perhaps a lotion or body wash? (wish-full thinking)</li>
            <li> As a DE shaver, I have somewhat mixed feelings about this shave cream. I used a hot steam towel to aid in softening my facial hair. I then, applied the cream as instructed, and went through quite a long process for my first shave with the Candid Essential shave cream. The first impression I got out of it, was that it felt like a conditioner, only a little thicker. I&#x27;m sure this was the way it was intended to be but it doesn&#x27;t provide very good cushion for a safety razor. The slickness is pretty good but there can be a bit of tugging on the first pass. The only other issue I had, is that this cream can really clog a DE razor very fast. I aslo noticed a burning sensation right after applying the cream, which has continued on several minutes after the shave. I believe this would be a very good product for multi blade cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband but thought I would give it a try as well.  Remember, it a cream, not the traditional foam or gel we have become accustomed to.  The product went on very easy and has a fresh, clean smell.  It left my legs smoothly shaved, moisturized and nick free.  I had to rinse the cream from my razor with hot water though to make sure it was thoroughly removed.  My husband liked it as well.  He has sensitive skin and said it left his face conditioned.  He said the razor glided smoothly over his face and his only complaint was it stuck in his razor (he rinses with warm water).  I told him to use the hot water and it worked with his razor as well.  I am excited I was chosen to review this product for my true and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> This is really nice shaving gel. It is not a regular shaving cream. It doesnt leather. It makes the skin so soft and smooth. I got this for my hubby. He really likes it. The packaging is pretty decent. It leaves smooth and soft effect on the face.&lt;br /&gt;I would say this is great for men use. I received this product in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I love just about every thing about this product. The scent is soft yet fresh and yummy. The feel is soothing, moisturizing, but not too lotion like where it leaves a sticky or gummy residue. It glides on and my razor glides right along my legs without any issue. A little goes a long way and I love that part. I thought I was going to need a lot to shave my legs but a quarter size is more than enough for each leg. The only thing I would like to see different is the way it could be dispensed. It can get a little awkward in the shower opening and closing the cap with wet hands and can drop some product. A pump or a squeeze tube would make it PERFECT! Other than that I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thought or opinions.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews on products that I use. However, I would be remissed and doing the next consumer an extreme injustice if I did not express my immense satisfaction for this product. As an Army Soldier (15 years and going), I am required to shave daily and have tried various shave creams and gels over the years to finally say that I have found my forever shave product. This satisfaction is magnified because it is an all natural product, as I have shifted a majority of what I use and eat to be as such. Although the price tag may be considered somewhat high for a shave product; it is my honest belief that the benefits that this shave cream provides is well worth the investment. My only word of advice to this particular firm is don&#x27;t fix what isn&#x27;t broken. There is no need to reformulate anything or introduce a &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; rendition later on down the road. I hope that the company extends their product line to more grooming essential products for men as this is definitely a sure thing. Great job on developing such a wonderful product that truly aligns with the needs and wants of the shaver&#x27;s market.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I shave my head and have had problems with sensitivity, bumps, cuts, etc. for some time now. I decided to Candid Essentials a try and discovered the most amazing shaving product I never thought existed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaving experience has become so much more comfortable that I almost look forward to shaving again. OK, it&#x27;s not complete magic but it is darn close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very few bumps, almost no irritation that lasts longer than a few minutes after shaving. No nicks, I would usually get at least one bleeder a night. (I shave at night so I&#x27;m silky smooth for bed. Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My blades even last longer. Seriously, I can get at least a week and a half out of the same make and model of blades that lasted a week before. It&#x27;s not a huge difference but every little bit helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, not total magic but darn close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh!! Did I mention that my scalp is the smoothest and softest it has ever been post shave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do not change anything about this product it is perfect the way it is. Love the scent too. You should make an After Shave or Cologne that has the same scent. My Girlfriend loves it!! I might even get lucky a little more often. Come on, help a guy out.</li>
            <li> IT clogs up my razor with the cream..I will not buy it again...</li>
            <li> Unlike most other shaving creams this does not form a thick lather when you apply it to your face. This may seem strange initially if you are used to using other shaving creams. Once you get used to the thin lather and start shaving you&#x27;ll find that this shaving cream does its job very well.  Here are a few tips on how to get a really close, smoothe shave when using this product: 1st - Apply hot water to the area you are shaving to open up the pores on your skin 2nd - Evenly apply the shaving cream with your fingers to area you are shaving 3rd - Shave the area 4th - Repeat steps 1-3 up to three times. I found my skin was baby soft after just 2 passes and I get a thick beard growth  I enjoyed shaving with this cream and found it to be as advertised. My skin did not get irritated and my razor (Gillette fusion) did its job effortlessly. This shaving cream works very well as a protective, slick lubricant.  Conclusion: If you like a really thick, old school shaving cream on your face that you apply with a shaving brush then this product is probably not for you. If instead you are willing to try something different because you have sensitive skin (but still want a close shave) then give this a chance. For those with sensitive skin this product is gentle enough so that you can shave and repeat two or three times without worrying about skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Family members with sensitive skin who dread shaving love this.</li>
            <li> FOUR stars for smooth, clean shave with very little drag. HOWEVER, the cream gives me a mild stinging sensation which stays with me until I finish shaving and rinse my face. Am I the only one who has this experience?</li>
            <li> Whatever the alcohol in here is, it left my face red and burning.  I got a great shave, make no mistake...  But I couldn&#x27;t use the product more than a few times.  Each time my face got redder for longer.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend who has always suffered fron sensitive skin, to the point it hurt me to look at his skin. He said this is the best shaving cream he&#x27;s ever used and his skin has greatly improved! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Probably,the best shaving cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Awesome! This creme is magic! I was never able to shave every day because of sensitive skin. I&#x27;d get irritated and it would hurt. No more! I really like the subtle tingly feeling this creme gives my skin and afterwards it feels smooth and cool.&lt;br /&gt;Going to have to buy one for my dad and brother to try.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;Plus (and its a big one these days) the folks behind this product seem to be very proud and just plain nice!</li>
            <li> Love it. I recommend. Will use for life. Lathers nicely. Great shave.</li>
            <li> My Husband has dry skin and loves this Shave Crewm!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Drastically reduced razor bumps and inflammation from daily shaving. Have tried many, many other brands and this gave best results, by far, for me. YMMV of course as everyone&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
