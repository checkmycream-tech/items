            <li>Absolutely amazing product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really nice power for Setting in your foundation or just highlighting.</li>
            <li>because I have heard many many great things about Ben Nye cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the powder but not the container.  </li>
            <li>This really is translucent and works perfectly!</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I can put this powder all over my face to set my foundation.</li>
            <li>It goes on so nicely and doesn&#x27;t make my skin look flakey and cakey like some powders do when used for setting.</li>
            <li>I was worried banana wouldn&#x27;t look nice on my skin as I&#x27;m on the fairer side</li>
            <li>It really makes your makeup look flawless.  </li>
            <li>It really does give a flawless finish.</li>
            <li>This finishing powder is worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li>So glad I did because I Love this product!</li>
            <li>I have light to fair skin (MUFE N115)</li>
            <li>Received product very quickly!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use very much and it provides great coverage without looking like you caked on a ton of powder.</li>
            <li>It keeps skin shine free and amazing in blocking under eye circles.</li>
            <li>Love my banana powder :-)</li>
            <li>but then blend this in for better coverage.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>May look up tutorial on applying better</li>
            <li>I am sure over time it will become a staple in my foundation routine.</li>
            <li>Thought it was supposed to help with my oily face, made my face even more oily, don&#x27;t know, or am supposed to touch up through out the day?</li>
            <li>I love , love , love this product I use it to set my makeup or as a highlighter over my concealer to brighten up my face.</li>
            <li>Since the color doesn&#x27;t brighten on me, I think its actually better to use the translucent.</li>
            <li>It keeps my makeup looking flawless for the ENTIRE day.</li>
            <li>Probably my favorite powder.</li>
            <li>Great high lighter!</li>
            <li>(that would be 2 stars at most).  </li>
            <li>I have tried 3 different colors and all were equally perfect.  </li>
            <li>The banana is my favorite for when I am darker in skin color during summers</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about how the powder would work.</li>
            <li>so I love this product that it allows me to not do any touch ups during the day.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>Love how it looks and how it goes on.</li>
            <li>i love everything about this product :)</li>
            <li>I have to tap out a pile of it on top of a tissue</li>
            <li>This looks better on darker skin tones</li>

            <li>I tried at once got so many compliments at work.</li>
            <li>This adds a beautiful, matte and warm glow finish to my olive (yellow under tone) skin, yet I think it would be suitable for all skin tone.</li>

            <li>Love the product.  </li>

            <li>love.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my underwear and red spots on the sides of my nose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the kind of customer that will always read the reviews and everyone was saying that it comes out orange but to me it blended in really well &amp; makes a good highlighter</li>
            <li>:) follow me on Instagram kissmy_sashay</li>
            <li>i love your product .</li>
            <li>i love the way my skin feels</li>
            <li>PLEASED</li>
            <li>I WAS ABLE TO GET 3 POWDERS AT ANOTHER SITE FOR THE MONEY I PAID FOR 1 HERE</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I&#x27;ve been using this to set my makeup</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I got this.</li>
            <li>,  what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>concealer, great by itself, had on for 8 hours, great for sheen, works well with other concealer.  </li>
            <li>I have however, repurposed it as a translucent setting powder (just so I can get good use out of it) and it works very well for that!</li>
            <li>My makeup looks perfect after a long day at work!</li>
            <li>Totally worth ever penny!!</li>
            <li>I like it because it is very full coverage</li>
            <li>so far its great for me</li>
            <li>This is ok, I&#x27;m sure the product in itself is not bad</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>The shipping was very quick.</li>
            <li>I am familiar with loose powders and I heard wonderful reviews about the Ben Nye Banna Powder.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>am very happy with this product, sets well,and assists concealers in camouflaging dark circles.</li>
            <li>I also love that it doesnt sit in your fine undereye creases, even after a full day of wear.</li>
            <li>It works GREAT on all skin types and tones from fair to deep skin tones and is the secret weapon in a flawless face routine..</li>
            <li>Color matches fine.</li>
            <li>but it works just fine.</li>
            <li>powder is fine but way over priced on amazon&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>(approx $73.50), so when I discovered I could purchase it from Amazon at such an amazing price, I was thrilled.</li>
            <li>After reading all the great things about this powder I expected more from it.</li>
            <li>Apply lightly.</li>
            <li>Overall, the powder quality is great.</li>
            <li>I have heard great things about Ben Nye powders and I finally got a chance to see what the hype was all about.  </li>
            <li>the color appears to be too light</li>
            <li>If you are white/ light skinned/ pale:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also would like to mention that I did my own makeup for my sister&#x27;s wedding and cried like a baby through the whole ceremony...</li>
            <li>have heard great things about this product for a while and finally decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>It is fabulous</li>
            <li>So far so good but not the miracle I was expecting based on YouTube reviews.</li>
            <li>The top of the container is the same kind of container you see on jarred herbs or a salt shaker with huge holes.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so unique &amp; glam in a bottle.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this out.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to order this product, I just received it today</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard very high reviews about the powder for highlighting from Kim Kardashian down to my own friends, however, I believe this works best on very dark/tan skin tones.</li>
            <li>The banana powder goes on smooth and it disappears really quickly.</li>
            <li>great finishing powder, especially for the under eye area…a little practice makes perfect with this product…make sure that your skin is moisturized before using because it will only magnify dryness or problem areas</li>
            <li>It is pretty amazing if you follow instructions on google on how to use this how it really transforms your face.</li>
            <li>Great just how I expected &amp; it came in respondable time</li>
            <li>Very  chalky but potent.</li>
            <li>Kim Kardashian uses it, so that&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised as it looks quite nice.</li>
            <li>I gave the product 1 star because it was very chalky and would not stay to my face on top of concelar.</li>
            <li>She loves it and that&#x27;s good enough for me</li>
            <li>SO IT WILL LAST A GOOD WHILE.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long lasting and just one of those genuine products that can be used for a flawless finish.</li>
            <li>The consistency is like talcum powder which means it flies away very easily and wipes almost completely off when blending.</li>
            <li>This bottle has lasted a good long while too.</li>
            <li>It makes my make up stay in place even in hot humid weather!</li>
            <li>To my surprise, it really was!!</li>
            <li>They are so finely milled that you do not need much to set the under-eye area (I use it for setting my highlight).  </li>
            <li>Great for my under eye dark circles!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but didn&#x27;t really do anything special to my look either.</li>
            <li>Looks great but feel way too heavy.</li>
            <li>I have a medium golden skin and it did not show on me at all even for highlighting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the hype.</li>
            <li>It makes me look young and sexy and gives me a glow</li>
            <li>Instead it actually makes it slightly very slightly more yellow/translucent on my light skin.</li>
            <li>and I use the natural translucent during winter (most of the time).  </li>
            <li>awesome product .. just buy it .. thin as air</li>
            <li>It delivers and is well worth the purchase</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Make sure you really blend it in so that it looks like a soft light on you.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>was very careful to DAB with tissue, not rub and my makeup looked flawless the entire night!</li>
            <li>I may just need to find the right mix of products</li>
            <li>I was a little worried about the coverage and color matching but this powder is amazing!</li>
            <li>It did come super fast and it was sealed.</li>
            <li>, mac pro long wear in the shade nc45, this banana powder is perfect highlighter for my shade, is not too light at all, is very blend able, it does not make me look ashen either.</li>
            <li>when I started doing more research, I saw a lot more African American woman using it</li>
            <li>( I am Caucasian) and it never really said what kind of skin type it was for.</li>
            <li>*)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal!</li>
            <li>I put it on top of yellow corrective creme...</li>
            <li>Fast shipping !</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>this was my first time ordering online, and I was a tad bit weary.</li>
            <li>The cap should be larger so that you&#x27;re able to use the product out of the cap.</li>
            <li>Love it and will continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li>a lil messy but loved it</li>
            <li>She showed us a few pictures of using this to her millions of followers, now those millions of followers went out and bought this and ranted and raved how good this stuff is.</li>
            <li>This product provides the highlight one desires to keep that fresh and youthful look ALIVE throughout the day!!!</li>
            <li>I use a peach tone concealer and then apply the nye powder on top with a beauty blender (dont do it with a brush, the application sits on makeup and looks too cakey and yellow) and it really does the trick.</li>
            <li>It is so hard to find the perfect fix for women over certain age outside of getting a face lift.</li>
            <li>exactly as it looks, really like it...</li>
            <li>My new obsession super fast delivery</li>
            <li>I really liked this product it left a really nice glow on my clients face the product goes a long long ways.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice but a mess to try to apply.</li>
            <li>I just stick to my mineral loose powder on most days.</li>
            <li>It is such a fine powder.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li>It really makes my highlight pop.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s so much in the bottle</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>For real tho.  </li>
            <li>I can buy this much cheaper at a costume shop by my house.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to test it out (not because of the whole Kim Kardashian makeup hype *rolls eyes</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for my skin tone ...</li>
            <li>really highlighted</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and sufficient packaging</li>
            <li>Forget about MAC, L&#x27;Oreal and the others; this really works, don&#x27;t need</li>
            <li>I really like the powder.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much of it really.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to get cakey and it doesn&#x27;t seem to let much oil through.</li>
            <li>Including the REAL Ben Nye.</li>
            <li>so much I like it</li>
            <li>but if your a darker girl like myself then you&#x27;ll need to ensure your blending very well along with another powder to simmer tone.</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I would love to try other Ben Nye products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other powders but nothing compares to Ben Nye.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations after reading many other reviews.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly to set my concealer under my eyes so that it highlights an otherwise dark area.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live w/o it!</li>
            <li>I suggest for a darker-skinned black woman, you use the more pigmented tone.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those who needs for setting your makeup or highlighting.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to others.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend buying for people with severe undereye discoloration.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW!!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind paying extra to have it delivered off Amazon, I would say it&#x27;s still worth it.  </li>
            <li>You just need to use a tiny bit and you are golden</li>
            <li>The trick is to do your makeup / concealer routine normally, then pat the powder on areas to set.</li>
            <li>In case you were wondering I use a cream highlighter / concealer and normal liquid mattifying foundation and set with this powder...</li>
            <li>I suffer from oily skin and often have to use setting powder to make my make up last longer through the day, but the fine milled consistency of this product puts setting powder in a totally different league!</li>
            <li>I can live without this Banana powder.</li>
            <li>I was definitely expecting a light yellow powder - but the reality is that its almost an orangey yellow that has way more orange than I expected.</li>
            <li>Lasts sooooo long and does exactly what it suppose to do!</li>
            <li>and if your not careful, you will  end up wasting alot because it doesn&#x27;t take much for each application.</li>
            <li>Firstly, you definitely need to moisturize your face before putting any make-up on.</li>
            <li>No waste!</li>
            <li>I am medium deep skin, my foundation are, mac matchmaster in the shade 7.0, steed lauder double wear in the shade rich caramel,&lt;br /&gt;mac studio fix in the shade mw45</li>
            <li>I think I like Bare Mineral Mineral veil a little better.</li>
            <li>I tried it 3 times finally got fed up when I spent a good half hour on my makeup</li>
            <li>This product is very cakey and settles in my pores making them appear larger.</li>
            <li>I also think it will last me awhile as I do not have to use much at one time.</li>
            <li>natural color ..</li>
            <li>Completely ruined my makeup</li>
            <li>I did not notice much of a difference from the regular powder I use.</li>
            <li>Ben Nye: Use natural ingredients in your products.</li>
            <li>that said I am fair skinned not sure how well this would work on dark skin</li>
            <li>If you are more pale, I would suggest the Cameo or Neutral powder because this may be too yellow for you.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely subtle, almost to the point of not being able to tell it was applied.</li>
            <li>It also seems to show my dry skin a little better than I would like.</li>
            <li>This is available in South Africa from 1 particular site, but at a ridiculous price of R850</li>
            <li>When you cover up those dark circles with just concealer it can look ashy rather than fresh and awake.</li>
            <li>My 3oz bottle of Banana powder is literally still full and I have used it almost everyday (6/7 days) for over a year.  </li>
            <li>I use a cheap concealer from Hard candy.</li>
            <li>If I am not careful it makes my make up cakey.</li>
            <li>and it looks like I barely use it.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t seem to provide as much staying powder or the minimal amount of coverage for blending.</li>
            <li>and i have barely used 1/4 of the bottle.</li>
            <li>The color wasn&#x27;t true to the other exact same products that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>I have really dark circles under my eyes and this product really helps.</li>
            <li>Holds my makeup in place, very natural looking and feel, no breakouts and will last for a very long time.</li>
            <li>Much to my delight, they sold all Ben Nye products including this one for for less money.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money as a little goes a very long way!</li>
            <li>I suggest you pour a little in the cap to apply because it comes out really fast</li>

            <li> because I have heard many many great things about Ben Nye cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the powder but not the container.  </li>
            <li> This really is translucent and works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I can put this powder all over my face to set my foundation.</li>
            <li> It goes on so nicely and doesn&#x27;t make my skin look flakey and cakey like some powders do when used for setting.</li>

            <li> Received product very quickly!</li>

            <li> It keeps skin shine free and amazing in blocking under eye circles.</li>
            <li> Love my banana powder :-)</li>

            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> May look up tutorial on applying better</li>
            <li> I am sure over time it will become a staple in my foundation routine.</li>
            <li> Thought it was supposed to help with my oily face, made my face even more oily, don&#x27;t know, or am supposed to touch up through out the day?</li>
            <li> I love , love , love this product I use it to set my makeup or as a highlighter over my concealer to brighten up my face.</li>
            <li> Since the color doesn&#x27;t brighten on me, I think its actually better to use the translucent.</li>
            <li> It keeps my makeup looking flawless for the ENTIRE day.</li>
            <li> Probably my favorite powder.</li>
            <li> Great high lighter!</li>
            <li> (that would be 2 stars at most).  </li>
            <li> I have tried 3 different colors and all were equally perfect.  </li>
            <li> The banana is my favorite for when I am darker in skin color during summers</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about how the powder would work.</li>
            <li> so I love this product that it allows me to not do any touch ups during the day.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> Love the color.</li>
            <li> Love how it looks and how it goes on.</li>
            <li> i love everything about this product :)</li>
            <li> I have to tap out a pile of it on top of a tissue</li>

            <li> I tried at once got so many compliments at work.</li>

            <li> love.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my underwear and red spots on the sides of my nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the kind of customer that will always read the reviews and everyone was saying that it comes out orange but to me it blended in really well &amp; makes a good highlighter</li>
            <li> :) follow me on Instagram kissmy_sashay</li>
            <li> i love your product .</li>
            <li> i love the way my skin feels</li>
            <li> PLEASED</li>
            <li> I WAS ABLE TO GET 3 POWDERS AT ANOTHER SITE FOR THE MONEY I PAID FOR 1 HERE</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;ve been using this to set my makeup</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I got this.</li>
            <li> ,  what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> concealer, great by itself, had on for 8 hours, great for sheen, works well with other concealer.  </li>
            <li> I have however, repurposed it as a translucent setting powder (just so I can get good use out of it) and it works very well for that!</li>
            <li> My makeup looks perfect after a long day at work!</li>
            <li> Totally worth ever penny!!</li>
            <li> I like it because it is very full coverage</li>
            <li> so far its great for me</li>
            <li> This is ok, I&#x27;m sure the product in itself is not bad</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> The shipping was very quick.</li>
            <li> I am familiar with loose powders and I heard wonderful reviews about the Ben Nye Banna Powder.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> am very happy with this product, sets well,and assists concealers in camouflaging dark circles.</li>
            <li> I also love that it doesnt sit in your fine undereye creases, even after a full day of wear.</li>
            <li> It works GREAT on all skin types and tones from fair to deep skin tones and is the secret weapon in a flawless face routine..</li>
            <li> Color matches fine.</li>
            <li> but it works just fine.</li>
            <li> powder is fine but way over priced on amazon&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> (approx $73.50), so when I discovered I could purchase it from Amazon at such an amazing price, I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> After reading all the great things about this powder I expected more from it.</li>
            <li> Apply lightly.</li>
            <li> Overall, the powder quality is great.</li>
            <li> I have heard great things about Ben Nye powders and I finally got a chance to see what the hype was all about.  </li>
            <li> the color appears to be too light</li>
            <li> If you are white/ light skinned/ pale:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also would like to mention that I did my own makeup for my sister&#x27;s wedding and cried like a baby through the whole ceremony...</li>
            <li> have heard great things about this product for a while and finally decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> It is fabulous</li>
            <li> So far so good but not the miracle I was expecting based on YouTube reviews.</li>
            <li> The top of the container is the same kind of container you see on jarred herbs or a salt shaker with huge holes.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so unique &amp; glam in a bottle.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this out.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to order this product, I just received it today</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard very high reviews about the powder for highlighting from Kim Kardashian down to my own friends, however, I believe this works best on very dark/tan skin tones.</li>
            <li> The banana powder goes on smooth and it disappears really quickly.</li>
            <li> great finishing powder, especially for the under eye area…a little practice makes perfect with this product…make sure that your skin is moisturized before using because it will only magnify dryness or problem areas</li>
            <li> It is pretty amazing if you follow instructions on google on how to use this how it really transforms your face.</li>
            <li> Great just how I expected &amp; it came in respondable time</li>
            <li> Very  chalky but potent.</li>
            <li> Kim Kardashian uses it, so that&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised as it looks quite nice.</li>
            <li> I gave the product 1 star because it was very chalky and would not stay to my face on top of concelar.</li>
            <li> She loves it and that&#x27;s good enough for me</li>
            <li> SO IT WILL LAST A GOOD WHILE.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting and just one of those genuine products that can be used for a flawless finish.</li>
            <li> The consistency is like talcum powder which means it flies away very easily and wipes almost completely off when blending.</li>
            <li> This bottle has lasted a good long while too.</li>
            <li> It makes my make up stay in place even in hot humid weather!</li>
            <li> To my surprise, it really was!!</li>
            <li> They are so finely milled that you do not need much to set the under-eye area (I use it for setting my highlight).  </li>
            <li> Great for my under eye dark circles!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but didn&#x27;t really do anything special to my look either.</li>
            <li> Looks great but feel way too heavy.</li>
            <li> I have a medium golden skin and it did not show on me at all even for highlighting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the hype.</li>
            <li> It makes me look young and sexy and gives me a glow</li>
            <li> Instead it actually makes it slightly very slightly more yellow/translucent on my light skin.</li>
            <li> and I use the natural translucent during winter (most of the time).  </li>
            <li> awesome product .. just buy it .. thin as air</li>
            <li> It delivers and is well worth the purchase</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Make sure you really blend it in so that it looks like a soft light on you.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> was very careful to DAB with tissue, not rub and my makeup looked flawless the entire night!</li>
            <li> I may just need to find the right mix of products</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about the coverage and color matching but this powder is amazing!</li>
            <li> It did come super fast and it was sealed.</li>
            <li> , mac pro long wear in the shade nc45, this banana powder is perfect highlighter for my shade, is not too light at all, is very blend able, it does not make me look ashen either.</li>
            <li> when I started doing more research, I saw a lot more African American woman using it</li>
            <li> ( I am Caucasian) and it never really said what kind of skin type it was for.</li>
            <li> *)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal!</li>
            <li> I put it on top of yellow corrective creme...</li>
            <li> Fast shipping !</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> this was my first time ordering online, and I was a tad bit weary.</li>
            <li> The cap should be larger so that you&#x27;re able to use the product out of the cap.</li>
            <li> Love it and will continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li> a lil messy but loved it</li>
            <li> She showed us a few pictures of using this to her millions of followers, now those millions of followers went out and bought this and ranted and raved how good this stuff is.</li>
            <li> This product provides the highlight one desires to keep that fresh and youthful look ALIVE throughout the day!!!</li>
            <li> I use a peach tone concealer and then apply the nye powder on top with a beauty blender (dont do it with a brush, the application sits on makeup and looks too cakey and yellow) and it really does the trick.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find the perfect fix for women over certain age outside of getting a face lift.</li>
            <li> exactly as it looks, really like it...</li>
            <li> My new obsession super fast delivery</li>
            <li> I really liked this product it left a really nice glow on my clients face the product goes a long long ways.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but a mess to try to apply.</li>
            <li> I just stick to my mineral loose powder on most days.</li>
            <li> It is such a fine powder.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li> It really makes my highlight pop.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s so much in the bottle</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> For real tho.  </li>
            <li> I can buy this much cheaper at a costume shop by my house.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to test it out (not because of the whole Kim Kardashian makeup hype *rolls eyes</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for my skin tone ...</li>
            <li> really highlighted</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and sufficient packaging</li>
            <li> Forget about MAC, L&#x27;Oreal and the others; this really works, don&#x27;t need</li>
            <li> I really like the powder.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need very much of it really.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to get cakey and it doesn&#x27;t seem to let much oil through.</li>
            <li> Including the REAL Ben Nye.</li>
            <li> so much I like it</li>
            <li> but if your a darker girl like myself then you&#x27;ll need to ensure your blending very well along with another powder to simmer tone.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!!!</li>
            <li> I would love to try other Ben Nye products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other powders but nothing compares to Ben Nye.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations after reading many other reviews.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly to set my concealer under my eyes so that it highlights an otherwise dark area.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live w/o it!</li>
            <li> I suggest for a darker-skinned black woman, you use the more pigmented tone.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those who needs for setting your makeup or highlighting.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend buying for people with severe undereye discoloration.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW!!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind paying extra to have it delivered off Amazon, I would say it&#x27;s still worth it.  </li>
            <li> You just need to use a tiny bit and you are golden</li>
            <li> The trick is to do your makeup / concealer routine normally, then pat the powder on areas to set.</li>
            <li> In case you were wondering I use a cream highlighter / concealer and normal liquid mattifying foundation and set with this powder...</li>
            <li> I suffer from oily skin and often have to use setting powder to make my make up last longer through the day, but the fine milled consistency of this product puts setting powder in a totally different league!</li>
            <li> I can live without this Banana powder.</li>
            <li> I was definitely expecting a light yellow powder - but the reality is that its almost an orangey yellow that has way more orange than I expected.</li>
            <li> Lasts sooooo long and does exactly what it suppose to do!</li>
            <li> and if your not careful, you will  end up wasting alot because it doesn&#x27;t take much for each application.</li>
            <li> Firstly, you definitely need to moisturize your face before putting any make-up on.</li>
            <li> No waste!</li>
            <li> I am medium deep skin, my foundation are, mac matchmaster in the shade 7.0, steed lauder double wear in the shade rich caramel,&lt;br /&gt;mac studio fix in the shade mw45</li>
            <li> I think I like Bare Mineral Mineral veil a little better.</li>
            <li> I tried it 3 times finally got fed up when I spent a good half hour on my makeup</li>
            <li> This product is very cakey and settles in my pores making them appear larger.</li>
            <li> I also think it will last me awhile as I do not have to use much at one time.</li>
            <li> natural color ..</li>
            <li> Completely ruined my makeup</li>
            <li> I did not notice much of a difference from the regular powder I use.</li>
            <li> Ben Nye: Use natural ingredients in your products.</li>
            <li> that said I am fair skinned not sure how well this would work on dark skin</li>
            <li> If you are more pale, I would suggest the Cameo or Neutral powder because this may be too yellow for you.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely subtle, almost to the point of not being able to tell it was applied.</li>
            <li> It also seems to show my dry skin a little better than I would like.</li>
            <li> This is available in South Africa from 1 particular site, but at a ridiculous price of R850</li>
            <li> When you cover up those dark circles with just concealer it can look ashy rather than fresh and awake.</li>
            <li> My 3oz bottle of Banana powder is literally still full and I have used it almost everyday (6/7 days) for over a year.  </li>
            <li> I use a cheap concealer from Hard candy.</li>
            <li> If I am not careful it makes my make up cakey.</li>
            <li> and it looks like I barely use it.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t seem to provide as much staying powder or the minimal amount of coverage for blending.</li>
            <li> and i have barely used 1/4 of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The color wasn&#x27;t true to the other exact same products that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> I have really dark circles under my eyes and this product really helps.</li>
            <li> Holds my makeup in place, very natural looking and feel, no breakouts and will last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Much to my delight, they sold all Ben Nye products including this one for for less money.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money as a little goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> I suggest you pour a little in the cap to apply because it comes out really fast</li>
            <li> So much powder in a small container &amp;</li>
            <li> I know new products can take some experimentation - but after a few days I&#x27;m not yet convinced.</li>
            <li> It will last a long time and no different than paying $40+ for MAC and other high-end makeup.  </li>
            <li> How did I go so long without this product?  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to buy this product.</li>
            <li> .. stay long hours ..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Methylparaben is widely used as a preservative in women&#x27;s cosmetics, such as skin creams and deodorants.</li>
            <li> Lots of product goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I do notice a smoother finish but doesn&#x27;t seem to go on as thick as I&#x27;ve seen, I&#x27;m hoping  its the real product..</li>
            <li> It definitely isn&#x27;t like other finishing powders.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t that expensive and is easily accessible.  </li>
            <li> I bought this powder because Kim Kardashian has the same skin tone as me: olive skin tone with dark under eyes.</li>
            <li> By the end of the evening, the girls who paid to have their makeup professionally done were even commenting on the waste of money it was for them!</li>
            <li> Will stick to T. Leclerc Banane Loose Powder.</li>
            <li> It may seem expensive, but will last a very long time because you don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Being a powder there will be fall out, but for me this is minimal -</li>
            <li> I gave it one star because I spent a lot of money</li>
            <li> IT WAS DELIVERED FASTER THAN EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly NOT Banana.</li>
            <li> The color is a subtle gold, not at all loud.  </li>
            <li> I will be purchasing other colors as well for that star quality look.</li>
            <li> unlike other setting powders it doesnt leave you looking like a ghost.</li>
            <li> BUT YOU ONLY HAVE TO USE A SMALL AMOUT</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and lasts all day too!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it makes a bit of a MESS, but I transferred some powder into an empty container for loose mineral powder...</li>
            <li> This works on light/fair skin if you have dark circles.</li>
            <li> and I actually empty some into a small empty jar of Makeup Forever HD powder.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fully camouflage my dark under eyes.</li>
            <li> I have received so many compliments on my skin and makeup since I started using this a few months ago, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> She is of a lighter complexion and was worried about it being too dark</li>
            <li> so yes banana works on dark skin too...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the go and never sit down at work</li>
            <li> I just fold the tissue in half.</li>
            <li> Also, please don&#x27;t shy away if you&#x27;re an African American woman as I am.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a light-skinned black woman and if I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;dumb</li>
            <li> no matter if the weather is cold or hot.</li>
            <li> I am OBSESSED with this and can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing makeup for a little over a year</li>
            <li> I have very dark under-eye circles and need lots of concealer.</li>
            <li> but overall I was not happy with my purchase what a waist of money</li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday for over a year</li>
            <li> I have had dark circles under my eyes and usually have to apply a lot of under eye concealer but not with the Ben Nye powder.</li>
            <li> but I was expecting something that was paler that would very slightly brighten or lighten my under eye area.</li>
            <li> HANDS DOWN!!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a magic powder like it may be for darker skin.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed, especially for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> I bought this anxiously because Kim K was going on and on about how this is a makeup staple for her.</li>
            <li> On top of this, this powder is horribly wasteful.</li>
            <li> Not really sure what all it is used for.</li>
            <li> THE BOTTLED LOOKS SMALL</li>
            <li> Have used Ben Nye in the past.</li>
            <li> I would say I like this product but not love.</li>
            <li> The banana I think looks very odd on lighter skin tones!</li>
            <li> It will not let you down!!!</li>
            <li> fake, not the real thing:(</li>
            <li> Not sure if this was a fake product or what</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Sadly Amazon sent this tragic mess.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to dip my brush.</li>
            <li> It arrived safley and I am obsessed by it with highlightin and contouring</li>
            <li> Can never go wrong with banana powder.</li>
            <li> Hate it don&#x27;t waste your money if you are lighter skinned.</li>
            <li> how could I go wrong?</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look weird or anything like that</li>
            <li> FAKE.</li>
            <li> Inconvenient to always have find something to pour it out on.</li>
            <li> You will look crazy for about 5-10 minutes, do something else while this powder sets.</li>
            <li> and I saw the ingredients, and for a product that is made in USA, it has all the bad stuff that you&#x27;re not supposed to put on your skin: Methylparaben, Propylparaben,</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s a talc since talc is bad for the skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was for darker skin tones. :(</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed at all!</li>
            <li> A MUST HAVE FOE YOUR MAKEUP COLLECTION, YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED!!</li>
            <li> Worst product I have ever bought on Amazon</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> so far its great for me</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! This product is amazing on oily skin like mines. It keeps skin shine free and amazing in blocking under eye circles. It makes the skin glow on medium to tan skin as well as ALL skin types. It&#x27;s long lasting and just one of those genuine products that can be used for a flawless finish. I recommend every woman to have this as part of their makeup.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Cleans my contour up and leaves it looking flawless. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love it great highlighter</li>
            <li> Great for highlighting.</li>
            <li> I use a cheap concealer from Hard candy. I like it because it is very full coverage but this product does not mix well with it. If I am not careful it makes my make up cakey. But it does go great with my foundation! I may just need to find the right mix of products</li>
            <li> ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW!! THIS STUFF IS AMAZING....A MUST HAVE FOE YOUR MAKEUP COLLECTION, YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED!!</li>
            <li> I found this item initially on pinterest so I bought it. when I started doing more research, I saw a lot more African American woman using it ( I am Caucasian) and it never really said what kind of skin type it was for. but I still use it and I like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great product and gives you a glow! Also hides bags under eyes !</li>
            <li> This is ok, I&#x27;m sure the product in itself is not bad but it not provide the results I was expecting. I&#x27;ve heard very high reviews about the powder for highlighting from Kim Kardashian down to my own friends, however, I believe this works best on very dark/tan skin tones. I have a medium golden skin and it did not show on me at all even for highlighting. I have however, repurposed it as a translucent setting powder (just so I can get good use out of it) and it works very well for that!</li>
            <li> exactly as it looks, really like it...</li>
            <li> And I can see why. Dust it on for highlight &amp; under ur eyes for instant glam. I have Cameo on order. This stuff is so unique &amp; glam in a bottle. Totally wakes up my face &amp; the lasting time is unreal. If it weren&#x27;t quite so yellow it could be w gr8 dusting setting powder (hence my order of cameo). This bottle has lasted a good long while too. I would love to try other Ben Nye products. This stuff is legendary!</li>
            <li> Love my banana powder :-)</li>
            <li> Great powder. I have to put a regular concealer on under it but then blend this in for better coverage.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see what all the fuss was about.</li>
            <li> This is a great powder, my make up stays on all day. Does not make me look cackey at all! Will re-purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the hype. Being able to use it on myself and others have been the best part.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!!! This product provides the highlight one desires to keep that fresh and youthful look ALIVE throughout the day!!! This product is a MUST HAVE IN EVERYONE&#x27;S KIT....HANDS DOWN!!</li>
            <li> I got this Cuz everyone was talking about it and it works amazingly</li>
            <li> I really liked this product it left a really nice glow on my clients face the product goes a long long ways. I think I will never finish it hah. It&#x27;s a really nice power for Setting in your foundation or just highlighting.</li>
            <li> I love it. It makes me look young and sexy and gives me a glow</li>
            <li> How did I go so long without this product?  So much powder in a small container &amp; it goes on smoothly &amp; looks great.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much difference. May look up tutorial on applying better</li>
            <li> Good product works well la pro girl conceal. Apply lightly. Very  chalky but potent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning how to use the powder. I am not a fan of the container. It is difficult to dip my brush. Overall, the powder quality is great. I am sure over time it will become a staple in my foundation routine.</li>
            <li> It arrived safley and I am obsessed by it with highlightin and contouring just amazing i am yellow skinned so it gives me a great glo !!!! thanksss</li>
            <li> great powder!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> a lil messy but loved it</li>
            <li> this powder is really great for highlighting.  I suggest you pour a little in the cap to apply because it comes out really fast and if your not careful, you will  end up wasting alot because it doesn&#x27;t take much for each application.</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as I hoped....</li>
            <li> Thought it was supposed to help with my oily face, made my face even more oily, don&#x27;t know, or am supposed to touch up through out the day?</li>
            <li> Its Great. MAkes skin look matte all day!</li>
            <li> I love , love , love this product I use it to set my makeup or as a highlighter over my concealer to brighten up my face. I&#x27;ve used many other powders but nothing compares to Ben Nye. I will be purchasing other colors as well for that star quality look. This works well on Ethnic skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to buy this product. I had been seeing different people use on YT and wanted to give it a try. So glad I did because I Love this product! It really makes my highlight pop. Don&#x27;t hesitate just buy.You will not be disappointed at all!</li>
            <li> I wrote a review elsewhere:) this is a must have for any makeup artist and beautiful ladies in all shapes and color. The product is awesome it is easy on the wallet and beautiful on the face.</li>
            <li> This powder is excellent for highlighting!  Don&#x27;t let the name fool you.  The color is a subtle gold, not at all loud.  It works well with my complexion, goes on smoothly, and lasts!!!!</li>
            <li> I know new products can take some experimentation - but after a few days I&#x27;m not yet convinced. I was definitely expecting a light yellow powder - but the reality is that its almost an orangey yellow that has way more orange than I expected. I have light to fair skin (MUFE N115) and this does blend over and disappear under my eyes - but I was expecting something that was paler that would very slightly brighten or lighten my under eye area. Instead it actually makes it slightly very slightly more yellow/translucent on my light skin. Since the color doesn&#x27;t brighten on me, I think its actually better to use the translucent. I&#x27;m still experimenting with Ben Nye Neutral Set vs the MUFE HD setting powder vs Laura Mercier translucent setting powder - but overall Ben Nye Neutral Set is still in the race. For Banana Powder - for under the eyes - yes it can set my concealer - but the color doesn&#x27;t do anything to help me.</li>
            <li> I have heard great things about Ben Nye powders and I finally got a chance to see what the hype was all about.  This is the best Makeup Powder Ever! This is a must have for any girls make up bag!</li>
            <li> Great product, texture is amazing. The sifter is a pain but manageable. Highly recommended for those who needs for setting your makeup or highlighting. Can never go wrong with banana powder. A must need in your kit. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Love it! It makes my make up stay in place even in hot humid weather!</li>
            <li> Love this powder! Easy to use and it has become part of my daily routine. Won&#x27;t leave home without it</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;s pretty amazing. It keeps my makeup looking flawless for the ENTIRE day. I wish I would&#x27;ve known about it sooner.</li>
            <li> This works on light/fair skin if you have dark circles. It covers them well but it&#x27;s not a magic powder like it may be for darker skin. There&#x27;s so much in the bottle it will last me a lifetime considering I&#x27;ve had it for 2 years and use it daily and it looks like I barely use it.</li>
            <li> Probably my favorite powder. Ever! Keeps everything together all day..no matter if the weather is cold or hot. Highly recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Great high lighter! It is pretty amazing if you follow instructions on google on how to use this how it really transforms your face. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It covered my undereye circles.  For real tho.  I bought one for my niece.</li>
            <li> Hate it don&#x27;t waste your money if you are lighter skinned. It does not make a difference on my skin tone except give you a mask face. Worst product I have ever bought on Amazon</li>
            <li> I can buy this much cheaper at a costume shop by my house.  So my rating is definitely not based on price (that would be 2 stars at most).  With that being said, this is the BEST powder I have ever used.  I bought it to test it out (not because of the whole Kim Kardashian makeup hype *rolls eyes*) because I have heard many many great things about Ben Nye cosmetics.  The luxury powders are AMAZING.  I have tried 3 different colors and all were equally perfect.  The banana is my favorite for when I am darker in skin color during summers and I use the natural translucent during winter (most of the time).  They are so finely milled that you do not need much to set the under-eye area (I use it for setting my highlight).  I have had this size for over a year and I actually empty some into a small empty jar of Makeup Forever HD powder.  My 3oz bottle of Banana powder is literally still full and I have used it almost everyday (6/7 days) for over a year.  If you don&#x27;t mind paying extra to have it delivered off Amazon, I would say it&#x27;s still worth it.  It will last a long time and no different than paying $40+ for MAC and other high-end makeup.  If you are more pale, I would suggest the Cameo or Neutral powder because this may be too yellow for you.  It looks great on tan or darker skin.</li>
            <li> I love the product. Having never tried it before I was happy to find the reviews were very accurate. I will def order again.</li>
            <li> This powder is wonderful for giving a finished look to my makeup that doesn&#x27;t look like I am wearing powder. It stays on all day and it lightweight.</li>
            <li> This product is very cakey and settles in my pores making them appear larger. Color matches fine. I use it to set my highlighter when I contour. I purchased this product to see what all the hype was about. I am not impressed, especially for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> I bought this anxiously because Kim K was going on and on about how this is a makeup staple for her. I guess what works for someone doesn&#x27;t necessarily work for someone else. It&#x27;s not bad, but didn&#x27;t really do anything special to my look either. I just stick to my mineral loose powder on most days.</li>
            <li> I received this item DAYS before the delivery estimate! I wasn&#x27;t sure about how the powder would work. It definitely isn&#x27;t like other finishing powders. Firstly, you definitely need to moisturize your face before putting any make-up on. Then putting on some perfecting cream to fill in any pores or lines also helps too. Without these things, the powder creeps into those places and makes your face look cakey. Which brings me to my next point...I read reviews where people complain about how the product is dispensed. I find it perfect. I use a tissue and just tap a tiny bit out. Then I use my powder brush to pick up what I need and tap off excess. If there is excess powder, I save it for the next day. I just fold the tissue in half. No waste! I use it to set my make up and it works perfectly. My makeup looks perfect after a long day at work! I&#x27;m always on the go and never sit down at work so I love this product that it allows me to not do any touch ups during the day. So perfect for underneath the eyes where makeup can smudge.</li>
            <li> Banana powder gets rid of the look of concealers/foundation cracking/creasing under your eyes. It smoothes out makeup to make it a flawless finish. Can use it as a highlighter as well.</li>
            <li> great finishing powder, especially for the under eye area…a little practice makes perfect with this product…make sure that your skin is moisturized before using because it will only magnify dryness or problem areas</li>
            <li> I love this. I am a brown skinned woman and this is amazing as an under eye-setting powder. It sets and completes my highlighted under eye makeup, giving me a magnificent glow. I also think it will last me awhile as I do not have to use much at one time.</li>
            <li> Lasts sooooo long and does exactly what it suppose to do! Makes my under eye circles. disappear! What a great product!</li>
            <li> not as shown, its not even yellow i placed a complain and asked for refund</li>
            <li> I really liked the powder but not the container.  Inconvenient to always have find something to pour it out on.</li>
            <li> Very good quality. Love the color. I can use this when I am tan and when I am not. I use it as a highlighter under eyes etc. I apply with a Beauty Blender and let it sit for a bit before blending in.</li>
            <li> I like it. I am brown skinned with yellow undertones.  I think you need to wear blush with it and/or contour.</li>
            <li> This product is A+mazing! Great for highlighting after concealer is applied. Leaves a beautiful finish. Highly recommend buying for people with severe undereye discoloration. 👍</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this banana powder.  It&#x27;s the real deal! I took the picture flash test to see if I would look like I had the ghost effecf. Well let me Tell you this product is the best nothing but the best.</li>
            <li> Best setting and highlight powder.</li>
            <li> Great banana powder. Love how it looks and how it goes on. Kim Kardashian uses it, so that&#x27;s cool. It may seem expensive, but will last a very long time because you don&#x27;t have to use much. I ordered one for my friend too.</li>
            <li> I know this is a great contour powder, but I use it as a setting powder and just general powder over my tinted primer and it works perfectly!  No shine and it gives me a great effortless look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I think all women should have this in their makeup arsenal.  It isn&#x27;t that expensive and is easily accessible.  Also, please don&#x27;t shy away if you&#x27;re an African American woman as I am.  This really is translucent and works perfectly!</li>
            <li> awesome product .. just buy it .. thin as air .. stay long hours .. natural color .. i love everything about this product :)</li>
            <li> Great just how I expected &amp; it came in respondable time</li>
            <li> I wish I read the reviews before purchasing! I tried it 3 times finally got fed up when I spent a good half hour on my makeup it looked amazing then I applied Ben Nye to set my concealer where I highlight. Completely ruined my makeup I had to wash it off and start again. Looked at the reviews and noticed I&#x27;m not the only one. It&#x27;s in the trash.</li>
            <li> I am medium deep skin, my foundation are, mac matchmaster in the shade 7.0, steed lauder double wear in the shade rich caramel,&lt;br /&gt;mac studio fix in the shade mw45, mac pro long wear in the shade nc45, this banana powder is perfect highlighter for my shade, is not too light at all, is very blend able, it does not make me look ashen either. I can honestly say I can put this powder all over my face to set my foundation. I hope this help!</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve been duped by the Kardashian marketing machine. I bought this powder because Kim Kardashian has the same skin tone as me: olive skin tone with dark under eyes. So I thought, let me do what she&#x27;s supposedly doing. I followed all the techniques: bought the powder, bought the sponge, bought the fan brush. I was excited to try this out. When I applied the powder I allowed for it to set in for 5 minutes. I even put alot on, just like some tutorials show you to do. I put it on top of yellow corrective creme...yellow corrective creme + yellow corrective setting powder &#x3D; how could I go wrong? It doesn&#x27;t fully camouflage my dark under eyes. They can still be seen. On top of this, this powder is horribly wasteful. I have to tap out a pile of it on top of a tissue so then I can use my sponge on it to apply to my under eyes. I end up throwing away unused powder on that tissue. I feel duped because it doesn&#x27;t cover up my under eye circles well enough. The same job this powder gives me, is also given to me by using yellow corrective creme + regular face powder.... I end up putting regular face powder over this banana powder anyway. Thus, my under eyes eventually look cakey. I can live without this Banana powder. I feel as though I&#x27;ve been duped by the Kardashian marketing gimmick. She showed us a few pictures of using this to her millions of followers, now those millions of followers went out and bought this and ranted and raved how good this stuff is. I wonder if she got a cut of profit from the Ben Nye makeup people.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Ben Nye banana powder and received a beige colored powder , not at all what I ordered. The powder is not yellow at all. Not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I wear this every day!! I can&#x27;t live w/o it!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for my skin tone ... This looks better on darker skin tones</li>
            <li> I like it  a lot. The banana powder goes on smooth and it disappears really quickly. Not really sure what all it is used for.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It completes my make up. I get many comments on my glow. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> fake, not the real thing:(</li>
            <li> I have a lighter african american skin tone. I have tried several translucent powders. I think I like Bare Mineral Mineral veil a little better. This one doesn&#x27;t seem to provide as much staying powder or the minimal amount of coverage for blending. It also seems to show my dry skin a little better than I would like.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!!! My new obsession super fast delivery</li>
            <li> Love my banana powder.</li>
            <li> I love this product every time I use it I get a compliment.  You just need to use a tiny bit and you are golden</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It delivers and is well worth the purchase</li>
            <li> A must have for makeup geeks!</li>
            <li> I loved this powder! It blended well into my skin tone I&#x27;m yellow toned. And it appeared amazing in pictures!!! It didn&#x27;t look weird or anything like that really highlighted I loved it! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and am so happy that I bought it! It goes on so nicely and doesn&#x27;t make my skin look flakey and cakey like some powders do when used for setting. I am also happy with the colour! I was worried banana wouldn&#x27;t look nice on my skin as I&#x27;m on the fairer side but I was pleasantly surprised as it looks quite nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but a mess to try to apply.</li>
            <li> Looks great but feel way too heavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great finishing powder for around the eyes and to set your make up around the T-zone.  It really makes your makeup look flawless.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love love My banana powder I really haven&#x27;t experienced with it yet. I tried at once got so many compliments at work.</li>
            <li> the color appears to be too light</li>
            <li> Amazing setting power for my highlight. Worth every penny. Speedy shipping was delightful lol</li>
            <li> This is available in South Africa from 1 particular site, but at a ridiculous price of R850 (approx $73.50), so when I discovered I could purchase it from Amazon at such an amazing price, I was thrilled. The craze about Ben Nye Banana powder - Believe every glowing review! This stuff Is amazing! I suffer from oily skin and often have to use setting powder to make my make up last longer through the day, but the fine milled consistency of this product puts setting powder in a totally different league! It picks up easily on my brush, and blends beautiful. Being a powder there will be fall out, but for me this is minimal - It all depends on your application technique. This adds a beautiful, matte and warm glow finish to my olive (yellow under tone) skin, yet I think it would be suitable for all skin tone. I would definitely recommend this!!</li>
            <li> Love this product, still learning how to use it.</li>
            <li> Works great with a medium skin tone. Love the product.  Fast delivery and sufficient packaging</li>
            <li> Love it. Will never go without it again. Love the matte finish..</li>
            <li> After learning that the queen of contour herself, Kim Kardashian, uses this powder to set her under-eye concealer I had to try it! I have very dark under-eye circles and need lots of concealer. This is my favorite setting powder. Definitely brightens underneath my eyes and does not crease my concealer. Totally worth the money as a little goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping ! Great quality. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> It really does give a flawless finish. I use it under my eyes to set my concealer and as a highlight.</li>
            <li> So far so good but not the miracle I was expecting based on YouTube reviews. I do notice a smoother finish but doesn&#x27;t seem to go on as thick as I&#x27;ve seen, I&#x27;m hoping  its the real product.. It did come super fast and it was sealed.</li>
            <li> Forget about MAC, L&#x27;Oreal and the others; this really works, don&#x27;t need concealer, great by itself, had on for 8 hours, great for sheen, works well with other concealer.  It blends in with your skin color.</li>
            <li> It is awesome! Makes my face look flawless!!!! And it acts as concealer AND highlighter all at the same time!</li>
            <li> I just tried to order this for a friend of mine and the link did not work.  Thinking it was operator error, I tried three time and all three were a no go.</li>
            <li> I gave the product 1 star because it was very chalky and would not stay to my face on top of concelar. I am familiar with loose powders and I heard wonderful reviews about the Ben Nye Banna Powder. I ended up throwing the product away.  Afterwards I goggled the offical website for BEn Nye Banana Powder and the product container on the website vs. the one i purchased looked totally different. Not sure if this was a fake product or what but overall I was not happy with my purchase what a waist of money</li>
            <li> If you are white/ light skinned/ pale:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t for you! The banana I think looks very odd on lighter skin tones! I didn&#x27;t like the quality nor did I like to wear it.</li>
            <li> I have medium skin this works so well on me. I love it</li>
            <li> Love this!! Totally worth ever penny!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely subtle, almost to the point of not being able to tell it was applied. The consistency is like talcum powder which means it flies away very easily and wipes almost completely off when blending. The top of the container is the same kind of container you see on jarred herbs or a salt shaker with huge holes. It&#x27;s like a sieve. Definitely not the easiest way to use it.</li>
            <li> I have really dark circles under my eyes and this product really helps. I am latina and our skin tends to look sallow when you arent tanned. When you cover up those dark circles with just concealer it can look ashy rather than fresh and awake. I use a peach tone concealer and then apply the nye powder on top with a beauty blender (dont do it with a brush, the application sits on makeup and looks too cakey and yellow) and it really does the trick. Make sure you really blend it in so that it looks like a soft light on you. I also love that it doesnt sit in your fine undereye creases, even after a full day of wear.</li>
            <li> I gave it one star because I spent a lot of money and I can&#x27;t use it.  I didn&#x27;t realize it was for darker skin tones. :(</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I use as a setting powder and extra highlight under my eyes. My only complaint is that it makes a bit of a MESS, but I transferred some powder into an empty container for loose mineral powder... The trick is to do your makeup / concealer routine normally, then pat the powder on areas to set. You will look crazy for about 5-10 minutes, do something else while this powder sets. Then brush the extra off with a stippling brush and your makeup will look PERFECT and will be matte the rest of the day. I have received so many compliments on my skin and makeup since I started using this a few months ago, you will not be disappointed. Also would like to mention that I did my own makeup for my sister&#x27;s wedding and cried like a baby through the whole ceremony... was very careful to DAB with tissue, not rub and my makeup looked flawless the entire night! By the end of the evening, the girls who paid to have their makeup professionally done were even commenting on the waste of money it was for them! In case you were wondering I use a cream highlighter / concealer and normal liquid mattifying foundation and set with this powder...</li>
            <li> This Is A Cosmetic Must Have To Me Personally But It&#x27;s Good Lol</li>
            <li> The shipping was very quick. After reading all the great things about this powder I expected more from it. I did not notice much of a difference from the regular powder I use.</li>
            <li> Love! Perfect for setting the under eyes and anywhere else that you want to brighten up your face! Def will purchase more!!</li>
            <li> Great for my under eye dark circles!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend. She likes it and says that it works great. She is of a lighter complexion and was worried about it being too dark but it works just fine. I know nothing about this stuff except that she likes it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I. just. love. this. stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product - will repurchase but won&#x27;t have to for a while because it lasts forever!!</li>
            <li> Holds my makeup in place, very natural looking and feel, no breakouts and will last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I really like the powder.  I only wish that it would not sink into the age lines around my face. It is so hard to find the perfect fix for women over certain age outside of getting a face lift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d seen many makeup artist using this product and was a bit skeptical.  I didn&#x27;t think it was as good as they claimed it to be.  To my surprise, it really was!! I noticed a difference the first time I used it.  This will, now, be a must for me!!!  Received product very quickly!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my underwear and red spots on the sides of my nose. The 3 oz bottle is going to last me awhile.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed. I had high expectations after reading many other reviews.</li>
            <li> She loves it and that&#x27;s good enough for me</li>
            <li> Awesome best make up product I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
            <li> Lovee it ! I&#x27;m the kind of customer that will always read the reviews and everyone was saying that it comes out orange but to me it blended in really well &amp; makes a good highlighter</li>
            <li> The color wasn&#x27;t true to the other exact same products that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> BELIEVE THE HYPE.. Just got my Ben Nye this week and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. I am a fan of Kim Kardashian and I am a YouTube junkie. I&#x27;m not gonna lie this was my first time ordering online, and I was a tad bit weary. But all that was put to rest when I got my Banana powder ON TIME. I am a darker tone gal NW45 , and 607 Bronze in Marykay.. This product is so gorgeous when used to highlight!!! I got so many compliments on the glow it gave!!! I highly recommend this product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!! I plan to by this luxury powder in Topaz also!! I just can&#x27;t get enough!! If I could I would give this product a 10!! :) follow me on Instagram kissmy_sashay</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! It definitely does it&#x27;s job. I&#x27;m a light-skinned black woman and if I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;dumb it down&amp;#34; it would look like I have flour on my face. I suggest for a darker-skinned black woman, you use the more pigmented tone.&lt;br /&gt;The only con that I have about this powder is the dispenser. The cap should be larger so that you&#x27;re able to use the product out of the cap.</li>
            <li> have heard great things about this product for a while and finally decided to give it a try. unlike other setting powders it doesnt leave you looking like a ghost. very nice product</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It is such a fine powder. Check out a video review for this product: http://youtu.be/F4ShiRMRD4I</li>
            <li> i love your product . i love the way my skin feels and i recommended to all my closest friends.</li>
            <li> Why not?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe the hype!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is perfection for setting under eyes concealers and highlighters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Mac NW 40-45, so yes banana works on dark skin too...</li>
            <li> WIsh the packaging was easier to put a brush in or get product out..</li>
            <li> I was really excited to order this product, I just received it today and I saw the ingredients, and for a product that is made in USA, it has all the bad stuff that you&#x27;re not supposed to put on your skin: Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Methylparaben is widely used as a preservative in women&#x27;s cosmetics, such as skin creams and deodorants. This compound has been found intact within breast cancer tissues. Some researchers suggest that methylparaben may increase risk of breast cancer, or accelerate the growth of these tumors.&lt;br /&gt;I think I may just return it without even using it, I don&#x27;t want to put any of those chemicals on my face. Ben Nye: Use natural ingredients in your products.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS A GREAT BUY. IT WAS DELIVERED FASTER THAN EXPECTED. THE PRODUCT WORKS GREAT. THE BOTTLED LOOKS SMALL BUT YOU ONLY HAVE TO USE A SMALL AMOUT AT ONCE SO IT WILL LAST A GOOD WHILE. PLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> powder is fine but way over priced on amazon&#x27;s website. i paid triple the amount here. I WAS ABLE TO GET 3 POWDERS AT ANOTHER SITE FOR THE MONEY I PAID FOR 1 HERE</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have been using it everyday for over a year and i have barely used 1/4 of the bottle. Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> This was a stocking stuffer for my daughter on Xmas.  She said it is the best powder she has ever used. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Product is great for evening out skin tone. I apply it by  dappling  with a damp makeup sponge .</li>
            <li> It is fabulous but when it was not shippable to Canada, I decided to check out my local costume shoppe. Much to my delight, they sold all Ben Nye products including this one for for less money. Pays to check local...</li>
            <li> am very happy with this product, sets well,and assists concealers in camouflaging dark circles. that said I am fair skinned not sure how well this would work on dark skin</li>
            <li> Love it and will continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li> Wish they had a smaller bottle.  Lots of product goes a long way.  Don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s a talc since talc is bad for the skin.</li>
            <li> I like the powder, I just feel as though I&#x27;m not putting it on properly.</li>
            <li> OMG! Ladies (and gentlemen!) This finishing powder is worth every penny!!! It is fool proof and makes the skin glow! I feel like Beyonce when she said &amp;#34;I woke up like this, FLAWLESS!&amp;#34; You will absolutely love it! Add this to your make-up regimen. It will not let you down!!!</li>
            <li> Go Bananas, b-a-n-a-n-a-s/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works well for my girlfriend. She loves it. That works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product. Good shipping.</li>
            <li> I am OBSESSED with this and can&#x27;t live without it. It works great as a highlighting powder. I use it mostly to set my concealer under my eyes so that it highlights an otherwise dark area. I will be ordering this again and again.</li>
            <li> Works great as a finishing powder</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about the coverage and color matching but this powder is amazing! You don&#x27;t need to use very much and it provides great coverage without looking like you caked on a ton of powder. I have had dark circles under my eyes and usually have to apply a lot of under eye concealer but not with the Ben Nye powder. A little goes a long way and lasts all day too!</li>
            <li> This product is DEVINE! I can sit here and rant on for hours about banana powder but i&#x27;ll keep it short. It works GREAT on all skin types and tones from fair to deep skin tones and is the secret weapon in a flawless face routine.. I use it on all my clients accompanied with the Tarte Maracuja Miracle Foundation 12-Hour and get nothing but excitement from the gals. This is DEFINATELY a necessity !!!</li>
            <li> Dude! Ok, so I&#x27;ve been using this to set my makeup and it&#x27;s been working like a charm. You don&#x27;t need very much of it really. It doesn&#x27;t seem to get cakey and it doesn&#x27;t seem to let much oil through. Which is saying a lot for me, I&#x27;m a grease monster. I&#x27;m really glad I got this. Excellent product at an even better price,  what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> I LOVE this powder! I use it for my highlight! Will continue to buy and use!</li>
            <li> Great love it !!! This was the best purchase I have made for makeup in a while love it !!!</li>
            <li> FAKE. It&#x27;s certainly NOT Banana. Have used Ben Nye in the past. And it is an awesome powder. Sadly Amazon sent this tragic mess. Never again!  Will stick to T. Leclerc Banane Loose Powder. Nothing beats it. Including the REAL Ben Nye.</li>
            <li> like it and it&#x27;s work</li>
            <li> thaaaaaaaaaaaank you so much I like it and I will order it again</li>
            <li> Not the orginal products</li>
            <li> I would say I like this product but not love. I&#x27;ve been doing makeup for a little over a year and it does blend but if your a darker girl like myself then you&#x27;ll need to ensure your blending very well along with another powder to simmer tone. The hype must be for those that&#x27;s a lighter skin tone.</li>
            <li> Good quality product. I like it for highlighting. I gave it a low review because I felt that it was over priced.</li>
            <li> Brightens up under the eye beautifully!</li>
