    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the price, the timeliness on the receipt of my product and the effects of the product. I would order from this person over and over again!!</li>
            <li> it grew my hair back in two weeks time. . . .the results are amazing</li>
            <li> I will be ordering again! ASAP, these vits have done an amazing job in the less than a month I have taken them. The price is great also!</li>
            <li> Really like the nouritress products, but I ordered the edge repair day and night? do not buy this it has the exactly the same ingredients there is no different between the day or night.  You are just buying double the product and that makes it last longer, but if that&#x27;s what you want then you should not be tricked into making that purchase.  I try calling nouritress and wanted someone to explain the difference to me? had to leave a message and NEVER received a call back, very disappointed.  I have been telling others about this product and encouraging them to buy no I am encouraging people not to fall for the switch and bate of the day and night it does not exist.  Shame on you guys we work to hard for our money for you to take advantage of us, and if you do not know these are the same then shame on you for not knowing what you are selling.  You have a good product don&#x27;t you don&#x27;t have to use trickery.  Boo to day and night take the sun and moon off implying that there is a difference.  Buyer beware&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin actually works.  Did not believe the reviews.  After trying the product, I can see that it works.  Both sides of my head has x2 half dollar coin size bald areas.  Nouritress thickened the hair in the area and has promoted hair growth to my scalp.  I did not expect a significant miricle, but I can see a measurable difference.</li>
            <li> They seemed OKAY! like any other hair,skin,nail vitamin only more expensive! I did not see a huge change in my hair, but I really didn&#x27;t take it long enough to see what It MAY/ or MAY NOT do. If you want to spend the money I say try it! I had absolutely no adverse affects from taking it I&#x27;m just being a frugal college student.</li>
            <li> I love these vitamins they really work.  My hair is healthier and stronger</li>
            <li> This purchase was totally disappointing! Nuritress bottles come in 60 tablets and not in 30 tablets. I do not know how this retailer is allowed to sell a fraudulent product like this and get away with it! I have noticed that amazon is allowing other retailers to sell fake and fraudulent items as well and claiming and selling them like it is the real thing! I will not be making anymore beauty purchases again from amazon! Buyers beware!</li>
            <li> I wear my hair in natural locs.  My loctician noticed the difference in my hair after taking these for only two weeks.  She has a fit and can tell if there is a gap in my use of it.</li>
            <li> They got me on this one.....or I didn&#x27;t read the label.  There are only a fifteen day supply in this bottle.  The recommended dosage is two pills per day.  It&#x27;s already time to buy another supply.  Next time I will by the larger bottle.  The pills vitamins work great!  I have used them before and my hair really did thicken up when I used them the time before.  I expect I will notice a difference in my hair with the next bottle I purchase.</li>
            <li> Price to high for only a 15 day supply. Best to order directly from company.</li>
            <li> I am seeing hair in areas I thought I never would.  I will be ordering again and again.  I wish I could find it in a store in my town.</li>
            <li> Great product, my hair is Healthy and Stronger than ever. I recommend it for any one that is having problems with Hair thinning..</li>
            <li> old vitamins. past exploration date. would not recommend.</li>

            <li> I love this product. My hair is healthier, stronger and is growing nicely. Totally recommend! My stylist recommended it to me cause of thinning hair and I am glad I listened to her great advice.</li>
            <li> ...that this would thicken and grow more hair, as suggested on the website (although I bought it through here). It made my scalp itch and it took 3 months for half an inch to grow. A bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> Excellent vitamin - it helped my hair grow longer and stronger. I highly recommend it for anyone who is looking for longer, thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Lone nouritress, not only works for your hair makes you feel good</li>
            <li> I did not see any improvement.</li>
            <li> I have a bottle that was given to me and the expiration date is 2013 but it is not open can I still use it</li>
            <li> I like the product &amp; my husband like it for men. They have this product for me. It helps &amp; it works</li>
            <li> Just order my third bottle of this vitamin looking to buy more in the furture if anyone want there hair to grow this is it I also told all my friends about this product they are buying it too thank you</li>
            <li> They were old  and the outer shells were cracked</li>
            <li> I thought is was good for my hair but was taken back when it changed the color of my urine and caused constipation</li>
            <li> Great product , grows hair , and nails !</li>
            <li> I have balding areas with no hair at all around my edges as well as at the crown of my head and I was actually one month away from having hair transplant surgery when a friend referred me to NouriTress.com! Oh my goodness, in only one month of taking the vitamins, my bald areas are visibly filling in and there are sprigs of hair growing along my edges. My hairdresser has even noticed. Not only that, my skin has cleared up and my nails are stronger and thicker as well. I am a believer!! These vitamins saved me $8,000 in the cost of surgery and I plan to purchase and take them until my hair is completely restored and beyond. AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks 5 star AAAA++++++</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is doing its necessary job.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t working. Didn&#x27;t saw any improvement in my hair and were very disappointed. Will never recommended it and it&#x27;s the worst I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> first of all the pills came all broken up.I don&#x27;t believe these are the real nourtress hair vitamins very very disappointed at the way they were all crushed up and the bad part was I ordered 3 bottles and they were both crushed.I am crushed and wasted my hard earned money.</li>
            <li> The pills looked old the outer shells were cracked, I eneded up having to throw them away, without using them.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite hair products</li>
            <li> The vitamins were cracked I was very disappointed. I was not able to to seet the resultds of taking the vitamins because I hadto throw some of them away.</li>
            <li> Misrepresented.  Only a 15 day supply.</li>
            <li> pills came in broken and seemed very old</li>
            <li> If you are considering taking these vitamins then please do so when i first started to take nouritress vitamins i immediate notice a change with my hair, nails and skin excellent product would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using these vitamins for 3 months and I am halfway through the 4th month supply. I will purchase 2 more bottles since the product recommends consistent use for 4 month to get the best results. I want to use it for 5 months to determine how my hair is doing as far as lenghth, health, and density. The edges of my hairline that was damage due to braid last year has started to filled in considerably. I also lost a penny size spot in the back neck area that is finally starting to see some peach fuzz after what seemed like an eternity.</li>
            <li> I was recommend  this product by a salon stylist.  She was telling me my edges were almost gone&lt;br /&gt;  and you need help.</li>
            <li> My fingernails have grown.</li>
    </ol>
