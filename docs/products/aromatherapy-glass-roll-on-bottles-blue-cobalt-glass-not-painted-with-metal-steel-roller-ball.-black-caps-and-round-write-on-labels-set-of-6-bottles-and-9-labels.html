            <li>nice bottles...</li>
            <li>They look nice...</li>
            <li>I liked Cobalt color and the metal ball instead of plastic.</li>
            <li>most of the metal balls fell out of the top, otherwise the glass bottles are nice, but can&#x27;t use them after the ball falls out</li>
            <li>Love that they have the metal roller ball vs a plastic one.</li>
            <li>I love the bottles but it took forever to get them.</li>
            <li>All three of the glass bottles were ok but it took almost 4 weeks to receive them.</li>
            <li>these bottles roll on metal use them to essences like mint oil refreshes and relaxes the metal ball more</li>

            <li>I love the metal roller ball &amp; cobalt blue glass for use with my essential oils.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li>I use these roller ball bottles with FCO and some essential oils and after a couple days use the roller balls would just fall right out</li>
            <li>This worked very well for mixing and using essential oil blends.</li>
            <li>Bottles are nice but the metal balls fall out, poor quality</li>
            <li>Poor quality on the black cap didn&#x27;t fit very well and one came cracked.</li>

            <li> Took a bit to arrive. Most work great but had one roller come out..:little messy and unable to put back in. Reason for the three stars.</li>
            <li> Took several weeks to arrive. Metal balls fall out and spill oil everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;I found higher grade rollers elsewhere!</li>
            <li> Love these, easy and do not leak. Good packaging.  Did take a bit long for dellivery but it was around the xmas holidays....</li>

            <li> I love these bottles! I had plastic roller balls before and these are so much nicer!</li>
            <li> nice bottles...but the roller ball came out after only a couple of uses!!! no way to get it back in and it stay!! useless! This is not good....</li>
            <li> They look nice...but the two I have used so far have leaked and the cap does not fit on right it&#x27;s crooked. And trust me I know how to use roller balls and put caps on. I&#x27;m not sure if they are defective or what. I just wish they didn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> These are great! I love the metal roller ball &amp; cobalt blue glass for use with my essential oils. Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> most of the metal balls fell out of the top, otherwise the glass bottles are nice, but can&#x27;t use them after the ball falls out</li>

            <li> Balls fall out, would buy again.</li>
            <li> I use these roller ball bottles with FCO and some essential oils and after a couple days use the roller balls would just fall right out and then the oil would pour out or leak everywhere.</li>
            <li> i used these for essential oils with fractionated coconut oil.  They oils broke down the plastic and the metal ball loosened and came out within a few days. These do not hold up to essential oils.</li>
            <li> I liked Cobalt color and the metal ball instead of plastic. Poor quality on the black cap didn&#x27;t fit very well and one came cracked. It took 3-4 weeks to arrive. Not sure if I will reorder.</li>

            <li> The caps don&#x27;t fit correctly once the roller is installed. This issue was with every bottle.</li>
