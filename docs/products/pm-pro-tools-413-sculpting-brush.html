            <li>so much better made.</li>
            <li>Ordered these in August 2012 and just ordered 5 more.  </li>
            <li>The bristle tips are what fall off and cause me to buy more.  </li>
            <li>So... they could be made better maybe</li>
            <li>And my clients love it too:)</li>
            <li>I love these Paul Mitchell brushes.</li>
            <li>so I checked on Amazon and was pleased to find it there.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>

            <li>Had one for many years</li>
            <li>This brush is a knock off for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found one like it.</li>
            <li>Linda &amp; daughter both agree it&#x27;s a great brush, plus reasonable.</li>
            <li>Love this brush.  </li>
            <li>Not as pliable and well-made as authentic Paul Mitchell brushes, but does</li>
            <li>so I ordered 1 of these because I was so glad I found them.  </li>
            <li>I just love this brush.</li>
            <li>on your hair like so many are.</li>
            <li>My favorite brush used to buy it from my hairdresser.</li>
            <li>Glad to get it here</li>
            <li>Leave it to Paul to create such a wonderful brush.</li>
            <li>The sculpting brush is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Received in time, love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>But that was OK.</li>
            <li>(I think I had my last one for about 10 years), are easily washable, and feel wonderful on your scalp.</li>
            <li>Very cheap compared to my original</li>
            <li>It is also easy to maneuver when I&#x27;m juggling the blow dryer and brush.  </li>
            <li>Never pulls, easy to work with...</li>
            <li>I have fine hair.  </li>
            <li>the job just fine.</li>
            <li>is fine.</li>
            <li>And it was much more reasonably priced!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap product</li>
            <li>Light weight and glides through the hair.  </li>
            <li>Guess that is why it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>These are nice and high quality.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also extremely light in weight- the wood is made out of super cheap pine or something.</li>
            <li>My original lasted for</li>
            <li>I had an original 413 for -oh, my gosh, 12 years.</li>
            <li>I have owned three of this model brush over the past 25 years - always an excellent brush.  </li>
            <li>Not made as well as my original.  </li>
            <li>This is not close to the original.</li>
            <li>This is a new plum color that I have not seen before and really liked it.</li>
            <li>So I was delighted to see that Amazon had them (or they were available from 3rd party sellers).</li>
            <li>It is not what I expected but is a good brush for styling hair,not very good to use when hair is wet for drying.</li>
            <li>Received correct brush, but ordered black,but received a bright RED one.&lt;br /&gt;No notice that another color would be automatically substituted until received.</li>
            <li>The transaction went quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, my daughter and I had this same brush for over 15 years or more.</li>
            <li>Also, the pins fall out rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Wonderful for long or short hair.</li>
            <li>I use this and then smooth my straight hair with a boar bristle brush to soften it.  </li>
            <li>After a month the whole bristle part rubber and all came apart from the cheap handle.</li>
            <li>After a month the whole bristle part rubber and all came apart from the cheap handle.</li>
            <li>I dont feel like this item was an authentic item as it was much lighter that the one I had and the quality was very</li>
            <li>The only thing I would have liked is the option to choose a color.  </li>
            <li>The quality of this brush seems to be the same as the two I already own.</li>
            <li>It is also very light weight - not the same qualilty as the original</li>
            <li>I had an original 413 for a few years and loved the brush until my dogs got ahold of it.</li>
            <li>My wife had to toss her old brush, after 15 years, and was dreading having to find a new one she liked but the brush was/is the right one for her.</li>
            <li>I enjoy great little products that are tried and true and make a big difference.  </li>
            <li>It works fine but would love to have back the classic PM wood brush,</li>
            <li>Ordered black received bright orange..</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just as good as the black that was the color of my original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It arrived and it is bright RED - not black as pictured.  </li>
            <li>Not as fabulous as my original Paul Mitchell wooden brush.</li>
            <li>Knowing that I wouldn&#x27;t be satisfied with anything else I decided to look online and was pleasantly surprised that I found a new one!  </li>
            <li>when I bought my first 413?</li>
            <li>(my dog ate my first one</li>
            <li>I had no idea they were available in different colors and was pleasantly surprised when this one showed up purple :]</li>
            <li>husband has used this brush for many years, but did not want a RED brush.</li>
            <li>embarrassed to admit that my first model of this brush lasted about 10 years...</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t able to purchase one at local salons</li>
            <li>I have been a hairstylist since 1982 when Paul Mitchell first hit the salon world.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>As always I check Amazon first for whatever I am looking for.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it bristles fell out.  </li>
            <li>Not what I would have chosen, but it still brushes my hair the same  :)</li>
            <li>Does not work like the real ones!</li>
            <li>We received bright lime green.</li>
            <li>the brush is a complete knock off from the real paul mitchell 413!!!  </li>
            <li>Good size, lightweight, no static and&lt;br /&gt;bristles are great for my thick, course hair.</li>
            <li>But I found the postage very high and the seller would not reduce it, but I loved the brush in the past, my dog ate the one I treasured, so I paid the high postage and bought extra brushes to make the postage more reasonable.</li>
            <li>Strong enough for a man, but made for a women.</li>
            <li>I have used this hairbrush in the past and have liked it very much.</li>
            <li>and I broke my second one in a fit of unrelated to the brush rage).  </li>
            <li>They cannot be real products of PM.</li>
            <li>They cannot be real products of PM.</li>
            <li>Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I really like Paul Mitichell hairbrushes.  </li>
            <li>They cannot be real products of PM.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon for having this brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Even better, my first two were black.  </li>
            <li>and they still last long enough for me to be happy with my purchases.</li>
            <li>I am sure most people wouldn&#x27;t mind the red but at least show it in the picture.</li>
            <li>the classic Paul Mitchell 413 Sculpting Brush.</li>
            <li>a male who uses a brush instead of a comb, I&#x27;ve been loyal to the PM 413 for, well,</li>
            <li>I received exactly what was ordered &amp; exactly the same as the ones I bought years ago.  </li>
            <li>ok in the last 20 years i have only used paul mitchell sculpting brush 413 this one seems cheaper then normal</li>
            <li>Better than hot pink, especially for him.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend you don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li>But for the past 20 and 8 years respectively, my wife and daughter have favored my PM 413 more than anything they&#x27;ve used with their relatively long hair styles, so my million year old 413 is now literally starting to fall apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so long I&#x27;m sure because I wear relatively short hair styles</li>
            <li>- I agree with other reviewers - this is a cheap knock off not a Paul Mitchell product.</li>
            <li>my brand new 413 arrived</li>
            <li>i just got a new 413 made of bamboo and tea tree it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a new brush.</li>
            <li>I have had this brush for years and needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>A new one for me and one for him.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this model hairbrush for over 10 years and obviously like it very much.</li>
            <li>(the first brush I thought was a fluke but the second did the exact same thing).</li>
            <li>This was exactly the same brush that I have bought in the salons over the years, my daughters and I always fight over thse, so I am stocking up on these and throwing out all the others that no one ever likes to use.  </li>
            <li>I only like a wood brush due to plastic causing static in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Had to order a new one when my old one lost all of its rubber ends on the bristles.</li>
            <li>I would have liked a black one instead of red and white because I color my hair</li>
            <li>As a professional cosmetologist I would never recommend buying salon brand items off the internet, they cannot guaranteed by the manufacturer unless sold from a salon or cosmetology school.</li>
            <li>The brush received was the type I wanted, but I was unpleasantly surprised that it was purple.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised when it arrived in a hot pink color.</li>
            <li>I have several of these that I have bought over the past few years and this brush is very nice and does NOT look like a knockoff.  </li>
            <li>They are pretty much identical and feel the same and no funny &#x27;smell&#x27;.</li>
            <li>My original brush is 12 years old and the handle is a bit worn with some of the white tips missing.  </li>
            <li>after losing about 6 or 7 bristles, i finally purchased a new replacement.  </li>
            <li>This new brush seems to have the same quality</li>
            <li>I still have my old Paul Mitchell brush that has lasted me almost ten years and besides for the rubber getting old and giving way it would have still been usable.  </li>
            <li>and my original is starting to deteriorate a little.</li>
            <li>and I wanted no other.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was definitely worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;There was a little delay, but everything worked out well.</li>
            <li>The handle is wooden just like the classic brush and the color they sent me was red.</li>
            <li>I posted pictures of the new purple brush and my old pink one.  </li>
            <li>after only 2 months, i left the new one in a hotel...</li>
            <li>Other reviews also suggest that they are receiving various colors other than the black pictured on the product page; the one I received (from Amazon 3rd party seller Lush Essence) was bright green</li>
            <li>Really would have preferred a black on my vanity.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great brush, whether I&#x27;m wearing a little long, pretty short or spikin&#x27; it.</li>

            <li> The sculpting brush is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Received in time, love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> But that was OK.</li>
            <li> (I think I had my last one for about 10 years), are easily washable, and feel wonderful on your scalp.</li>
            <li> Very cheap compared to my original</li>
            <li> It is also easy to maneuver when I&#x27;m juggling the blow dryer and brush.  </li>
            <li> Never pulls, easy to work with...</li>
            <li> I have fine hair.  </li>
            <li> the job just fine.</li>
            <li> is fine.</li>
            <li> And it was much more reasonably priced!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap product</li>
            <li> Light weight and glides through the hair.  </li>
            <li> Guess that is why it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> These are nice and high quality.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also extremely light in weight- the wood is made out of super cheap pine or something.</li>
            <li> My original lasted for</li>
            <li> I had an original 413 for -oh, my gosh, 12 years.</li>
            <li> I have owned three of this model brush over the past 25 years - always an excellent brush.  </li>
            <li> Not made as well as my original.  </li>
            <li> This is not close to the original.</li>
            <li> This is a new plum color that I have not seen before and really liked it.</li>
            <li> So I was delighted to see that Amazon had them (or they were available from 3rd party sellers).</li>
            <li> It is not what I expected but is a good brush for styling hair,not very good to use when hair is wet for drying.</li>
            <li> Received correct brush, but ordered black,but received a bright RED one.&lt;br /&gt;No notice that another color would be automatically substituted until received.</li>
            <li> The transaction went quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, my daughter and I had this same brush for over 15 years or more.</li>
            <li> Also, the pins fall out rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for long or short hair.</li>
            <li> I use this and then smooth my straight hair with a boar bristle brush to soften it.  </li>
            <li> After a month the whole bristle part rubber and all came apart from the cheap handle.</li>
            <li> After a month the whole bristle part rubber and all came apart from the cheap handle.</li>
            <li> I dont feel like this item was an authentic item as it was much lighter that the one I had and the quality was very</li>
            <li> The only thing I would have liked is the option to choose a color.  </li>
            <li> The quality of this brush seems to be the same as the two I already own.</li>
            <li> It is also very light weight - not the same qualilty as the original</li>
            <li> I had an original 413 for a few years and loved the brush until my dogs got ahold of it.</li>
            <li> My wife had to toss her old brush, after 15 years, and was dreading having to find a new one she liked but the brush was/is the right one for her.</li>
            <li> I enjoy great little products that are tried and true and make a big difference.  </li>
            <li> It works fine but would love to have back the classic PM wood brush,</li>
            <li> Ordered black received bright orange..</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just as good as the black that was the color of my original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It arrived and it is bright RED - not black as pictured.  </li>
            <li> Not as fabulous as my original Paul Mitchell wooden brush.</li>
            <li> Knowing that I wouldn&#x27;t be satisfied with anything else I decided to look online and was pleasantly surprised that I found a new one!  </li>
            <li> when I bought my first 413?</li>
            <li> (my dog ate my first one</li>
            <li> I had no idea they were available in different colors and was pleasantly surprised when this one showed up purple :]</li>
            <li> husband has used this brush for many years, but did not want a RED brush.</li>
            <li> embarrassed to admit that my first model of this brush lasted about 10 years...</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t able to purchase one at local salons</li>
            <li> I have been a hairstylist since 1982 when Paul Mitchell first hit the salon world.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> As always I check Amazon first for whatever I am looking for.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it bristles fell out.  </li>
            <li> Not what I would have chosen, but it still brushes my hair the same  :)</li>
            <li> Does not work like the real ones!</li>
            <li> We received bright lime green.</li>
            <li> the brush is a complete knock off from the real paul mitchell 413!!!  </li>
            <li> Good size, lightweight, no static and&lt;br /&gt;bristles are great for my thick, course hair.</li>
            <li> But I found the postage very high and the seller would not reduce it, but I loved the brush in the past, my dog ate the one I treasured, so I paid the high postage and bought extra brushes to make the postage more reasonable.</li>
            <li> Strong enough for a man, but made for a women.</li>
            <li> I have used this hairbrush in the past and have liked it very much.</li>
            <li> and I broke my second one in a fit of unrelated to the brush rage).  </li>
            <li> They cannot be real products of PM.</li>
            <li> They cannot be real products of PM.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I really like Paul Mitichell hairbrushes.  </li>
            <li> They cannot be real products of PM.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon for having this brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Even better, my first two were black.  </li>
            <li> and they still last long enough for me to be happy with my purchases.</li>
            <li> I am sure most people wouldn&#x27;t mind the red but at least show it in the picture.</li>
            <li> the classic Paul Mitchell 413 Sculpting Brush.</li>
            <li> a male who uses a brush instead of a comb, I&#x27;ve been loyal to the PM 413 for, well,</li>
            <li> I received exactly what was ordered &amp; exactly the same as the ones I bought years ago.  </li>
            <li> ok in the last 20 years i have only used paul mitchell sculpting brush 413 this one seems cheaper then normal</li>
            <li> Better than hot pink, especially for him.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend you don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> But for the past 20 and 8 years respectively, my wife and daughter have favored my PM 413 more than anything they&#x27;ve used with their relatively long hair styles, so my million year old 413 is now literally starting to fall apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so long I&#x27;m sure because I wear relatively short hair styles</li>
            <li> - I agree with other reviewers - this is a cheap knock off not a Paul Mitchell product.</li>
            <li> my brand new 413 arrived</li>
            <li> i just got a new 413 made of bamboo and tea tree it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a new brush.</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for years and needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> A new one for me and one for him.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this model hairbrush for over 10 years and obviously like it very much.</li>
            <li> (the first brush I thought was a fluke but the second did the exact same thing).</li>
            <li> This was exactly the same brush that I have bought in the salons over the years, my daughters and I always fight over thse, so I am stocking up on these and throwing out all the others that no one ever likes to use.  </li>
            <li> I only like a wood brush due to plastic causing static in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Had to order a new one when my old one lost all of its rubber ends on the bristles.</li>
            <li> I would have liked a black one instead of red and white because I color my hair</li>
            <li> As a professional cosmetologist I would never recommend buying salon brand items off the internet, they cannot guaranteed by the manufacturer unless sold from a salon or cosmetology school.</li>
            <li> The brush received was the type I wanted, but I was unpleasantly surprised that it was purple.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised when it arrived in a hot pink color.</li>
            <li> I have several of these that I have bought over the past few years and this brush is very nice and does NOT look like a knockoff.  </li>
            <li> They are pretty much identical and feel the same and no funny &#x27;smell&#x27;.</li>
            <li> My original brush is 12 years old and the handle is a bit worn with some of the white tips missing.  </li>
            <li> after losing about 6 or 7 bristles, i finally purchased a new replacement.  </li>
            <li> This new brush seems to have the same quality</li>
            <li> I still have my old Paul Mitchell brush that has lasted me almost ten years and besides for the rubber getting old and giving way it would have still been usable.  </li>
            <li> and my original is starting to deteriorate a little.</li>
            <li> and I wanted no other.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was definitely worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;There was a little delay, but everything worked out well.</li>
            <li> The handle is wooden just like the classic brush and the color they sent me was red.</li>
            <li> I posted pictures of the new purple brush and my old pink one.  </li>
            <li> after only 2 months, i left the new one in a hotel...</li>
            <li> Other reviews also suggest that they are receiving various colors other than the black pictured on the product page; the one I received (from Amazon 3rd party seller Lush Essence) was bright green</li>
            <li> Really would have preferred a black on my vanity.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great brush, whether I&#x27;m wearing a little long, pretty short or spikin&#x27; it.</li>
            <li> Really annoyed I have to type so many words before you will take my rating! :-/</li>
            <li> I have had several of these brushes since I was little, but recently can&#x27;t find them where I live.  </li>
            <li> and i not a big fan of colored brushes i prefer old school black and white</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that these were purple instead of black like the last ones I got.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Received the brush and was surprised it was red not hot pink or purple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several other types (locally) that seem to be the same but just don&#x27;t get thru my hair.</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised to get a black one with gold on the bristles.  </li>
            <li> This brush lasts a long time</li>
            <li> It had been so long since I purchased it</li>
            <li> Strange color choices.  </li>
            <li> no matter is my hair was waist long or 2&amp;#34</li>
            <li> ; long.  </li>
            <li> Hope this one lasts as long.  </li>
            <li> I am so sorry I threw my original out for these 2 pieces of junk.</li>
            <li> I tried several other kinds, but none worked as well.</li>
            <li> This hair brush is a &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34;, I use every day to brush and dry my hair.</li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;m not sure what the difference between an American plastic smell and a Chinese plastic smell even is, but I can confirm that the 413 I received is odorless.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for black as shown in the pic once you click on the item to purchase however red</li>
            <li> The picture posted was the traditional black color that Paul Mitchell&#x27;s brushes are manufactured with.  </li>
            <li> hopefully I will get purple or pink</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about a month, and the Paul Mitchell label on the front has fallen off, as well as several bristles are now missing.</li>
            <li> They show the brush in pink and purple.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick and course hair now, and the size, weight and ability of the brush to penetrate and \\&quot;grab\\&quot; all of the layers of my hair at once when I am brushing my hair is why it&#x27;s become such a must-have for me.  </li>
            <li> Some of the other reviews say they received a knockoff, but mine isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The other will come apart no doubt.</li>
            <li> They were pink or purple and I went with the dark purple.  </li>
            <li> I did not read the other reviews before I purchased - I should have.  </li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t be returned due to their time constraint on returns.</li>
            <li> I just wish they would attach them some other way.  </li>
            <li> Another review here complained about a \\&quot;Chinese plastic smell:\\</li>
            <li> But, the price has gone down also</li>
            <li> but I use it every day for a year and a half and the brush takes a punishment.</li>
            <li> the black that was shown.</li>
            <li> Mine was black</li>
            <li> received this item late and it was missing several bristles.</li>
            <li> I have previously owned this brush that I bought at a salon</li>
            <li> They do not guarantee a color, I received black and gold.</li>
            <li> I wish I could have gotten it in black but</li>
            <li> However, both times, the cushion came out after the first couple of uses and I had to crazy glue it into the handle</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> so the brush takes little abuse with just me using it.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to buy this online without knowing what color I would get</li>
            <li> I think it is a little over priced for the quality.</li>
            <li> I love the give in the base so that it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair as hard and the tips on the end of each bristle.</li>
            <li> He would not allow this cheap crap to have his name on it.</li>
            <li> AND A WASTE OF MONEY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell #413 Sculpting Brush is still my number one go to everyday brush</li>
            <li> He would not allow this cheap crap to have his name on it.</li>
            <li> I contacted the company bc when the brush arrived it was already missing bristles.</li>
            <li> response from them was that they do not sell fakes and to send them pictures of the missing bristles.</li>
            <li> He would not allow this cheap crap to have his name on it.</li>
            <li> the color comes off on the white base so it will be very unsightly in a short&lt;br /&gt;time.</li>
            <li> Well they are crap and nothing like the original.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this brush twice over the past 10 years because it was small with long bristles that go through my wavy, thick hair.</li>
            <li> They are crap and nothing like the original.</li>
            <li> This product was disappointing - it was in a color I did not order, and the bristles were less than a previous brush by the same company.</li>
            <li> This was unfortunate as they were to be stocking stuffers for my children, and I did not have enough time to reorder before Xmas.</li>
            <li> Lite weight and bristles aren&#x27;t too hard.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> Not authentic!</li>
            <li> The brush I received was an ugly orange color, not pink or purple as shown.  </li>
            <li> and if finally wore ugly, not out.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was very sad when I broke my second brush.  </li>
            <li> AND A WASTE OF MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> To this day no response from them which shows me they dont stand behind their products</li>
            <li> They are false advertising and scamming people.</li>
            <li> old brush looked awful but I never could find one just like it</li>
            <li> and I hit the nail on the head when I said fake.</li>
            <li> Wondered how I could go wrong.</li>
            <li> REALLY BAD KNOCK OFF</li>
            <li> REALLY BAD KNOCK OFF</li>
            <li> I never was so disappointed in my life.</li>
            <li> Was a bit disappointed when they came in</li>
            <li> I never was so disappointed in my life.</li>
            <li> I told them I didnt appreciate a crap knock off</li>
            <li> /&gt;Major Disappointment!!</li>
            <li> It can detangle the worst hair even without detangler spray!  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this same (type) brush for over 15 years. Had to order a new one when my old one lost all of its rubber ends on the bristles. Perfect  styling brush!!</li>
            <li> I would have liked a black one instead of red and white because I color my hair&lt;br /&gt;and the color comes off on the white base so it will be very unsightly in a short&lt;br /&gt;time.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush for fine hair. I have used it for 20 years and use it every day. I have only had to replace it twice in all that time.</li>
            <li> I have had several of these brushes since I was little, but recently can&#x27;t find them where I live.  Knowing that I wouldn&#x27;t be satisfied with anything else I decided to look online and was pleasantly surprised that I found a new one!  This brush lasts a long time (I think I had my last one for about 10 years), are easily washable, and feel wonderful on your scalp.</li>
            <li> Favorite brushes ever</li>
            <li> Used a friends brush while on vacation &amp; ordered one as soon as I got home!&lt;br /&gt;Love it for blow drying &amp; the volume.</li>
            <li> Ah yes...the classic Paul Mitchell 413 Sculpting Brush. Strong enough for a man, but made for a women. Or am I thinking of an ad for [[ASIN:B003EMJHG4 something else]] from a million years ago when I bought my first 413? Anyway....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a male who uses a brush instead of a comb, I&#x27;ve been loyal to the PM 413 for, well, like I said above, a million years or so and my original is starting to deteriorate a little. So I was delighted to see that Amazon had them (or they were available from 3rd party sellers). My original lasted for so long I&#x27;m sure because I wear relatively short hair styles so the brush takes little abuse with just me using it. But for the past 20 and 8 years respectively, my wife and daughter have favored my PM 413 more than anything they&#x27;ve used with their relatively long hair styles, so my million year old 413 is now literally starting to fall apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my brand new 413 arrived and it&#x27;s perfect. Some of the other reviews say they received a knockoff, but mine isn&#x27;t. Another review here complained about a \\&quot;Chinese plastic smell:\\&quot; I&#x27;m not sure what the difference between an American plastic smell and a Chinese plastic smell even is, but I can confirm that the 413 I received is odorless. Other reviews also suggest that they are receiving various colors other than the black pictured on the product page; the one I received (from Amazon 3rd party seller Lush Essence) was bright green and it&#x27;s just as good as the black that was the color of my original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great brush, whether I&#x27;m wearing a little long, pretty short or spikin&#x27; it. And m&#x27;ladies like it too.</li>
            <li> Simply put.....I LOVE THEM as I ordered 2.  Have shown them to my hair stylist and he loves them too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this model hairbrush for over 10 years and obviously like it very much. The price I paid for tis order was excellent.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair.  This gets tangles out nicely and shines my hair.  I use this and then smooth my straight hair with a boar bristle brush to soften it.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> I love this style of Paul Mitchell brush.  This is my 3rd one in 15 years (my dog ate my first one and I broke my second one in a fit of unrelated to the brush rage).  Needless to say, I was very sad when I broke my second brush.  It had been so long since I purchased it, I thought I would never find another one to replace it.  Thankfully, I found it on Amazon and it made my day!  Even better, my first two were black.  I had no idea they were available in different colors and was pleasantly surprised when this one showed up purple :]</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for over 15 years. I bought one for my mom and sister for Christmas this year and was very satisfied with it. This is a new plum color that I have not seen before and really liked it. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Received the brush and was surprised it was red not hot pink or purple. So I ordered another one today hopefully I will get purple or pink we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;If the product is red it should be listed as red I am sure most people wouldn&#x27;t mind the red but at least show it in the picture.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my 3rd Paul Mitchell 413 Sculpting brush because I&#x27;ve worn 2 of them out over the course of about 15 years.  I have long, thick and course hair now, and the size, weight and ability of the brush to penetrate and \\&quot;grab\\&quot; all of the layers of my hair at once when I am brushing my hair is why it&#x27;s become such a must-have for me.  It is also easy to maneuver when I&#x27;m juggling the blow dryer and brush.  I enjoy great little products that are tried and true and make a big difference.  Kudos to the Paul Mitchell Company!</li>
            <li> Great product.  We&#x27;ve had one of these before and if finally wore ugly, not out.  Purchased three more.  Love em.</li>
            <li> MY HAIR LOVES THIS BRUSH AND SO DO MY HANDS.  THE HANDLE HAS A NICE FEEL TO IT. BUY IT YOU WILL LIKE IT TOO.</li>
            <li> The brush is loved by everyone in my family.  When my children come home for a visit the brushes seem to walk out the door with them when they leave!  They hold up to daily use for years.  My original brush is 12 years old and the handle is a bit worn with some of the white tips missing.  Hope the company continues to keep making a great product.</li>
            <li> Received correct brush, but ordered black,but received a bright RED one.&lt;br /&gt;No notice that another color would be automatically substituted until received. The invoice stated it could be one of several colors, but not stated before ordering.&lt;br /&gt;My husband has used this brush for many years, but did not want a RED brush.</li>
            <li> I had an original 413 for -oh, my gosh, 12 years. I ordered 2 of these because I was so glad I found them. Well they are crap and nothing like the original. Don&#x27;t order them.  After a month the whole bristle part rubber and all came apart from the cheap handle. I never was so disappointed in my life. They cannot be real products of PM. He would not allow this cheap crap to have his name on it. The other will come apart no doubt. I am so sorry I threw my original out for these 2 pieces of junk. REALLY BAD KNOCK OFF AND A WASTE OF MONEY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Major Disappointment!!</li>
            <li> I have several of these that I have bought over the past few years and this brush is very nice and does NOT look like a knockoff.  The seller was great and the brushes arrived fast.  These are nice and high quality.  I posted pictures of the new purple brush and my old pink one.  They are pretty much identical and feel the same and no funny &#x27;smell&#x27;.</li>
            <li> The transaction went quickly. I love these brushes.</li>
            <li> This product was disappointing - it was in a color I did not order, and the bristles were less than a previous brush by the same company.</li>
            <li> I have had the paul mitchell sculpting brush for years and was looking for a replacement.  This one is just like it and came in a cute purple color.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is a great hairbrush! I got several and gave as gifts. I was pleasantly surprised that these were purple instead of black like the last ones I got.&lt;br /&gt;Love em!!</li>
            <li> The brush is great and just like one I have had for 20 years - except for the color.  Strange color choices.  They were pink or purple and I went with the dark purple.  Really would have preferred a black on my vanity.</li>
            <li> embarrassed to admit that my first model of this brush lasted about 10 years... after losing about 6 or 7 bristles, i finally purchased a new replacement.  just as great as the original!  after only 2 months, i left the new one in a hotel... so this is my 3rd time purchasing this brush- it&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> I have owned three of this model brush over the past 25 years - always an excellent brush.  I did not read the other reviews before I purchased - I should have.  It arrived and it is bright RED - not black as pictured.  It is also very light weight - not the same qualilty as the original - I agree with other reviewers - this is a cheap knock off not a Paul Mitchell product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the one I like!!</li>
            <li> Not as fabulous as my original Paul Mitchell wooden brush. It feels a bit plastic and the tynes are stiffer. It works fine but would love to have back the classic PM wood brush,</li>
            <li> ok in the last 20 years i have only used paul mitchell sculpting brush 413 this one seems cheaper then normal i just got a new 413 made of bamboo and tea tree it so much better made. and i not a big fan of colored brushes i prefer old school black and white</li>
            <li> This is the only brush I have ever used. I have long thick hair. This brush is made of wood and holds up to my punishment.</li>
            <li> Ordered these in August 2012 and just ordered 5 more.  I have thick hair and it&#x27;s the only brush that goes thru my hair without a fight. I&#x27;ve bought several other types (locally) that seem to be the same but just don&#x27;t get thru my hair. The bristle tips are what fall off and cause me to buy more.  So... they could be made better maybe but I use it every day for a year and a half and the brush takes a punishment.</li>
            <li> I received my 413 brush and finally got a chance to use it yesterday! It is absolutely wonderful! And my clients love it too:)</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for years and needed another one.  I tried several other kinds, but none worked as well. I love the give in the base so that it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair as hard and the tips on the end of each bristle.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t feel like the trusted Paul Mitchell brush I have had for years. Unless the company has changed the quality or this is not a Paul Mitchell product</li>
            <li> This brush is well constructed.  Even though it is a bit pricy it is well oath the money charged for it.  You are not paying for a well known name.  You are buying a well designed product.</li>
            <li> The brush I received was an ugly orange color, not pink or purple as shown.  Will donate it to goodwill since I can&#x27;t receive a refund / exchange.</li>
            <li> I love these Paul Mitchell brushes. Great hair brush, perfect for the my hair needs. Excellent! This hair brush is a &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34;, I use every day to brush and dry my hair. Satisfies all my requirements</li>
            <li> I have used this hairbrush in the past and have liked it very much. Wasn&#x27;t able to purchase one at local salons so I checked on Amazon and was pleased to find it there. And it was much more reasonably priced!! Thank You.</li>
            <li> Always have loved this style Paul Mitchell brush. Perfect for my hair.</li>
            <li> Have only had the brush for 2 months and the bristles are falling out. It can&#x27;t be returned due to their time constraint on returns. It&#x27;s a cheap product and I would highly recommend you don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> My wife had to toss her old brush, after 15 years, and was dreading having to find a new one she liked but the brush was/is the right one for her. Only time will tell if this one will last 15 years as well but she&#x27;d buy from here again.</li>
            <li> I received exactly what was ordered &amp; exactly the same as the ones I bought years ago.  Nothing else does the job like these wooden handled pieces.</li>
            <li> i am happy with the lipstick and the speed that it came!</li>
            <li> Great brush.  Light weight and glides through the hair.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I have been a hairstylist since 1982 when Paul Mitchell first hit the salon world.  Paul Mitchell #413 Sculpting Brush is still my number one go to everyday brush no matter is my hair was waist long or 2&amp;#34; long.  It feels good on your head, is of great quality, and made for everyone of your family members.  One at home and one in your travel bag is a must!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.  Had one for many years but it finally started falling apart.  Used it every day for years.  Hope this one lasts as long.  I bought two just in case.</li>
            <li> This brush is a knock off for sure. I&#x27;ve used it for about a month, and the Paul Mitchell label on the front has fallen off, as well as several bristles are now missing. It&#x27;s also extremely light in weight- the wood is made out of super cheap pine or something.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Wonderful for long or short hair.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, my daughter and I had this same brush for over 15 years or more. I&#x27;m so glad I found one like it. Linda &amp; daughter both agree it&#x27;s a great brush, plus reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have had my last brush for several years.  Love this brush.  I was very glad to see that they still made them, so I ordered two.  Was a bit disappointed when they came in and they were red and white-not the black that was shown. The white shows all the hair after brushing.</li>
            <li> Not as pliable and well-made as authentic Paul Mitchell brushes, but does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> This is a Very nice brush.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s purple with a rhinestone on it.&lt;br /&gt;It was definitely worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;There was a little delay, but everything worked out well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this brush twice over the past 10 years because it was small with long bristles that go through my wavy, thick hair. However, both times, the cushion came out after the first couple of uses and I had to crazy glue it into the handle (the first brush I thought was a fluke but the second did the exact same thing). Also, the pins fall out rather quickly. Now, the name plate on the handle of my second brush is falling off. I&#x27;m looking for a new brush.</li>
            <li> I have used this style (and brand) of brush forever....I probably always will! I can&#x27;t locate them in salons anymore, so am happy I could purchase online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I had an original 413 for a few years and loved the brush until my dogs got ahold of it. Mine was black so I ordered 1 of these because I was so glad I found them.  They are crap and nothing like the original. Don&#x27;t order them. After a month the whole bristle part rubber and all came apart from the cheap handle. I never was so disappointed in my life. They cannot be real products of PM. He would not allow this cheap crap to have his name on it. I contacted the company bc when the brush arrived it was already missing bristles. I told them I didnt appreciate a crap knock off product.&lt;br /&gt;I sent this email to them:&lt;br /&gt;I received this item late and it was missing several bristles. I have previously owned this brush that I bought at a salon but my dogs ate it. I dont feel like this item was an authentic item as it was much lighter that the one I had and the quality was very poor.&lt;br /&gt;Heather&lt;br /&gt;The response from them was that they do not sell fakes and to send them pictures of the missing bristles. I did as they said and sent them the pictures on Sept 22. To this day no response from them which shows me they dont stand behind their products and I hit the nail on the head when I said fake.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great brush - that&#x27;s all I will use - would recommend it to anyone!  It met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I just love this brush. I noticed at Thanksgiving my daughter was using one and I ask her about it and she said she really&lt;br /&gt;liked it. Wondered how I could go wrong. As always I check Amazon first for whatever I am looking for. This brush is not&lt;br /&gt;hard on your hair like so many are. In fact I had come to the place that I was not even using a brush till I bought this one.&lt;br /&gt;Would not use another type again. Happy buyer.</li>
            <li> But I found the postage very high and the seller would not reduce it, but I loved the brush in the past, my dog ate the one I treasured, so I paid the high postage and bought extra brushes to make the postage more reasonable.</li>
            <li> Not made as well as my original.  The first time I used it bristles fell out.  Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Will not order another.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this brush for a while. It&#x27;s the best for my hair when blow drying it.</li>
            <li> This brush is great!  It can detangle the worst hair even without detangler spray!  Lite weight and bristles aren&#x27;t too hard.</li>
            <li> the brush is a complete knock off from the real paul mitchell 413!!!  This is not close to the original.</li>
            <li> These are the greastest brushes ever!</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for years and needed a new one.  So I am happy with the product.  The only thing I would have liked is the option to choose a color.  The picture showed multiple colors and I didn&#x27;t have an option to choose... and was sent a red one.  Not what I would have chosen, but it still brushes my hair the same  :)</li>
            <li> My favorite brush used to buy it from my hairdresser. Glad to get it here</li>
            <li> Easy on the scalp, nice quality bristles.</li>
            <li> As a professional cosmetologist I would never recommend buying salon brand items off the internet, they cannot guaranteed by the manufacturer unless sold from a salon or cosmetology school. So you are probably buying a knock off, if that does not bother you than be my guest.</li>
            <li> Love these hairbrushes!</li>
            <li> This was exactly the same brush that I have bought in the salons over the years, my daughters and I always fight over thse, so I am stocking up on these and throwing out all the others that no one ever likes to use.  The handle is wooden just like the classic brush and the color they sent me was red.</li>
            <li> The quality of this brush seems to be the same as the two I already own. I was hoping for black as shown in the pic once you click on the item to purchase however red is fine. The reason I am only giving it 3 stars is because I cannot stand it when people put inventory stickers on the actual item. Especially when the item is wood. I understand the need for invetory stickers I just wish they would attach them some other way.  Now I have a sticky residue on the backside of the wooden hair brushes that I paid $35.00 for (2 brushes).</li>
            <li> They show the brush in pink and purple. They do not guarantee a color, I received black and gold. I ordered three and I only received two. This was unfortunate as they were to be stocking stuffers for my children, and I did not have enough time to reorder before Xmas. They did however give me a credit. The product is what it says it is and that is always a plus.</li>
            <li> Leave it to Paul to create such a wonderful brush. Never pulls, easy to work with...I&#x27;ve used them for years and years and will never buy another...they&#x27;re terrific and last quite well.</li>
            <li> I really like Paul Mitichell hairbrushes.  Only place I can find the brushes are on-line.  The sculpting brush is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to buy this online without knowing what color I would get but I was pleasantly surprised to get a black one with gold on the bristles.  I still have my old Paul Mitchell brush that has lasted me almost ten years and besides for the rubber getting old and giving way it would have still been usable.  This new brush seems to have the same quality and I&#x27;m hoping to get another ten years out of this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these for 25 years and they have of course gone downhill quality-wise over the years. But, the price has gone down also and so I can buy several and they still last long enough for me to be happy with my purchases.</li>
            <li> The brush received was the type I wanted, but I was unpleasantly surprised that it was purple.  The picture posted was the traditional black color that Paul Mitchell&#x27;s brushes are manufactured with.  While this does raise the question of actual manufacturer, the brush appears to be the same.  However, I would have kept looking if the purple color had been disclosed by the seller.</li>
            <li> REALLY BAD KNOCK OFF AND A WASTE OF MONEY!!! They are false advertising and scamming people.They cannot be real products of PM. He would not allow this cheap crap to have his name on it. Has made in China on it.</li>
            <li> It is not what I expected but is a good brush for styling hair,not very good to use when hair is wet for drying. I think it is a little over priced for the quality.</li>
            <li> Received in time, love it.  Really annoyed I have to type so many words before you will take my rating! :-/</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brush!  I can&#x27;t get it in stores anymore, so I was relieved to be able to purchase it through you!</li>
            <li> Not authentic! Does not work like the real ones! Piece of junk</li>
            <li> Ordered black received bright orange.. Very cheap compared to my original</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I have had this style for years. My son uses it as well. He will be going away to college this Fall and I did not want my brush to go with him, so I bought two. A new one for me and one for him. I wish I could have gotten it in black but the company I ordered it from were out of that color. Guess that is why it was so cheap. It was to be a color of their choice we would get in my order. We received bright lime green. But that was OK. Better than hot pink, especially for him.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brush - it does what it is supposed to do. The best feature for me is that it glides smoothly through my unruly, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this same brush about 15 years ago from my hairdresser. I only like a wood brush due to plastic causing static in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;My old brush looked awful but I never could find one just like it and I wanted no other. Thanks to Amazon for having this brush.&lt;br /&gt;I should have bought two. The paint will wear off the wood over the years but the brush itself is awesome. Good size, lightweight, no static and&lt;br /&gt;bristles are great for my thick, course hair. I was surprised when it arrived in a hot pink color. Good thing it was&#x27;nt for my husband or sons.</li>
