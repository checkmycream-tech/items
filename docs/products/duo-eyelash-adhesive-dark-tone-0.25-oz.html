    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This product is awesome!  </li>
            <li>It is not meant for semi-permanent lashes, like Ardell Lashtite is, but is perfect for all-day wear.  </li>
            <li>literally, this Duo adhesive has them staying in place perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Best Glue ever!!</li>

            <li>Duo is freaking spectacular!!</li>
            <li>This brand is usually very good.</li>

            <li>Still a great product.</li>
            <li>yes, the price was good, but the product does not work good at all!  </li>
            <li>However, if you get the waterproof glue, it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li>This glue is amazing!</li>
            <li>So amazing, will continue to buy!</li>
            <li>Even the subjectively successful ones ended up with the lashes coming off my eyelash and having me look like a humanoid moth or something</li>
            <li>Nice!</li>
            <li>them you will get nice results !</li>
            <li>It easily hides the lining of the lashes so it works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>Great deal love this stuff never put on lashes before but this stuff works great</li>
            <li>I have read realy good reviews of this product and thought to buy this for my wife..</li>
            <li>its always good to have good glue that is also waterproof</li>
            <li>Item was in good condition</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is good if you plan on taking your lashes off before you sleep or before you shower.  </li>
            <li>Good product, good price.</li>
            <li>This was a really good buy including shipping &amp; a good eyelash adhesive.</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>It is really good</li>
            <li>I got really good results putting the glue on the lash when I read about the method makeup artist, Carmindy, of What Not to Wear uses.  </li>
            <li>Its not the right thing!!!!</li>
            <li>was very pleased</li>
            <li>Love it but don&#x27;t know why I ordered it!</li>
            <li>I just bought this, based on others&#x27; reviews and can I say that I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this eyelash glue although I didn&#x27;t get the waterproof glue that Amazon stated it was but the company that sent them out to me made up for it!</li>
            <li>Highly satisfied!</li>
            <li>But when I do get it to work, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>amazing glue.</li>
            <li>duo lash glue is amazing.</li>
            <li>and I get ready hoping for the best and put that lash onto my lid&#x27;s edge!</li>
            <li>Duo glue works very well, and holds eyelashes on great!!!!</li>
            <li>and they weren&#x27;t coming off on their own</li>
            <li>I took photos, will upload layer as i don&#x27;t have them handy at the moment.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be better from all the reviews that i saw, but it&#x27;s not that good</li>
            <li>Love it came to me in perfect condition and fast!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product, works great!</li>
            <li>I can see it really is the biggest factor in successfully putting on lashes!</li>
            <li>But it still a very strong eyelash glue.</li>
            <li>Very strong eyelash glue.</li>
            <li>now that I own some (two, just to be safe)</li>
            <li>This is absolutley by far the best eyelash glue to ever be used!</li>
            <li>Best glue ive used so far</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and lasts all day!</li>
            <li>great adhesive first one i tried and will buy again its gray color and turns darker when applied if you buy will not regret</li>
            <li>I do think this is one of the best eyelash adhesives for keeping the eyelashes attached in general</li>
            <li>Wipes of any application tools easily and can be removed with just warm water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to take off with warm water.</li>
            <li>Good, but I might be having a mild allergic reaction to it during use.</li>
            <li>It works just as well and blends in with your lash line much better than its predecessor.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more</li>
            <li>I have applied eyelash adhesive many times before.</li>
            <li>works alot better then the glue i was using.</li>
            <li>I love this eyelash glue.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even look like I was wearing unattractive eyeliner on the top either:]</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I will keep repurchasing:)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff. .</li>
            <li>I have used soooo many different kinds of eye lash glue and this is the best!!!</li>
            <li>it is fuss free and bottom line it works!</li>
            <li>THIS HELPS ! :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Amazon and its the many companies that work with them.</li>
            <li>in LOVE.</li>
            <li>i did learn that if you cry with this glue, they lashes will just fall off into your lap:)</li>
            <li>so no tears ladies:)</li>
            <li>Just make sure you concentrate on the corners of the lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this adhesive once, but I&#x27;m already impressed with it.</li>
            <li>I love this lash glue for it&#x27;s durability and long-lasting effect.</li>
            <li>will be ordering some more.</li>
            <li>Highlyyyy recommend!!!! :)</li>
            <li>Love this lash glue</li>
            <li>Although I would have been a lot more happier with the waterproof lash glue</li>
            <li>but its better then white since I don&#x27;t go a day without eyeliner its perfect.</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>I love DUO</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more than that!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this eyelash adhesive.</li>
            <li>Will get more.</li>
            <li>I love that this glue goes on as gray</li>
            <li>didnt use it more than 3 times.</li>
            <li>and I will be getting more</li>
            <li>and I love it which means they will now probably stop making it.  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S TOO RUNNY FOR MY LIKING, BUT IT GETS THE JOB DONE.&lt;br /&gt;IT COMES OUT A MEDIUM GRAY COLOR AND DRIES A NICE BLACK COLOR WHICH IS PERFECT FOR MY LASH COLOR, CONCEALS AND BLENDS IN WELL.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another tip is to use cuticle scissors to cut some lashes so the fit better.</li>
            <li>really got good reviews so that is why I ordered it.</li>
            <li>I cannot really say how good it works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Due is best!</li>
            <li>i like this adhesive.. easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to put on</li>
            <li>All the youtube tutorials showing how easy it was couldn&#x27;t fix a thing.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Stays in place like a charm but can easily be cleaned from falsies with a q-tip and rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>Easy application</li>
            <li>Easy to remove with eye makeup remover, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really easy to remove.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s smell is not as strong as others</li>
            <li>This works beautifully - strong too.</li>
            <li>dark is the best!</li>
            <li>Duo is hands down the best adhesive when it comes to appearance and function.</li>
            <li>excellent product, I won&#x27;t use any other brand!</li>
            <li>There was no need, they were on perfectly fine</li>
            <li>works amazing my new favorite  ,</li>
            <li>The best have tried different glues its the real deal lashes stay on for hours and easy to remove.</li>
            <li>I ordered it from housewares and received the kind that can be purchased at any CVS or beauty supply (for cheaper and much faster).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Read the size next time lol</li>
            <li>Make sure to put your eyeshadow and eyeliner on first though.</li>
            <li>It worked great for the long eyelashes I bought!</li>
            <li>this lash glue does not have any special waterproof staying power as it is labeled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Duo always holds up when I&#x27;m making up faces for special occasions.</li>
            <li>I however do not think this is the true product.</li>
            <li>It is fair enough.</li>
            <li>I did get a full refund &amp; Thankful for it because I wanted to waterproof lash glue</li>
            <li>Its cool for someone if your not going to rock your lashes all day.</li>
            <li>but it holds it amazingly and is easy to paint liner back over it.</li>
            <li>saying that other customers were happy with their purchases.</li>
            <li>This is super sticky stuff.  </li>
            <li>it contained formaldehyde and linalool (which I have a mild allergy to).</li>
            <li>But the scent quickly dissipated when I wiped it on the lash&#x27;s band line.</li>
            <li>i can see myself running out of this product fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>and I got it rather quickly</li>
            <li>The Dark Tone worked great for Halloween.</li>
            <li>I put them on at the same time today and so far so good!</li>
            <li>very satisfied, definitely will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I wear a ton of eye makeup, and this dark tone is great.  </li>
            <li>None of my own eyelashes ripped off or anything, as it does with many other lash adhesives.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and holds the lashes for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>Loved it, it lasted a long time</li>
            <li>Worth the price, which actually is not bad.</li>
            <li>It also arrived on time and was exactly as described!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>It is by far the best on the market hands down!</li>
            <li>totally worth it</li>
            <li>so I figured it was worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the clear version for beginners since it is more forgiving.</li>
            <li>I am using the DUO Water Proof Adhesive now and it is supposed to be the best false eyelash glue around.  </li>
            <li>you can use a small amount great holding and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Bottle lasts a long time as well :) !</li>
            <li>And it came right off the eyelashes</li>
            <li>This one I can just use my eye remover, or even olive oil, and it comes right off.</li>
            <li>and she was right.</li>
            <li>the would wipe right off...</li>
            <li>I like the dark tone because I don&#x27;t like to use a lot of eyeliner, so the falsies plus the darker glue enhances the lash line perfectly for me, eliminating an entire step in the makeup process.</li>
            <li>It hold perfectly and lasts long unlike other products.</li>
            <li>last pretty long and is super cost effective for us divas who need our lashes &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>Overall this glue has amazing staying power and is great for experienced false eyelash wears who like to wear dark eyeliner with their falsies!</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Shipped very fast</li>
            <li>This is the first adhesive I&#x27;ve used that didn&#x27;t allowed my eyelashes to start peeling away before the night was over.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>&quot; I would much rather be honest and direct rather than coddle my customer&#x27;s as if they were extremely sensitive children.</li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>The product came exactly as shown.</li>
            <li>I use it every time i put lashes on and it holds them on for the whole day but still come off painlessly!</li>
            <li>It glues my eyelids together exactly as I hoped it would.</li>
            <li>I knew for sure the formula was very different when I put it on.</li>
            <li>but it really holds lashes all day!</li>
            <li>This was my first lash adhesive purchase.</li>
            <li>way I use it is I put the eyelashes on FIRST.</li>
            <li>its my first choice lash glue</li>
            <li>I should have read the reviews and I would have bought this one first.</li>
            <li>Went straight to the trash!</li>
            <li>and I still haven&#x27;t finished my first tube of it.</li>
            <li>Lashes stayed on all night with no problem, thanks again!</li>
            <li>Best adhesive for false eye lashes!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the one I got was either the real thing or a good one, mine would not dry and it may be from traveling a great distance but either way it sucked for me sorry person who sent it to me</li>
            <li>and I found this glue quick and easy to apply, my lashes lasted the whole night with only one snag.</li>
            <li>Later that night, I take it off with surprising ease and remove the glue from the lash in one solid string!</li>
            <li>So I ordered this in black and I love it!</li>
            <li>Also, the hole where the glue comes out is huge and it dispenses far to much than is needed to line the band of the lashes, so too much gets</li>
            <li>MY FIRST TIME REALLY USING THIS SORTA STUFF, MAYBE</li>
            <li>All of the comments about this product are from newbie lash wearers who are thrilled at finding non-irritating glue in a  dark tone.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable, strong, and the black color adds a volume/ liner affect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure you put the lid on quickly, mine leaked out onto my dresser, luckily I had an old towel down</li>
            <li>Yesterday, we experienced 30 mph winds and as I walked to my apartment from my car, my false eyelashes stayed on like they were real ;)</li>
            <li>Love the black since it blends in better than the white does.  </li>
            <li>, the opening is so large, too much glue comes out</li>
            <li>Unlike Lashtite, which didn&#x27;t last much longer than DUO, (especially after sleeping or showering), this product came off easily with Lash Free or eye-makeup remover without pulling out any of my natural lashes (the Lashtite pulled out a good 25 percent of my real lashes and left my eyelashes sparse and short).  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly, and the dark tone blends well with darker eye-makeup or black eyeliner, or if used alone and with precision, creates the appearance of a grayish-black eyeliner on the upper lid, which is very attractive.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry sticky like many of the store bought brands and the dark tone blends great with eyeliner and mascara without the odd milky residue that the &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; adhesive leaves.</li>
            <li>this works very well</li>
            <li>Very helpful.  </li>
            <li>To get it to work I had to apply it both on my eyelid and the eyelash strip - too much hassle.</li>
            <li>go to work.. and the whole day, the lashes HAVE.</li>
            <li>I really do like this glue, but I cant help but notice that on the page it said that the glue was WATERPROOF, however on the day that I received this the packaging didn&#x27;t say waterproof anywhere:(I still tried it out</li>
            <li>This adhesive really works.</li>
            <li>It is gently with the eyes.</li>
            <li>and that way too much globs out not a thin bit?</li>
            <li>OF POURING IT OUT HORIZONTALLY, I&#x27;D RECCOMEND VERTICALLY OTHERWISE TOO MUCH WILL SPEW OUT.</li>
            <li>BUT I DON&#x27;T CARE TOO MUCH FOR IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really works</li>
            <li>Ruined my real lashes and irritated the eyes.</li>
            <li>No pain and is very quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>Is this really waterproof?</li>
            <li>when i recived it, it was very runny/</li>
            <li>I was trying to use the glue that came with my lashes to much frustration.</li>
            <li>so it helps hide the adhesive much faster.</li>
            <li>Seems to work very well for me.  </li>
            <li>but I wanted to try them when I bought them and ended up loving them enough to put them on the next day</li>
            <li>Very easily blends with my black eyeliner.</li>
            <li>The glue used makes a huge difference when wearing false lashes, and this is the best for those with dark natural lashes.  </li>
            <li>You only need a tiny bit and it holds very strong.</li>
            <li>The original formula is just not the same as the waterproof one.</li>
            <li>Works better than the other one I bought.</li>
            <li>its not black, but its dark enough, works great</li>
            <li>This is my first time reviewing a seller/product on Amazon because it was quite clear to me, the seller scammed me.  </li>
            <li>But to me, the dark stays better.</li>
            <li>The dark tone is always better to me because you can&#x27;t see the glue on your lashes</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and clearly and is easy to get off with a little soap and water.</li>
            <li>Love how it dries black.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to bother returning the item because it was less than $5.00, but I will for sure be throwing it out.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered several, and bought from stores too (same price or more).</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite eyelash glue because of the dark tone which blends seamlessly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried over ten lash glues this is the first that will not burn my eyes!</li>
            <li>Works fine enough, but the smell is so offensive I could barely use it.  </li>
            <li>Although it may look legitimate, the &amp;#34;printing&amp;#34; of the product was completely off-marked and looks to have been scanned on unlike the real DUO Eyelash Adhesive.  </li>
            <li>It is grey when wet, so you can see exactly how much you&#x27;ve applied, the extent of the application area and you can judge the drying rate better than a clear glue.</li>
            <li>on my eyelashes just because normal glue just wouldn&#x27;t hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is the ONLY glue worth using, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I like the dark color much better than the clear.  </li>
            <li>Seems to have a better texture than the clear, less watery.</li>
            <li>I tried several pair of lashes and washed face and the lashes came right off</li>
            <li>it dries dark and has a strong hold.i will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to falsies</li>
            <li>Anyways I still really like this product it lasted a pretty long time before the lashes started to come off</li>
            <li>Totally reliable - lashes to stay put the first time you apply them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only tried it for the first time today, and I need practice applying the lashes, sp</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t exactly quality check every last one</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this glue ;)</li>
            <li>Be aware that this specific listing isn&#x27;t for the waterproof glue.  </li>
            <li>It may be cheaper locally--(research in your local area first).</li>
            <li>I naturally came here to look for some new stuff.</li>
            <li>really love the idea of a dark eyelash adhesive because the white is sometimes visible on the lashline AFTER drying.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to hear about the dark tone adhesive.</li>
            <li>so the dark tone ones simply blends into my eyeliner and makes it even more natural looking.</li>
            <li>but I should&#x27;ve probably bought the clear one though</li>
            <li>It says &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34;, but when I opened the package and looked at the tube, it clearly does not say &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;s see using the clear adhesive every again.</li>
            <li>before my Duo arrived, I used this clear swipe on adhesive.</li>
            <li>but instead was sent the DUO Clear Eyelash Adhesive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to try the clear.</li>
            <li>They went out of their way in their email to be condescending even going so far as to say \\</li>
            <li>Getting my eyelashes done by a professional now...</li>
            <li>Everywhere I went, everyone I talked to, everything I read, Duo was the most commonly recommended adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it in my professional makeup artist kit.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t think it is completely waterproof, however.</li>
            <li>I just pulled out the glue and fixed the corner.</li>
            <li>this glue holds very well for us lash wears I do the individual</li>
            <li>(so far).</li>
            <li>so it looks natural.</li>
            <li>Try not to put them under direct water in the shower</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and wear contacts and these did not irritate my eyes.....</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Use very little of this glue on the lashes, blow on it a few times (the hue will change slightly when it&#x27;s at its best), then apply</li>
            <li>easy to use as I am a first time user of false eyelashes.</li>
            <li>So excited it came earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li>3 stars only because I ordered waterproof and received non-waterproof, so I&#x27;m kind of disappointed since I ordered it BECAUSE I needed waterproof, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>it is gray not black...</li>
            <li>I usually use extra glue around the tips of the lashes to help it stay more through the night, but with DUO, there is no need.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that same quality that lets you clean off the glue from the lashes at night and thus you can get long use out of the same pair.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a good lash glue, since all the other ones I&#x27;ve used were horrible, and I had heard good things about the Duo lash adhesive.</li>
            <li>If u use the white that truns clear you have to wait for it to turn clear</li>
            <li>sure how asking that they don&#x27;t falsely represent a product is making me like a sensitive child who needs to be coddled.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it comes out a light gray color and when it is time to put them on they turn to a darker gray and by the time they are completely dry to your eyelids they are as dark as my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>If you use proper care and get decent lashes, I have had them last up to 3 days.</li>
            <li>cuz my eyes tend to water a little bit more than the average.</li>
            <li>Though I love that this is black, it doesn&#x27;t stay like the other white glue</li>
            <li>the only thing is I would like it in clear color.</li>
            <li>Barely acceptable gloppy tube of glue.</li>
            <li>I love using this glue when I wear false eyelashes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It dries black - great for any residue left behind; it looks like a tiny mascara clump.</li>
            <li>I have used the clear Duo eyelash adhesive for awhile now, but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t always dry completely clear</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t seem to stick very well at the edges when compared to other quality brands.</li>
            <li>On the other hand... the price doesn&#x27;t excite me to much.</li>
            <li>They are either hard to dry, or easy to fall off.</li>
            <li>Be aware that when you first apply the glue it has a dark grey-ish color, but once is dry it turns black.</li>
            <li>this glue is super stays on last on my eye lashes for at least two weeks</li>
            <li>It was very messy when I first used it, but I learned how to use it without much of the mess.</li>

            <li> This brand is usually very good.</li>

            <li> Still a great product.</li>
            <li> yes, the price was good, but the product does not work good at all!  </li>
            <li> However, if you get the waterproof glue, it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li> This glue is amazing!</li>
            <li> So amazing, will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> Even the subjectively successful ones ended up with the lashes coming off my eyelash and having me look like a humanoid moth or something</li>
            <li> Nice!</li>
            <li> them you will get nice results !</li>
            <li> It easily hides the lining of the lashes so it works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> Great deal love this stuff never put on lashes before but this stuff works great</li>
            <li> I have read realy good reviews of this product and thought to buy this for my wife..</li>
            <li> its always good to have good glue that is also waterproof</li>
            <li> Item was in good condition</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is good if you plan on taking your lashes off before you sleep or before you shower.  </li>
            <li> Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> This was a really good buy including shipping &amp; a good eyelash adhesive.</li>
            <li> Works good.</li>
            <li> It is really good</li>
            <li> I got really good results putting the glue on the lash when I read about the method makeup artist, Carmindy, of What Not to Wear uses.  </li>
            <li> Its not the right thing!!!!</li>
            <li> was very pleased</li>
            <li> Love it but don&#x27;t know why I ordered it!</li>
            <li> I just bought this, based on others&#x27; reviews and can I say that I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this eyelash glue although I didn&#x27;t get the waterproof glue that Amazon stated it was but the company that sent them out to me made up for it!</li>
            <li> Highly satisfied!</li>
            <li> But when I do get it to work, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> amazing glue.</li>
            <li> duo lash glue is amazing.</li>
            <li> and I get ready hoping for the best and put that lash onto my lid&#x27;s edge!</li>
            <li> Duo glue works very well, and holds eyelashes on great!!!!</li>
            <li> and they weren&#x27;t coming off on their own</li>
            <li> I took photos, will upload layer as i don&#x27;t have them handy at the moment.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be better from all the reviews that i saw, but it&#x27;s not that good</li>
            <li> Love it came to me in perfect condition and fast!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product, works great!</li>
            <li> I can see it really is the biggest factor in successfully putting on lashes!</li>
            <li> But it still a very strong eyelash glue.</li>
            <li> Very strong eyelash glue.</li>
            <li> now that I own some (two, just to be safe)</li>
            <li> This is absolutley by far the best eyelash glue to ever be used!</li>
            <li> Best glue ive used so far</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> great adhesive first one i tried and will buy again its gray color and turns darker when applied if you buy will not regret</li>
            <li> I do think this is one of the best eyelash adhesives for keeping the eyelashes attached in general</li>
            <li> Wipes of any application tools easily and can be removed with just warm water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to take off with warm water.</li>
            <li> Good, but I might be having a mild allergic reaction to it during use.</li>
            <li> It works just as well and blends in with your lash line much better than its predecessor.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more</li>
            <li> I have applied eyelash adhesive many times before.</li>
            <li> works alot better then the glue i was using.</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash glue.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even look like I was wearing unattractive eyeliner on the top either:]</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I will keep repurchasing:)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. .</li>
            <li> I have used soooo many different kinds of eye lash glue and this is the best!!!</li>
            <li> it is fuss free and bottom line it works!</li>
            <li> THIS HELPS ! :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Amazon and its the many companies that work with them.</li>
            <li> in LOVE.</li>
            <li> i did learn that if you cry with this glue, they lashes will just fall off into your lap:)</li>
            <li> so no tears ladies:)</li>
            <li> Just make sure you concentrate on the corners of the lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this adhesive once, but I&#x27;m already impressed with it.</li>
            <li> I love this lash glue for it&#x27;s durability and long-lasting effect.</li>
            <li> will be ordering some more.</li>
            <li> Highlyyyy recommend!!!! :)</li>
            <li> Love this lash glue</li>
            <li> Although I would have been a lot more happier with the waterproof lash glue</li>
            <li> but its better then white since I don&#x27;t go a day without eyeliner its perfect.</li>
            <li> Love this item.</li>
            <li> I love DUO</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for more than that!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eyelash adhesive.</li>
            <li> Will get more.</li>
            <li> I love that this glue goes on as gray</li>
            <li> didnt use it more than 3 times.</li>
            <li> and I will be getting more</li>
            <li> and I love it which means they will now probably stop making it.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S TOO RUNNY FOR MY LIKING, BUT IT GETS THE JOB DONE.&lt;br /&gt;IT COMES OUT A MEDIUM GRAY COLOR AND DRIES A NICE BLACK COLOR WHICH IS PERFECT FOR MY LASH COLOR, CONCEALS AND BLENDS IN WELL.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another tip is to use cuticle scissors to cut some lashes so the fit better.</li>
            <li> really got good reviews so that is why I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I cannot really say how good it works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Due is best!</li>
            <li> i like this adhesive.. easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to put on</li>
            <li> All the youtube tutorials showing how easy it was couldn&#x27;t fix a thing.</li>
            <li> Easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Stays in place like a charm but can easily be cleaned from falsies with a q-tip and rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> Easy application</li>
            <li> Easy to remove with eye makeup remover, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really easy to remove.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s smell is not as strong as others</li>
            <li> This works beautifully - strong too.</li>
            <li> dark is the best!</li>
            <li> Duo is hands down the best adhesive when it comes to appearance and function.</li>
            <li> excellent product, I won&#x27;t use any other brand!</li>
            <li> There was no need, they were on perfectly fine</li>
            <li> works amazing my new favorite  ,</li>
            <li> The best have tried different glues its the real deal lashes stay on for hours and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I ordered it from housewares and received the kind that can be purchased at any CVS or beauty supply (for cheaper and much faster).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Read the size next time lol</li>
            <li> Make sure to put your eyeshadow and eyeliner on first though.</li>
            <li> It worked great for the long eyelashes I bought!</li>
            <li> this lash glue does not have any special waterproof staying power as it is labeled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Duo always holds up when I&#x27;m making up faces for special occasions.</li>
            <li> I however do not think this is the true product.</li>
            <li> It is fair enough.</li>
            <li> I did get a full refund &amp; Thankful for it because I wanted to waterproof lash glue</li>
            <li> Its cool for someone if your not going to rock your lashes all day.</li>
            <li> but it holds it amazingly and is easy to paint liner back over it.</li>
            <li> saying that other customers were happy with their purchases.</li>
            <li> This is super sticky stuff.  </li>
            <li> it contained formaldehyde and linalool (which I have a mild allergy to).</li>
            <li> But the scent quickly dissipated when I wiped it on the lash&#x27;s band line.</li>
            <li> i can see myself running out of this product fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> and I got it rather quickly</li>
            <li> The Dark Tone worked great for Halloween.</li>
            <li> I put them on at the same time today and so far so good!</li>
            <li> very satisfied, definitely will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I wear a ton of eye makeup, and this dark tone is great.  </li>
            <li> None of my own eyelashes ripped off or anything, as it does with many other lash adhesives.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and holds the lashes for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> Loved it, it lasted a long time</li>
            <li> Worth the price, which actually is not bad.</li>
            <li> It also arrived on time and was exactly as described!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> It is by far the best on the market hands down!</li>
            <li> totally worth it</li>
            <li> so I figured it was worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the clear version for beginners since it is more forgiving.</li>
            <li> I am using the DUO Water Proof Adhesive now and it is supposed to be the best false eyelash glue around.  </li>
            <li> you can use a small amount great holding and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Bottle lasts a long time as well :) !</li>
            <li> And it came right off the eyelashes</li>
            <li> This one I can just use my eye remover, or even olive oil, and it comes right off.</li>
            <li> and she was right.</li>
            <li> the would wipe right off...</li>
            <li> I like the dark tone because I don&#x27;t like to use a lot of eyeliner, so the falsies plus the darker glue enhances the lash line perfectly for me, eliminating an entire step in the makeup process.</li>
            <li> It hold perfectly and lasts long unlike other products.</li>
            <li> last pretty long and is super cost effective for us divas who need our lashes &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Overall this glue has amazing staying power and is great for experienced false eyelash wears who like to wear dark eyeliner with their falsies!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Shipped very fast</li>
            <li> This is the first adhesive I&#x27;ve used that didn&#x27;t allowed my eyelashes to start peeling away before the night was over.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> &quot; I would much rather be honest and direct rather than coddle my customer&#x27;s as if they were extremely sensitive children.</li>
            <li> Haha!</li>
            <li> The product came exactly as shown.</li>
            <li> I use it every time i put lashes on and it holds them on for the whole day but still come off painlessly!</li>
            <li> It glues my eyelids together exactly as I hoped it would.</li>
            <li> I knew for sure the formula was very different when I put it on.</li>
            <li> but it really holds lashes all day!</li>
            <li> This was my first lash adhesive purchase.</li>
            <li> way I use it is I put the eyelashes on FIRST.</li>
            <li> its my first choice lash glue</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews and I would have bought this one first.</li>
            <li> Went straight to the trash!</li>
            <li> and I still haven&#x27;t finished my first tube of it.</li>
            <li> Lashes stayed on all night with no problem, thanks again!</li>
            <li> Best adhesive for false eye lashes!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the one I got was either the real thing or a good one, mine would not dry and it may be from traveling a great distance but either way it sucked for me sorry person who sent it to me</li>
            <li> and I found this glue quick and easy to apply, my lashes lasted the whole night with only one snag.</li>
            <li> Later that night, I take it off with surprising ease and remove the glue from the lash in one solid string!</li>
            <li> So I ordered this in black and I love it!</li>
            <li> Also, the hole where the glue comes out is huge and it dispenses far to much than is needed to line the band of the lashes, so too much gets</li>
            <li> MY FIRST TIME REALLY USING THIS SORTA STUFF, MAYBE</li>
            <li> All of the comments about this product are from newbie lash wearers who are thrilled at finding non-irritating glue in a  dark tone.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable, strong, and the black color adds a volume/ liner affect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure you put the lid on quickly, mine leaked out onto my dresser, luckily I had an old towel down</li>
            <li> Yesterday, we experienced 30 mph winds and as I walked to my apartment from my car, my false eyelashes stayed on like they were real ;)</li>
            <li> Love the black since it blends in better than the white does.  </li>
            <li> , the opening is so large, too much glue comes out</li>
            <li> Unlike Lashtite, which didn&#x27;t last much longer than DUO, (especially after sleeping or showering), this product came off easily with Lash Free or eye-makeup remover without pulling out any of my natural lashes (the Lashtite pulled out a good 25 percent of my real lashes and left my eyelashes sparse and short).  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly, and the dark tone blends well with darker eye-makeup or black eyeliner, or if used alone and with precision, creates the appearance of a grayish-black eyeliner on the upper lid, which is very attractive.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry sticky like many of the store bought brands and the dark tone blends great with eyeliner and mascara without the odd milky residue that the &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; adhesive leaves.</li>
            <li> this works very well</li>
            <li> Very helpful.  </li>
            <li> To get it to work I had to apply it both on my eyelid and the eyelash strip - too much hassle.</li>
            <li> go to work.. and the whole day, the lashes HAVE.</li>
            <li> I really do like this glue, but I cant help but notice that on the page it said that the glue was WATERPROOF, however on the day that I received this the packaging didn&#x27;t say waterproof anywhere:(I still tried it out</li>
            <li> This adhesive really works.</li>
            <li> It is gently with the eyes.</li>
            <li> and that way too much globs out not a thin bit?</li>
            <li> OF POURING IT OUT HORIZONTALLY, I&#x27;D RECCOMEND VERTICALLY OTHERWISE TOO MUCH WILL SPEW OUT.</li>
            <li> BUT I DON&#x27;T CARE TOO MUCH FOR IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really works</li>
            <li> Ruined my real lashes and irritated the eyes.</li>
            <li> No pain and is very quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> Is this really waterproof?</li>
            <li> when i recived it, it was very runny/</li>
            <li> I was trying to use the glue that came with my lashes to much frustration.</li>
            <li> so it helps hide the adhesive much faster.</li>
            <li> Seems to work very well for me.  </li>
            <li> but I wanted to try them when I bought them and ended up loving them enough to put them on the next day</li>
            <li> Very easily blends with my black eyeliner.</li>
            <li> The glue used makes a huge difference when wearing false lashes, and this is the best for those with dark natural lashes.  </li>
            <li> You only need a tiny bit and it holds very strong.</li>
            <li> The original formula is just not the same as the waterproof one.</li>
            <li> Works better than the other one I bought.</li>
            <li> its not black, but its dark enough, works great</li>
            <li> This is my first time reviewing a seller/product on Amazon because it was quite clear to me, the seller scammed me.  </li>
            <li> But to me, the dark stays better.</li>
            <li> The dark tone is always better to me because you can&#x27;t see the glue on your lashes</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and clearly and is easy to get off with a little soap and water.</li>
            <li> Love how it dries black.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to bother returning the item because it was less than $5.00, but I will for sure be throwing it out.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered several, and bought from stores too (same price or more).</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite eyelash glue because of the dark tone which blends seamlessly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried over ten lash glues this is the first that will not burn my eyes!</li>
            <li> Works fine enough, but the smell is so offensive I could barely use it.  </li>
            <li> Although it may look legitimate, the &amp;#34;printing&amp;#34; of the product was completely off-marked and looks to have been scanned on unlike the real DUO Eyelash Adhesive.  </li>
            <li> It is grey when wet, so you can see exactly how much you&#x27;ve applied, the extent of the application area and you can judge the drying rate better than a clear glue.</li>
            <li> on my eyelashes just because normal glue just wouldn&#x27;t hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is the ONLY glue worth using, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I like the dark color much better than the clear.  </li>
            <li> Seems to have a better texture than the clear, less watery.</li>
            <li> I tried several pair of lashes and washed face and the lashes came right off</li>
            <li> it dries dark and has a strong hold.i will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to falsies</li>
            <li> Anyways I still really like this product it lasted a pretty long time before the lashes started to come off</li>
            <li> Totally reliable - lashes to stay put the first time you apply them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only tried it for the first time today, and I need practice applying the lashes, sp</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t exactly quality check every last one</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this glue ;)</li>
            <li> Be aware that this specific listing isn&#x27;t for the waterproof glue.  </li>
            <li> It may be cheaper locally--(research in your local area first).</li>
            <li> I naturally came here to look for some new stuff.</li>
            <li> really love the idea of a dark eyelash adhesive because the white is sometimes visible on the lashline AFTER drying.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to hear about the dark tone adhesive.</li>
            <li> so the dark tone ones simply blends into my eyeliner and makes it even more natural looking.</li>
            <li> but I should&#x27;ve probably bought the clear one though</li>
            <li> It says &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34;, but when I opened the package and looked at the tube, it clearly does not say &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;s see using the clear adhesive every again.</li>
            <li> before my Duo arrived, I used this clear swipe on adhesive.</li>
            <li> but instead was sent the DUO Clear Eyelash Adhesive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to try the clear.</li>
            <li> They went out of their way in their email to be condescending even going so far as to say \\</li>
            <li> Getting my eyelashes done by a professional now...</li>
            <li> Everywhere I went, everyone I talked to, everything I read, Duo was the most commonly recommended adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it in my professional makeup artist kit.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think it is completely waterproof, however.</li>
            <li> I just pulled out the glue and fixed the corner.</li>
            <li> this glue holds very well for us lash wears I do the individual</li>
            <li> (so far).</li>
            <li> so it looks natural.</li>
            <li> Try not to put them under direct water in the shower</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and wear contacts and these did not irritate my eyes.....</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Use very little of this glue on the lashes, blow on it a few times (the hue will change slightly when it&#x27;s at its best), then apply</li>
            <li> easy to use as I am a first time user of false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> So excited it came earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> 3 stars only because I ordered waterproof and received non-waterproof, so I&#x27;m kind of disappointed since I ordered it BECAUSE I needed waterproof, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> it is gray not black...</li>
            <li> I usually use extra glue around the tips of the lashes to help it stay more through the night, but with DUO, there is no need.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that same quality that lets you clean off the glue from the lashes at night and thus you can get long use out of the same pair.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a good lash glue, since all the other ones I&#x27;ve used were horrible, and I had heard good things about the Duo lash adhesive.</li>
            <li> If u use the white that truns clear you have to wait for it to turn clear</li>
            <li> sure how asking that they don&#x27;t falsely represent a product is making me like a sensitive child who needs to be coddled.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it comes out a light gray color and when it is time to put them on they turn to a darker gray and by the time they are completely dry to your eyelids they are as dark as my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> If you use proper care and get decent lashes, I have had them last up to 3 days.</li>
            <li> cuz my eyes tend to water a little bit more than the average.</li>
            <li> Though I love that this is black, it doesn&#x27;t stay like the other white glue</li>
            <li> the only thing is I would like it in clear color.</li>
            <li> Barely acceptable gloppy tube of glue.</li>
            <li> I love using this glue when I wear false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It dries black - great for any residue left behind; it looks like a tiny mascara clump.</li>
            <li> I have used the clear Duo eyelash adhesive for awhile now, but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t always dry completely clear</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t seem to stick very well at the edges when compared to other quality brands.</li>
            <li> On the other hand... the price doesn&#x27;t excite me to much.</li>
            <li> They are either hard to dry, or easy to fall off.</li>
            <li> Be aware that when you first apply the glue it has a dark grey-ish color, but once is dry it turns black.</li>
            <li> this glue is super stays on last on my eye lashes for at least two weeks</li>
            <li> It was very messy when I first used it, but I learned how to use it without much of the mess.</li>
            <li> This is just simple super glue, just less harsh.</li>
            <li> As a pro artist, this is the glue I use for applying lashes as well as little gems and stones for a particular look.</li>
            <li> It takes only 2-3 seconds to dry, and can last about one day.</li>
            <li> I use the dark and the clear version.</li>
            <li> I had no idea what the difference was in dark or clear</li>
            <li> I ordered the dark tone and received the clear ....</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stick long enough</li>
            <li> This glue does not last long, maybe two or three hours and gets kinda itchy.</li>
            <li> Overall, a fabulous product and the only false eyelash adhesive brand I will ever buy again!</li>
            <li> I used Lashtite clear previously which was a nightmare to remove.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I wish it wasn&#x27;t in the dark tone color because if you are messy with it, it can get on your lid and its a dark color that is kind of hard to get off, but it kept my lashes on well</li>
            <li> took too long to dry; finally just pulled lashes off as I was aggravated that it didn&#x27;t work... would not recommend.</li>
            <li> they last a very long time!</li>
            <li> I read some other reviews and it is important to place a small amount of glue on some foil and wait a few seconds before you apply the adhesive to the lashes.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this product in clear, as the dark-tone can dry on your lids if you make a slight mistake after you apply your shadow, in which case you need to reapply your eye-makeup.  </li>
            <li> So finally I did a little more research as to WHY putting eyelashes might be difficult and</li>
            <li> this glue didn&#x27;t use it for long because I lost it</li>
            <li> These hold the lashes on firmly, but don&#x27;t pull out my natural lashes when I remove the falsies.  </li>
            <li> Holds lashes on as long as you want them on.  </li>
            <li> MINOR INCONVENIENCE.</li>
            <li> Thought it looked strange when received the packaging but opened anyway.</li>
            <li> It looks grey when it comes out</li>
            <li> One tube goes a long way.</li>
            <li> They still allow the lashes to stay on a long time.</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best eyelash glue I&#x27;ve ever used (and I have used an awful lot).</li>
            <li> The only thing is if you mess up with the glue it is obvious because the eyelash glue is colored.</li>
            <li> Where other &#x27;glues&#x27; have left my lashes hanging...</li>
            <li> I contacted the vendor he abruptly offered to send me proof from the vendor that they no longer market this formula as waterproof but it was the same formula.</li>
            <li> I tried some other brands that did not last at all.</li>
            <li> I had no idea you could purchase eyelash adhesive in anything other than the white.  </li>
            <li> the glue lasts for so long (depending on how well you put on your lashes of course) even when i accidentally sleep in my makeup my lashes will survive the night!</li>
            <li> The tube lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too dry</li>
            <li> I used it for a week , and my eye&#x27;s are kinda dry now</li>
            <li> When i tried to use it, it wouldn&#x27;t dry, stayed sticky for hours.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re a bit clumsy like me.you can get gray spots on your yes and it spoils the whole make up,be careful when you are applying it ,and</li>
            <li> I am returning my dark tone adhesive and getting my money back.</li>
            <li> I no longer haave to worry about blending white glue the shows through my dark lashes with mascara.</li>
            <li> what you receive is a regular dark tone adhesive.</li>
            <li> It kept my false lashes on for about 16 hours, and even when I took the lashes off they were still glued on pretty well.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever tried the Duo glue for my false eyelashes...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me a little while to get used to it because if you put the glue on before it&#x27;s been exposed to air long enough, it won&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy again, even though I doubt I&#x27;ll have to for some time because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Seriously everyone, if you&#x27;re new to lashes, GET THE ADHESIVE ON POINT!</li>
            <li> A month and a half later.</li>
            <li> It dries quick, isn&#x27;t bulky if you put a thin layer (which is all you need) and it blends well with eyeliner!</li>
            <li> My eyes do get a little watery and for this reason I was hoping for a waterproof glue, but by the middle of the night the lashes started to come off.</li>
            <li> Unlike other glue, this does not get that dry scratchy feel during the day.  </li>
            <li> but I think its just the same price or maybe even less at the store walmart or any other drug store</li>
            <li> perhaps if i used it every day id say it would last a few weeks.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s too wet.</li>
            <li> And then to get the glue off the lashes to use again and go through the same process everyday is impossible!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put a thin layer on the false lashes, then add a tad more to each end.  </li>
            <li> I love this for my fake eye lashes but this was like watery and it cost less at target, don&#x27;t be lazy like me just go buy it.</li>
            <li> Also, when it is dry, it becomes dark.</li>
            <li> Looks grey when you apply it, but dries to black.</li>
            <li> Plus, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to apply but when it gets dry it last all day!!!</li>
            <li> It may be due to the latex in it.</li>
            <li> I bought, according to other reviewers.</li>
            <li> Ever since my first purchase using fake eyelashes from MAC, DUO is the glue they sold to me along with the eyelashes.</li>
            <li> All the other one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried never adhere too well.</li>
            <li> I then let it dry a little to get tacky, then adhere.  </li>
            <li> Also the pigmentation is a dark grey color, not the dark black color I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Then just wait a few minutes to dry (put foundation and other face makeup on).</li>
            <li> you just want DUO ark toned lash adhesive, buy that but don&#x27;t be suckered into purchasing a more expensive version by this falsely labeled ad for waterproof eyelash adhesive from Housewares.</li>
            <li> This glue is not easy to apply, very un user friendly  comes out of the tube thick and just did NOT do the job of keeping the lash in place :(&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Most eyelash adhesives are awful and don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I squeeze just a little bit and PHEW, does this stuff stink when its wet.</li>
            <li> only bad think about this product is when you dispense it onto your lashes for the first time</li>
            <li> Not worth my time or my money.</li>
            <li> I like how it comes on dark..</li>
            <li> The Duo Water Proof Eyelash Adhesive Dark Tone 0.25 Oz.</li>
            <li> I use this one and the dark tone one all the time.</li>
            <li> Dries dark.</li>
            <li> Dark eyelash glue is a must</li>
            <li> anyone know of a dark tone waterproof eyelash glue?</li>
            <li> but with the dark it blends with the lashes and your eye liner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;ve never bought the dark tone before..</li>
            <li> so I just bought the dark because someone else recommended it</li>
            <li> Lashes stay on and glue dries dark</li>
            <li> When I saw they sold a dark tone instead of</li>
            <li> Kept my fake eyelashes on very well.</li>
            <li> I had ordered the DUO Dark Toned Eyelash Adhesive</li>
            <li> I like the dark tone</li>
            <li> I  would rate it average..</li>
            <li> I was not let down.</li>
            <li> but i am NOT switching to any other adhesive!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time/ money on other glues just get this</li>
            <li> I brought this glue because I the other stuff only last on my eye for one day especially if I am going out and dancing because I sweat so bad</li>
            <li> I wanted to leave half a star of rating or close to none.</li>
            <li> it dries black.</li>
            <li> and i ike that its black also like the lashes</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is advertised to be black but mine is gray.</li>
            <li> Dries Black</li>
            <li> If you were eyeliner, black adhesive is for you.</li>
            <li> Any slight humidity makes the lashes fall off.</li>
            <li> and then it turns to black to blend with my lashes.</li>
            <li> the dark glue does show if it comes on your lid a little bit</li>
            <li> The glue kept them on for hours and didn&#x27;t mess with my make up at all.</li>
            <li> what a mess.</li>
            <li> I used several other brands before, but was not happy.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t show, can be a little stringy, hard to remove all, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I found it a little cumbersome to use.  </li>
            <li> A little dab of this will do when you concentrate it on the outer corners.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product somewhere else and box was labeled waterproof... veribage was missing on this box..</li>
            <li> I use an oil based eye make-up remover from Japan to remove all residue, otherwise I&#x27;ve found it difficult to completely rid my eyes of the glue residue.</li>
            <li> I wear them everyday now.</li>
            <li> the glue is easier to pull off so you can reuse the lashed a few</li>
            <li> After a few face plants they still lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The item was not water proof as described on the internet, and it looked different, was not happy with the item.</li>
            <li> Comes out gray and dries black!</li>
            <li> So it works plus is black and is in a squeeze tube!</li>
            <li> Thank you amazon for one less trip to the store yet again!</li>
            <li> figured I was just the problem or maybe the lash was too stiff even if I did all I could to make it flexible.</li>
            <li> It is hard to buy the dark tone in any drugstore like CVS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty bad at knowing when to apply the lashes.</li>
            <li> Having never used this brand, I was shocked when the glue (when applied evenly and correctly) stayed during whole work shifts!</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant ordering the darker one because I don&#x27;t always like to wear fake eyelashes with eyeliner, but it was several bucks cheaper</li>
            <li> /&gt;It should be illegal to market it as such, but hey, I guess they have gotten away with it since August 2013</li>
            <li> (I usually have mine on for 8+ hours per day)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:</li>
            <li> For YEARS I have told myself I simply am not able to wear eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Just didnt realize the tube was going to be so small for the price I paid for it..</li>
            <li> I usually use a bobby pin to help with edges and placing the lashes</li>
            <li> When I opened my package, I initially realized I was sent the wrong product.  </li>
            <li> My hands were a little shaky</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using false eye lashes 40 years &amp; have always used Duo dark tone adhesive.</li>
            <li> Decided to go with the darker tone, since I wear black eyeliner with false lashes.</li>
            <li> the glue was hard to remove from eyelid.  </li>
            <li> watery had a hard time drying .</li>
            <li> I ordered some Ardell Invisibands here on Amazon just to at least practice with them and</li>
            <li> I was never able to use them, but not anymore!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t intend on wearing fake eyelashes every day or even every other day</li>
            <li> However, the length of time to dry is a bit annoying with the application, compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> Not good for me because I have a tendency to have teary eyes.</li>
            <li> ITS SO DUMB</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you don&#x27;t plan on always wearing black eyeliner with your false eyelashes!!</li>
            <li> Vendor was rude and wrongly assumed that this meant that the product was still waterproof.</li>
            <li> l have tried this product was not happy with this item..</li>
            <li> I found it irritating .</li>
            <li> Ugh, what a poor choice.</li>
            <li> It is false advertising to be waterproof, this glue is not waterproof.</li>
            <li> Yesterday I applied it to my false eyelashes at 7:30 AM</li>
            <li> and I suck when it comes to putting false lashes</li>
            <li> I never have a problem with my false eye lashes falling off.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t dry flexible, it was horrible, those babies were coming off my eyes in less than a couple of hours</li>
            <li> Ive had glues that were like tar and impossible to get them off, and once had half of my eyelashes ripped out.</li>
            <li> Every attempt I&#x27;ve ever made- failed.</li>
            <li> Was a fake.</li>
            <li> Never wore fake eyelashes before this.</li>
            <li> I think this is fake.</li>
            <li> I always had troubles whit fake lashes!</li>
            <li> I wrote to the vendor about this they were insulting and rude</li>
            <li> Smelled like it was bad, box was in bad shape.</li>
            <li> It never came off or looked bad with the eyelashes.</li>
            <li> but this one must have been a bad one...</li>
            <li> It also dries a particularly ugly shade.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in my purchase..</li>
            <li> AS YOU DISCLAIMER STATES :(</li>
            <li> I used to use weave glue (bad idea, bad for your eyes!)</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Of course since then I have came to realize the price MAC charged me for eyelashes was insane</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I as well did not get the waterproof adhesive, it doesn&#x27;t say it anywhere like it shows on the picture that it is waterproof, and it does not act water proof at all either...</li>
            <li> Stop advertising WATERPROOF adhesive and sending me non-waterproof.</li>
            <li> I have read realy good reviews of this product and thought to buy this for my wife..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she did not like it..</li>
            <li> i like this adhesive.. easy to use</li>
            <li> I like this glue didn&#x27;t use it for long because I lost it but it gets the job done but I should&#x27;ve probably bought the clear one though</li>
            <li> I used Lashtite clear previously which was a nightmare to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Duo dark is the best! It is grey when wet, so you can see exactly how much you&#x27;ve applied, the extent of the application area and you can judge the drying rate better than a clear glue. Totally reliable - lashes to stay put the first time you apply them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries black - great for any residue left behind; it looks like a tiny mascara clump. Wipes of any application tools easily and can be removed with just warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An excellent product, I won&#x27;t use any other brand!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  It is not meant for semi-permanent lashes, like Ardell Lashtite is, but is perfect for all-day wear.  Unlike Lashtite, which didn&#x27;t last much longer than DUO, (especially after sleeping or showering), this product came off easily with Lash Free or eye-makeup remover without pulling out any of my natural lashes (the Lashtite pulled out a good 25 percent of my real lashes and left my eyelashes sparse and short).  It dries quickly, and the dark tone blends well with darker eye-makeup or black eyeliner, or if used alone and with precision, creates the appearance of a grayish-black eyeliner on the upper lid, which is very attractive.  I just ordered this product in clear, as the dark-tone can dry on your lids if you make a slight mistake after you apply your shadow, in which case you need to reapply your eye-makeup.  Overall, a fabulous product and the only false eyelash adhesive brand I will ever buy again!</li>
            <li> This is super sticky stuff.  Where other &#x27;glues&#x27; have left my lashes hanging... literally, this Duo adhesive has them staying in place perfectly.  If you&#x27;ve been struggling to get the falsies to stay where they&#x27;re supposed to, try this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the first adhesive I&#x27;ve used that didn&#x27;t allowed my eyelashes to start peeling away before the night was over.</li>
            <li> Best Glue ever!! As a pro artist, this is the glue I use for applying lashes as well as little gems and stones for a particular look. So happy it was shipped on time too.</li>
            <li> Got a knock off of this glue. Didn&#x27;t work. Best to buy at a drug store .</li>
            <li> I have used the clear Duo eyelash adhesive for awhile now, but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t always dry completely clear so I was excited to hear about the dark tone adhesive. It works just as well and blends in with your lash line much better than its predecessor. Great product!</li>
            <li> It is not waterproof..</li>
            <li> Smelled like it was bad, box was in bad shape. Ended up throwing away.</li>
            <li> great product i will buy this again. it dries dark and has a strong hold.i will buy it again. i will this product 10 stars</li>
            <li> i dont see anything great about this product, the glue does not hold well and ever since i&#x27;ve bought it i tried to use it but couldn&#x27;t cause it does not work for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered water proof glue and box was not labeled as such.  I have ordered this product somewhere else and box was labeled waterproof... veribage was missing on this box..</li>
            <li> ITS SO DUMB IT SAID IT WAS WATERPROOF AND WASNT i rather just go to sallys and buy their waterproof instead</li>
            <li> I wanted to leave half a star of rating or close to none. My parcel has not arrived on time. It is false advertising to be waterproof, this glue is not waterproof. I am returning my dark tone adhesive and getting my money back. Not worth my time or my money.</li>
            <li> this is great glue its always good to have good glue that is also waterproof I will be ordering more</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to apply but when it gets dry it last all day!!! u can swing and nothing happens!!! really good!!! ;)</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite eyelash glue because of the dark tone which blends seamlessly. Due is best!</li>
            <li> The two stars are for the shipping. I love DUO glue, but unfortunately, this was not what I ordered. It says &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34;, but when I opened the package and looked at the tube, it clearly does not say &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34;. It does not say &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; on the packaging, either. The photo is deceiving. The original formula is just not the same as the waterproof one. Trust me, I know. I&#x27;ve tried them all. I am disappointed in my purchase..</li>
            <li> This was a replacement tube for me. I use it for my individual (cluster) daily wear lashes.  The tube lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;s see using the clear adhesive every again. I am very experienced using eyelash adhesive so the dark tone ones simply blends into my eyeliner and makes it even more natural looking.</li>
            <li> great adhesive first one i tried and will buy again its gray color and turns darker when applied if you buy will not regret</li>
            <li> What a brilliant product! Hands down, the best eyelash glue I&#x27;ve ever used (and I have used an awful lot).</li>
            <li> Best eyelash glue out there, and I have tried a lot! Love how it dries black. Bottle lasts a long time as well :) !</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I no longer haave to worry about blending white glue the shows through my dark lashes with mascara. Highly recommend this product, works great! Just follow the instructions and you should have no problem! It also arrived on time and was exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of glue, but Duo brand works best for me. I use the dark and the clear version. But to me, the dark stays better. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have applied eyelash adhesive many times before. This brand is usually very good. I however do not think this is the true product. It came in the correct packaging, and tubing.. but it doesn&#x27;t adhere.</li>
            <li> this works very well just don&#x27;t get it on your clothing by mistake will not come out</li>
            <li> I am using the DUO Water Proof Adhesive now and it is supposed to be the best false eyelash glue around.  I have only used it two times so I will reserve judgment.  Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The glue used makes a huge difference when wearing false lashes, and this is the best for those with dark natural lashes.  I put a thin layer on the false lashes, then add a tad more to each end.  I then let it dry a little to get tacky, then adhere.  These hold the lashes on firmly, but don&#x27;t pull out my natural lashes when I remove the falsies.  I use an oil based eye make-up remover from Japan to remove all residue, otherwise I&#x27;ve found it difficult to completely rid my eyes of the glue residue.</li>
            <li> The Bomb.com, I won&#x27;t use anything else - there&#x27;s no reason to.</li>
            <li> I like how it comes on dark..but it&#x27;s not as waterproof as I thought it would be. But it still a very strong eyelash glue.</li>
            <li> works alot better then the glue i was using. last pretty long and is super cost effective for us divas who need our lashes &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> My order stated waterproof but the container of the product just said eyelash glue and no indication of being waterproof on the packaging</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to lashes. i brought several pair &amp; different adhesives to practice. Though I love that this is black, it doesn&#x27;t stay like the other white glue I practice with. I&#x27;ll keep trying...maybe it&#x27;s me.</li>
            <li> This is a great lash glue. The dark tone is always better to me because you can&#x27;t see the glue on your lashes</li>
            <li> All of the comments about this product are from newbie lash wearers who are thrilled at finding non-irritating glue in a  dark tone. DUO is great. This formula is great but it is NOT WATERPROOF.  I ordered it from housewares and received the kind that can be purchased at any CVS or beauty supply (for cheaper and much faster).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I contacted the vendor he abruptly offered to send me proof from the vendor that they no longer market this formula as waterproof but it was the same formula. Vendor was rude and wrongly assumed that this meant that the product was still waterproof. If it was, it would always be labeled with that sales point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that Duo got lots of complaints from selling the same formula as waterproof, when it was definitely not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just want DUO ark toned lash adhesive, buy that but don&#x27;t be suckered into purchasing a more expensive version by this falsely labeled ad for waterproof eyelash adhesive from Housewares. Go to a local drug store or beauty supply and save time (a and possibly money.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have allergies or are worried about heading to a wedding where you might get weepy, be forewarned... this lash glue does not have any special waterproof staying power as it is labeled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be illegal to market it as such, but hey, I guess they have gotten away with it since August 2013 so why stop now?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I wrote to the vendor about this they were insulting and rude saying that other customers were happy with their purchases. They went out of their way in their email to be condescending even going so far as to say \\&quot; I would much rather be honest and direct rather than coddle my customer&#x27;s as if they were extremely sensitive children. I&#x27;d rather interact with my customer&#x27;s as we were adults doing business.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how asking that they don&#x27;t falsely represent a product is making me like a sensitive child who needs to be coddled.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is how adults respond.lts respond.</li>
            <li> Works great. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash glue. Easy to put on and they stay on for days if I let them. Haha!</li>
            <li> It lasts all day. Very helpful.  I wear them everyday now. I will definitely buy it again. the only thing is I would like it in clear color.</li>
            <li> This glue makes my eyes burn. It may be due to the latex in it. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to stick very well at the edges when compared to other quality brands.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I saw a make-up artist use it.  I found it a little cumbersome to use.  But that is just my opinion.  I do like that it dries black.</li>
            <li> I always had troubles whit fake lashes! I was never able to use them, but not anymore! This glue is amazing! It&#x27;s a bit of a pain to remove, but totally worth it (:</li>
            <li> Most eyelash adhesives are awful and don&#x27;t last very long. I used to use weave glue (bad idea, bad for your eyes!) on my eyelashes just because normal glue just wouldn&#x27;t hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS eyelash adhesive works. For hours on end if you apply it correctly. (I usually have mine on for 8+ hours per day)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Use very little of this glue on the lashes, blow on it a few times (the hue will change slightly when it&#x27;s at its best), then apply (I hold them still for a couple of seconds and then let go while applying)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me a little while to get used to it because if you put the glue on before it&#x27;s been exposed to air long enough, it won&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11/17/2012 Update&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a while I ceased use when I found out it contained formaldehyde and linalool (which I have a mild allergy to). During my last bout of strip lash use, I used Kiss&#x27;s Eyelash Adhesive as it did not have those ingredients. To get it to work I had to apply it both on my eyelid and the eyelash strip - too much hassle. I have officially given up on these things. Getting my eyelashes done by a professional now... Mink &amp; faux mink ftw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have no allergies or qualms about putting formaldehyde by your eyes, this is still the best working of the strip lash adhesives.</li>
            <li> Works fine enough, but the smell is so offensive I could barely use it.  Smells like sulfur (rotten eggs).  EWWW.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant ordering the darker one because I don&#x27;t always like to wear fake eyelashes with eyeliner, but it was several bucks cheaper so I figured it was worth the investment. I was not let down. Having never used this brand, I was shocked when the glue (when applied evenly and correctly) stayed during whole work shifts! It didn&#x27;t even look like I was wearing unattractive eyeliner on the top either:]</li>
            <li> It worked great for the long eyelashes I bought! The glue kept them on for hours and didn&#x27;t mess with my make up at all. And it came right off the eyelashes so I can reuse them!</li>
            <li> this makes your lashes stay on for days ive had mine on six days now and they show no signs of coming offf and i ike that its black also like the lashes</li>
            <li> What a change. For YEARS I have told myself I simply am not able to wear eyelashes. Every attempt I&#x27;ve ever made- failed. Even the subjectively successful ones ended up with the lashes coming off my eyelash and having me look like a humanoid moth or something crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured I was just the problem or maybe the lash was too stiff even if I did all I could to make it flexible. Nope. Still failures. All the youtube tutorials showing how easy it was couldn&#x27;t fix a thing. So finally I did a little more research as to WHY putting eyelashes might be difficult and adhesive was the number one stated factor! Everywhere I went, everyone I talked to, everything I read, Duo was the most commonly recommended adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now that I own some (two, just to be safe) I can see it really is the biggest factor in successfully putting on lashes! It&#x27;s a freaking miracle! I ordered some Ardell Invisibands here on Amazon just to at least practice with them and before my Duo arrived, I used this clear swipe on adhesive. Didn&#x27;t dry flexible, it was horrible, those babies were coming off my eyes in less than a couple of hours and I took them off. Next day, I tried some Ardell. Saaaame failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINALLY DUO ARRIVES! I squeeze just a little bit and PHEW, does this stuff stink when its wet. Smells like urine and Hell. But the scent quickly dissipated when I wiped it on the lash&#x27;s band line. 25 seconds pass and I get ready hoping for the best and put that lash onto my lid&#x27;s edge! My hands were a little shaky so the application wasn&#x27;t perfect, but it was good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go to work.. and the whole day, the lashes HAVE. NOT. BUDGED. It&#x27;s a miracle! Later that night, I take it off with surprising ease and remove the glue from the lash in one solid string! The miracle then happens the next day, and the next, and the next, and now I&#x27;m putting on lashes like it&#x27;s nothing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1, I am so freaking proud of myself and&lt;br /&gt;2, THIS STUFF IS AWESOME! Seriously everyone, if you&#x27;re new to lashes, GET THE ADHESIVE ON POINT! Duo is freaking spectacular!!</li>
            <li> yes, the price was good, but the product does not work good at all!  took too long to dry; finally just pulled lashes off as I was aggravated that it didn&#x27;t work... would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Amazon said it would ship the 16th-20th. I got it the 15th. The product came exactly as shown. Great! So excited it came earlier than I expected. On the other hand... the price doesn&#x27;t excite me to much.</li>
            <li> This product is really wonderful! I use it every time i put lashes on and it holds them on for the whole day but still come off painlessly! I would recommend this brand to anyone! the dark glue does show if it comes on your lid a little bit but it holds it amazingly and is easy to paint liner back over it.</li>
            <li> This eyelash glue works well. I use it in my professional makeup artist kit. I would purchase this item again!</li>
            <li> this stuff I heard was the best lash glue money could buy so I got it but I wish it wasn&#x27;t in the dark tone color because if you are messy with it, it can get on your lid and its a dark color that is kind of hard to get off, but it kept my lashes on well</li>
            <li> The best have tried different glues its the real deal lashes stay on for hours and easy to remove. Love it</li>
            <li> Great but Walgreens have it for the same price. So if u can&#x27;t wait u can get it there but great stuff</li>
            <li> I really do like this glue, but I cant help but notice that on the page it said that the glue was WATERPROOF, however on the day that I received this the packaging didn&#x27;t say waterproof anywhere:(I still tried it out and it wasn&#x27;t waterproof at all. My eyes do get a little watery and for this reason I was hoping for a waterproof glue, but by the middle of the night the lashes started to come off. Anyways I still really like this product it lasted a pretty long time before the lashes started to come off and I find that this doesn&#x27;t budge so I will keep repurchasing:)</li>
            <li> Holds lashes on as long as you want them on.  Love the black since it blends in better than the white does.  Duo always holds up when I&#x27;m making up faces for special occasions.</li>
            <li> The Dark Tone worked great for Halloween. It mixed in well with my eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I do think this is one of the best eyelash adhesives for keeping the eyelashes attached in general, I don&#x27;t think it is completely waterproof, however.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly.  No problem.</li>
            <li> This adhesive really works. I tried some other brands that did not last at all. I read some other reviews and it is important to place a small amount of glue on some foil and wait a few seconds before you apply the adhesive to the lashes.</li>
            <li> Just didnt realize the tube was going to be so small for the price I paid for it.. Lesson learned. Read the size next time lol</li>
            <li> This is just simple super glue, just less harsh. Don&#x27;t expect it to be one of those things that is going to last 12 hours a day, every day. I like the dark tone because I don&#x27;t like to use a lot of eyeliner, so the falsies plus the darker glue enhances the lash line perfectly for me, eliminating an entire step in the makeup process. Make sure you put the lid on quickly, mine leaked out onto my dresser, luckily I had an old towel down and it didn&#x27;t ruin the wood. I am no expert and I found this glue quick and easy to apply, my lashes lasted the whole night with only one snag. I just pulled out the glue and fixed the corner.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give a review on the glue that I bought with my eye lashes because I couldn&#x27;t wear the eye lashes. The Duo Water Proof Eyelash Adhesive Dark Tone 0.25 Oz. really got good reviews so that is why I ordered it. If I ever get to use this product I will give a review on it. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You for your prompt service/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M.L.P.</li>
            <li> its not black, but its dark enough, works great</li>
            <li> It is gently with the eyes. Easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I think Duo eyelash glue is one of the best out there. I use this one and the dark tone one all the time. It lasts a long time and holds the lashes for a good amount of time. Easy to use and it does not irritate my eyes. Have repurchased this item in the drug store too.</li>
            <li> Duo glue works very well, and holds eyelashes on great!!!! The only thing is if you mess up with the glue it is obvious because the eyelash glue is colored. I would recommend the clear version for beginners since it is more forgiving. Also the pigmentation is a dark grey color, not the dark black color I was expecting. Don&#x27;t buy this if you don&#x27;t plan on always wearing black eyeliner with your false eyelashes!! Overall this glue has amazing staying power and is great for experienced false eyelash wears who like to wear dark eyeliner with their falsies!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. . Dries dark. Only eyelash glue I buy</li>
            <li> I bought this because others said it&#x27;s the best. I only tried it for the first time today, and I need practice applying the lashes, sp I cannot really say how good it works.&lt;br /&gt;It is advertised to be black but mine is gray. Also, the hole where the glue comes out is huge and it dispenses far to much than is needed to line the band of the lashes, so too much gets wasted.&lt;br /&gt;Has anyone else bought this and hsd the same problems tjat it is gray not black...and that way too much globs out not a thin bit? Please let me know.</li>
            <li> Best eyelash glue ever!!</li>
            <li> Love it but don&#x27;t know why I ordered it! Could&#x27;ve just bought it locally and save on shipping. I thought it was a larger tube!</li>
            <li> I have used soooo many different kinds of eye lash glue and this is the best!!! Yesterday, we experienced 30 mph winds and as I walked to my apartment from my car, my false eyelashes stayed on like they were real ;)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this stuff even needs another review... It is by far the best on the market hands down! Don&#x27;t waste your time/ money on other glues just get this it is fuss free and bottom line it works!</li>
            <li> Works great but it smells just like hair glue.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S TOO RUNNY FOR MY LIKING, BUT IT GETS THE JOB DONE.&lt;br /&gt;IT COMES OUT A MEDIUM GRAY COLOR AND DRIES A NICE BLACK COLOR WHICH IS PERFECT FOR MY LASH COLOR, CONCEALS AND BLENDS IN WELL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INSTEAD OF POURING IT OUT HORIZONTALLY, I&#x27;D RECCOMEND VERTICALLY OTHERWISE TOO MUCH WILL SPEW OUT. MINOR INCONVENIENCE. THIS IS MY FIRST TIME REALLY USING THIS SORTA STUFF, MAYBE THEY&#x27;RE ALL LIKE THAT FOR ALL I KNOW. BUT I DON&#x27;T CARE TOO MUCH FOR IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOPE THIS HELPS ! :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Amazon and its the many companies that work with them. Hallelujah, I don&#x27;t have to spend time going to the store and standing in lines!</li>
            <li> PERF. PERF. PERF! Absolutely amazing!! in LOVE. The eyelashes stay on for like, EVER!!&lt;br /&gt;If i ever run out of eyelash glue, i know which ones im getting ^^</li>
            <li> this product is pheonomenal! it comes out a light gray color and when it is time to put them on they turn to a darker gray and by the time they are completely dry to your eyelids they are as dark as my eyelashes. but thats not even the best part! they last a very long time! i had put my lashes on at about 8 pm i woke up played volly ball the next day til about 12 am and when i got home i had to peel them off. they werent anywhere close to falling off! i did learn that if you cry with this glue, they lashes will just fall off into your lap:) so no tears ladies:) the glue is easier to pull off so you can reuse the lashed a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only bad think about this product is when you dispense it onto your lashes for the first time, the opening is so large, too much glue comes out but you learn how much is enough eventually and how to apply it evenly. i can see myself running out of this product fairly quickly. perhaps if i used it every day id say it would last a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty bad at knowing when to apply the lashes. Like they say wait 30 seconds or until glue is tacky. Yeah well whenever I wait 30 it&#x27;s too dry and if I wait until I think it&#x27;s tacky, it&#x27;s too wet. But when I do get it to work, it&#x27;s amazing. Just make sure you concentrate on the corners of the lashes. They need lots of glue</li>
            <li> Best adhesive for false eye lashes! Individual lashes lasted 3 days with this adhesive! Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> It is not water proof ....l have tried this product was not happy with this item.. I tried several pair of lashes and washed face and the lashes came right off</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stick long enough</li>
            <li> Item was in good condition</li>
            <li> Just received.  Dark eyelash glue is a must</li>
            <li> This glue is NOT WATERPROOF!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is good if you plan on taking your lashes off before you sleep or before you shower.  The issue is after doing all that work to get them on they will be falling off. And then to get the glue off the lashes to use again and go through the same process everyday is impossible!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone know of a dark tone waterproof eyelash glue?</li>
            <li> Pros :&lt;br /&gt;Fast drying&lt;br /&gt;Sticks until you want to remove&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t hurt when I peel it off&lt;br /&gt;Nice color&lt;br /&gt;Cons :&lt;br /&gt;Smells like shrimp or has some funky odor</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good lash glue, since all the other ones I&#x27;ve used were horrible, and I had heard good things about the Duo lash adhesive. Decided to go with the darker tone, since I wear black eyeliner with false lashes. I&#x27;ve only used this adhesive once, but I&#x27;m already impressed with it. It kept my false lashes on for about 16 hours, and even when I took the lashes off they were still glued on pretty well. I&#x27;ll definitely buy again, even though I doubt I&#x27;ll have to for some time because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this lash glue for it&#x27;s durability and long-lasting effect. However, the length of time to dry is a bit annoying with the application, compared to other brands. If they came out with a quick-dry formula, I would be a life-long consumer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using false eye lashes 40 years &amp; have always used Duo dark tone adhesive. If u use the white that truns clear you have to wait for it to turn clear but with the dark it blends with the lashes and your eye liner. Great product!</li>
            <li> IT IS NOT WATER PROOF AS YOU DISCLAIMER STATES :(</li>
            <li> Best Glue I Ever Used. Doesn&#x27;t Irritate My Eyes &amp; Holds Great! Dries Black Too.</li>
            <li> this did not make my lashes stick. I had to reapply and reapply. it didn&#x27;t work. I thought this glue was supposed to be the best, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This is absolutley by far the best eyelash glue to ever be used! It stays on, its great and noone can tell unlike the white&lt;br /&gt;^-^</li>
            <li> The best eyelash adhesive I&#x27;ve used. It glues my eyelids together exactly as I hoped it would.</li>
            <li> this glue holds very well for us lash wears I do the individual and they stay on for 2weeks will be ordering some more. I  went swimming in my lashes to test the waterproof out was very pleased lashes are still on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;ve never bought the dark tone before.. it&#x27;s great bc when it dries it looks like eyeliner. All you have to do is go over it with your eyeliner to even the line out.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyelash glue I have used to date. It dries quickly and clearly and is easy to get off with a little soap and water.</li>
            <li> It works just as described. Be aware that when you first apply the glue it has a dark grey-ish color, but once is dry it turns black.</li>
            <li> I just bought this, based on others&#x27; reviews and can I say that I absolutely LOVE it! I had no idea what the difference was in dark or clear so I just bought the dark because someone else recommended it and and my eyelashes look awesome! This is the second day I&#x27;ve used it and I&#x27;ve worn it all day at work both days (so far). It never came off or looked bad with the eyelashes. Yesterday I applied it to my false eyelashes at 7:30 AM and i didn&#x27;t take them off till around 9 PM (4 hours after I got home from work). There was no need, they were on perfectly fine and we had some friends over so I didn&#x27;t want to take them off yet and they weren&#x27;t coming off on their own so I thought what the heck! I put them on at the same time today and so far so good! (It&#x27;s 2:30 PM). I don&#x27;t intend on wearing fake eyelashes every day or even every other day but I wanted to try them when I bought them and ended up loving them enough to put them on the next day lol. I didn&#x27;t even bother with the glue that came with the eyelashes because that was the only con to the eyelashes I bought, according to other reviewers. DUO worked perfectly! Highlyyyy recommend!!!! :)</li>
            <li> amazing glue. really works and I suck when it comes to putting false lashes</li>
            <li> I found it irritating .</li>
            <li> I ordered the dark tone and received the clear .... A month and a half later.</li>
            <li> Was a fake. Do not recommend. Thought it looked strange when received the packaging but opened anyway. I knew for sure the formula was very different when I put it on. Ruined my real lashes and irritated the eyes. Never again.</li>
            <li> Holds all day and blends with my eye-liner.</li>
            <li> the glue was hard to remove from eyelid.  what a mess.</li>
            <li> If you use it its great.</li>
            <li> It is fair enough. Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> If you were eyeliner, black adhesive is for you. I don&#x27;t have anything to compare DUO&#x27;s glue to but it meets satisfaction! It dries quick, isn&#x27;t bulky if you put a thin layer (which is all you need) and it blends well with eyeliner! Plus if you aren&#x27;t already wearing eyeliner, it looks like eyeliner. It easily hides the lining of the lashes so it works perfectly for me. This glue lasts all day for me. I went through roller coasters and Disney rides with my falsies on, and not a corner came off! I&#x27;m new to falsies but i am NOT switching to any other adhesive!</li>
            <li> Comes out gray and dries black! I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this lash glue I&#x27;ve tried over ten lash glues this is the first that will not burn my eyes! And it&#x27;s smell is not as strong as others but it really holds lashes all day! So it works plus is black and is in a squeeze tube! Love it came to me in perfect condition and fast!</li>
            <li> It is the ONLY glue worth using, in my opinion. Lashes stay on and glue dries dark so it looks natural. Seems to have a better texture than the clear, less watery. A little dab of this will do when you concentrate it on the outer corners.</li>
            <li> This was my first lash adhesive purchase. It was very messy when I first used it, but I learned how to use it without much of the mess. It applied well and my lashes stayed put! It did the job, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the one I got was either the real thing or a good one, mine would not dry and it may be from traveling a great distance but either way it sucked for me sorry person who sent it to me you can&#x27;t exactly quality check every last one but this one must have been a bad one... however the service was great and I got it rather quickly so that is great the product is the part that sucked.</li>
            <li> This item work for me no burning or discomfort I&#x27;ll recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this eyelash glue although I didn&#x27;t get the waterproof glue that Amazon stated it was but the company that sent them out to me made up for it! I did get a full refund &amp; Thankful for it because I wanted to waterproof lash glue cuz my eyes tend to water a little bit more than the average. Although I would have been a lot more happier with the waterproof lash glue I would definitely recommend this glue ;)</li>
            <li> works amazing my new favorite  ,</li>
            <li> This is not a waterproof product. It&#x27;s advertised as waterproof but what you receive is a regular dark tone adhesive.</li>
            <li> Ever since my first purchase using fake eyelashes from MAC, DUO is the glue they sold to me along with the eyelashes. Of course since then I have came to realize the price MAC charged me for eyelashes was insane and I now order from amazon. Once I ran out of glue I naturally came here to look for some new stuff. When I saw they sold a dark tone instead of white I instantly wanted to try it out. So I ordered it, it came two days later with my prime membership. It looks grey when it comes out but its better then white since I don&#x27;t go a day without eyeliner its perfect. I have never had a problem with this glue and I can go swimming without worrying my eyelashes will fall off. Thank you amazon for one less trip to the store yet again!</li>
            <li> I love using this glue when I wear false eyelashes. It is comfortable, strong, and the black color adds a volume/ liner affect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I use it is I put the eyelashes on FIRST. Before liner, shadow, mascara, anything. Then just wait a few minutes to dry (put foundation and other face makeup on). I usually use a bobby pin to help with edges and placing the lashes (I know that is the most difficult part for some people). Another tip is to use cuticle scissors to cut some lashes so the fit better. Then I can go and finish my eye makeup. If you use proper care and get decent lashes, I have had them last up to 3 days. This just includes not rubbing your eyes a lot and washing around them when you wash your face. Try not to put them under direct water in the shower either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I once fell asleep with them on while on vacation. Woke up and went wake boarding. After a few face plants they still lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removing them is quite simple too. Ive had glues that were like tar and impossible to get them off, and once had half of my eyelashes ripped out. This one I can just use my eye remover, or even olive oil, and it comes right off. No pain and is very quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never use another eyelash glue.</li>
            <li> Very strong eyelash glue. Kept my fake eyelashes on very well. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this for my fake eye lashes but this was like watery and it cost less at target, don&#x27;t be lazy like me just go buy it.</li>
            <li> Love this item. I used several other brands before, but was not happy. They are either hard to dry, or easy to fall off. But this item is different. It takes only 2-3 seconds to dry, and can last about one day. Also, when it is dry, it becomes dark.</li>
            <li> I love DUO I think that it is the best that I&#x27;ve ever used I&#x27;m a makeup artist and I suggest it to people all the time.</li>
            <li> I initially had no review as I have not tried the product at that time. But I have since tried it and I like it! It holds as it should and it is invisible once the adhesive dries! Can&#x27;t ask for more than that!&lt;br /&gt;I really love the idea of a dark eyelash adhesive because the white is sometimes visible on the lashline AFTER drying.</li>
            <li> This is my first time reviewing a seller/product on Amazon because it was quite clear to me, the seller scammed me.  When I opened my package, I initially realized I was sent the wrong product.  I had ordered the DUO Dark Toned Eyelash Adhesive but instead was sent the DUO Clear Eyelash Adhesive.  After further review, I was able to tell that the product was a fake.  Although it may look legitimate, the &amp;#34;printing&amp;#34; of the product was completely off-marked and looks to have been scanned on unlike the real DUO Eyelash Adhesive.  I&#x27;m not going to bother returning the item because it was less than $5.00, but I will for sure be throwing it out.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s gone into the product and by the looks of the packaging, who knows; it could be Elmer&#x27;s Glue!</li>
            <li> Be aware that this specific listing isn&#x27;t for the waterproof glue.  However, if you get the waterproof glue, it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li> The item was not water proof as described on the internet, and it looked different, was not happy with the item.</li>
            <li> It works very well.  Lashes stayed in place all day.  I darker color also works well not showing the glue if you use it properly</li>
            <li> This glue is not easy to apply, very un user friendly  comes out of the tube thick and just did NOT do the job of keeping the lash in place :(&lt;br /&gt;Very disapointed and would not recommend or purchase this product it is gooey and does not work</li>
            <li> Works perfectly great. It hold perfectly and lasts long unlike other products. Shipped very fast</li>
            <li> Duo is hands down the best adhesive when it comes to appearance and function. It does not dry sticky like many of the store bought brands and the dark tone blends great with eyeliner and mascara without the odd milky residue that the &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; adhesive leaves. Stays in place like a charm but can easily be cleaned from falsies with a q-tip and rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Keeps your lashes on all day and night. Easy application Bc it gets tacky after a while. Easy to take off with warm water.</li>
            <li> Never wore fake eyelashes before this. Duo was great. Made the lashes look perfect &amp; they stayed in place perfectly.</li>
            <li> It is hard to buy the dark tone in any drugstore like CVS. very satisfied, definitely will buy it again.</li>
            <li> It works perfect! So sticky. Nice! But if you&#x27;re a bit clumsy like me.you can get gray spots on your yes and it spoils the whole make up,be careful when you are applying it ,and them you will get nice results !</li>
            <li> Works great to hold eyelashes. Holds all day, and you cant even see it. Make sure to put your eyeshadow and eyeliner on first though. (:</li>
            <li> Is this really waterproof? Any slight humidity makes the lashes fall off. Not good for me because I have a tendency to have teary eyes.</li>
            <li> Loved it, it lasted a long time</li>
            <li> This was a really good buy including shipping &amp; a good eyelash adhesive. It gets the job DONE!!! It may be cheaper locally--(research in your local area first).</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eyelash adhesive. It is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t show, can be a little stringy, hard to remove all, but not too bad. One tube goes a long way. I have ordered several, and bought from stores too (same price or more). Worth the price, which actually is not bad. Will get more. I&#x27;d like to try the clear.</li>
            <li> you can use a small amount great holding and dries quickly. Easy to remove with eye makeup remover, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Neither the package nor the tube is labeled as waterproof. The seller&#x27;s photo shows different product from the one I have received. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Best glue ive used so far but I think its just the same price or maybe even less at the store walmart or any other drug store</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever tried the Duo glue for my false eyelashes...I have sensitive eyes and wear contacts and these did not irritate my eyes.....however, these are NOT WATERPROOF. They still allow the lashes to stay on a long time. I love that this glue goes on as gray and then it turns to black to blend with my lashes. Highly satisfied!</li>
            <li> when i recived it, it was very runny/ watery had a hard time drying . didnt use it more than 3 times.</li>
            <li> duo lash glue is amazing. its my first choice lash glue</li>
            <li> I was trying to use the glue that came with my lashes to much frustration. So I ordered this in black and I love it! It&#x27;s easy to use and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> 3 stars only because I ordered waterproof and received non-waterproof, so I&#x27;m kind of disappointed since I ordered it BECAUSE I needed waterproof, but that&#x27;s ok. Still a great product.</li>
            <li> Great deal love this stuff never put on lashes before but this stuff works great came on time and I will be getting more</li>
            <li> Good, but I might be having a mild allergic reaction to it during use.</li>
            <li> Works good. It does what others costumers review.</li>
            <li> Keeps lashes on with no reapply later.</li>
            <li> Barely acceptable gloppy tube of glue. Nothing comes out of the tip in an even flow - it&#x27;s big drops, air &amp;#34;farts,&amp;#34; or nothing. It also dries a particularly ugly shade. Ugh, what a poor choice.</li>
            <li> I like the dark tone so it helps hide the adhesive much faster. I usually use extra glue around the tips of the lashes to help it stay more through the night, but with DUO, there is no need.</li>
            <li> Seems to work very well for me.  I never have a problem with my false eye lashes falling off.  I like the dark color much better than the clear.  Very easily blends with my black eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This glue does not last long, maybe two or three hours and gets kinda itchy. Its cool for someone if your not going to rock your lashes all day. I used it for a week , and my eye&#x27;s are kinda dry now but it is no big deal this reminds me of the bonding glue that women use on their hair... its the same thing.. I  would rate it average.. I don&#x27;t know about water proof ..</li>
            <li> I use these for applying individual flare lashes and they last a week! I&#x27;ve never used them for strip lashes, but assume they would function well for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Works better than the other one I bought. I should have read the reviews and I would have bought this one first. easy to use as I am a first time user of false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I had no idea you could purchase eyelash adhesive in anything other than the white.  This works beautifully - strong too.</li>
            <li> Its not the right thing!!!!</li>
            <li> Horrible! Don&#x27;t purchase. I think this is fake. I received it and it had cracked in the pkg so there was product falling out when i opened the packaging. When i tried to use it, it wouldn&#x27;t dry, stayed sticky for hours. Went straight to the trash! I took photos, will upload layer as i don&#x27;t have them handy at the moment.</li>
            <li> I wear a ton of eye makeup, and this dark tone is great.  It last all day, even through tears!!! I wear it all through work and there is no movement.  It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> sticks perfectly all day all night! stuck on  through roller coasters and jet skiis and even sleep. i will never use another glue</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for! Looks grey when you apply it, but dries to black. Plus, a little goes a long way. Six months later and I still haven&#x27;t finished my first tube of it.</li>
            <li> I got the white one. and it took forever to get here</li>
            <li> only lash glue to work for me. the glue lasts for so long (depending on how well you put on your lashes of course) even when i accidentally sleep in my makeup my lashes will survive the night! So amazing, will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wear eyelashes until I found out about this glue.  It is really good and I love it which means they will now probably stop making it.  Nooooooooooo!  Unlike other glue, this does not get that dry scratchy feel during the day.  There is something in it that keeps it flexible and it doesn&#x27;t feel like you need to pick it off.  It&#x27;s that same quality that lets you clean off the glue from the lashes at night and thus you can get long use out of the same pair.  I got really good results putting the glue on the lash when I read about the method makeup artist, Carmindy, of What Not to Wear uses.  She puts a dab of the glue on her non-dominant hand and then using tweezers runs the edge of the eyelash strip through that.  For me this works like a charm!  [...]</li>
            <li> My girlfriend told me it was the best and she was right. Lashes stayed on all night with no problem, thanks again!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be better from all the reviews that i saw, but it&#x27;s not that good as I thought after i used it...</li>
            <li> I brought this glue because I the other stuff only last on my eye for one day especially if I am going out and dancing because I sweat so bad the would wipe right off...this glue is super stays on last on my eye lashes for at least two weeks</li>
            <li> Duo is probably the best brand I&#x27;ve used for eyelash adhesive. All the other one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried never adhere too well. You only need a tiny bit and it holds very strong. It&#x27;s also really easy to remove. None of my own eyelashes ripped off or anything, as it does with many other lash adhesives. I will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
