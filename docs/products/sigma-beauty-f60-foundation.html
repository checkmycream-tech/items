    <ol>
            <li> Just as described. Legitimate product!</li>
            <li> too expensive for so so kinda brush</li>
            <li> Well made.  Used daily with either airflash or BB moisture makeup which leaves no brushstrokes.  Brush head fits perfectly within contours of the face.  Soft bristles but firm enough to stay together.  Cleans quickly.  I like this brush a lot!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good beginners brush for liquid foundation and I done some research and I got good advice about this one so I ordered it and I loved it since I got it</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It is even nicer than much more expensive brushes that I have used. Super fast delivery too. I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Excellent foundation brush.It gives a smooth and flawess application..Sigma brushes are a good&lt;br /&gt;value for your money.Try them out.You wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> Truly gorgeous. So soft. High quality. Affordable. Worth it investment. And I don&#x27;t even wear foundation, I use this for liquid illuminators and liquid or cream highlighters. So versatile.</li>
            <li> I love this brush for foundation it doesnt streek like i thought it would like my other brushes! its sooo soft and i love it! im never going back to my cheap brushes!</li>
            <li> I had actually emailed Sigma with a question of which to buy - F60 or F80. They never got back to me and so I bought the F60 here on Amazon. Mine was shipped from Etailz which is an authentic Sigma seller. It shipped super fast with Prime membership.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it and my foundation looks great! I had splurged on a decent foundation ad wanted something that helped spread it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty noticeable pores on the sides of my nose. I am 34 years old with pretty smooth skin but I hate those pores. I have never tried a foundation brush and always used a sponge. But this works great! It really got into my pores and made them less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would guess they &#x27;disappeared&#x27; about 80%. I would highly recommend this brush. The rest of my face looks airbrushed.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this brush.  Soft sturdy bristles that apply foundation smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> Wonderful foundation brush. Applies smoothly with no lines. Flawless finish</li>
            <li> I use this to apply liquid makeup and or moisturizer.  It is very soft, no shedding, and holds/spreads just perfect. It doesn&#x27;t hog the product up.  I love it! THANKS!</li>
            <li> I use this for my MAC concealer actually I like a larger buffing brush for foundation.  It really is amazing quality, just depends on how you use it and what you prefer.</li>
            <li> Great brush! Received it fast</li>
            <li> Excellent brush!!:) I love how easy it is to hold</li>
            <li> This brush works great!!</li>
            <li> Soft nice brush. Evenly distributes the makeup. The makeup really sticks in the brush though and it has been hard, in my opinion, to wash out my foundation. Overall a great brush though. It provides a good application and the bristles seem to stay even though I wash it quite often.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It&#x27;s absolutely what I want. Very good quality, useful design and easy manipulation also for beginners :)&lt;br /&gt;Are you looking for good quality/ price brushes? This is right choice!!!</li>
            <li> Great, high quality brush.  I just got a BB cream (a little behind the times) and this brush does a great job.  i haven&#x27;t used foundation makeup in the past because it looks streaky but this brush takes care of that problem and feels really nice on my skin.  I have sensitive skin and it hasn&#x27;t irritated at all.  I haven&#x27;t washed it yet so we&#x27;ll see if it stands the test of time</li>
            <li> Very nice brush. Hold together very well. No missing bristles. Stays true to its shape. Firm but soft and spreads the foundation evenly.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the eyes kit by Sigma and loved the brushes. I decided to try the Sigma foundation brush. What can I say, I&#x27;m loving Sigma Makeup Brushes.  I use both a foundation and sometimes a tinted moisturizer with a creamy consistency.  I love these brushes and the delivery time is superfast!  I&#x27;m big on good customer service.</li>
            <li> I love all of sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> Really nice, doesn&#x27;t absorb foundation into the bristles which is what I was looking for. Made well, cleans easy.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the synthetic hair.  Applying primer was smooth and easy.  Not planning to use it for foundation because I have the Kabuki brush for that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a staunch MAC addict! I love their brushes, and will only use their brushes. I decided to get the Sigma brushes because I needed brushes I could take to work, but would not mind if I lost them. These brushes are amazing! They&#x27;re soft and wash so nicely. No shedding and apply like a dream! Best of all, they&#x27;re cheaper than MAC! I&#x27;ve purchased two of each because I like them that much!</li>
            <li> I like it it is very  nice product soft and easy to use, thanks sigma keep the good work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards</li>
            <li> This brush was perfect. It was easy to clean and it cover perfectly your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended , good quality</li>
            <li> I got the premium kit but it didn&#x27;t have my favorite style foundation brush, so I bought this one to complete the set.</li>
            <li> I use this with my favorite BB cream ans swirl in a circular motion to minimize pores. . .virtually non-existent.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!  Never has shed once!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic brush. My first Sigma (Lisa Eldridge recommended, Lisa E. I love you!) and I think I will come back to this brand. Solid product.</li>
