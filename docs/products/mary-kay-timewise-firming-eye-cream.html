            <li> Best Ever! I am 43 years old and trust me,..... I have tried every eye cream on the market. This is the ONLY one that actually does what it claims to do and is so nice feeling on and around my eyes. The only wrinkles I have are between the brows....but no crow&#x27;s feet! I swear by this and pray Mary Kay never stops making it!</li>
            <li> Love Mary Kay products. No irritation, easy to use, very light on skin and serves it purpose.</li>
            <li> My mom has been using this for 30 years now it&#x27;s my turn so far so good but u don&#x27;t even need a full pump just a bit less than half bc it would be too gunky</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It seems to help with the puffiness above and below the eye.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, awesome</li>
            <li> Very hydrating compared to many high end products!</li>
            <li> It is ok was not what I was thinking, I still use it on occasions. I can not tell that it helps!</li>
            <li> Toothpicks in a bottle! I&#x27;ve tried at least 15 types of eye creams ranging from the least expensive to the highest end. None come close!</li>
            <li> I like Mary Kay products, but I think $4.99 for each item purchased, for shipping and handleing is to steep. When ordering more than one item, there should be a lower rate!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this product!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent item. I love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. One of the few eye creams where you can actually feel it tightening the skin. Not uncomfortable, you just know it&#x27;s working! Worth the price, lasts for quite a while!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It goes on very smoothly. It firms the eye area very well. I particularly like the way it decreases the lines between my eyebrows. They almost disappear after I apply foundation.</li>
            <li> My all-time favorite Mary Kay product.  I feel that this is the best eye-cream that I&#x27;ve used.  I have been using this for several years.  Every now and then I try a new product, but always go back to the Mary Kay Firming Eye Cream.</li>

            <li> Really does wonders for your eyes, and leaves them feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> Best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used! Have used it exclusively ever since the product was introduced...</li>
            <li> I like this eye cream because it is firming and has a wonderful consistency that applies well.
