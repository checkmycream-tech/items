            <li>Helps an old lady look good.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.com!!!</li>
            <li>it cost me more because of the shipping charges, but I am willing to pay the shipping in order to get this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Originally I frosted my hair for years.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend for a quick fix.</li>
            <li>the smell didn&#x27;t bother me at first not after a while I noticed a chemical taste in my mouth!</li>
            <li>good product to take the yellow out of graying or very light blonde hair</li>
            <li>To fight this undesirable issue, I use  about 4 dime-size amounts, first 2 on the temples, and 2nd part over the top to melt the smooth tint.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for any blond or white hair that shows signs of any brassy and yellow.  </li>
            <li>This picture is of the original product, what I was received was the new style.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a clear light purple , I&#x27;d recommend going darker gray to cover that</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find it locally anymore.</li>
            <li>The good thing that it totally washable and any overdoes could be corrected by simple water rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li>It is not always available at any of my local pharmacies ...</li>
            <li>It does the job very well and does not leave a residue on my hair nor does it come off on anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I would like to hilight my grey-white hair and this really works.</li>
            <li>-full Rinse #49 Ultra White Minx .  </li>
            <li>They claimed to be selling the older version of Fanciful</li>
            <li>It truly works, and makes your hair very soft!</li>
            <li>I like the White Minx better than the steel grey shades which sometimes leave a bluish cast to my hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you had solid grey hair, it would work better?</li>
            <li>so I ordered one &amp; got the new version.</li>
            <li>this is a good brand, but hard to find in local stores.</li>
            <li>but it you want to tone down yellow/green tinges, this is too light to do so-</li>
            <li>And my hair is frosted a very light/whiteish blonde.</li>
            <li>This product really does the job of keeping my bleached hair looking platinum rather than yellow.  </li>
            <li>Gentle on the hair, and washes out later on.</li>
            <li>The only reason I ordered was because I wanted the old version, so I waited 7 days and paid shipping for something I could of picked up at the local beauty supply store.</li>

            <li> Brightens the grey hair and stays in for several days.</li>
            <li> great - too bad it cannot be found on any store!</li>
            <li> /&gt;During the time I was unable to purchase it I tried many other products that claim to remove brassiness from grey or lightened hair.  </li>
            <li> this review is for the pink bottle version though I think they&#x27;re the same...</li>
            <li> I like using on wet hair - zero fritz when dry and corrects highlights.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not my hair getting in my mouth either, it&#x27;s just a wafting smell while the hair is wet?</li>

            <li> In the past few years I have had a hard time finding the White Minx and could find no one who would order it for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this to keep my silvery hair looking silvery and not yellowy-grey for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Then I brush it, and use my usual hair styling products.</li>
            <li> They should be removed for false advertising.</li>
            <li> it makes me feel kinda sick, I chew gum to distract from it.</li>
            <li> I hate blow during my hair, but I will just to get rid of the smell/taste.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just what I needed. Great product! Great service!</li>
            <li> so far has worked great. Im very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> I use this often to keep my grey/white hair from yellowing. I like the White Minx better than the steel grey shades which sometimes leave a bluish cast to my hair.</li>
            <li> good product to take the yellow out of graying or very light blonde hair</li>
            <li> I have written before regarding this product.  If your hair is silver or gray ... and has those &amp;#34;mousy&amp;#34; colors or not quite silver or gray, you will love this product.  It is not always available at any of my local pharmacies ... Easy to purchase on this site.</li>
            <li> It runs everywhere. Only put it on after your done washing and rinsing your hair, still while in the shower so you can rinse out of the shower stall. Also, it did nothing for my hair. Didn&#x27;t brighten it. Didn&#x27;t make it easier to manage. A waste of my money. Maybe if you had solid grey hair, it would work better? I honestly don&#x27;t know. But for me, it did nothing. And my hair is frosted a very light/whiteish blonde.</li>
            <li> Nice to know I can order it from here; everything is 5 star</li>
            <li> This picture is of the original product, what I was received was the new style. This picture should be changed it is misleading. The only reason I ordered was because I wanted the old version, so I waited 7 days and paid shipping for something I could of picked up at the local beauty supply store. Please be aware of this, it is false advertising!</li>
            <li> great - too bad it cannot be found on any store!</li>
            <li> They claimed to be selling the older version of Fanciful so I ordered one &amp; got the new version. They should be removed for false advertising.</li>
            <li> This keeps gray hair looking silvery and not yellowed. Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t stain your hands.</li>
            <li> I ordered it for my wife and she says &amp;#34;exactly what I was looking for&amp;#34;.  I can&#x27;t give a better review that that!</li>
            <li> I love this product and have not been able to find it when I need it; therefore, I order it in bulk.  This takes out the yellow in grey hair or color treated hair.  I don&#x27;t care if you are a blond or a redhead.  It works great.  I by both this and Roux Fanci-full Rinse #49 Ultra White Minx .  I love them both.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this to keep my silvery hair looking silvery and not yellowy-grey for a few years now. It does the job very well and does not leave a residue on my hair nor does it come off on anything.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spilt it on the tub and sink and on towels. It washes out easily as it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> this review is for the pink bottle version though I think they&#x27;re the same...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if your hair is gray/white it does tone to a brighter white but it you want to tone down yellow/green tinges, this is too light to do so- it&#x27;s a clear light purple , I&#x27;d recommend going darker gray to cover that color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also it smells... the smell didn&#x27;t bother me at first not after a while I noticed a chemical taste in my mouth! it makes me feel kinda sick, I chew gum to distract from it. it&#x27;s not my hair getting in my mouth either, it&#x27;s just a wafting smell while the hair is wet? I hate blow during my hair, but I will just to get rid of the smell/taste.</li>
            <li> The color is very rich.  Leaves hair soft and easy to manage.  Would recommend to give grey hair a beautiful lift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with my product since I cannot find it in any stores</li>
            <li> Good for after-shampoo.  Helps take the yellow out of blonde hair and doesn&#x27;t stain towels noticeably.  Haven&#x27;t been able to find it locally anymore.</li>
            <li> works great, client very happy</li>
            <li> I like using on wet hair - zero fritz when dry and corrects highlights. It is like using setting lotion...if you remember that stuff!</li>
            <li> This product really does the job of keeping my bleached hair looking platinum rather than yellow.  I would recommend for a quick fix.</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed.. I use it after every wash. I works as a toner for my hair. Otherwise it would be brassy.</li>
            <li> Every lady needs a way to refresh the shine on her hair color- this is a good brand, but hard to find in local stores. Works as a  rinse in the morning.</li>
            <li> Works just like I want it to!!  Brightens the grey hair and stays in for several days.</li>
            <li> Arrived within a few days, well packaged and exactly what I expected.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for any blond or white hair that shows signs of any brassy and yellow.  I haave used it for years.  I love this product.  Don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
            <li> I love it!! It truly works, and makes your hair very soft!</li>
            <li> This product works great for what I use it for. Coloring my horses tails for Halter classes. Mix it with water and use in a spray bottle. Gentle on the hair, and washes out later on. Perfect! Stores don&#x27;t carry the color I need, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to find it on Amazon!! Thanks Amazon.com!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I also like this one.  It does not smell or leave stains, however, it doesn&#x27;t work on my hair color as well as the Ultra White Minx.  I would still purchase it though if I could not find the other.</li>
            <li> Helps an old lady look good.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> In the past few years I have had a hard time finding the White Minx and could find no one who would order it for me.&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, mind you it cost me more because of the shipping charges, but I am willing to pay the shipping in order to get this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the time I was unable to purchase it I tried many other products that claim to remove brassiness from grey or lightened hair.  NONE of them performed satisfactorily. Originally I frosted my hair for years.  Now I would like to hilight my grey-white hair and this really works.</li>
            <li> I have thin bleached blonde hair which gets yellowish about after a week of coloring, especially on the temples area. To fight this undesirable issue, I use  about 4 dime-size amounts, first 2 on the temples, and 2nd part over the top to melt the smooth tint. Then I brush it, and use my usual hair styling products. You may use a larger amount if want to achieve platinum-blond effect or have a thicker hair. The good thing that it totally washable and any overdoes could be corrected by simple water rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: if you put a towel-wrap after applying Fanci-Full, it might be stained,as well. However, those stains are easily washable,too.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, but I decided to go with another color because I changed the color of my hair. I would buy it again, it is very good.</li>
