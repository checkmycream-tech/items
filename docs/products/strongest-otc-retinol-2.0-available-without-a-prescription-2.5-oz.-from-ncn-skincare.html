            <li>I research everything before I buy it, and NCN products are all top-notch.</li>

            <li>I will continue to use it but am not overly impressed.  </li>
            <li>I have used SkinCeutical 1% retinol which works great</li>

            <li>Happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>

            <li>my skin clarity has greatly improved.</li>
            <li>Even though there was nothing she could do, it was all Amazon, she contacted me immediately and was very nice.</li>
            <li>This retinol is really nice!  </li>

            <li>This is very strong!</li>
            <li>REALLY GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Looking for a good Retinol?  </li>
            <li>Good investment</li>
            <li>but you still need a fair amount to cover a face.  </li>
            <li>Also, get a GOOD moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is a good product.</li>
            <li>It is really incredible how much better my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t tell by the way it felt like I can with this 2% retinol lotion--it burns, in a good way that tells me it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>but for sure my skin feels great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I am 48 and have worked in the sun for many years causing great damage to my skin.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like magic!</li>
            <li>I love it !  </li>
            <li>The fine lines and sun spots have greatly improved.</li>
            <li>It is amazing</li>
            <li>and I have to replace it just for my own piece of mine.</li>
            <li>and I am thrilled.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest</li>
            <li>I liked the bottle before you could see in it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with this Retinol, but then again I haven&#x27;t used very many products before with retinol in it.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly, and thought this would be great.</li>
            <li>Make sure to massage it into your face, it works much better!</li>
            <li>This has been WAY more effective.  </li>
            <li>*, Nanci Nivolo, is very attentive to customer reviews.  </li>
            <li>i love this and skincare is very important to me.</li>
            <li>Time will tell if she has better results, hence the 3 star rating for now.</li>
            <li>Pleased.</li>
            <li>Ive had my hands on some of the most advance retinol formulas.</li>
            <li>I need to love a product or it goes in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but you can tell that your skin is just getting better.  </li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>Bought for my boyfriend, who uses it at night and in the morning with zinc based sunscreen on top and he has seen a drastic improvement.</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d power through, thinking it would get better.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>but most people think I&#x27;m in my thirties.</li>
            <li>and I wanted something to plump up the skin so they would look better.</li>
            <li>My hands are looking much better.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more of this.</li>
            <li>but I have recently started using Boots No. 7 along with the NCN retinol at night and this combination is awesome.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I use a lot of her products and LOVE them all.</li>
            <li>It also works better than the retinol cream I bought from a prestige brand for $220.00.  </li>
            <li>Do love the product will buy again, and would recommend to anyone who asks</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff...</li>
            <li>in all, this is better for your health.</li>
            <li>Love this product -</li>
            <li>(the .3% was okay until I tried this</li>
            <li>What i am most impressed with is the fact that for me, I had zits re-occuring in the same area over and over.</li>
            <li>Follow their guidelines more than mine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a cream type.  </li>
            <li>I love a product that delivers so</li>
            <li>My face looks glowing in the morning and my complexion is very clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll get better and it&#x27;ll be worth it :)</li>
            <li>, the price is good and if I could find a stronger dosage for a decent price I would buy that.</li>
            <li>A good price, for a high level of retinol.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s the first step in effective skin turnover).</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see any difference in my fine lines.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if my fine lines are disappearing</li>
            <li>My skin is not sensitive to most products so this combination is great for me.</li>
            <li>I started to notice an increased number of sun spots on my face along with some fine lines in my forehead and in-between my eye brows.</li>
            <li>I thought this product would work far more better for the price I paid!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t vouch for all of their skincare products, but I can certainly say the owner stands by them and wants to make customers happy.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy to say those deep holes  in my face from acne are shrinking and almost gone.</li>
            <li>and my face feels smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>:B005SRTDWQ Strongest OTC Retinol 2.0% Available Without A Prescription from NCN Skincare]]</li>
            <li>Truth in advertising is important and NCN Pro Skincare cares about the consumer.</li>
            <li>how healthy and fresh I look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is fantastic.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my skin smooth, and once every couple weeks my skin will shed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and bright.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>This serum is pretty good, but after using it for a couple of weeks, I haven&#x27;t noticed too much difference in wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 3rd month of use and my skin looks amazing!</li>
            <li>There was no peeling or flaking at first and his skin looks better than it ever has.</li>
            <li>This retinol is worth every penny !</li>
            <li>The first brand I bought ( from Neutrogena Dermatologics) may have been okay</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this.</li>
            <li>In this day and age of dismissive and often rude customer service, I was immensely impressed.  </li>
            <li>After trying it faithfully for a while, I can honestly tell you that it was much less effective than the 1% SkinCeutical brand.</li>
            <li>I am 43 years old and this is the single best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin.  </li>
            <li>so i could feel it working, and it&#x27;s strong but not irritating (though i wouldn&#x27;t advise using a scrub before it!)</li>
            <li>I experienced my skin going a bit crazy for the first two months, but now my skin feels pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t see improvement rather quickly, I won&#x27;t use it again.  </li>
            <li>Delivery is always really quick.</li>
            <li>I saw a huge difference in my skin after about 2 months with my first bottle.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff, I am not even half way through  the bottle yet.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin, dry skin &amp; blackheads.  </li>
            <li>You might breakout at first but stuck with it!</li>
            <li>some of you will see breakouts the first week of use, but this stuff works!</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and I have to really look to see the scares now.</li>
            <li>Very creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li>Nancy (the owner of the company) was very helpful and attentive when I contacted her with questions.</li>
            <li>After seeing results from the product the cost of the product and the cost of the shipping are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>This by far is still my favorite.</li>
            <li>well worth the cost;</li>
            <li>I love the SkinCeutical product and only tried the NCN product because of the claim that it is the strongest OTC product available.</li>
            <li>For me, it tightened my skin so I look far more \\&quot;wrinkly\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I have resting wrinkles in some areas of my face but no one notices them until I smile.</li>
            <li>I would prefer it this was more of a clear serum like Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s line.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping</li>
            <li>Instead, my face has become soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely buy more products from this company.</li>
            <li>I thankfully also don&#x27;t have the red skin issue that so many describe.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to search for a higher retinol and hopefully find one that works.</li>
            <li>Sunspots have started to disappear and my deep wrinkles appear to be plumping out, for lack of a better term.</li>
            <li>after only one day of using this (washed face, then put a generous layer of this on, went to sleep), my face looks better.</li>
            <li>smaller pores, fewer pimples, and i&#x27;m glowing :)</li>
            <li>when i start getting low i will be definately be ordering more...</li>
            <li>, This bottle should last you a year or more.</li>
            <li>No peeling or funny reaction from this.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to use it daily!</li>
            <li>otherwise I would be buying it all the time because it really does work!</li>
            <li>I have noticed my fine lines becoming less noticable</li>
            <li>The big, aching, throbbing kind that are super obvious and cannot be concealed with makeup.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this because it had a lot of positive reviews.</li>
            <li>But, THIS item along with a mild exfoliant and deep-cleansing regimen have almost completely restored the texture of my skin to it&#x27;s pre-adolescent condition.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great for deep wrinkles, fine lines, and tightening.</li>
            <li>price is right to try it - you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised like I was!</li>
            <li>I use 1 squeeze for the whole area.  </li>
            <li>But really?</li>
            <li>If you want scientifically rather than anecdotally proven results, go to a real dermatologist and get an Rx.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very picky regarding products.  </li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t think there is any retinol in the product:/</li>
            <li>I use it even on my eyelids and it is not irritating at all.</li>
            <li>I absolutely believe that it is.  </li>
            <li>it with a Glycolic Peel if you really want to see the anti-aging, acne-clearing benefits.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I tend to break out after using almost anything on my skin, but I have never broken out using this product.</li>
            <li>- now I&#x27;m seeing real</li>
            <li>I have not had the slightest bit of irritation from this product, even on my neck, which is very sensitive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has really done both for me.</li>
            <li>It will work overnight, but it won&#x27;t make your face look like a supermodel&#x27;s over night - you do have to be patient and reasonable.</li>
            <li>then you used too much.</li>
            <li>Really liking it so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would also like to add that Nanci really does care about her customers.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what it is supposed to do, but I like to slough it off gently and apply an SPF to protect my new baby skin.</li>
            <li>have tried MANY other retinol products but they irritated my skin so much that I could never get much benefit from them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have had it with adult acne, please consider this product IF you are willing to be patient.</li>
            <li>I will post in another three months (meaning after a full six months of use) to report on any further results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is the only cosmetic that I have tried that actually does work on fine lines and wrinkles !</li>
            <li>The one comment I can remark, is that one still needs a &#x27;decent&#x27; amount of cream to cover the face for one application.  </li>
            <li>I recently researched retinol and now know that it is sensitive to light and air and that it should be kept in an aluminum tube.  </li>
            <li>I can see a tremendous improvement in the overall appearance and condition of my skin.</li>
            <li>a high price moisturizer.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Tried this on my face and neck but have not noticed any improvement in my skin; maybe my expectations were too high.</li>
            <li>With 2% retinol, it really delivers, but it&#x27;s a completely non-irritating formula.</li>
            <li>I guess I should have realized if it was that strong of a retinol it&#x27;d probably be a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But this one is not irritating, it is very soothing, Sometimes I fall asleep without putting anything over it and my skin is not dry or irritated at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will most likely immediately begin to dry up your acne and even break up some of your scarring.</li>
            <li>Wish I could get something strong, having breast cancer crying really damages the eyes, but I&#x27;m thankful for this.</li>
            <li>Only rating it 4 stars right now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed lines and wrinkles becoming less noticeable -</li>
            <li>I use several different products from different companies but this is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>It is available in other ways.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough, but so far, I don&#x27;t see any difference between this cream and many others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>My skin tech noticed my skin had a new sheen to it and asked what I was using.</li>
            <li>a retinol product, exfoliation, and to use a product to nourish the new skin (i.e. bell essence).  </li>
            <li>As soon as I&#x27;d get them to heal up, a new one would form.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t do that with the new bottle.</li>
            <li>I had to stop using it nightly, because it is strong and my skin needs time to adjust, but I would rather use it less often than not have it work.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive, rosacea-prone, maturing skin</li>
            <li>If you are at all prone to acne, I would steer well clear of this!</li>
            <li>as the old adage goes, &#x27; you get what you pay for &#x27;!</li>
            <li>It is quickly absorbed into the skin so you don&#x27;t have to wait long before you can apply a moisturizer over</li>
            <li>I still have faint wrinkles in areas above the lips and would love to see them eventually fade away :).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many wrinkle creams in the past.</li>
            <li>Better than the usual over the counter brands.  </li>
            <li>Did nothing for me - not sure product is authentic</li>
            <li>I use it consistently each evening, and although my skin turns slightly red after application, this is gone by the time I wake up.</li>
            <li>No odor, no excessive dryness.  </li>
            <li>One thing though, it certainly doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin - leaves it pretty soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>However, THIS product has helped make a tremendous improvement in the overall appearance and condition of my sensitive skin like no other in 25 years.</li>
            <li>and it is not harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li>Helps with pimples and wrinkles but you have to use it for at least a month or more.</li>
            <li>Have been using it for about a month, no problems so far.</li>
            <li>I have noticed my skin is much smoother and has a glow about it, however I have only been using it for 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I am a 35 year old woman of color and my skin just started showing signs of aging.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin even around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I bought it directly through NCN</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and breakout with any stress, exercise, sweating, etc.</li>
            <li>Skin is sensitive and I can&#x27;t go in the sun, but I&#x27;m waiting to see my sun damage lighten.</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several months and its definitely a gentle Retin A.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a month and notice that my skin is much hydrated the next morning.  </li>
            <li>Like its effects so far.  </li>
            <li>, I was looking for something that would battle both my adult acne and the beginning signs of aging.</li>
            <li>my skin is so silky soft after use and my pores have minimized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only used it for a week, without much of improvement so far.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since November and it really reduces wrinkles and deep lines.</li>
            <li>so you know how much you have left.</li>
            <li>A non irritating but, effective retinol.  </li>
            <li>My skin is a bit smoother and I have started breaking out slightly (which is NOT a bad sign</li>
            <li>I would very much like to get my money back and go back to the SkinCeutical product that I know works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the high price for the, small, amount.</li>
            <li>I read so many reviews where people said very little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>so I am currently unsure if there is anything medically proven about the formula or just some pretty perks just like any pharmacy commercial drug.</li>
            <li>have to wonder why there is no other product that claims to be over 1.0 percent.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about this product, which I&#x27;ve used in conjunction with NCN Copper Peptide Serum for my adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had wrinkles on my nose that are barely noticeable now.</li>
            <li>I will continue to update this review, for better or for worse.</li>
            <li>I stopped immediately, and it took another 4 weeks for my skin to calm back down.</li>
            <li>This is only the second brand of retinol that I&#x27;ve purchased, being new to using retinol.  </li>
            <li>and I was surprised at how little is used and how much the bottle contains.</li>
            <li>I am only a little more than half way through after three months of use!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>old male who, for decades, bore the remnants of teenage acne scars.</li>
            <li>This product  dose not dry out my face</li>
            <li>take my time and smooth it all over my face and do not put on eyelid and work my way down my face and end rubbing on down my neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really nervous about that because I usually do break out when trying a new product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see it differ in that respect from my other creams that were of a similar density.</li>
            <li>I had to start using the skinceuticals product every third night, and then eventually every other night, but it did its job very well.  </li>
            <li>, the first few weeks of a retinol product you can expect to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this product a high score anyway since I really shouldn&#x27;t evaluate something before trying it out for at least 6 months.  </li>
            <li>Yes, the shipping was high compared to other experiences I have had with shipping costs.</li>
            <li>The retinol increases the cellular turn over of the skin, which caused mine to purge, so I got more breakouts that usual and my skin texture was a bit blotchy and rough-looking in a few places.</li>
            <li>I use it almost every night (only because I&#x27;m sometimes lazy) and it has really helped tighten my pores and clear up my skin.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> REALLY GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Looking for a good Retinol?  </li>
            <li> Good investment</li>
            <li> but you still need a fair amount to cover a face.  </li>
            <li> Also, get a GOOD moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is a good product.</li>
            <li> It is really incredible how much better my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t tell by the way it felt like I can with this 2% retinol lotion--it burns, in a good way that tells me it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> but for sure my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I am 48 and have worked in the sun for many years causing great damage to my skin.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like magic!</li>
            <li> I love it !  </li>
            <li> The fine lines and sun spots have greatly improved.</li>
            <li> It is amazing</li>
            <li> and I have to replace it just for my own piece of mine.</li>
            <li> and I am thrilled.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest</li>
            <li> I liked the bottle before you could see in it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with this Retinol, but then again I haven&#x27;t used very many products before with retinol in it.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, and thought this would be great.</li>
            <li> Make sure to massage it into your face, it works much better!</li>
            <li> This has been WAY more effective.  </li>
            <li> *, Nanci Nivolo, is very attentive to customer reviews.  </li>
            <li> i love this and skincare is very important to me.</li>
            <li> Time will tell if she has better results, hence the 3 star rating for now.</li>
            <li> Pleased.</li>
            <li> Ive had my hands on some of the most advance retinol formulas.</li>
            <li> I need to love a product or it goes in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you can tell that your skin is just getting better.  </li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> Bought for my boyfriend, who uses it at night and in the morning with zinc based sunscreen on top and he has seen a drastic improvement.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d power through, thinking it would get better.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> but most people think I&#x27;m in my thirties.</li>
            <li> and I wanted something to plump up the skin so they would look better.</li>
            <li> My hands are looking much better.  </li>
            <li> I will buy more of this.</li>
            <li> but I have recently started using Boots No. 7 along with the NCN retinol at night and this combination is awesome.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I use a lot of her products and LOVE them all.</li>
            <li> It also works better than the retinol cream I bought from a prestige brand for $220.00.  </li>
            <li> Do love the product will buy again, and would recommend to anyone who asks</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff...</li>
            <li> in all, this is better for your health.</li>
            <li> Love this product -</li>
            <li> (the .3% was okay until I tried this</li>
            <li> What i am most impressed with is the fact that for me, I had zits re-occuring in the same area over and over.</li>
            <li> Follow their guidelines more than mine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a cream type.  </li>
            <li> I love a product that delivers so</li>
            <li> My face looks glowing in the morning and my complexion is very clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll get better and it&#x27;ll be worth it :)</li>
            <li> , the price is good and if I could find a stronger dosage for a decent price I would buy that.</li>
            <li> A good price, for a high level of retinol.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s the first step in effective skin turnover).</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see any difference in my fine lines.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my fine lines are disappearing</li>
            <li> My skin is not sensitive to most products so this combination is great for me.</li>
            <li> I started to notice an increased number of sun spots on my face along with some fine lines in my forehead and in-between my eye brows.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would work far more better for the price I paid!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t vouch for all of their skincare products, but I can certainly say the owner stands by them and wants to make customers happy.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy to say those deep holes  in my face from acne are shrinking and almost gone.</li>
            <li> and my face feels smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> :B005SRTDWQ Strongest OTC Retinol 2.0% Available Without A Prescription from NCN Skincare]]</li>
            <li> Truth in advertising is important and NCN Pro Skincare cares about the consumer.</li>
            <li> how healthy and fresh I look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is fantastic.</li>
            <li> and it keeps my skin smooth, and once every couple weeks my skin will shed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and bright.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> This serum is pretty good, but after using it for a couple of weeks, I haven&#x27;t noticed too much difference in wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 3rd month of use and my skin looks amazing!</li>
            <li> There was no peeling or flaking at first and his skin looks better than it ever has.</li>
            <li> This retinol is worth every penny !</li>
            <li> The first brand I bought ( from Neutrogena Dermatologics) may have been okay</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this.</li>
            <li> In this day and age of dismissive and often rude customer service, I was immensely impressed.  </li>
            <li> After trying it faithfully for a while, I can honestly tell you that it was much less effective than the 1% SkinCeutical brand.</li>
            <li> I am 43 years old and this is the single best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin.  </li>
            <li> so i could feel it working, and it&#x27;s strong but not irritating (though i wouldn&#x27;t advise using a scrub before it!)</li>
            <li> I experienced my skin going a bit crazy for the first two months, but now my skin feels pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t see improvement rather quickly, I won&#x27;t use it again.  </li>
            <li> Delivery is always really quick.</li>
            <li> I saw a huge difference in my skin after about 2 months with my first bottle.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, I am not even half way through  the bottle yet.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin, dry skin &amp; blackheads.  </li>
            <li> You might breakout at first but stuck with it!</li>
            <li> some of you will see breakouts the first week of use, but this stuff works!</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and I have to really look to see the scares now.</li>
            <li> Very creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li> Nancy (the owner of the company) was very helpful and attentive when I contacted her with questions.</li>
            <li> After seeing results from the product the cost of the product and the cost of the shipping are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This by far is still my favorite.</li>
            <li> well worth the cost;</li>
            <li> I love the SkinCeutical product and only tried the NCN product because of the claim that it is the strongest OTC product available.</li>
            <li> For me, it tightened my skin so I look far more \\&quot;wrinkly\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have resting wrinkles in some areas of my face but no one notices them until I smile.</li>
            <li> I would prefer it this was more of a clear serum like Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s line.  </li>
            <li> Very fast shipping</li>
            <li> Instead, my face has become soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely buy more products from this company.</li>
            <li> I thankfully also don&#x27;t have the red skin issue that so many describe.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to search for a higher retinol and hopefully find one that works.</li>
            <li> Sunspots have started to disappear and my deep wrinkles appear to be plumping out, for lack of a better term.</li>
            <li> after only one day of using this (washed face, then put a generous layer of this on, went to sleep), my face looks better.</li>
            <li> smaller pores, fewer pimples, and i&#x27;m glowing :)</li>
            <li> when i start getting low i will be definately be ordering more...</li>
            <li> , This bottle should last you a year or more.</li>
            <li> No peeling or funny reaction from this.  </li>
            <li> I love it and will continue to use it daily!</li>
            <li> otherwise I would be buying it all the time because it really does work!</li>
            <li> I have noticed my fine lines becoming less noticable</li>
            <li> The big, aching, throbbing kind that are super obvious and cannot be concealed with makeup.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this because it had a lot of positive reviews.</li>
            <li> But, THIS item along with a mild exfoliant and deep-cleansing regimen have almost completely restored the texture of my skin to it&#x27;s pre-adolescent condition.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great for deep wrinkles, fine lines, and tightening.</li>
            <li> price is right to try it - you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised like I was!</li>
            <li> I use 1 squeeze for the whole area.  </li>
            <li> But really?</li>
            <li> If you want scientifically rather than anecdotally proven results, go to a real dermatologist and get an Rx.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very picky regarding products.  </li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t think there is any retinol in the product:/</li>
            <li> I use it even on my eyelids and it is not irritating at all.</li>
            <li> I absolutely believe that it is.  </li>
            <li> it with a Glycolic Peel if you really want to see the anti-aging, acne-clearing benefits.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tend to break out after using almost anything on my skin, but I have never broken out using this product.</li>
            <li> - now I&#x27;m seeing real</li>
            <li> I have not had the slightest bit of irritation from this product, even on my neck, which is very sensitive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has really done both for me.</li>
            <li> It will work overnight, but it won&#x27;t make your face look like a supermodel&#x27;s over night - you do have to be patient and reasonable.</li>
            <li> then you used too much.</li>
            <li> Really liking it so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would also like to add that Nanci really does care about her customers.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what it is supposed to do, but I like to slough it off gently and apply an SPF to protect my new baby skin.</li>
            <li> have tried MANY other retinol products but they irritated my skin so much that I could never get much benefit from them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have had it with adult acne, please consider this product IF you are willing to be patient.</li>
            <li> I will post in another three months (meaning after a full six months of use) to report on any further results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is the only cosmetic that I have tried that actually does work on fine lines and wrinkles !</li>
            <li> The one comment I can remark, is that one still needs a &#x27;decent&#x27; amount of cream to cover the face for one application.  </li>
            <li> I recently researched retinol and now know that it is sensitive to light and air and that it should be kept in an aluminum tube.  </li>
            <li> I can see a tremendous improvement in the overall appearance and condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> a high price moisturizer.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Tried this on my face and neck but have not noticed any improvement in my skin; maybe my expectations were too high.</li>
            <li> With 2% retinol, it really delivers, but it&#x27;s a completely non-irritating formula.</li>
            <li> I guess I should have realized if it was that strong of a retinol it&#x27;d probably be a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But this one is not irritating, it is very soothing, Sometimes I fall asleep without putting anything over it and my skin is not dry or irritated at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will most likely immediately begin to dry up your acne and even break up some of your scarring.</li>
            <li> Wish I could get something strong, having breast cancer crying really damages the eyes, but I&#x27;m thankful for this.</li>
            <li> Only rating it 4 stars right now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed lines and wrinkles becoming less noticeable -</li>
            <li> I use several different products from different companies but this is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> It is available in other ways.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough, but so far, I don&#x27;t see any difference between this cream and many others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> My skin tech noticed my skin had a new sheen to it and asked what I was using.</li>
            <li> a retinol product, exfoliation, and to use a product to nourish the new skin (i.e. bell essence).  </li>
            <li> As soon as I&#x27;d get them to heal up, a new one would form.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t do that with the new bottle.</li>
            <li> I had to stop using it nightly, because it is strong and my skin needs time to adjust, but I would rather use it less often than not have it work.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive, rosacea-prone, maturing skin</li>
            <li> If you are at all prone to acne, I would steer well clear of this!</li>
            <li> as the old adage goes, &#x27; you get what you pay for &#x27;!</li>
            <li> It is quickly absorbed into the skin so you don&#x27;t have to wait long before you can apply a moisturizer over</li>
            <li> I still have faint wrinkles in areas above the lips and would love to see them eventually fade away :).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many wrinkle creams in the past.</li>
            <li> Better than the usual over the counter brands.  </li>
            <li> Did nothing for me - not sure product is authentic</li>
            <li> I use it consistently each evening, and although my skin turns slightly red after application, this is gone by the time I wake up.</li>
            <li> No odor, no excessive dryness.  </li>
            <li> One thing though, it certainly doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin - leaves it pretty soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> However, THIS product has helped make a tremendous improvement in the overall appearance and condition of my sensitive skin like no other in 25 years.</li>
            <li> and it is not harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> Helps with pimples and wrinkles but you have to use it for at least a month or more.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for about a month, no problems so far.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my skin is much smoother and has a glow about it, however I have only been using it for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I am a 35 year old woman of color and my skin just started showing signs of aging.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin even around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I bought it directly through NCN</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and breakout with any stress, exercise, sweating, etc.</li>
            <li> Skin is sensitive and I can&#x27;t go in the sun, but I&#x27;m waiting to see my sun damage lighten.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months and its definitely a gentle Retin A.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month and notice that my skin is much hydrated the next morning.  </li>
            <li> Like its effects so far.  </li>
            <li> , I was looking for something that would battle both my adult acne and the beginning signs of aging.</li>
            <li> my skin is so silky soft after use and my pores have minimized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only used it for a week, without much of improvement so far.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since November and it really reduces wrinkles and deep lines.</li>
            <li> so you know how much you have left.</li>
            <li> A non irritating but, effective retinol.  </li>
            <li> My skin is a bit smoother and I have started breaking out slightly (which is NOT a bad sign</li>
            <li> I would very much like to get my money back and go back to the SkinCeutical product that I know works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the high price for the, small, amount.</li>
            <li> I read so many reviews where people said very little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> so I am currently unsure if there is anything medically proven about the formula or just some pretty perks just like any pharmacy commercial drug.</li>
            <li> have to wonder why there is no other product that claims to be over 1.0 percent.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product, which I&#x27;ve used in conjunction with NCN Copper Peptide Serum for my adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had wrinkles on my nose that are barely noticeable now.</li>
            <li> I will continue to update this review, for better or for worse.</li>
            <li> I stopped immediately, and it took another 4 weeks for my skin to calm back down.</li>
            <li> This is only the second brand of retinol that I&#x27;ve purchased, being new to using retinol.  </li>
            <li> and I was surprised at how little is used and how much the bottle contains.</li>
            <li> I am only a little more than half way through after three months of use!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> old male who, for decades, bore the remnants of teenage acne scars.</li>
            <li> This product  dose not dry out my face</li>
            <li> take my time and smooth it all over my face and do not put on eyelid and work my way down my face and end rubbing on down my neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really nervous about that because I usually do break out when trying a new product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see it differ in that respect from my other creams that were of a similar density.</li>
            <li> I had to start using the skinceuticals product every third night, and then eventually every other night, but it did its job very well.  </li>
            <li> , the first few weeks of a retinol product you can expect to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product a high score anyway since I really shouldn&#x27;t evaluate something before trying it out for at least 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the shipping was high compared to other experiences I have had with shipping costs.</li>
            <li> The retinol increases the cellular turn over of the skin, which caused mine to purge, so I got more breakouts that usual and my skin texture was a bit blotchy and rough-looking in a few places.</li>
            <li> I use it almost every night (only because I&#x27;m sometimes lazy) and it has really helped tighten my pores and clear up my skin.  </li>
            <li> It does not seem to be as strong as we expected - it seems to do little for some dark patches but may have reduced some wrinkles is sun damaged skin.  </li>
            <li> I have wasted so much money each year on every new product that arrived in the drug store to eliminate my wrinkles, only to be let down.</li>
            <li> price is reasonable considering the results and as I said before, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used other retinols before, but since i&#x27;m sensitive to things like fragrance and alcohols, they made my skin hurt.</li>
            <li> I tried other stuff, I I have sensitive skin .  </li>
            <li> Instead, those areas are flat, and although they are red from years of repeated pimples, they are beginning to fade with time.</li>
            <li> Countless online and OTC cosmetic-related items make such absurd and fantastic claims about &#x27; restoring youthful a appearance &#x27;.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of SkinCeutical retinol products and had been using their 1% retinol prior to trying the NCN product.</li>
            <li> The bottle will last you a LONG time.</li>
            <li> It works slowly, the pure retinol by skinscuetical with only 1.0 works faster and smoother texture on my face and overnight results.</li>
            <li> It has lots of moisturizing ingredients also so it doesn&#x27;t dry your face out after the initial flaking/peeling.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s less expense if purchased directly as you can use a coupon on the site.</li>
            <li> When I had a slight issue with a product that had been damaged by the shipper, Nanci contacted me directly to find out how to remedy it.  </li>
            <li> Product goes a long way and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This product leave my face dry (i have vry oily skin) with out brake out.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t overly dry skin, but I also use a moisterizer over it.  </li>
            <li> Uglies\\&quot; (aka: Worse before better effect) which is fairly common.</li>
            <li> I used this for a little over two months and my face was like a war zone--anywhere from 6-10 pimples at a time when I generally have maybe 1-2.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve used Retinols in the past, both over the counter and prescription grade, so I know that an initial breakout is not something outside the realm of possibilities.</li>
            <li> It lightens them and definitely makes them less</li>
            <li> My wrinkles are much less noticeable and the deep ones have seemed to fill in.</li>
            <li> I expected my face to break out and become dry and flaky, but it didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> Just started using it roughly two weeks ago and &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; I am amazed at the difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> it has 1/2 the strength that this product is alleged to have.  </li>
            <li> the ncn had done its job at the alleged 2% strength, the skinceuticals 1% would not have had any effect.  </li>
            <li> Word of Caution: Be careful with this product around your eyes.</li>
            <li> Not much of a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> As time goes on, those scars are getting less and less deep.  </li>
            <li> but I guess being in the sun this past summer really had a negative effect on my skin.</li>
            <li> Helps appearance of skin, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> But, a little goes a long way AND</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, of THIS product, at first.</li>
            <li> If anyone has any other one&#x27;s to try go ahead and contact me on here about other one&#x27;s that work.</li>
            <li> Even though it is a small bottle it last for about 2 months.</li>
            <li> For this reason alone, I will try other NCN products.  </li>
            <li> I have no affiliation with NCN other than being a customer.</li>
            <li> I no longer get pimples in the same \\&quot;usual suspect\\&quot; areas.</li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> I am much like others in that I am always skeptical about products like this.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any type of breakout so far.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by fake purchased reviews, I just purchased real retinol at .05% for half the price</li>
            <li> now I have my eye on this company and have picked up a few other items they sell.</li>
            <li> I suggest using an exfoliator at least one day after using because it will bring up dead skin the next couple days after.</li>
            <li> In less than two days the bumps started to fade.</li>
            <li> As a 60 year old female who grew up in the Florida sun, the resulting damage to my skin was depressing.</li>
            <li> I typically use it at night for two consecutive days, then go off for a day or two.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Each morning there is a little flake of skin here or there on my previous acne scars.  </li>
            <li> I just put a drop on my finger and dab little dots of it around.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I think it may be improving, then other times I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> The label is a bit gimmicky</li>
            <li> and even I use a few hyaluronic acid drops with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> but I will be 43 in a few months.</li>
            <li> I noticed it working right away, not miraculous results like some bad midnight infomercial, small results.</li>
            <li> My buddy has been slathering retin-a on his face and looked raw and chapped after about a week of use.  </li>
            <li> hoping they stand up to the test like this little baby has!</li>
            <li> The generic for retinol that I had used for years has just gotten too expensive.</li>
            <li> I have worked for a plastic surgeon for years in the past.</li>
            <li> I apply generously every night and the bottle lasts at least two months-</li>
            <li> either the company knows that they are selling a useless product, or they don&#x27;t know enough about retinol to know its useless.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Therefore, it is impossible for me to believe this is 2.0 percent, after experience with other products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> quality and made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> this product is not sold in an aluminum tube, which would then render it useless, which is not surprising to me given the fact that this had no effect on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, this one was by far and away one of the worst.</li>
            <li> but I guess I was curious to see how a 2% retinol product would work (I hate pores).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey :(</li>
            <li> And it MAY be expensive.</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews before I bought it and was really skeptical.  </li>
            <li> I never threw away an expensive product like I did to this one.&lt;br /&gt;Bad</li>
            <li> Wish this stuff wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive .</li>
            <li> My hands have very thin skin</li>
            <li> Hopefully you won&#x27;t have as bad a reaction to it as I did.</li>
            <li> I am now using it to get rid of a bad tattoo, it seems to be helping that to.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch, they lied about the percent of retinol or if there is another chemical in the mixture that is canceling the retinol</li>
            <li> REALLY BAD FOR ACNE, MAYBE FOR WRINKLES</li>
            <li> BUT MY SKIN HAD BAD BREAKOUTS</li>
            <li> Very disappointed after 3 weeks of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> The plus with this is there isn&#x27;t parabens and that horrible glycol propylene which is used in</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my2nd bottle.  Obviously I like it since I re-ordered it, the price is good and if I could find a stronger dosage for a decent price I would buy that.</li>
            <li> I have been trying different brands for years and this is the one. The label is a bit gimmicky so I hesitated to order this one and decided to try it based on reviews. Yes, the shipping was high compared to other experiences I have had with shipping costs. After seeing results from the product the cost of the product and the cost of the shipping are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve used Retinols in the past, both over the counter and prescription grade, so I know that an initial breakout is not something outside the realm of possibilities. However, this one was by far and away one of the worst. I used this for a little over two months and my face was like a war zone--anywhere from 6-10 pimples at a time when I generally have maybe 1-2. I finally quit using it and my face cleared up in about a week. I just didn&#x27;t see enough benefits to risk further acne scarring on my face. I gave it two stars, because the amount you get for the price is acceptable. Hopefully you won&#x27;t have as bad a reaction to it as I did.</li>
            <li> Helps appearance of skin, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make me peel but I can tell it&#x27;s working My skin is a bit smoother and I have started breaking out slightly (which is NOT a bad sign, it&#x27;s the first step in effective skin turnover).</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie to YOU!.... I was skeptical, of THIS product, at first. Countless online and OTC cosmetic-related items make such absurd and fantastic claims about &#x27; restoring youthful a appearance &#x27;. However, THIS product has helped make a tremendous improvement in the overall appearance and condition of my sensitive skin like no other in 25 years. I&#x27;m a 47 yr. old male who, for decades, bore the remnants of teenage acne scars. Microdermabrasion and those, so-called, &#x27; scar therapy &#x27; creams were no help to me. But, THIS item along with a mild exfoliant and deep-cleansing regimen have almost completely restored the texture of my skin to it&#x27;s pre-adolescent condition. I will be reordering IT, soon. It&#x27;s worth the high price for the, small, amount. But, a little goes a long way AND as the old adage goes, &#x27; you get what you pay for &#x27;!</li>
            <li> REALLY GOOD PRODUCT IT DOES WHAT IT SAY I LIKE IT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with this Retinol, but then again I haven&#x27;t used very many products before with retinol in it. If anyone has any other one&#x27;s to try go ahead and contact me on here about other one&#x27;s that work. I experienced my skin going a bit crazy for the first two months, but now my skin feels pretty awesome. I will continue using this...unless I find another one to try. I like Retinol products though.</li>
            <li> Looking for a good Retinol?  This is it!  I have been using this product for 3 weeks, and have already noticed an improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for about 5 weeks.  It does not seem to be as strong as we expected - it seems to do little for some dark patches but may have reduced some wrinkles is sun damaged skin.  Time will tell if she has better results, hence the 3 star rating for now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product almost a month and I don&#x27;t see any difference in my fine lines. I guess I should have realized if it was that strong of a retinol it&#x27;d probably be a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to say those deep holes  in my face from acne are shrinking and almost gone. I am 46 and have lived with the embarrassment of craters on my face and neck with others staring at my scares. This product  dose not dry out my face and I have not seen any peeling. My face feels smooth and I have to really look to see the scares now. This is great stuff, I am not even half way through  the bottle yet. I use it in the morning and at night. I use 1 squeeze for the whole area.  I am now using it to get rid of a bad tattoo, it seems to be helping that to.</li>
            <li> I read reviews and wonder WHY? Why haven&#x27;t you tried Retin-A? I think I know. It is a prescription. It requires a doctor visit. And it MAY be expensive. But really? It is available in other ways. If you want scientifically rather than anecdotally proven results, go to a real dermatologist and get an Rx. People in the skin biz are profit oriented. Doctors are not.</li>
            <li> Using this product for a week and it definitely works, though the overall effect long-term will need to be evaluated. I had to stop using it nightly, because it is strong and my skin needs time to adjust, but I would rather use it less often than not have it work. Very fast shipping and I was surprised at how little is used and how much the bottle contains. Pleased.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.  Just started using it roughly two weeks ago and &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; I am amazed at the difference in my skin.  I read all of the reviews before I bought it and was really skeptical.  I expected my face to break out and become dry and flaky, but it didn&#x27;t! Instead, my face has become soft and smooth.  I&#x27;ve noticed lines and wrinkles becoming less noticeable - I am very impressed with this product.  I&#x27;ve even begun to use it on my hands.  Maybe now when someone guesses my age they won&#x27;t say &amp;#34;44&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been working as an esthetician for over 5 years and I come from a holistic approach to skin. Ive had my hands on some of the most advance retinol formulas. This by far is still my favorite. Its a generous amount too. I&#x27;ve used mine twice a week for over a year and I have to replace it just for my own piece of mine. I still have a quarter of a bottle left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for deep wrinkles, fine lines, and tightening. I suggest using an exfoliator at least one day after using because it will bring up dead skin the next couple days after. This is exactly what it is supposed to do, but I like to slough it off gently and apply an SPF to protect my new baby skin.</li>
            <li> I love it! Use it nightly----saw a difference in two weeks.Very creamy and smooth.Above my expectations.I have used this product since May.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any difference in my skin what so ever! I thought this product would work far more better for the price I paid!</li>
            <li> I have noticed my fine lines becoming less noticable and my face feels smooth and silky.  I use this product all over my face and neck every night; even under my eyes. A little goes a long way.  I will definitely purchase again when I get low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very picky regarding products.  If I don&#x27;t see improvement rather quickly, I won&#x27;t use it again.  I have aging skin (52 yo)so I need to love a product or it goes in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is reasonable considering the results and as I said before, a little goes a long way.  It is quickly absorbed into the skin so you don&#x27;t have to wait long before you can apply a moisturizer over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005SRTDWQ Strongest OTC Retinol 2.0% Available Without A Prescription from NCN Skincare]]</li>
            <li> This product leave my face dry (i have vry oily skin) with out brake out. My face looks glowing in the morning and my complexion is very clean. Good investment</li>
            <li> This product does what it claims. I am very happy with it. Will continue to purchase it. Even though it is a small bottle it last for about 2 months. I don&#x27;t use a lot at once.</li>
            <li> This retinol is really nice!  Doesn&#x27;t smell and doesn&#x27;t burn and you don&#x27;t flake and peel but you can tell that your skin is just getting better.  I&#x27;m trying a different brand that&#x27;s 2.5% retinol after I&#x27;m out of this one and will report back.</li>
            <li> After using this, my face looks brighter and well moisturized.  I don&#x27;t know if my fine lines are disappearing, I&#x27;d like to thing so but for sure my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> It is the strongest out there. This is my second bottle. People ask me what I have been doing to my face. Love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase. It does everything it says it does and it is not harsh on my skin. I would definitely buy more products from this company. Truth in advertising is important and NCN Pro Skincare cares about the consumer.</li>
            <li> Bought for my boyfriend, who uses it at night and in the morning with zinc based sunscreen on top and he has seen a drastic improvement. There was no peeling or flaking at first and his skin looks better than it ever has.</li>
            <li> Great product! Helps with pimples and wrinkles but you have to use it for at least a month or more. You might breakout at first but stuck with it! I even make my husband use it. I apply generously every night and the bottle lasts at least two months- well worth the cost; stop wasting money on drugstore lotions. Delivery is always really quick.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough, but so far, I don&#x27;t see any difference between this cream and many others I&#x27;ve tried.  I thankfully also don&#x27;t have the red skin issue that so many describe.  I still have faint wrinkles in areas above the lips and would love to see them eventually fade away :).  I&#x27;m giving this product a high score anyway since I really shouldn&#x27;t evaluate something before trying it out for at least 6 months.  I can perhaps update my response then as well.  The one comment I can remark, is that one still needs a &#x27;decent&#x27; amount of cream to cover the face for one application.  I read so many reviews where people said very little goes a long way.  It&#x27;s a thinner/wetter feeling cream so in that regard it helps to spread it but you still need a fair amount to cover a face.  I didn&#x27;t really see it differ in that respect from my other creams that were of a similar density.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for almost a week. So far so good. Can tell a difference in my skin and the smoothness and texture. Only rating it 4 stars right now but if continues to do what it is, it&#x27;s definitely a 5 star product. Make sure to massage it into your face, it works much better!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this. A good price, for a high level of retinol. Shipped quickly, and thought this would be great. Until, within days of starting to use (literally 2-3 days), I was breaking out. I figured I&#x27;d power through, thinking it would get better. No luck there. Instead, within 2 weeks I had massive bouts of CYSTIC acne all over. Between my eyebrows, on the tip of my nose, my chin, my temples. The big, aching, throbbing kind that are super obvious and cannot be concealed with makeup. I was horrified. I stopped immediately, and it took another 4 weeks for my skin to calm back down. If you are at all prone to acne, I would steer well clear of this!</li>
            <li> Great product good as it is described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many wrinkle creams in the past. I decided to try this because it had a lot of positive reviews. It is amazing and I love it. Not only have I noticed the wrinkles fading but my face has a youthful glow. I will be 50 this year but most people think I&#x27;m in my thirties. Best product!</li>
            <li> According to the web, this product has the highest amount of retinol in a non-prescription face product, which is why I bought it. Have been using it for about a month, no problems so far. No flaking or adverse reaction. Goes on well, no stinging. Seems to be doing the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now and I really don&#x27;t think there is any retinol in the product:/</li>
            <li> I bought this from NCN website and was looking forward to trying a 2% retinol product. I have used SkinCeutical 1% retinol which works great but I guess I was curious to see how a 2% retinol product would work (I hate pores). After trying it faithfully for a while, I can honestly tell you that it was much less effective than the 1% SkinCeutical brand. I noticed another person left a similar feedback so it is not just me. I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch, they lied about the percent of retinol or if there is another chemical in the mixture that is canceling the retinol out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product at all. I will continue to search for a higher retinol and hopefully find one that works.</li>
            <li> It has no odor. It does cause you to peel if you are not used to using a retinol, but after a week or two the flaking stops. It has lots of moisturizing ingredients also so it doesn&#x27;t dry your face out after the initial flaking/peeling. I use it even on my eyelids and it is not irritating at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I&#x27;ve been only using it for two weeks and I see results already.  they don&#x27;t call me sir anymore. even my family notice who sees me every day</li>
            <li> My hands have very thin skin and I wanted something to plump up the skin so they would look better. My hands are looking much better.  I also used this on my face and it has lightened a brown spot.  I will buy more of this.</li>
            <li> Did not see any change at all. Very disappointed after 3 weeks of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Just a high price moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my skin is much smoother and has a glow about it, however I have only been using it for 2 weeks so I am currently unsure if there is anything medically proven about the formula or just some pretty perks just like any pharmacy commercial drug.</li>
            <li> I am a 35 year old woman of color and my skin just started showing signs of aging. It felt like it happened suddenly but I guess being in the sun this past summer really had a negative effect on my skin. I had some bumps under the skin around my eyes under the skin and after buying a product before for around the same price  without results I took a chance on this. In less than two days the bumps started to fade. Its now a week and they are gone. I hope this product stays around forever because I will continue to buy it</li>
            <li> Ordering my second bottle. I saw a huge difference in my skin after about 2 months with my first bottle. My skin tech noticed my skin had a new sheen to it and asked what I was using. When I told her, she asked that I send her a text with the name of the product. I use several different products from different companies but this is my absolute favorite. Having 2.0 percent retinol is enough but I have recently started using Boots No. 7 along with the NCN retinol at night and this combination is awesome. My skin is not sensitive to most products so this combination is great for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 8 months ago and used it until it ran out.  My skin never peeled nor did I see any improvement.  I recently researched retinol and now know that it is sensitive to light and air and that it should be kept in an aluminum tube.  this product is not sold in an aluminum tube, which would then render it useless, which is not surprising to me given the fact that this had no effect on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought another retinol product from amazon (skinceuticals 1% retinol)  that is kept in an aluminum tube.  it has 1/2 the strength that this product is alleged to have.  w/the skinceuticals my skin had all of the effects that its supposed to have when you use retinol.  it peeled!  it got red!  I had to start using the skinceuticals product every third night, and then eventually every other night, but it did its job very well.  pores got smaller.  btw, I also started to use &#x27;bell essence intensive anti aging treatment&#x27; at the suggestion of one of the reviewers and it has helped to keep the redness and peeling to a minimum and my skin is softer and plumper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if the ncn had done its job at the alleged 2% strength, the skinceuticals 1% would not have had any effect.  so, the ncn I think is a scam.  either the company knows that they are selling a useless product, or they don&#x27;t know enough about retinol to know its useless.  either way, its not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just read that a dermatologist said that you need to do three things to change your skin.  a retinol product, exfoliation, and to use a product to nourish the new skin (i.e. bell essence).  that makes sense to me.  I use a cheaper version of clarisonic to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> An excellent retinol product that does not bother your skin.  No burning, flaking, scaling, drying out....and can be used daily.  Definitely softens lines.</li>
            <li> Saw a difference in my skin after about three weeks. Pores are smaller. Clearing up some oil deposits. I have purchased again. But you should go to the NCN Skincare website for proper instructions on use. Like a retinol products, you should wait 30 minutes to apply. Also, it&#x27;s less expense if purchased directly as you can use a coupon on the site.</li>
            <li> Happy with the product.  Not sure what I expected.  My buddy has been slathering retin-a on his face and looked raw and chapped after about a week of use.  Been using this product for three weeks and finally look like I can afford the prescription products.</li>
            <li> As a 60 year old female who grew up in the Florida sun, the resulting damage to my skin was depressing. I have wasted so much money each year on every new product that arrived in the drug store to eliminate my wrinkles, only to be let down. When I was searching for an over the counter Retinol product, I discovered All-Trans Retinol 2%. I have been using it for about five weeks and I am thrilled. Sunspots have started to disappear and my deep wrinkles appear to be plumping out, for lack of a better term. I am receiving compliments on how healthy and fresh I look.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin even around the eyes.  Would buy again.  Product goes a long way and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest I bought it directly through NCN Skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive, rosacea-prone, maturing skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried MANY other retinol products but they irritated my skin so much that I could never get much benefit from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this one is not irritating, it is very soothing, Sometimes I fall asleep without putting anything over it and my skin is not dry or irritated at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow her directions and with some additional products or strategies you will not peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the first few weeks of a retinol product you can expect to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they have 1% and the recommend you start with THAT one and not the 2%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NCN Skincare is terrific. I use a lot of her products and LOVE them all.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and breakout with any stress, exercise, sweating, etc. I put this on before I go to bed and when I wake up the next morning I immediately see a difference. It&#x27;s like magic!</li>
            <li> Works!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now and I feel a difference. Skin is sensitive and I can&#x27;t go in the sun, but I&#x27;m waiting to see my sun damage lighten. Overall my skin feels like a babies bottom.</li>
            <li> Better than the usual over the counter brands.  Still, I&#x27;ve decided to ask my dermatologist for prescription strength.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week but I&#x27;m starting to see results already!&lt;br /&gt;I use vit C serum and then the retinol</li>
            <li> It works slowly, the pure retinol by skinscuetical with only 1.0 works faster and smoother texture on my face and overnight results.</li>
            <li> A non irritating but, effective retinol.  It leaves a film on your face but it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li> after only one day of using this (washed face, then put a generous layer of this on, went to sleep), my face looks better. smaller pores, fewer pimples, and i&#x27;m glowing :) i have sensitive skin so i could feel it working, and it&#x27;s strong but not irritating (though i wouldn&#x27;t advise using a scrub before it!). i&#x27;ve used other retinols before, but since i&#x27;m sensitive to things like fragrance and alcohols, they made my skin hurt. i can&#x27;t wait to see what my face looks like in a week!</li>
            <li> It is the only cosmetic that I have tried that actually does work on fine lines and wrinkles !</li>
            <li> The generic for retinol that I had used for years has just gotten too expensive. The product I purchased from you seems to do fine.s</li>
            <li> I am 43 years old and this is the single best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin.  I have fair skin, dry skin &amp; blackheads.  I noticed after two days of use that my blackheads were reduced by atleast 75%. I typically use it at night for two consecutive days, then go off for a day or two.  Another user who reveiwed this product was not convinced that it&#x27;s 2% retinol.  I absolutely believe that it is.  This product delivers!  It also works better than the retinol cream I bought from a prestige brand for $220.00.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 months now &amp; I will buy it again and again and again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months and its definitely a gentle Retin A.&lt;br /&gt;Try it with a Glycolic Peel if you really want to see the anti-aging, acne-clearing benefits.&lt;br /&gt;I use 40% Glycolic Acid but try 20% if you&#x27;ve never used a peel before.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic. I put is in all my face moistureizers and add it to me serums. Wish I could get something strong, having breast cancer crying really damages the eyes, but I&#x27;m thankful for this.</li>
            <li> One pump and that&#x27;s all you need.  You&#x27;ll see results in under a month.  Doesn&#x27;t overly dry skin, but I also use a moisterizer over it.  I use it at night and it&#x27;s really great.  Best OTC retinol I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I purchased this back in January, it&#x27;s now October. As I suspected this is not Retinol!!! It is just lotion in a bottle with a Retinol label, fraud at it&#x27;s best. Don&#x27;t be fooled by fake purchased reviews, I just purchased real retinol at .05% for half the price</li>
            <li> REALLY BAD FOR ACNE, MAYBE FOR WRINKLES BUT MY SKIN HAD BAD BREAKOUTS AFTER I USED THIS. DO NOT RECOMEND TO TREAT ACNE!!</li>
            <li> Do love the product will buy again, and would recommend to anyone who asks</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff...when i start getting low i will be definately be ordering more...please dont stop making this!</li>
            <li> It appears the founder of NCN*, Nanci Nivolo, is very attentive to customer reviews.  When I had a slight issue with a product that had been damaged by the shipper, Nanci contacted me directly to find out how to remedy it.  In this day and age of dismissive and often rude customer service, I was immensely impressed.  I can&#x27;t vouch for all of their skincare products, but I can certainly say the owner stands by them and wants to make customers happy.  For this reason alone, I will try other NCN products.  *I have no affiliation with NCN other than being a customer.</li>
            <li> Ordered a second time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months and can see no improvement at all. I am a long time user of SkinCeutical retinol products and had been using their 1% retinol prior to trying the NCN product. I love the SkinCeutical product and only tried the NCN product because of the claim that it is the strongest OTC product available. I emailed NCN to see if perhaps I was using the product incorrectly but have had no response from them. I would very much like to get my money back and go back to the SkinCeutical product that I know works. After posting this review two weeks ago, I once again emailed NCN and still have not heard one word back from them. I will try to reach them by phone next.</li>
            <li> This works ! It has made a difference in one month in the depth and appearance of wrinkles. I use it after Murad Serum - another product that simply does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> This is the best retinol product out there ! With 2% retinol, it really delivers, but it&#x27;s a completely non-irritating formula. I tend to break out after using almost anything on my skin, but I have never broken out using this product. I research everything before I buy it, and NCN products are all top-notch. I now buy LOTS of their products (the acne product line can&#x27;t be beat). This retinol is worth every penny !</li>
            <li> It may be a bit slower then the skinsceuticles but I have been using it every night and it keeps my skin smooth, and once every couple weeks my skin will shed. The plus with this is there isn&#x27;t parabens and that horrible glycol propylene which is used in anti freeze.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is better for your health.</li>
            <li> I added this to my nightly anti-aging ritual.  I can see a tremendous improvement in the overall appearance and condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> Tried this on my face and neck but have not noticed any improvement in my skin; maybe my expectations were too high.</li>
            <li> Love this product - I use it almost every night (only because I&#x27;m sometimes lazy) and it has really helped tighten my pores and clear up my skin.  Each morning there is a little flake of skin here or there on my previous acne scars.  As time goes on, those scars are getting less and less deep.  It lightens them and definitely makes them less notable.&lt;br /&gt;I had been using .3% retinol from another company for a year or so as that was the highest % I could find.  This has been WAY more effective.  (the .3% was okay until I tried this - now I&#x27;m seeing real progress.)&lt;br /&gt;The price is right to try it - you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised like I was!</li>
            <li> i love this and skincare is very important to me. i added this to my routine! A lot of retinol for the money.</li>
            <li> I never threw away an expensive product like I did to this one.&lt;br /&gt;Bad quality and made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> I have not had the slightest bit of irritation from this product, even on my neck, which is very sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, it is impossible for me to believe this is 2.0 percent, after experience with other products.&lt;br /&gt;I have to wonder why there is no other product that claims to be over 1.0 percent.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me - not sure product is authentic</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month and notice that my skin is much hydrated the next morning.  Like its effects so far.  Will recommend it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product, which I&#x27;ve used in conjunction with NCN Copper Peptide Serum for my adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 31, I was looking for something that would battle both my adult acne and the beginning signs of aging. This has really done both for me. I use it consistently each evening, and although my skin turns slightly red after application, this is gone by the time I wake up. It will most likely immediately begin to dry up your acne and even break up some of your scarring. What i am most impressed with is the fact that for me, I had zits re-occuring in the same area over and over. As soon as I&#x27;d get them to heal up, a new one would form. This product, in conjunction with the copper peptide, has stopped the pimple cycle. I no longer get pimples in the same \\&quot;usual suspect\\&quot; areas. Instead, those areas are flat, and although they are red from years of repeated pimples, they are beginning to fade with time. The bottle will last you a LONG time. I am only a little more than half way through after three months of use!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could have found these products earlier to prevent some of the scarring that has taken place in my cheeks. I can only hope that with time, I will see the scarring begin to fade as well. If you have had it with adult acne, please consider this product IF you are willing to be patient. It will work overnight, but it won&#x27;t make your face look like a supermodel&#x27;s over night - you do have to be patient and reasonable. But it can and should stop your cyclical acne, and help to begin the healing process. I will post in another three months (meaning after a full six months of use) to report on any further results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Word of Caution: Be careful with this product around your eyes. For me, it tightened my skin so I look far more \\&quot;wrinkly\\&quot;. NCN does warn that this can happen though. So I avoid my eye area. Also, get a GOOD moisturizer. I have oily skin and even I use a few hyaluronic acid drops with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is a good product. I put it on my face, and it stings.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing...... I don&#x27;t like that in a plastic buttle.</li>
            <li> It does not work at all. The consistency is like water and it seperates. I would not buy it again. I just threw it away.</li>
            <li> I use it just as a lotion especially at night! It goes a long way! It&#x27;s a little pricey :(</li>
            <li> I have worked for a plastic surgeon for years in the past. This is very strong! It works great, This bottle should last you a year or more. I takes a tiny bit. I just put a drop on my finger and dab little dots of it around. my eye&#x27;s and cheeks, jaw line between eyebrows,&lt;br /&gt;I take my time and smooth it all over my face and do not put on eyelid and work my way down my face and end rubbing on down my neck.&lt;br /&gt;If your face turns red, starts to peel allot then you used too much. Follow their guidelines more than mine but I have used Retinol for over 10 years and will always use it. I have no wrinkles on my fore head or between my eye brow&#x27;s. I have resting wrinkles in some areas of my face but no one notices them until I smile. I think they will agree to only use it at night and wear sunscreen every day!</li>
            <li> I would prefer it this was more of a clear serum like Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s line.  It&#x27;s more of a cream type.  Other then that I do like it.</li>
            <li> Now don&#x27;t freak out.. some of you will see breakouts the first week of use, but this stuff works! I noticed it working right away, not miraculous results like some bad midnight infomercial, small results. my skin is so silky soft after use and my pores have minimized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have now used this stuff for a year now, it has become my must have product, I&#x27;ve noticed my lines have diminished greatly my skin clarity has greatly improved. I love a product that delivers so now I have my eye on this company and have picked up a few other items they sell. hoping they stand up to the test like this little baby has!</li>
            <li> No peeling or funny reaction from this.  Not much of a moisturizer. Only used it for a week, without much of improvement so far.&lt;br /&gt;Will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since November and it really reduces wrinkles and deep lines. I jog and am in the sun daily at work and have a lot of wrinkles. I only use an SPF 15 moisturizer on my face and it did show! My wrinkles are much less noticeable and the deep ones have seemed to fill in. I had wrinkles on my nose that are barely noticeable now. It is really incredible how much better my skin looks and feels. People always think I am around 30 but I will be 43 in a few months. I use the cream every night on my face, neck, chest and arms. I love it and will continue to use it daily!</li>
            <li> Wish this stuff wasn&#x27;t so expensive otherwise I would be buying it all the time because it really does work!</li>
            <li> This is only the second brand of retinol that I&#x27;ve purchased, being new to using retinol.  The first brand I bought ( from Neutrogena Dermatologics) may have been okay but I couldn&#x27;t tell by the way it felt like I can with this 2% retinol lotion--it burns, in a good way that tells me it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I have use this for a couple of years now. I love it !  I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive . They have changed the bottle . I liked the bottle before you could see in it so you know how much you have left. You can&#x27;t do that with the new bottle. I tried other stuff, I I have sensitive skin .  I  have broke out with rash or hives except for this one.</li>
            <li> I am much like others in that I am always skeptical about products like this. I have been using it for only 3 days and I can already notice a difference. My face feels like silk and the overall skin tone has improved. I am 48 and have worked in the sun for many years causing great damage to my skin. I will continue to update this review, for better or for worse. I have not experienced any type of breakout so far. I was really nervous about that because I usually do break out when trying a new product. Really liking it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to add that Nanci really does care about her customers. Somehow Amazon managed to order and charge me twice for this product. I contacted her and she responded immediately. Even though there was nothing she could do, it was all Amazon, she contacted me immediately and was very nice. Amazon took care of the issue and the money has been put back on my account.</li>
            <li> When I turned 30, I decided to amp up my skin care regiment to combat the beginning signs of aging. I started to notice an increased number of sun spots on my face along with some fine lines in my forehead and in-between my eye brows. After a ton of research, I chose to try this product. It took about 2 months for my skin to adjust to it and I got the \\&quot;Retinol Uglies\\&quot; (aka: Worse before better effect) which is fairly common. The retinol increases the cellular turn over of the skin, which caused mine to purge, so I got more breakouts that usual and my skin texture was a bit blotchy and rough-looking in a few places. It didn&#x27;t bother me though, because it was a sign that it was working! I&#x27;m in my 3rd month of use and my skin looks amazing! It&#x27;s so soft and bright. The fine lines and sun spots have greatly improved. Nancy (the owner of the company) was very helpful and attentive when I contacted her with questions. I would recommend her company and her products to anyone out there looking to improve their skin! If you have a similar reaction to it that I did, HANG IN THERE! It&#x27;ll get better and it&#x27;ll be worth it :)</li>
            <li> Have noticed a difference in softness and clarity.  No odor, no excessive dryness.  Will buy this again.  Best over the counter</li>
            <li> This serum is pretty good, but after using it for a couple of weeks, I haven&#x27;t noticed too much difference in wrinkles.  Sometimes I think it may be improving, then other times I&#x27;m not sure.  One thing though, it certainly doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin - leaves it pretty soft and supple.  I will continue to use it but am not overly impressed.  Maybe wrinkles will improve with continued use.</li>
    </ol>
