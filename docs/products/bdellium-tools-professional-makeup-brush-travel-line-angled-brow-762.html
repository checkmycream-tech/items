            <li>This is a nice brush</li>
            <li>Um ... I LOVE THIS BRUSH.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold a great amount of product but that really doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>Feels more like a liner brush.</li>
            <li>more now.</li>
            <li>love my Bdellium brushes...so sturdy.</li>
            <li>If you want a brush to give you some definition and precision, this brush should be your go-to. :)</li>
            <li>its ok</li>
            <li>I am quite pleased and wish I had ordered two at once, one for the home kit and one for travel.</li>
            <li>easy brush to work with and very precise</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Also it is really fine.</li>
            <li>(I go a little lighter some days than others and am experimenting with the sorts of products I like best).</li>
            <li>This little brush is just perfect for the dust-on type of eyebrow color.  </li>
            <li>They are soft and strong, and the makeup application is nice.  </li>
            <li>Great little brush.</li>
            <li>I also like quality products and this Bdellium Tools Professional Antibacterial Brush filled my order to a T, both literally and figuratively!</li>
            <li>my brows couldn&#x27;t look more natural.</li>
            <li>Its size is perfect for brows without going outside and looking too huge or being ridiculously small, requiring you to go over your brows again and again either.</li>
            <li>It can hold a fair amount of product and this brush is fine if one day I want to use a powder and then switch to a different color compact the next day</li>
            <li>The price is very affordable.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller than I originally thought (can&#x27;t be more than 6 inches long with small bristles), but I actually like this style better because you can get a greater level of precision.  </li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers, I use this for my brows.</li>
            <li>In need of a new eyebrow brush I knew I&#x27;d find what I needed here - on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li>This brush is like any other eyebrow brush nothing special about it.</li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup artist and I received a set of bdellium brushes as a gift.  </li>
            <li>Brush is too soft for doing your eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Washing some brushes changed their quality for the worse and while this one never necessarily NEEDED a washing, I think it&#x27;s a good, hygienic thing to do</li>
            <li>Small size makes it easy to pack in a make-up bag for travel.</li>

            <li> Small size makes it easy to pack in a make-up bag for travel.</li>
            <li> I already have used this a few months and it&#x27;s still like brand new with daily use.</li>
            <li> This was smaller than i expected it to be</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> It was less than 1/4\\&quot; wide</li>
            <li> and I think I need a slightly wider brush to work well on my brows.</li>
            <li> but I wish the brush would have been a little firmer.</li>
            <li> Maybe a little longer then like a gulf pencil.</li>
            <li> so have washed it a few times.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> Its quite hard and stiff.....</li>
            <li> the head of the brush is too thin and small.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a brush that makes really thin defined lines</li>
            <li> I also like the size without the unnecessary length.</li>

            <li> Um ... I LOVE THIS BRUSH. I use it every day for my eyebrows and it gives me the precision I need. Fits perfectly in my brush roll.</li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist and I received a set of bdellium brushes as a gift.  These brushes are really nice.  They are soft and strong, and the makeup application is nice.  The price is very affordable.  I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> This was smaller than i expected it to be but i am also not the best at buying this kind of stuff but all in all it did the job and i liked it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do my brows without it!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect for on the go and creating a perfectly fine line. It doesn&#x27;t hold a great amount of product but that really doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I will happily buy more brushes from them</li>
            <li> Works well for control of application.  Small size makes it easy to pack in a make-up bag for travel.</li>
            <li> Great little brush. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I use this for my brows. I know others use it for eyeliner, but I can&#x27;t comment on that. This brush holds up well and maintains its shape and precision. Its size is perfect for brows without going outside and looking too huge or being ridiculously small, requiring you to go over your brows again and again either. It can hold a fair amount of product and this brush is fine if one day I want to use a powder and then switch to a different color compact the next day (I go a little lighter some days than others and am experimenting with the sorts of products I like best). Washing some brushes changed their quality for the worse and while this one never necessarily NEEDED a washing, I think it&#x27;s a good, hygienic thing to do so have washed it a few times. Thankfully it doesn&#x27;t lose its quality after washes. I already have used this a few months and it&#x27;s still like brand new with daily use.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  Brush is too soft for doing your eyebrows.  I like the size but I wish the brush would have been a little firmer.</li>
            <li> This brush is like any other eyebrow brush nothing special about it. It is also pretty small. Maybe a little longer then like a gulf pencil. Also it is really fine. Feels more like a liner brush.</li>
            <li> easy brush to work with and very precise</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush but I prefer the one I bought ( and lost ) AT Max in Nordstroms.  It was $14.00 several years ago.  more now.</li>
            <li> love the bdellium this is great for applying shadow or gel liner, I love the size which allows a perfect application and perfect detailing, solo recommend this!</li>
            <li> love my Bdellium brushes...so sturdy.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for applying my gel eyeliner. I&#x27;ve been looking for a brush that makes really thin defined lines so I can thickening the liner to my liking. I also like the size without the unnecessary length. If you want a brush to give you some definition and precision, this brush should be your go-to. :)</li>
            <li> The bristles on this are finer than I like and overall the head of the brush is too thin and small.  I don&#x27;t care for this brush at all.</li>
            <li> Its quite hard and stiff.....i had to bend the hairs some to wake it up a bit.......its ok...wouldn&#x27;t recommend though.</li>
            <li> This little brush is just perfect for the dust-on type of eyebrow color.  I am quite pleased and wish I had ordered two at once, one for the home kit and one for travel.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use with my liquid eyebrow color applicator.  Very nice quality for the price and does a nice job.</li>
            <li> Great for grave it&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> This brush is well made, however I was expecting a slightly larger brush. It was less than 1/4\\&quot; wide and I think I need a slightly wider brush to work well on my brows.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom, she says she loves it to apply her brow powder, loves the angled edge for control. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow brush! It&#x27;s smaller than I originally thought (can&#x27;t be more than 6 inches long with small bristles), but I actually like this style better because you can get a greater level of precision.  This brush works especially well with eyebrow stencils.</li>
            <li> In need of a new eyebrow brush I knew I&#x27;d find what I needed here - on Amazon! I also like quality products and this Bdellium Tools Professional Antibacterial Brush filled my order to a T, both literally and figuratively! With a stroke here, and a stroke there...my brows couldn&#x27;t look more natural.</li>
