            <li>Great very black coverage that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many other types/brands of waterproof mascara.</li>

            <li>One coat and BOOM, thick, full and luscious lashes all day and all night.  </li>

            <li> And the person who said that it doesn&#x27;t work clearly doesn&#x27;t know how to use mascara.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes &amp; wear contacts.</li>
            <li> This mascara starts out great, but by the middle of the day it starts to smudge like crazy and irritates my eyes.  </li>

            <li> One coat and BOOM, thick, full and luscious lashes all day and all night.  </li>
            <li> Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Alltho the box came in a little broken</li>
            <li> The waterproof can add some extra clumping, but it never flakes or runs, and holds all day long!</li>
            <li> Although I have tried other mascaras that do a better job (But they are so expensive)</li>
            <li> has a curved brush and waterproof for people like me with stick straight eyelashes that are hard to curl and stay curled...</li>
            <li> I use this mascara for already a long time, and that is taking into consideration</li>
            <li> It stay in my lashes for a long time.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Perfect long lashes...</li>
            <li> I FOUND IT TO DRY</li>
            <li> I always use to wear the black Lash stiletto till I decided to try this one &amp; it gave my lashes that extra push that it needed .</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY DRY EYES, SO I MUST BE CAREFUL.  </li>
            <li> other brands of mascara while being waterproof, leave me limp lashes instead of lifting them and this is the only one that leaves me curled!</li>
            <li> Unlike the other maybelline waterproof mascara i had when it gets wet</li>
            <li> The other reviewer said it still smudged, but mine NEVER EVER smudge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and have tried all kinds of other products in the interim, from Benefit, to Shiseido, to Origins...</li>
            <li> I may try adding a couple of drops of baby oil to see if it helps prevent this, but so far it&#x27;s a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> However they were either not exactly waterproof or they just made my lashes feel so stiff and brittle.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that it is no longer available.</li>
            <li> for when I buy the new stiletto from the store ill throw that bush away and use the curved one.</li>
            <li> It does add a tremendous amount of volume but it leaves me with like five eyelashes because they all stick together so badly.</li>
            <li> but I find one or two little fibers on my face at the end of the day...</li>
            <li> A LITTLE ON MY EYELASHES.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are very short &amp; thin.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this mascara is that it smells a little weird, but its not a strong scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it didn&#x27;t work for me now</li>
            <li> I usually stick to rubber brushes for this reason, but I figured I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li> I tried a number of waterproof mascaras after disappointments with mascaras from my usual dept. store counters.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t keep it any longer than a usual mascara&#x27;s expiration date if you have contacts because it starts to irritate.  </li>
            <li> why is it so hard to find Maybelline?  </li>
            <li> Dried out old crap mascara.</li>
            <li> It only gets annoying at night because its hard to get off.</li>
            <li> I am very pretentious towards mascaras.</li>
            <li> SOMETIMES IRRITATING MY EYES.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve stopped wearing false lashes ever since I got this mascara.</li>
            <li> I was so sad when Maybelline discontinued it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry Maybelline discontinued it.</li>
            <li> and until then I would wear this mascara every day despite the fact that I hate waterproof mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> but it does clump and flake as your day goes on.</li>
            <li> This mascara was okay. I used to wear it when it was still sold in stores and loved it. I&#x27;m not sure why it didn&#x27;t work for me now</li>
            <li> This is one of THE BEST mascaras I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve tried PLENTY.  Real quick and easy application.  One coat and BOOM, thick, full and luscious lashes all day and all night.  I was so sad when Maybelline discontinued it but I knew I could count on Amazon to have some in stock!</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly, very well packaged, and exactly as described. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great very black coverage that lasts all day. You will need make-up remover to get it off at night. Subscribe and save is a good value.</li>
            <li> It does not thicken lashes as well as advertised; I had to apply several coats.</li>
            <li> I usually stick to rubber brushes for this reason, but I figured I&#x27;d give this a try. It does add a tremendous amount of volume but it leaves me with like five eyelashes because they all stick together so badly. Seems overall like it&#x27;d be a good product for people who this isn&#x27;t a recurring problem for but it&#x27;s not the best for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months and i love it! The other reviewer said it still smudged, but mine NEVER EVER smudge. No matter how wet my face get, it looks and stays beautiful all day! It reminds me of my &#x27;former&#x27; mascara, Nyx Doll Eyes Mascara, but somehow better &#x3D;]. I&#x27;m 17 btw. And in my opinion, it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the ultimate length I don&#x27;t care for this one</li>
            <li> Honestly nothing special.  Just any other cheap mascara. I did not like the brush at all. Did not lengthen my lashes at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and have tried all kinds of other products in the interim, from Benefit, to Shiseido, to Origins...but I still like to have this on hand in case the others drop the ball. The waterproof can add some extra clumping, but it never flakes or runs, and holds all day long! Tried and true.</li>
            <li> I really love this mascara. I got it a few days and its just so cute so I was happy to try it out. I&#x27;m a 17 year old girl, senior, in high school and I have to say this is by far, one of the best mascaras I have ever tried. It is indeed waterproof and it doesn&#x27;t smudge at all. It only gets annoying at night because its hard to get off. But I like it a lot, I&#x27;ve stopped wearing false lashes ever since I got this mascara. Buy it without doubt. And the person who said that it doesn&#x27;t work clearly doesn&#x27;t know how to use mascara.</li>
            <li> I tried a number of waterproof mascaras after disappointments with mascaras from my usual dept. store counters. This one went on very thick, and lasted a long time, which was great, but it was also very clumpy. I may try adding a couple of drops of baby oil to see if it helps prevent this, but so far it&#x27;s a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I really liked this mascara. I have very tiny lashes and when I was done applying it, they looked thicker and longer. Although I have tried other mascaras that do a better job (But they are so expensive) this one does a similar job. Your lashes don&#x27;t clump, the mascara lasts all day, and it doesn&#x27;t smear. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this mascara is that it smells a little weird, but its not a strong scent. I would highly recommend this mascara!</li>
            <li> Loveeeeeee this! Except that it&#x27;s a b&amp;!ch to take off if you put more than 2 layers on which I do! Other than that I am on love with it.</li>
            <li> other brands of mascara while being waterproof, leave me limp lashes instead of lifting them and this is the only one that leaves me curled!</li>
            <li> I use this mascara for already a long time, and that is taking into consideration I am very pretentious towards mascaras. I have short lashes, but this mascara is a miracle! I use it in two layers for the best look.&lt;br /&gt;Very very good one!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara. I have it automatically shipped to me every couple of months. It&#x27;s the best. I&#x27;ve tried others but always come back to this one. Goes on beautifully, doesn&#x27;t clump - it really lengthens. I get the waterproof and it comes off easily with face wash. You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Dried out old crap mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I wish you would  of had more.....because I would of purchased all off them.  I am a Jazzercise Instructor and of course I would never want my mascara to run!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> this is my all time favorite waterproof mascara...why is it so hard to find Maybelline?  has a curved brush and waterproof for people like me with stick straight eyelashes that are hard to curl and stay curled...please bring this product back!</li>
            <li> Awesome best price too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many other types/brands of waterproof mascara. However they were either not exactly waterproof or they just made my lashes feel so stiff and brittle. In my opinion Stiletto is probably the best especially for the price</li>
            <li> I love that this mascara was waterproof and does not smear. It really elongates the eyelashes and stays on without clumping.</li>
            <li> I have never actually written a review about a product before, but I am so in love with this mascara! I have been searching all my life for a mascara like this stuff. When I use it with my eyelash curler, you&#x27;d think I have falsies on. I love it so much, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever need another brand. And no, this didn&#x27;t smudge on me all day, and I have make up on from 8am to 9pm.</li>
            <li> This mascara starts out great, but by the middle of the day it starts to smudge like crazy and irritates my eyes.  The other waterproof Maybelline Stiletto mascara is better.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this mascara over a year ago just because of the brush style. My lashes are very short &amp; thin. When I tried it I LOVED it. Not just for the brush either. I have sensitive eyes &amp; wear contacts. I can wear this w/o it clumping, flaking, or looking like a raccoon. The stores quit selling this mascara with this type of brush. I have kept buying the other with the straight brush, but now I will purchase this one, use it, &amp; keep the brush. for when I buy the new stiletto from the store ill throw that bush away and use the curved one. I can find this mascara at every store but they do not sell it with the curved brush!</li>
            <li> Great mascara. This has lasted for months without clumping and drying out. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This mascara is life !!!!!! I always use to wear the black Lash stiletto till I decided to try this one &amp; it gave my lashes that extra push that it needed . It lives by it&#x27;s name voluptuous</li>
            <li> i like this product because it&#x27;s so waterproof. So far this is the best mascara i had. Unlike the other maybelline waterproof mascara i had when it gets wet it smudges. It stay in my lashes for a long time.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it actually provides volume and extends your nAtural lashes. I don&#x27;t even need to use an eye lash curler with this product. I does not clump and looks great! Definitely a must for a great night out. The more applications you do the thicker and fuller they become. Just ensure to use a eyelash comb if you apply more than two coats. Many mascara a burn my eyes but this is gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite mascara.  I&#x27;m sorry Maybelline discontinued it.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!  I have very fine and short eyelashes, and it does lengthen them.  It doesn&#x27;t add very much volume though, so I&#x27;ll stick to my CoverGirl \\&quot;Falsies\\&quot; mascara for that.  But for the price you can&#x27;t beat this, it is much better than my overpriced $25 Too Faced mascara!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are very picky and they stay up with this mascara.  I apply it twice a day only if I&#x27;m doing something after work.</li>
            <li> Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Alltho the box came in a little broken</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara, it makes short blonde lashes long and it doesn&#x27;t clump of budge. It&#x27;s no longer sold in stores, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good but I find one or two little fibers on my face at the end of the day... No big deal to me though.</li>
            <li> I guess there is not a product out there that doesn&#x27;t smudge if you have sex with it on.  I&#x27;m still looking to stay beautiful without the racoon eyes while I&#x27;m getting busy!</li>
            <li> One of the best waterproof  mascara I have found through out my years. It keeps the lashes up.I was allergic to another popular brand I tried. I have always gone back to Maybelline</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to be able to get this mascara.  I can no longer find it in stores located in my neighborhood.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> The best mascara out there! Really makes your lashes look longer. Definitely my favorite, the only mascara I buy more than 3 times.</li>
            <li> This is by far my new favorite mascara!!! It does everything it says.&lt;br /&gt;My lashes look long and full, and it doesnt cake on like some mascaras do.&lt;br /&gt;I love it so much i have my daughter wearing it as well!!!</li>
            <li> I ORIGINALLY PUT 5 STARS,,BUT AFTER USING IT FOR AWHILE I FOUND IT TO DRY A LITTLE ON MY EYELASHES.  SOMETIMES IRRITATING MY EYES.  I HAVE VERY DRY EYES, SO I MUST BE CAREFUL.  I STILL LOVE TO USE THIS PRODUCT, BECAUSE IT IS EASY TO APPLY &amp; IT IS EASY TO APPLY.  SO THE DRYNESS ONCE IN A BLUE MOON IS NO BIG DEAL TO ME.  I THINK IT IS UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL TO TRY &amp; FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF FOR THE 1ST TIME.  HECK, THE PRICE IS RIGHT.  WHAT IS THERE TO LOSE?</li>
            <li> I like this mascara because it thickens my lashes.  I have continued to use it because it does not flakee or come off all day.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara make my lashes so long and last all day</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara and sadly it cannot be found in stores anymore.  I have short lashes and it is the only mascara that does wonders on my lashes .  I am so disappointed that it is no longer available.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Perfect long lashes...Nice</li>
            <li> Very good, doesn&#x27;t smudge, doesn&#x27;t flake, is about the right color.  But don&#x27;t keep it any longer than a usual mascara&#x27;s expiration date if you have contacts because it starts to irritate.  That is of course, not the fault of the mascara and until then I would wear this mascara every day despite the fact that I hate waterproof mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that swim season has started, it&#x27;s absolutely essential.  It lasts all day in the pool without any sort of smudging and still looks good when I get out of the pool.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite mascaras. I will continuously try out different mascaras, but always end up coming back to this one. I will sometimes layer this with the L&#x27;Oreal False Lashes in the gold bottle (I can&#x27;t remember the name of the mascara) and the two work wonderfully together. I like this better over the Dior mascaras and Benefit, too.</li>
            <li> its really good my eyelashes look so long and pretty, and i dont need to use other mascaras just this one</li>
            <li> Holds my lashes curled all throughout the day. Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever bought. Definitly buying again</li>
