            <li>but I believe it&#x27;s safe to say that this is absolutly one of the best if not THE best hairdryer out there.</li>
            <li>At the price I got it for on Amazon website I am very pleased!</li>
            <li>and I got it for around $65...very happy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know anything about blow-drying hair, but the lady who I got this for says this is great, that it doesn&#x27;t damage the hair while blow-drying it.</li>
            <li>While this hairdryer worked, it was great.</li>
            <li>This one shortens the time, smooths the hair shaft, and straightens great.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the LIE of telling people waht a great piece of workmanship?  </li>
            <li>What is so great?  </li>
            <li>This is a great dryer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just that great.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great deal.  </li>
            <li>This is a great hair dryer-</li>
            <li>It was a great price though</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I though it was a great price.</li>
            <li>I have been a proud owner for about two years, and purchased it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I was not too happy with this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>and they all agree it is great.  </li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>Very nice hair dryer.</li>
            <li>~:o)</li>
            <li>and I am still thrilled with its performance!</li>
            <li>Best of all, the diffuser works great significantly improves the look of my curls.      </li>
            <li>Got it about 15 months ago, and totally loved it.</li>
            <li>When the hairdryer did work, my wife loved it.  </li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me by a friend who always has good hair.</li>
            <li>You need to have a lot of time and patience - and for that you can probably get good hair with any priced dryer.</li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t imagine it is good for my hair).</li>
            <li>Good morning, I regret to inform you that this article was mistakenly delivered to another person and never received it.</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s a fairly good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>Product was packed in original box, in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>Amazon was great about the return, but if I had known for sure that a warrenty was not going to be included, I would never have ordered it from them.  </li>
            <li>It looks very healthy after blow drying without even any product.</li>
            <li>I was impressed the first time I used this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li>*still love my dryer though!</li>
            <li>Love this dryer!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>Love the hairdryer, it works amazing!  </li>
            <li>So I am completely satisfied!</li>
            <li>This dryer is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>I will explain why this hair dryer is amazing not the circumstances.</li>
            <li>And the benefits from not having to deal with all that wind are amazing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quieter, lighter and doesn&#x27;t require gymnastics to achieve amazing results.    </li>
            <li>So I really don&#x27;t know if it is the best dryer according to customer rating.  </li>
            <li>the kind that looks like I&#x27;ve been playing with electricity.  </li>
            <li>doesnt even get close to warm.  </li>
            <li>THINK before you write reviews and be honest.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for quality products at lower price and excellent delivery.  </li>
            <li>I thought this was a customer service kind of company ,</li>
            <li>I have a new baby, and would rather spend my time with her instead of drying my hair - so this seemed like the perfect product.    </li>
            <li>I have a very strong feeling</li>
            <li>over the years of working in salons, my own included, i have had many dryers.</li>
            <li>this product has been awesome so far.</li>
            <li>This professional dryer does the best job on my hair.</li>
            <li>I bring this with me to nice hotels because it&#x27;s always better than whatever they provide.</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference!    </li>
            <li>I purchased this hairdrier after reading the reviews from Consumer Reports - rated in the top 2.  </li>
            <li>I would have opted to pay more money.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>And plus, made such a great difference to my hair!</li>
            <li>If I get the same value out of this one I am a  happy camper!</li>
            <li>At best it is a refurb., definitely used.</li>
            <li>She suggested I check on Amazon for a better price.</li>
            <li>The best thing is that it&#x27;s quiet for a blow dryer ...</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Just make sure it&#x27;s through an authorized retailer</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a wonderful dryer and</li>
            <li>So, I love it, and I would buy another.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it one day, but feel it&#x27;s one of the best beauty investments I&#x27;ve ever made!!</li>
            <li>The amazon dryer also blew a lot more air than the one purchased from Sephora.  </li>
            <li>I love this dryer.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you do your research on this one before you decide where to purchase.</li>
            <li>This process used to take atleast 30 minutes or more.</li>
            <li>Ok Here goes.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer</li>
            <li>I love this hairdryer HOWEVER after owning it for 22 months (not quite 2 years)</li>
            <li>Although Amazon may not be an authorized retailer...please be sure to specify to T3 (if for some reason you have to return or register your product) that your dryer WAS purchased through Sephora/Amazon...in which case Sephora IS AN AUTHORIZED RESELLER of these dryers.  </li>
            <li>The dryer works ok - nothing</li>
            <li>I just wanted to be sure I was getting</li>
            <li>I would rather chance $100 without a warranty than pay $200 more for one.  </li>
            <li>The reason I say this hair dryer is just ok and gave it 3 stars is because I&#x27;ve had 2 of them.</li>
            <li>I do love how shiny the dryer makes my hair.</li>
            <li>With a vented roll brush, this leaves my hair looking sleek and healthy in record time.</li>
            <li>I had to spend more money to Order the Diffuser.  </li>
            <li>So I ended up spending more money and did not get the product I ordered through the Amazon site.</li>
            <li>If the product is not purchased from an authorized dealer, T3 Micro cannot and will not guarantee that the product is authentic or warrant the product against defects, inadequate build quality and/or improper performance.     </li>
            <li>T3 Micro may not be able to verify the authenticity of these products and cannot provide any warranty on the products sold by unauthorized dealers.    </li>
            <li>Make sure you heed the warning....</li>
            <li>Make sure it has the serial number on the box!I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>Now we have to spend more money on another blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Therefor this hairdryer was appealing to me.  </li>
            <li>I usually love Amazon and buy a lot of Cd&#x27;s, books, etc.</li>
            <li>I am sure glad I did.</li>
            <li>This ionic hair dryer does an outstanding job on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Seller was great and very prompt delivery.  </li>
            <li>But the T3 does it without blowing my hair everywhere, so you have much more control over styling.</li>
            <li>I love mine.</li>
            <li>So I guess it was OK to buy a corded gift after all.  </li>
            <li>I love this hairdryer-</li>
            <li>Hope to have many years with this one :)</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>But regardless of that, I think that anyone who wants silkier, smoother, straighter hair will be more than happy with their results with this dryer.  </li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I am giving 1 star as a judgment more about Bespoke Labs than the product I received.</li>
            <li>: make sure it&#x27;s the REAL DEAL (able to be warranteed) and make sure it&#x27;s on sale!!</li>
            <li>Instead I got the Special Edition with NO DIFFUSER for more money!  </li>
            <li>They really have to knock my socks off for me to take the time or energy to write a review, but this hair dryer does that and more!!</li>
            <li>A $300 hairdryer would have to come with it&#x27;s own stylist to be worth it!</li>
            <li>I can easily see how this can be a favorite of the worlds top stylists.</li>
            <li>Very light weight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;$135 is too much to pay for a hair dryer that lasts 6 months,... even if it was amazing when it worked!</li>
            <li>This dryer is so easy to use you will have more energy when you leave the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>This is fine for home use; in fact, it might be better not having and 8 ft cord.  </li>
            <li>Then I got a job with a 2-hour commute and my free time become a lot scarcer and more valuable and</li>
            <li>So far , its been great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this blow dryer for a month now, and so far I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>After seeing her burn thru cheap dryer after dryer, I decided to take the plunge and get her a top of the line product.</li>
            <li>but if you give it a chance you&#x27;ll see that it is light years better than anything else out there.    </li>
            <li>All I know is that my hair comes out silky, smooth, and since I&#x27;ve been using it, in MUCH better condition than before.  </li>
            <li>My hair is smooth, soft, shiny and best of all straight!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe I was able to get it for such a great price.  </li>
            <li>Ordered this hairdryer on Sunday and received it on Wednesday for very quick service.</li>
            <li>however it seems to get tangled easily.</li>
            <li>I cannot in good conscious keep a dryer that I paid almost 200 for where my vidal sassoon dryer gives off more air flow.  </li>
            <li>Has been using for over 2 years and still going strong.  </li>
            <li>I too liked this hair dryer very much.  </li>
            <li>Liked it very much.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>After giving this dryer a good week for a test drive, my hair only seemed flatter and had more static.  </li>
            <li>This blow dryer is the best I have ever used and the price is less that inferior dryers.</li>
            <li>I have a very old hair dryer now, a conair, that I love, and honestly, I would rather use the conair.    </li>
            <li>I would have the warranty available to me.</li>
            <li>I even wrap and secure the cord every time.</li>
            <li>I thought I was buying a great hair dryer that would last me for years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely light</li>
            <li>I know how to wait until the product become available at an authorized dealer.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t stress enough the difference a great blow dryer makes when doing one&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>It dries your hair faster as it claims and is light weight for holding.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>light air flow</li>
            <li>It is light, plastic, 1600 watt cheap deryer.  </li>
            <li>( I already own a real one), wanted to return it.</li>
            <li>The second one works great.</li>
            <li>All in all, one fantastic hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I had a cheap Revlon dryer that did the job</li>
            <li>My hair is always smooth after using.    </li>
            <li>Bottom line - feel free to try it out, but I&#x27;m spending my money elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>but so far so good...</li>
            <li>My wife says the hairdryer is very powerful and reduces the amount of drying time.</li>
            <li>Very powerful.  </li>
            <li>I love this T3 hair dryer - it is lightweight and dries your hair very fast.  </li>
            <li>The cool shot button is GREAT, it actually blows cool air.  </li>
            <li>i guess its worth it!?</li>
            <li>And so, I am concerned that my significant investment in this hair dryer is being compromised by using without the mesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, I bought this very same dryer from Amazon over a year ago, and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE It.</li>
            <li>I have the original dryer</li>
            <li>They are not difficult to push/ avoid pushing unless you have the most sausage of sausage fingers.  </li>
            <li>If you have that reaction I would suggest taking some lessons in blow drying techniques because I am pretty sure that will solve your problem.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and not extremely thick, and this dryer does a great job of giving me extra volume when I want a more glamourous look.  </li>
            <li>The Special Edition comes with a shorter cord.  </li>
            <li>special</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller, and because I was certain this was authentic, I threw the box away</li>
            <li>i like working with this as it is extremely light weight and dries the hair very fast and almost frizz free.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I expected and works very good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to have special ionic magical powers of some sort that help defrizz your hair, but I can&#x27;t really tell the difference.  </li>
            <li>Hair dryer was amazing until it started to struggle and make sounds after 2 months of use and completely stopped /</li>
            <li>if you love it and NEED the warranty.. return it and buy the real deal for 300 bucks at sephora.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know a good hairdryer could make such a difference.  </li>
            <li>It does make my hair nice and shiny and soft (but that also may be attributed to the Biosilk Cure product I&#x27;ve been using).  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a good hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>it better be the real thing.</li>
            <li>I elected to return for a full refund and went with a SuperSolano 3600.</li>
            <li>The dryer no longer heats up and the warranty was only good for a year.  </li>
            <li>Also, she always uses the diffuser and always does the curly look (probably on cool).     </li>
            <li>(To get this effect I always use the \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; after I get the look I want.</li>
            <li>I thought since I was paying so much it would be quicker &amp; better.</li>
            <li>I purchased this hairdryer after reading all the reviews that Amazon wasn&#x27;t an authorized retailer for the T3 hairdryer, but I wasn&#x27;t too concerned since it was such a good price.  </li>
            <li>The feather weight is an excellent hairdryer - my hair is extremely thick and curly.  </li>
            <li>It is light and powerful</li>
            <li>which is nice and not too loud either.</li>
            <li>But this is the real deal, authentic stickers and all.</li>
            <li>it works fast and my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I had my last one for 2 years which is the length of the warranty before it broke which for me is a good run.</li>
            <li>I had the blue Chi Ion before for 5 years that I loved dearly</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t pay full retail for it..</li>
            <li>Very nice product, but sometimes seems to actually get to hot.</li>
            <li>This one is light weight, ergonomically designed, delivers just the right amount of heat/\\&quot;blow\\&quot; for each setting.  </li>
            <li>The hair dryer came quickly with no issues.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quick and worked as stated.</li>
            <li>but when I spend more than a $100 on a product, I expect it to last more than 2 years.</li>
            <li>If you feel like you are doing something better for your hair because you spent this kind of money, then by all means, go for it.  </li>
            <li>it drys your hair so quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave the frizzy feeling that all drug store brand hair dryers leave.</li>
            <li>more of a hum than a high pitch whistle of some blow dryers.</li>
            <li>So light it didnt burn my skin on highest hot setting up agaqinst my arm.  </li>
            <li>The temperature is very very hot and hurts my scalp</li>
            <li>Very pretty with the jewel studded handle.</li>
            <li>I use the &#x27;cool shot&#x27; most of the time, and the button is easy to push and does not fatigue my hand the way lesser dryers have.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seriously my new favorite thing.</li>
            <li>The real deal is a fabulous dryer and I would suggest buying it for the full $300 and having a 4-year warranty on it.      </li>
            <li>it worth it to have beautiful hair year round, and its still cheaper than the beauty salon.</li>
            <li>Awesome product but did not give 5 stars because it didn&#x27;t last long before it started giving problems.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Featherweight first, took it back for the Evolution (thought maybe with more settings it would be ok).</li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time!</li>
            <li>If you want to invest in this hair dryer try to find it at a local beauty store (I found one with warranty and all for $170) and be sure to look for the silver serial number label!</li>
            <li>But my first one was $300!</li>
            <li>It has a 4 year warrenty and for a hair dryer at this price, that is worth something.  </li>
            <li>At that price, it&#x27;s worth the money, but I would never cough up the $300 MSP for the thing.</li>
            <li>I bought this dryer, but when I recieved it and try it was not as powerful as i thought it would be .</li>
            <li>I would have been pissed if I paid $300 for it, but I think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, my sister RAVED about this dryer</li>
            <li>Not becuase I&#x27;m not crazy enough to spend that kind of money, but because I&#x27;ve seen enough GOOD dryers to know you don&#x27;t need to spend that much to get a quality dryer.     </li>
            <li>WELL worth the $125 I paid for it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.</li>
            <li>but I felt with the five year warranty it was worth it.</li>
            <li>I am not the kind of person who spends $100 on a beauty product, but once I tried this hair dryer there was no going back.  </li>
            <li>However they were kind enough to say they would replace it for a $$ fee $$    Beware- where are these dryers coming from and why is Amazon still selling them if they are not an authorized retailer?  </li>
            <li>This is NOT A DRYER WORTH $50.00.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the money if you get one that works.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I do alot of research when I buy stuff, making sure I pay enough money to get quality and not buying cheap.  </li>
            <li>which should be fun.  </li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d pay $300 for it, but at this price it&#x27;s worth it...</li>
            <li>I gave $200 for my Hana professional and it is still my favorite hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I went directly to the T3 website and got the AUTHENTIC T3 hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>, maybe the money is worth it after all.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find one at this low price, and it has additional features!</li>
            <li>This dryer has taught me so much about how to dry my hair successfully that I am almost in debt to it for an education as well.  </li>
            <li>I have frizzy, thick, wavy hair but not in a good way!</li>
            <li>the price was right</li>
            <li>right to my skin and my sking</li>
            <li>Yeah right.</li>
            <li>and I am thrilled to get the lower price for the exact same product listed elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>When it had broke down, I only wanted to upgrade and the T3 was supposed to be the best around.</li>
            <li>Also the cord is long which is nice</li>
            <li>It has 3 levels of heat and a cool button although I dry my hair on highest setting, so the cool button doesn&#x27;t get very cool when I use it.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and super fast.</li>
            <li>I previously used a Babyliss ProTT tourmaline ceramic that I completely loved.</li>
            <li>But the real kicker is that the office witch actually complimented her on how nice her hair looked.  </li>
            <li>Well, they never had fine, fly-away, kinky, curly, bushy, virtually weightless hair that will not be tamed for love or money like I do, so I often wonder just who has it harder in that department!  </li>
            <li>The unit is easy to control, does not get too hot, and is powerful enough to just get the job done quickly.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my girlfriend who has very long and beautiful blonde hair.</li>
            <li>My previous hair dryer still blew warm air when i used the cool button</li>
            <li>It gets super hot really fast and dries my hair a lot quicker than what i had.</li>
            <li>I have very thick naturally curly hair, but not the good kind...</li>
            <li>The dryer is very quiet, gets hot quickly and has three levels of speed, but the fastest speed still seems a bit slower than other pro dryers, but I am happy with it and got a lifetime warranty for giving feedback to the site.</li>
            <li>but my hair feels SO soft and smooth and is shiny and silky..</li>
            <li>So far, my wife really enjoy the system.  </li>
            <li>HAHA!</li>
            <li>The only thing that makes me nervous is that it doesn&#x27;t quite look authentic..</li>
            <li>However, I know exactly where the serial number should have been (there is a place on the front of the box so it can be peeled off and applied for warrenty registration) and it had been removed or never applied.  </li>
            <li>I finally decided it was time to invest in something better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny that $130 seems like a deal for a blowdryer now.     </li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve asked various hair stylists why their blowouts were so much better than mine at home.</li>
            <li>When i first started using this hair dryer, my friends thought I had just come from the salon.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer even though I used it only 1 time</li>
            <li>The first model I owned was the \\&quot;evolution\\&quot; model ($300 retail) and used it for 5 years.  </li>
            <li>I recommend using the attachment to concentrate the airflow exactly where you want it.  </li>
            <li>This is in now way hot, no way</li>
            <li>I have NO RESPECT for a company that LIES to every one, puts out a dryer that is even in the news and yet sells top popele the EXACT OPPOSITE</li>
            <li>Now I am going to invest in the travel dryer because I am going on a Cruise this year, so it will better than packing the larger one.</li>
            <li>I never thouht i would spend that much on a dryer, but it has been well worth it.      </li>
            <li>I was actually giddy the first time I used this because of how it made my hair so smooth and full of body.  </li>
            <li>Says it is light as a feather and leaves her hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>You absolutely get what you pay for and this hair dryer is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>, I was worried about switching to something different but the T3 is everything is promises and more.  </li>
            <li>It actually gives you better control over your hairstyle and doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;poof\\&quot; up your hair.  </li>
            <li>Now I realize that this is most likely the humidity being blown out of my via the miracle of modern science!  </li>
            <li>;-)    </li>
            <li>Just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t the weather or my shampoo, I tried my ol&#x27; $20 Conair and the life came back to my hair!     </li>
            <li>Also my first one was a featherweight and I didn&#x27;t notice that this one was not until it was already shipping.</li>
            <li>Basically, if you don&#x27;t mind very hot hair dryers, go for it, but if my must older and less advanced conair does a better job than this, I have difficulty justifying the expense.    </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your hair look any more special than any other hair dryer does.  </li>
            <li>Who says a Grandma can&#x27;t be cool with a new blinged out T3?</li>
            <li>It works fine, but doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much power as my old dryer, which was 1875.</li>
            <li>The first lasted a good eight years and finally wore out with daily use.</li>
            <li>but hey, as long as it still works i&#x27;m fine with that!</li>
            <li>The only negative is that they&#x27;re not made of the best quality parts.</li>
            <li>83888-SE Special Edition Evolution Professional Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline Hair Dryer]]</li>
            <li>It is much much much quieter though, and it gets my hair really hot when I have it on the highest setting.  </li>
            <li>what I paid (as long as it continues to work and doesn&#x27;t burn out on me :-)</li>
            <li>Love the long cord also.</li>
            <li>Powerful,light,quiet and pretty much does everything it claims to do.</li>
            <li>But honestly, its not worth it because it broke within 3 months.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this item, but couldn&#x27;t imagine paying full price for it!</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy, fly-away hair that is prone to bushing and frizzing even in non-humid weather and until I found this dryer nothing could smooth, straighten and calm down this wild animal on my head!    </li>
            <li>It is very quiet and lightweight which makes it easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Good features, quick dry and its really quiet compared to her previous one (love that part).</li>
            <li>But be smart if you&#x27;re going to take the leap</li>
            <li>I also use John Frieda products (especially the hairspray for curly hair) as well - the hairspray will keep your hair straight for one day - and that is a true fact!</li>
            <li>Blow dryer didn&#x27;t last more than 1 year and was very loud.  </li>
            <li>The only positive of this dryer is light weight.  </li>
            <li>It replaces another that was essentially the same that worked for 8 years, perfectly and almost every day, and now is getting a little hitch when it turns on.</li>
            <li>It was light and quiet and fast.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s touted by the big-wigs as being fabulous I&#x27;m sure to hop on the gravy train and at least give it a try.</li>
            <li>Dries my hair fast leaving it smooth and shiny, quieter than my last dryer, and styles my hair well.  </li>
            <li>I feel it was worth the splurge, although I&#x27;m glad I bought it when I did (a few months ago) because the price has since gone up on it.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re really worried... try it out for a couple weeks..</li>
            <li>Very ergonomic.</li>
            <li>It dries faster and feels so much softer after.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I do not think my hair dries much faster with the T3 than the Andis Ionic Ceramic, maybe 10% faster.  </li>
            <li>This one is so much lighter.  </li>
            <li>and this really seems to work.)     </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even remember how much it was.</li>
            <li>This really makes me question the integrity of Amazon&#x27;s practices.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, it was $100, but so far it has been worth it.  </li>
            <li>The high wattage is a must!  </li>
            <li>really pissed about this.</li>
            <li>My hair is much smoother and feels healthier.</li>
            <li>It does not work like the real T3 at all  because it is not.</li>
            <li>Works very well and fast.</li>
            <li>My hair stays straight without it now.</li>
            <li>But I also know how much time DW spends on her hair every morning.  </li>
            <li>and I know what the real feels and looks like, including the serial number and the packaging.</li>
            <li>I use it sometimes to blowdry my hair straight</li>
            <li>This one works great, has multiple temperature settings and is quiet and light - with an extra long cord to boot.  </li>
            <li>Given that he has &#x27;human&#x27; hair, rather than fur, I feel comfortable stating that this is a &#x27;must buy,&#x27; if you are interested in quiet operation, a minimum of frizzies and a better result than standard dryers.</li>
            <li>I can hold the nozzle (with the nozzle on which is more extreme air flow)</li>
            <li>Due to the popularity of our products, unauthorized dealers have sold and continue to sell, products which they contend are authentic T3 Micro Products.  </li>
            <li>I love it because it works faster yet quieter than other blow-driers</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and very long, but stylists like to say that I have a very high number of follicles per square inch</li>
            <li>I bought one, expected a genuine article, didn&#x27;t get a manufacturer&#x27;s warranty and am stuck with a dryer that doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li>but I can dry it very quickly and not have friz from hurricane force winds and still have the heat I need.  </li>
            <li>Quite honestly I haven&#x27;t a clue whether this rates as a good hair dryer amongst quality hair-dryers, but I have slightly wavy blonde hair past my shoulders and this thing dries it beautifully, quickly, smoothly - and leaves you in total control.  </li>
            <li>This drier has cut down that time and is very light  weight.</li>
            <li>AND its cool button stays cool without holding it down.  </li>
            <li>So I have been blowing my hair out straight since high school.  </li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t notice anything special about it that a regular blow dryer wouldn&#x27;t have done.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time i have spent over $40 on a hair dryer and it was so worth it!</li>
            <li>and it doesnt burn my skin at all directly up against my skin on the highest setting, which is supposed to be Hot?  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d be pissed and take it back if I had paid full price.</li>
            <li>Is sounded funny and loud.  </li>
            <li>because I personally can not afford to pay full retail</li>
            <li>Anyway, before I review this product I should first say that my hair dryer prior to this one was a Super Solerno--also a professional dryer--that I paid $125 for.</li>
            <li>Would like a new one!  </li>
            <li>I appreciated very much the quietness of the hair dryer; at first I didn&#x27;t believe it could possibly dry my hair in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>I have been eyeing a new DSLR camera that just dropped below $1,000 on Amazon and am wondering if it will be the real deal or a knock off too?</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it for $40 less than retail.</li>
            <li>My hair ends up less manageable and more frizzy.  </li>
            <li>When I finally accpted the fact that no $10-$45 drugstore hair dryer could work the magic, I sprang for the Solerno and never looked back.</li>
            <li>I rated low to warn Amazon shoppers to make sure when you purchase this item the serial # tag is afixed to the cord - it is absolutely necessary for a warranty situation.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, when I blow-dry my hair straight with the T3 Evolution dryer, it makes my hair look very siky, soft, shiny, and with no frizz.  </li>
            <li>It would have been so worth the extra 100.00 to buy a real one instead of paying 200.00 for a $20.00 refurbished Conair motor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and dries hair quickly without frizzled ends.  </li>
            <li>So my hair dryer is possibly a copy; it is certainly not under any kind of warranty</li>
            <li>It has only two settings, both very hot.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>OK, there will be a little frizz, but not anywhere near as much as before.  </li>
            <li>If I have this right, this is an older, closeout version of the current $300 Evolution hairdryer but for the price</li>
            <li>the Solerno and the Elchim are great dryers that you just can&#x27;t go wrong with.</li>
            <li>So far as I know what I received is a knock off of the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I have medium length, super thick, baby fine, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>The medium setting, isn&#x27;t quite hot enough to get my hair straight.</li>
            <li>It would only blow out luke warm air at half the speed it should.</li>
            <li>My last one shorted right at my vanity.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like buying a knock off Louis in New York City.</li>
            <li>The item was purchased new but looks like a refurbished/used blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>The T3 was sold as new.</li>
            <li>I could purchase another one, new or refurbrished</li>
            <li>All I can think of is The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes.</li>
            <li>Does it live up to the promise?</li>
            <li>Item arrived in new condition as described.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure it would be worth the full cost of $300</li>
            <li>is kind of ridiculous.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t need to blow your hair to smithereens in order to dry it quickly and thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>The amazon dryer was VERY loud compared to the one that I purchased at Sephora.  </li>
            <li>My Babyliss dried my hair pretty quickly and so does the T3.</li>
            <li>I think hair dryers are like TVs because the biggest improvement is seen when you upgrade from the old version to the High Def TV or Ionic/Ceramic hair dryer; however, once you do upgrade only the slightest differences can be seen between in higher level models.    </li>
            <li>can clearly see the location where it used to be and was torn off!)  </li>
            <li>Under no circumstances should a hair blowdryer have a heat setting hot enough to singe your hair OFF.</li>
            <li>First, OMG..what /who are these people on here giving this hair dryer such rave reviews?  </li>
            <li>The first one only worked for a week</li>
            <li>Amazon is one of the places online that I have always felt safe making purchases, but no more.  </li>
            <li>So I am screwed if this breaks early!</li>
            <li>Even in hot, humid weather I can walk outside and not feel my hair shrivel and kink up.  </li>
            <li>, I find the lower speed virtually unecessary because the higher speed is versatile enough to use for any purpose.    </li>
            <li>I have now owned this blow dryer for about a year and despite daily use it&#x27;s still going strong with absolutely NO issues whatsoever</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice hair dryer but doesn&#x27;t blow very hard and it takes me longer to do my hair.</li>
            <li>This dryer dries it from completely wet to dry, smooth and straight in 12 minutes</li>
            <li>yeah this dryer definitely does dry faster than others and it comes with the top skinny thing which u can take off and make a regular hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and has a little bling on the handle.    </li>
            <li>In general, I would highly recommend this dryer to anyone regardless of their hair issues.  </li>
            <li>The hot air went from hot to warm and by Saturday, sparks flew and the only setting is cold.</li>
            <li>I have the dryer, I used it and it is clearly and no mistake or even \\&quot;maybe\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The reason the price is so low is that this is a cheap knock off and not a real Bespoke labs blow dryer.</li>
            <li>excellant product for the professional stylist</li>
            <li>I decided to go ahead and buy from Amazon since the 5-star ratings far exceeded the negatives.  </li>
            <li>The professional place that i bought my t3 from before stopped selling them, so i had to get one online..</li>
            <li>For some reason, maybe it&#x27;s the way this hair dryer smooths the cuticle, people think the lighter coloring at the ends is natural.    </li>
            <li>Heck, SOMETHING besides botox has to be keeping the 40 year old stars looking 20.</li>
            <li>The dryer was SOOOO LOUD (and I&#x27;ve had a CHI hair dryer before, so</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t personally like it that much.</li>
            <li>The next morning when I ran my brush through it, it didn&#x27;t so much as snag.   </li>
            <li>Contacting the company direct for a replacement since Amazon could not help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a professional hairstylist.</li>
            <li>but I was adamant on a refund.</li>
            <li>and if so how have you overcome the need to complete the dryer&#x27;s integrity by installing the mesh?</li>
            <li>I never realized how much my old hair dryer frizzed my hair until I used this one.  </li>
            <li>This has been a complete rip off.</li>
            <li>His hair dries much faster, and this dryer is quieter than the prior model.</li>
            <li>I am a hair stylist at a busy salon</li>
            <li>I had seen this effect a bit with my old dryer, but it happens a LOT with this dryer.  </li>
            <li>Wife wanted a professional quality hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get my money back and for that I gave it 2 stars, but I had to pay for shipping and waste my time going to the post office.</li>
            <li>Another thing is thatthe dryer is amazingly light - it weighs just over half a pound!  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally very curly, and has been very damaged by flat irons, hair dryers, and japanese straightening.  </li>
            <li>After all those years of inherited, used and just plain cheap \\&quot;pharmacy grade\\</li>
            <li>As for the Evolution itself, it does dry hair quickly, though I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s necessarily faster than my Solerno.</li>
            <li>If you curl your hair around a barrel brush and pull it tight, then pull verrry slowly down to the ends while following it with the dryer, it will dry your hair far more efficiently and smoothly than if you had to deal with tons of wind blowing your hair all over the place.  </li>
            <li>The one we got came with no serial number as described in other reviews below, but it has been working extremely well and as advertised in that it dries hair significantly faster than our old Conair Yellowbird 2000 watt and leaves your hair feeling much softer.  </li>
            <li>I also like the little \\&quot;bling\\&quot; added to the handle of this special edition (SE) model.</li>
            <li>Please be aware that you&#x27;re taking a chance that it may not be authentic and it might fail,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mainly using the T3 Bespoke hair dryer for a back up.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t broken yet like other customers complain, gets nice and hot too.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;no need for the low setting as the high is perfect\\&quot;,</li>
            <li>The cool shot button works almost immediately and helps to set hair when using a round metal brush to curl ends.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the tourmaline or whatever that gives your hair that nice look and feel, so you can dry your hair at the lowest heat setting and it will turn out the same way and cause very little damage.     </li>
            <li>Quick dry, doesn&#x27;t dry out hair by over heating.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, it delivers extremely hot heat that you could burn yourself if you leave it one area too long at the highest setting.  </li>
            <li>It cut my hair drying time in half and that is saying a lot because I have long fine hair</li>
            <li>Dried quickly</li>
            <li>First of all, let me warn you that if you are expecting this dryer to be anything like your old dryer you are going to be let down.  </li>
            <li>I was prepared to be disappointed in the T3 (could a hairdryer really be worth that much money?), but am totally satisfied.  </li>
            <li>It is quiet and does have several speeds/settings, and that&#x27;s a plus, but the truly stellar thing about it is that it actually seems to SET your hair in the style you create.</li>
            <li>I have a major probelm every time.  </li>
            <li>It is worth spending the extra couple of bucks over the other ones.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like my previous dryer, but I paid a lot more for the previous one.</li>
            <li>We have a high use home (several people use this dryer daily), so it gets quite a workout.  </li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>and I have no regrets.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually gotten compliments on a 3 day old blowout.</li>
            <li>Wow, I cannot believe the difference between T3 Evolution and a regular $20 Conair dryer I used before.  </li>
            <li>But, look at it this way, you could buy 3 of these for the same price as the one from an \\&quot;authorized\\&quot; dealer with a warranty-and you would still have to pay $15+ to have it fixed if it breaks under the warranty.  </li>
            <li>I have used a real one and this is not a real one</li>
            <li>Would definitely not recommend in a professional setting.</li>
            <li>I have a Hana professional hair dryer that is ten times the hair dryer this one is.</li>
            <li>Once you get the knack of it, though, you will never want to go back to your old dryer again.  </li>
            <li>I took out the partially broken piece, and used it for a couple more weeks.</li>
            <li>The company wasn&#x27;t wanting to rectify the cracked fan blades, but was wanting more money from me for this poorly designed fan section of the dryer.  </li>
            <li>maybe it is an older model or maybe the company took an old one and fixed it..because the fan inside is a different color than all the other ones i&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>its still working so far, but t3&#x27;s can be very trick, you never know when they&#x27;ll just break down on you.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one, it will let you down when you need it most.</li>
            <li>Five years later, when it finally died, I began looking for a new one and that&#x27;s when I heard of the Evolution.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much quieter than my old dryer and cuts drying time in half.</li>
            <li>I emailed Amazon a few time before posting this, in order to give then a chance to make it right, but they offer no help at all.  </li>
            <li>Normally it takes her about 45 min to an hour to thoroughly dry her hair.</li>
            <li>The entire dryer vibrated and shook your entire arm, it was that LOUD!  </li>
            <li>Apparently does not dry out her hair; or the dogs hair for that matter.</li>
            <li>Because my hair is damaged, I try to let my hair air dry some before I use the blow dryer on, so I can&#x27;t say how this dryer works on wet hair right out of the shower.</li>
            <li>The T3 was priced much lower than other web sites.  </li>
            <li>and the evolution was a little heavy to hold over the top of my head for any length of time, so I switched.      </li>
            <li>the hair dryer works very well to dry hair fast without harsh heat.</li>
            <li>I broke down and shelled out for the T3 only after buying three cheaper hairdryers -- the first broke and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different hair dryers and usually spend less money on them.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the dryer I received was not the special edition shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>The cool button must be held down; personally, I don&#x27;t know why most hair dryers don&#x27;t come with a button that keeps the cold air going, but I am not an engineer.    </li>
            <li>since she&#x27;s been using the hair dryer, she really notice less split ends.</li>
            <li>Dries much faster than non-pro dryers, and leaves my hair much less frizzy too.</li>
            <li>She says that the dryer dries her hair quicker and leaves it soft and it doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  </li>
            <li>However, it does seem to quickly finish drying my hair (after I let it air dry some) without leaving my hair feeling too coarse or dried out.</li>
            <li>It blows very hot but not too hard</li>
            <li>i have super thick hair and tons of it..</li>
            <li>Price-wise, this blow dryer costs a bit more than I usually pay for blow dryers, but I did want a nicer one that would last and not be so harsh on my hair.</li>
            <li>It feels like it takes about 25% less time than my old dryer, which was also a professional ionic/ceramic dryer.     </li>
            <li>Again, the control this affords you in being able to hold the dryer at strange angles indefinitely without feeling awkward or tired is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I used to think that only a professional could dry the hair on the back of my head and style it well, but now I can do it myself to perfection with this dryer.  </li>
            <li>Compared to other dryers, yes, you can pay less, but these are worth the price.</li>

            <li> While this hairdryer worked, it was great.</li>
            <li> This one shortens the time, smooths the hair shaft, and straightens great.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I though it was a great price.</li>

            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> Very nice hair dryer.</li>
            <li> ~:o)</li>
            <li> and I am still thrilled with its performance!</li>
            <li> Best of all, the diffuser works great significantly improves the look of my curls.      </li>
            <li> Got it about 15 months ago, and totally loved it.</li>
            <li> When the hairdryer did work, my wife loved it.  </li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend who always has good hair.</li>
            <li> You need to have a lot of time and patience - and for that you can probably get good hair with any priced dryer.</li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t imagine it is good for my hair).</li>
            <li> Good morning, I regret to inform you that this article was mistakenly delivered to another person and never received it.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s a fairly good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Product was packed in original box, in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li> Amazon was great about the return, but if I had known for sure that a warrenty was not going to be included, I would never have ordered it from them.  </li>
            <li> It looks very healthy after blow drying without even any product.</li>
            <li> I was impressed the first time I used this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> *still love my dryer though!</li>
            <li> Love this dryer!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> Love the hairdryer, it works amazing!  </li>
            <li> So I am completely satisfied!</li>
            <li> This dryer is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing.  </li>
            <li> I will explain why this hair dryer is amazing not the circumstances.</li>
            <li> And the benefits from not having to deal with all that wind are amazing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quieter, lighter and doesn&#x27;t require gymnastics to achieve amazing results.    </li>
            <li> So I really don&#x27;t know if it is the best dryer according to customer rating.  </li>
            <li> the kind that looks like I&#x27;ve been playing with electricity.  </li>
            <li> doesnt even get close to warm.  </li>
            <li> THINK before you write reviews and be honest.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for quality products at lower price and excellent delivery.  </li>
            <li> I thought this was a customer service kind of company ,</li>
            <li> I have a new baby, and would rather spend my time with her instead of drying my hair - so this seemed like the perfect product.    </li>
            <li> I have a very strong feeling</li>
            <li> over the years of working in salons, my own included, i have had many dryers.</li>
            <li> this product has been awesome so far.</li>
            <li> This professional dryer does the best job on my hair.</li>
            <li> I bring this with me to nice hotels because it&#x27;s always better than whatever they provide.</li>
            <li> It makes a huge difference!    </li>
            <li> I purchased this hairdrier after reading the reviews from Consumer Reports - rated in the top 2.  </li>
            <li> I would have opted to pay more money.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product.</li>
            <li> And plus, made such a great difference to my hair!</li>
            <li> If I get the same value out of this one I am a  happy camper!</li>
            <li> At best it is a refurb., definitely used.</li>
            <li> She suggested I check on Amazon for a better price.</li>
            <li> The best thing is that it&#x27;s quiet for a blow dryer ...</li>
            <li> Love it..</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Just make sure it&#x27;s through an authorized retailer</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a wonderful dryer and</li>
            <li> So, I love it, and I would buy another.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it one day, but feel it&#x27;s one of the best beauty investments I&#x27;ve ever made!!</li>
            <li> The amazon dryer also blew a lot more air than the one purchased from Sephora.  </li>
            <li> I love this dryer.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you do your research on this one before you decide where to purchase.</li>
            <li> This process used to take atleast 30 minutes or more.</li>
            <li> Ok Here goes.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer HOWEVER after owning it for 22 months (not quite 2 years)</li>
            <li> Although Amazon may not be an authorized retailer...please be sure to specify to T3 (if for some reason you have to return or register your product) that your dryer WAS purchased through Sephora/Amazon...in which case Sephora IS AN AUTHORIZED RESELLER of these dryers.  </li>
            <li> The dryer works ok - nothing</li>
            <li> I just wanted to be sure I was getting</li>
            <li> I would rather chance $100 without a warranty than pay $200 more for one.  </li>
            <li> The reason I say this hair dryer is just ok and gave it 3 stars is because I&#x27;ve had 2 of them.</li>
            <li> I do love how shiny the dryer makes my hair.</li>
            <li> With a vented roll brush, this leaves my hair looking sleek and healthy in record time.</li>
            <li> I had to spend more money to Order the Diffuser.  </li>
            <li> So I ended up spending more money and did not get the product I ordered through the Amazon site.</li>

            <li> Make sure you heed the warning....</li>
            <li> Make sure it has the serial number on the box!I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> Now we have to spend more money on another blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Therefor this hairdryer was appealing to me.  </li>
            <li> I usually love Amazon and buy a lot of Cd&#x27;s, books, etc.</li>
            <li> I am sure glad I did.</li>
            <li> This ionic hair dryer does an outstanding job on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Seller was great and very prompt delivery.  </li>
            <li> But the T3 does it without blowing my hair everywhere, so you have much more control over styling.</li>
            <li> I love mine.</li>
            <li> So I guess it was OK to buy a corded gift after all.  </li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer-</li>
            <li> Hope to have many years with this one :)</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> But regardless of that, I think that anyone who wants silkier, smoother, straighter hair will be more than happy with their results with this dryer.  </li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I am giving 1 star as a judgment more about Bespoke Labs than the product I received.</li>
            <li> : make sure it&#x27;s the REAL DEAL (able to be warranteed) and make sure it&#x27;s on sale!!</li>
            <li> Instead I got the Special Edition with NO DIFFUSER for more money!  </li>
            <li> They really have to knock my socks off for me to take the time or energy to write a review, but this hair dryer does that and more!!</li>
            <li> A $300 hairdryer would have to come with it&#x27;s own stylist to be worth it!</li>
            <li> I can easily see how this can be a favorite of the worlds top stylists.</li>
            <li> Very light weight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;$135 is too much to pay for a hair dryer that lasts 6 months,... even if it was amazing when it worked!</li>
            <li> This dryer is so easy to use you will have more energy when you leave the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> This is fine for home use; in fact, it might be better not having and 8 ft cord.  </li>
            <li> Then I got a job with a 2-hour commute and my free time become a lot scarcer and more valuable and</li>
            <li> So far , its been great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this blow dryer for a month now, and so far I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> After seeing her burn thru cheap dryer after dryer, I decided to take the plunge and get her a top of the line product.</li>
            <li> but if you give it a chance you&#x27;ll see that it is light years better than anything else out there.    </li>
            <li> All I know is that my hair comes out silky, smooth, and since I&#x27;ve been using it, in MUCH better condition than before.  </li>
            <li> My hair is smooth, soft, shiny and best of all straight!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I was able to get it for such a great price.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this hairdryer on Sunday and received it on Wednesday for very quick service.</li>
            <li> however it seems to get tangled easily.</li>
            <li> I cannot in good conscious keep a dryer that I paid almost 200 for where my vidal sassoon dryer gives off more air flow.  </li>
            <li> Has been using for over 2 years and still going strong.  </li>
            <li> I too liked this hair dryer very much.  </li>
            <li> Liked it very much.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> After giving this dryer a good week for a test drive, my hair only seemed flatter and had more static.  </li>
            <li> This blow dryer is the best I have ever used and the price is less that inferior dryers.</li>
            <li> I have a very old hair dryer now, a conair, that I love, and honestly, I would rather use the conair.    </li>
            <li> I would have the warranty available to me.</li>
            <li> I even wrap and secure the cord every time.</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying a great hair dryer that would last me for years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely light</li>
            <li> I know how to wait until the product become available at an authorized dealer.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t stress enough the difference a great blow dryer makes when doing one&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> It dries your hair faster as it claims and is light weight for holding.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> light air flow</li>
            <li> It is light, plastic, 1600 watt cheap deryer.  </li>
            <li> ( I already own a real one), wanted to return it.</li>
            <li> The second one works great.</li>
            <li> All in all, one fantastic hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I had a cheap Revlon dryer that did the job</li>
            <li> My hair is always smooth after using.    </li>
            <li> Bottom line - feel free to try it out, but I&#x27;m spending my money elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> but so far so good...</li>
            <li> My wife says the hairdryer is very powerful and reduces the amount of drying time.</li>
            <li> Very powerful.  </li>
            <li> I love this T3 hair dryer - it is lightweight and dries your hair very fast.  </li>
            <li> The cool shot button is GREAT, it actually blows cool air.  </li>
            <li> i guess its worth it!?</li>
            <li> And so, I am concerned that my significant investment in this hair dryer is being compromised by using without the mesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, I bought this very same dryer from Amazon over a year ago, and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE It.</li>
            <li> I have the original dryer</li>
            <li> They are not difficult to push/ avoid pushing unless you have the most sausage of sausage fingers.  </li>
            <li> If you have that reaction I would suggest taking some lessons in blow drying techniques because I am pretty sure that will solve your problem.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine and not extremely thick, and this dryer does a great job of giving me extra volume when I want a more glamourous look.  </li>
            <li> The Special Edition comes with a shorter cord.  </li>
            <li> special</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller, and because I was certain this was authentic, I threw the box away</li>
            <li> i like working with this as it is extremely light weight and dries the hair very fast and almost frizz free.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I expected and works very good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to have special ionic magical powers of some sort that help defrizz your hair, but I can&#x27;t really tell the difference.  </li>
            <li> Hair dryer was amazing until it started to struggle and make sounds after 2 months of use and completely stopped /</li>
            <li> if you love it and NEED the warranty.. return it and buy the real deal for 300 bucks at sephora.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know a good hairdryer could make such a difference.  </li>
            <li> It does make my hair nice and shiny and soft (but that also may be attributed to the Biosilk Cure product I&#x27;ve been using).  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is a good hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> it better be the real thing.</li>
            <li> I elected to return for a full refund and went with a SuperSolano 3600.</li>
            <li> The dryer no longer heats up and the warranty was only good for a year.  </li>
            <li> Also, she always uses the diffuser and always does the curly look (probably on cool).     </li>
            <li> (To get this effect I always use the \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; after I get the look I want.</li>
            <li> I thought since I was paying so much it would be quicker &amp; better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hairdryer after reading all the reviews that Amazon wasn&#x27;t an authorized retailer for the T3 hairdryer, but I wasn&#x27;t too concerned since it was such a good price.  </li>
            <li> The feather weight is an excellent hairdryer - my hair is extremely thick and curly.  </li>
            <li> It is light and powerful</li>
            <li> which is nice and not too loud either.</li>
            <li> But this is the real deal, authentic stickers and all.</li>
            <li> it works fast and my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I had my last one for 2 years which is the length of the warranty before it broke which for me is a good run.</li>
            <li> I had the blue Chi Ion before for 5 years that I loved dearly</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t pay full retail for it..</li>
            <li> Very nice product, but sometimes seems to actually get to hot.</li>
            <li> This one is light weight, ergonomically designed, delivers just the right amount of heat/\\&quot;blow\\&quot; for each setting.  </li>
            <li> The hair dryer came quickly with no issues.  </li>
            <li> It arrived quick and worked as stated.</li>
            <li> but when I spend more than a $100 on a product, I expect it to last more than 2 years.</li>
            <li> If you feel like you are doing something better for your hair because you spent this kind of money, then by all means, go for it.  </li>
            <li> it drys your hair so quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave the frizzy feeling that all drug store brand hair dryers leave.</li>
            <li> more of a hum than a high pitch whistle of some blow dryers.</li>
            <li> So light it didnt burn my skin on highest hot setting up agaqinst my arm.  </li>
            <li> The temperature is very very hot and hurts my scalp</li>
            <li> Very pretty with the jewel studded handle.</li>
            <li> I use the &#x27;cool shot&#x27; most of the time, and the button is easy to push and does not fatigue my hand the way lesser dryers have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously my new favorite thing.</li>
            <li> The real deal is a fabulous dryer and I would suggest buying it for the full $300 and having a 4-year warranty on it.      </li>
            <li> it worth it to have beautiful hair year round, and its still cheaper than the beauty salon.</li>
            <li> Awesome product but did not give 5 stars because it didn&#x27;t last long before it started giving problems.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Featherweight first, took it back for the Evolution (thought maybe with more settings it would be ok).</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time!</li>
            <li> If you want to invest in this hair dryer try to find it at a local beauty store (I found one with warranty and all for $170) and be sure to look for the silver serial number label!</li>
            <li> But my first one was $300!</li>
            <li> It has a 4 year warrenty and for a hair dryer at this price, that is worth something.  </li>
            <li> At that price, it&#x27;s worth the money, but I would never cough up the $300 MSP for the thing.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer, but when I recieved it and try it was not as powerful as i thought it would be .</li>
            <li> I would have been pissed if I paid $300 for it, but I think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, my sister RAVED about this dryer</li>
            <li> Not becuase I&#x27;m not crazy enough to spend that kind of money, but because I&#x27;ve seen enough GOOD dryers to know you don&#x27;t need to spend that much to get a quality dryer.     </li>
            <li> WELL worth the $125 I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> but I felt with the five year warranty it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I am not the kind of person who spends $100 on a beauty product, but once I tried this hair dryer there was no going back.  </li>
            <li> However they were kind enough to say they would replace it for a $$ fee $$    Beware- where are these dryers coming from and why is Amazon still selling them if they are not an authorized retailer?  </li>
            <li> This is NOT A DRYER WORTH $50.00.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the money if you get one that works.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I do alot of research when I buy stuff, making sure I pay enough money to get quality and not buying cheap.  </li>
            <li> which should be fun.  </li>
            <li> Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d pay $300 for it, but at this price it&#x27;s worth it...</li>
            <li> I gave $200 for my Hana professional and it is still my favorite hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I went directly to the T3 website and got the AUTHENTIC T3 hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> , maybe the money is worth it after all.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find one at this low price, and it has additional features!</li>
            <li> This dryer has taught me so much about how to dry my hair successfully that I am almost in debt to it for an education as well.  </li>
            <li> I have frizzy, thick, wavy hair but not in a good way!</li>
            <li> the price was right</li>
            <li> right to my skin and my sking</li>
            <li> Yeah right.</li>
            <li> and I am thrilled to get the lower price for the exact same product listed elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> When it had broke down, I only wanted to upgrade and the T3 was supposed to be the best around.</li>
            <li> Also the cord is long which is nice</li>
            <li> It has 3 levels of heat and a cool button although I dry my hair on highest setting, so the cool button doesn&#x27;t get very cool when I use it.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and super fast.</li>
            <li> I previously used a Babyliss ProTT tourmaline ceramic that I completely loved.</li>
            <li> But the real kicker is that the office witch actually complimented her on how nice her hair looked.  </li>
            <li> Well, they never had fine, fly-away, kinky, curly, bushy, virtually weightless hair that will not be tamed for love or money like I do, so I often wonder just who has it harder in that department!  </li>
            <li> The unit is easy to control, does not get too hot, and is powerful enough to just get the job done quickly.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend who has very long and beautiful blonde hair.</li>
            <li> My previous hair dryer still blew warm air when i used the cool button</li>
            <li> It gets super hot really fast and dries my hair a lot quicker than what i had.</li>
            <li> I have very thick naturally curly hair, but not the good kind...</li>
            <li> The dryer is very quiet, gets hot quickly and has three levels of speed, but the fastest speed still seems a bit slower than other pro dryers, but I am happy with it and got a lifetime warranty for giving feedback to the site.</li>
            <li> but my hair feels SO soft and smooth and is shiny and silky..</li>
            <li> So far, my wife really enjoy the system.  </li>
            <li> HAHA!</li>
            <li> The only thing that makes me nervous is that it doesn&#x27;t quite look authentic..</li>
            <li> However, I know exactly where the serial number should have been (there is a place on the front of the box so it can be peeled off and applied for warrenty registration) and it had been removed or never applied.  </li>
            <li> I finally decided it was time to invest in something better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny that $130 seems like a deal for a blowdryer now.     </li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve asked various hair stylists why their blowouts were so much better than mine at home.</li>
            <li> When i first started using this hair dryer, my friends thought I had just come from the salon.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer even though I used it only 1 time</li>
            <li> The first model I owned was the \\&quot;evolution\\&quot; model ($300 retail) and used it for 5 years.  </li>
            <li> I recommend using the attachment to concentrate the airflow exactly where you want it.  </li>
            <li> This is in now way hot, no way</li>
            <li> I have NO RESPECT for a company that LIES to every one, puts out a dryer that is even in the news and yet sells top popele the EXACT OPPOSITE</li>
            <li> Now I am going to invest in the travel dryer because I am going on a Cruise this year, so it will better than packing the larger one.</li>
            <li> I never thouht i would spend that much on a dryer, but it has been well worth it.      </li>
            <li> I was actually giddy the first time I used this because of how it made my hair so smooth and full of body.  </li>
            <li> Says it is light as a feather and leaves her hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> You absolutely get what you pay for and this hair dryer is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> , I was worried about switching to something different but the T3 is everything is promises and more.  </li>
            <li> It actually gives you better control over your hairstyle and doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;poof\\&quot; up your hair.  </li>
            <li> Now I realize that this is most likely the humidity being blown out of my via the miracle of modern science!  </li>
            <li> ;-)    </li>
            <li> Just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t the weather or my shampoo, I tried my ol&#x27; $20 Conair and the life came back to my hair!     </li>
            <li> Also my first one was a featherweight and I didn&#x27;t notice that this one was not until it was already shipping.</li>
            <li> Basically, if you don&#x27;t mind very hot hair dryers, go for it, but if my must older and less advanced conair does a better job than this, I have difficulty justifying the expense.    </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair look any more special than any other hair dryer does.  </li>
            <li> Who says a Grandma can&#x27;t be cool with a new blinged out T3?</li>
            <li> It works fine, but doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much power as my old dryer, which was 1875.</li>
            <li> The first lasted a good eight years and finally wore out with daily use.</li>
            <li> but hey, as long as it still works i&#x27;m fine with that!</li>
            <li> The only negative is that they&#x27;re not made of the best quality parts.</li>
            <li> 83888-SE Special Edition Evolution Professional Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline Hair Dryer]]</li>
            <li> It is much much much quieter though, and it gets my hair really hot when I have it on the highest setting.  </li>
            <li> what I paid (as long as it continues to work and doesn&#x27;t burn out on me :-)</li>
            <li> Love the long cord also.</li>
            <li> Powerful,light,quiet and pretty much does everything it claims to do.</li>
            <li> But honestly, its not worth it because it broke within 3 months.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this item, but couldn&#x27;t imagine paying full price for it!</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy, fly-away hair that is prone to bushing and frizzing even in non-humid weather and until I found this dryer nothing could smooth, straighten and calm down this wild animal on my head!    </li>
            <li> It is very quiet and lightweight which makes it easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Good features, quick dry and its really quiet compared to her previous one (love that part).</li>
            <li> But be smart if you&#x27;re going to take the leap</li>
            <li> I also use John Frieda products (especially the hairspray for curly hair) as well - the hairspray will keep your hair straight for one day - and that is a true fact!</li>
            <li> Blow dryer didn&#x27;t last more than 1 year and was very loud.  </li>
            <li> The only positive of this dryer is light weight.  </li>
            <li> It replaces another that was essentially the same that worked for 8 years, perfectly and almost every day, and now is getting a little hitch when it turns on.</li>
            <li> It was light and quiet and fast.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s touted by the big-wigs as being fabulous I&#x27;m sure to hop on the gravy train and at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair fast leaving it smooth and shiny, quieter than my last dryer, and styles my hair well.  </li>
            <li> I feel it was worth the splurge, although I&#x27;m glad I bought it when I did (a few months ago) because the price has since gone up on it.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re really worried... try it out for a couple weeks..</li>
            <li> Very ergonomic.</li>
            <li> It dries faster and feels so much softer after.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I do not think my hair dries much faster with the T3 than the Andis Ionic Ceramic, maybe 10% faster.  </li>
            <li> This one is so much lighter.  </li>
            <li> and this really seems to work.)     </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even remember how much it was.</li>
            <li> This really makes me question the integrity of Amazon&#x27;s practices.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, it was $100, but so far it has been worth it.  </li>
            <li> The high wattage is a must!  </li>
            <li> really pissed about this.</li>
            <li> My hair is much smoother and feels healthier.</li>
            <li> It does not work like the real T3 at all  because it is not.</li>
            <li> Works very well and fast.</li>
            <li> My hair stays straight without it now.</li>
            <li> But I also know how much time DW spends on her hair every morning.  </li>
            <li> and I know what the real feels and looks like, including the serial number and the packaging.</li>
            <li> I use it sometimes to blowdry my hair straight</li>
            <li> This one works great, has multiple temperature settings and is quiet and light - with an extra long cord to boot.  </li>
            <li> Given that he has &#x27;human&#x27; hair, rather than fur, I feel comfortable stating that this is a &#x27;must buy,&#x27; if you are interested in quiet operation, a minimum of frizzies and a better result than standard dryers.</li>
            <li> I can hold the nozzle (with the nozzle on which is more extreme air flow)</li>
            <li> Due to the popularity of our products, unauthorized dealers have sold and continue to sell, products which they contend are authentic T3 Micro Products.  </li>
            <li> I love it because it works faster yet quieter than other blow-driers</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and very long, but stylists like to say that I have a very high number of follicles per square inch</li>
            <li> I bought one, expected a genuine article, didn&#x27;t get a manufacturer&#x27;s warranty and am stuck with a dryer that doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li> but I can dry it very quickly and not have friz from hurricane force winds and still have the heat I need.  </li>
            <li> Quite honestly I haven&#x27;t a clue whether this rates as a good hair dryer amongst quality hair-dryers, but I have slightly wavy blonde hair past my shoulders and this thing dries it beautifully, quickly, smoothly - and leaves you in total control.  </li>
            <li> This drier has cut down that time and is very light  weight.</li>
            <li> AND its cool button stays cool without holding it down.  </li>
            <li> So I have been blowing my hair out straight since high school.  </li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t notice anything special about it that a regular blow dryer wouldn&#x27;t have done.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time i have spent over $40 on a hair dryer and it was so worth it!</li>
            <li> and it doesnt burn my skin at all directly up against my skin on the highest setting, which is supposed to be Hot?  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d be pissed and take it back if I had paid full price.</li>
            <li> Is sounded funny and loud.  </li>
            <li> because I personally can not afford to pay full retail</li>
            <li> Anyway, before I review this product I should first say that my hair dryer prior to this one was a Super Solerno--also a professional dryer--that I paid $125 for.</li>
            <li> Would like a new one!  </li>
            <li> I appreciated very much the quietness of the hair dryer; at first I didn&#x27;t believe it could possibly dry my hair in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> I have been eyeing a new DSLR camera that just dropped below $1,000 on Amazon and am wondering if it will be the real deal or a knock off too?</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it for $40 less than retail.</li>
            <li> My hair ends up less manageable and more frizzy.  </li>
            <li> When I finally accpted the fact that no $10-$45 drugstore hair dryer could work the magic, I sprang for the Solerno and never looked back.</li>
            <li> I rated low to warn Amazon shoppers to make sure when you purchase this item the serial # tag is afixed to the cord - it is absolutely necessary for a warranty situation.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, when I blow-dry my hair straight with the T3 Evolution dryer, it makes my hair look very siky, soft, shiny, and with no frizz.  </li>
            <li> It would have been so worth the extra 100.00 to buy a real one instead of paying 200.00 for a $20.00 refurbished Conair motor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and dries hair quickly without frizzled ends.  </li>
            <li> So my hair dryer is possibly a copy; it is certainly not under any kind of warranty</li>
            <li> It has only two settings, both very hot.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> OK, there will be a little frizz, but not anywhere near as much as before.  </li>
            <li> If I have this right, this is an older, closeout version of the current $300 Evolution hairdryer but for the price</li>
            <li> the Solerno and the Elchim are great dryers that you just can&#x27;t go wrong with.</li>
            <li> So far as I know what I received is a knock off of the real thing.  </li>
            <li> I have medium length, super thick, baby fine, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The medium setting, isn&#x27;t quite hot enough to get my hair straight.</li>
            <li> It would only blow out luke warm air at half the speed it should.</li>
            <li> My last one shorted right at my vanity.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like buying a knock off Louis in New York City.</li>
            <li> The item was purchased new but looks like a refurbished/used blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> The T3 was sold as new.</li>
            <li> I could purchase another one, new or refurbrished</li>
            <li> All I can think of is The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes.</li>
            <li> Does it live up to the promise?</li>
            <li> Item arrived in new condition as described.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure it would be worth the full cost of $300</li>
            <li> is kind of ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t need to blow your hair to smithereens in order to dry it quickly and thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> The amazon dryer was VERY loud compared to the one that I purchased at Sephora.  </li>
            <li> My Babyliss dried my hair pretty quickly and so does the T3.</li>
            <li> I think hair dryers are like TVs because the biggest improvement is seen when you upgrade from the old version to the High Def TV or Ionic/Ceramic hair dryer; however, once you do upgrade only the slightest differences can be seen between in higher level models.    </li>
            <li> can clearly see the location where it used to be and was torn off!)  </li>
            <li> Under no circumstances should a hair blowdryer have a heat setting hot enough to singe your hair OFF.</li>
            <li> First, OMG..what /who are these people on here giving this hair dryer such rave reviews?  </li>
            <li> The first one only worked for a week</li>
            <li> Amazon is one of the places online that I have always felt safe making purchases, but no more.  </li>
            <li> So I am screwed if this breaks early!</li>
            <li> Even in hot, humid weather I can walk outside and not feel my hair shrivel and kink up.  </li>
            <li> , I find the lower speed virtually unecessary because the higher speed is versatile enough to use for any purpose.    </li>
            <li> I have now owned this blow dryer for about a year and despite daily use it&#x27;s still going strong with absolutely NO issues whatsoever</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice hair dryer but doesn&#x27;t blow very hard and it takes me longer to do my hair.</li>
            <li> This dryer dries it from completely wet to dry, smooth and straight in 12 minutes</li>
            <li> yeah this dryer definitely does dry faster than others and it comes with the top skinny thing which u can take off and make a regular hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and has a little bling on the handle.    </li>
            <li> In general, I would highly recommend this dryer to anyone regardless of their hair issues.  </li>
            <li> The hot air went from hot to warm and by Saturday, sparks flew and the only setting is cold.</li>
            <li> I have the dryer, I used it and it is clearly and no mistake or even \\&quot;maybe\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The reason the price is so low is that this is a cheap knock off and not a real Bespoke labs blow dryer.</li>
            <li> excellant product for the professional stylist</li>
            <li> I decided to go ahead and buy from Amazon since the 5-star ratings far exceeded the negatives.  </li>
            <li> The professional place that i bought my t3 from before stopped selling them, so i had to get one online..</li>
            <li> For some reason, maybe it&#x27;s the way this hair dryer smooths the cuticle, people think the lighter coloring at the ends is natural.    </li>
            <li> Heck, SOMETHING besides botox has to be keeping the 40 year old stars looking 20.</li>
            <li> The dryer was SOOOO LOUD (and I&#x27;ve had a CHI hair dryer before, so</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t personally like it that much.</li>
            <li> The next morning when I ran my brush through it, it didn&#x27;t so much as snag.   </li>
            <li> Contacting the company direct for a replacement since Amazon could not help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a professional hairstylist.</li>
            <li> but I was adamant on a refund.</li>
            <li> and if so how have you overcome the need to complete the dryer&#x27;s integrity by installing the mesh?</li>
            <li> I never realized how much my old hair dryer frizzed my hair until I used this one.  </li>
            <li> This has been a complete rip off.</li>
            <li> His hair dries much faster, and this dryer is quieter than the prior model.</li>
            <li> I am a hair stylist at a busy salon</li>
            <li> I had seen this effect a bit with my old dryer, but it happens a LOT with this dryer.  </li>
            <li> Wife wanted a professional quality hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get my money back and for that I gave it 2 stars, but I had to pay for shipping and waste my time going to the post office.</li>
            <li> Another thing is thatthe dryer is amazingly light - it weighs just over half a pound!  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very curly, and has been very damaged by flat irons, hair dryers, and japanese straightening.  </li>
            <li> After all those years of inherited, used and just plain cheap \\&quot;pharmacy grade\\</li>
            <li> As for the Evolution itself, it does dry hair quickly, though I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s necessarily faster than my Solerno.</li>
            <li> If you curl your hair around a barrel brush and pull it tight, then pull verrry slowly down to the ends while following it with the dryer, it will dry your hair far more efficiently and smoothly than if you had to deal with tons of wind blowing your hair all over the place.  </li>
            <li> The one we got came with no serial number as described in other reviews below, but it has been working extremely well and as advertised in that it dries hair significantly faster than our old Conair Yellowbird 2000 watt and leaves your hair feeling much softer.  </li>
            <li> I also like the little \\&quot;bling\\&quot; added to the handle of this special edition (SE) model.</li>
            <li> Please be aware that you&#x27;re taking a chance that it may not be authentic and it might fail,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mainly using the T3 Bespoke hair dryer for a back up.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t broken yet like other customers complain, gets nice and hot too.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;no need for the low setting as the high is perfect\\&quot;,</li>
            <li> The cool shot button works almost immediately and helps to set hair when using a round metal brush to curl ends.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the tourmaline or whatever that gives your hair that nice look and feel, so you can dry your hair at the lowest heat setting and it will turn out the same way and cause very little damage.     </li>
            <li> Quick dry, doesn&#x27;t dry out hair by over heating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, it delivers extremely hot heat that you could burn yourself if you leave it one area too long at the highest setting.  </li>
            <li> It cut my hair drying time in half and that is saying a lot because I have long fine hair</li>
            <li> Dried quickly</li>
            <li> First of all, let me warn you that if you are expecting this dryer to be anything like your old dryer you are going to be let down.  </li>
            <li> I was prepared to be disappointed in the T3 (could a hairdryer really be worth that much money?), but am totally satisfied.  </li>
            <li> It is quiet and does have several speeds/settings, and that&#x27;s a plus, but the truly stellar thing about it is that it actually seems to SET your hair in the style you create.</li>
            <li> I have a major probelm every time.  </li>
            <li> It is worth spending the extra couple of bucks over the other ones.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like my previous dryer, but I paid a lot more for the previous one.</li>
            <li> We have a high use home (several people use this dryer daily), so it gets quite a workout.  </li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> and I have no regrets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually gotten compliments on a 3 day old blowout.</li>
            <li> Wow, I cannot believe the difference between T3 Evolution and a regular $20 Conair dryer I used before.  </li>
            <li> But, look at it this way, you could buy 3 of these for the same price as the one from an \\&quot;authorized\\&quot; dealer with a warranty-and you would still have to pay $15+ to have it fixed if it breaks under the warranty.  </li>
            <li> I have used a real one and this is not a real one</li>
            <li> Would definitely not recommend in a professional setting.</li>
            <li> I have a Hana professional hair dryer that is ten times the hair dryer this one is.</li>
            <li> Once you get the knack of it, though, you will never want to go back to your old dryer again.  </li>
            <li> I took out the partially broken piece, and used it for a couple more weeks.</li>
            <li> The company wasn&#x27;t wanting to rectify the cracked fan blades, but was wanting more money from me for this poorly designed fan section of the dryer.  </li>
            <li> maybe it is an older model or maybe the company took an old one and fixed it..because the fan inside is a different color than all the other ones i&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> its still working so far, but t3&#x27;s can be very trick, you never know when they&#x27;ll just break down on you.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one, it will let you down when you need it most.</li>
            <li> Five years later, when it finally died, I began looking for a new one and that&#x27;s when I heard of the Evolution.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much quieter than my old dryer and cuts drying time in half.</li>
            <li> I emailed Amazon a few time before posting this, in order to give then a chance to make it right, but they offer no help at all.  </li>
            <li> Normally it takes her about 45 min to an hour to thoroughly dry her hair.</li>
            <li> The entire dryer vibrated and shook your entire arm, it was that LOUD!  </li>
            <li> Apparently does not dry out her hair; or the dogs hair for that matter.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is damaged, I try to let my hair air dry some before I use the blow dryer on, so I can&#x27;t say how this dryer works on wet hair right out of the shower.</li>
            <li> The T3 was priced much lower than other web sites.  </li>
            <li> and the evolution was a little heavy to hold over the top of my head for any length of time, so I switched.      </li>
            <li> the hair dryer works very well to dry hair fast without harsh heat.</li>
            <li> I broke down and shelled out for the T3 only after buying three cheaper hairdryers -- the first broke and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different hair dryers and usually spend less money on them.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the dryer I received was not the special edition shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> The cool button must be held down; personally, I don&#x27;t know why most hair dryers don&#x27;t come with a button that keeps the cold air going, but I am not an engineer.    </li>
            <li> since she&#x27;s been using the hair dryer, she really notice less split ends.</li>
            <li> Dries much faster than non-pro dryers, and leaves my hair much less frizzy too.</li>
            <li> She says that the dryer dries her hair quicker and leaves it soft and it doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  </li>
            <li> However, it does seem to quickly finish drying my hair (after I let it air dry some) without leaving my hair feeling too coarse or dried out.</li>
            <li> It blows very hot but not too hard</li>
            <li> i have super thick hair and tons of it..</li>
            <li> Price-wise, this blow dryer costs a bit more than I usually pay for blow dryers, but I did want a nicer one that would last and not be so harsh on my hair.</li>
            <li> It feels like it takes about 25% less time than my old dryer, which was also a professional ionic/ceramic dryer.     </li>
            <li> Again, the control this affords you in being able to hold the dryer at strange angles indefinitely without feeling awkward or tired is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I used to think that only a professional could dry the hair on the back of my head and style it well, but now I can do it myself to perfection with this dryer.  </li>
            <li> Compared to other dryers, yes, you can pay less, but these are worth the price.</li>
            <li> The price was too high for a hair dryer that lasted less than 2 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll swear it takes less time to dry my hair, although I haven&#x27;t estimated by how much.  </li>
            <li> I chose this model as a birthday gift based on rave reviews from other ladies on a blog I frequent.</li>
            <li> How can this dryer be 20000 watts when it is barely blowing out any air to even directly make it to my round brush</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember the last time that I left the house with a completely dry head of hair...</li>
            <li> I purchased my hairdryer through Amazon and within 9 months it flat out stopped working -- conveniently on the day that I was going to be a bridesmaid in a wedding.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t even have to use the flat iron to finish the straightening job.  </li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;ve turned off my flat iron permanently.</li>
            <li> I really hope it doesn&#x27;t break down any time soon, like the other reviews mentioned because there is no warranty...</li>
            <li> , is supposedly healthier for hair (mine is definitely less dry since using it!), and doesn&#x27;t blow my hair all over at the high setting -</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know why every one is making such a big deal about warranties and unauthorized reseller and other trivial matters when you are buying this product at a third of the price.  </li>
            <li> Had been trying to find a blowdryer that would not blow my hair all over but had enough heat to dry it.  </li>
            <li> I like the different heat settings because I use it to dry my dog</li>
            <li> and she needs a low heat blow dry.  </li>
            <li> If my hair dryer blows up, I can buy a new one and still have spent less money.</li>
            <li> Not only did this hair dryer take longer to dry than past professional dryers that I have owned, it burned my hair the two times I used it!  </li>
            <li> If all else fails and you can&#x27;t get a bonafide authorized model on the cheap, spring for a better/professional dryer in the $125 range.</li>
            <li> In 6 months it quit working completely and I contacted Amazon about it only to be told that it was past the 30 days.  </li>
            <li> Will be expected damage and low or no life expectancy.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it delivers such power that it has actually tripped the circuits in the bathroom a few times and sometimes cuts off if you have used it too long on the highest setting.</li>
            <li> I have medium long wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine-ish, straight-ish hair.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS CLEARLY NOT EVEN 1600 WATTS, so</li>
            <li> unlike with old hair dryers that left my hair feeling coarse, dry, and dull.  </li>
            <li> i used to cringe at the thought of the long chore of blow drying, but because my hair has a natural wave to it, if i don&#x27;t blow dry it after washing, it looks really messy and unkempt.  </li>
            <li> it used to take way too long to dry.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believed, only 6 months, only cold air now, totally no heat come out, dead so easily of this blow-dryer.</li>
            <li> this hair dryer takes about half the time (or less) to completely dry my hair as it did to use a normal hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer was a gift to my daughter, a lawyer with very long hair.  </li>
            <li> Her hair doesn&#x27;t look and feel as dry as compared to a cheaper hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to get an animal-specific dryer, because of his size, but I grew weary of waiting (forever) for him to dry with the dryer I was using.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the fastest hairdryer i have ever used, it&#x27;s expensive though, Worth it for me for $150</li>
            <li> I tried it out and frankly, it does not do a single thing that my cheapo Conair doesn&#x27;t do.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and I have no more frizzies, and my hair is so shiny.</li>
            <li> After it cools down some, it turns back on no problem.</li>
            <li> working- contacted discount jungle and was told to email dryer back for replacement- had to call several times and was told my dryer would be mailed out shortly or was on the way- one call was answered with \\&quot;it is no longer under warrenty\\&quot; - broken dryer mailed back to me with no explanation-</li>
            <li> The control buttons are in an awkward place on the grip of the handle and it is easy to accidentally turn the dryer off or change the speed or temperature.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for less than 2 years and this morning it BURNED my hair because the blower isn&#x27;t working properly.  </li>
            <li> Only caveat is that if you buy online for less than retail, Bespoke will not honor the warranty.</li>
            <li> Dry me hair within 10 sec, and my wife&#x27;s in 2 mins.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> With the other dryers, twenty plus minutes each to dry my girls hair now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lifetime being frustrated by not being able to replicate what my hair looks like at the salon at home.</li>
            <li> I spent the $300 for it.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer and was skeptical, but I figured it was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li> But I also bought an 1875 BioIonic dryer and it blows stronger and harder than this piece of garbage.  </li>
            <li> I had expected longer delivery time.  </li>
            <li> I have used it nearly everyday for the last 6 months and my hair has never looked this shiny.</li>
            <li> I knew it was not real thing, below is a response from the company:    </li>
            <li> For the money paid, expected the product to hold up longer.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it takes some getting used to the lack of wind because you are forced to handle your hair differently.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate - especially if you have unruly, curly, thick hair that takes a long time to dry.  </li>
            <li> Upon first use to dry my hair, the dryer failed.  </li>
            <li> It takes 12 minutes to round brush dry and style from start to finish for hair halfway down my back.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I rated this product 4 out of 5 stars is that these more expensive hair dryers have the same shelf life as the less expensive ones.</li>
            <li> My two daughters with hair down to their but dry their hair in my wife &amp; I&#x27;s master bedroom bath.</li>
            <li> Previous dryers she used resulted in dry, brittle and unmanageable hair without the use of a lot of hair spry.  </li>
            <li> I am trying my luck with Iso brand due to lifetime warranty.  </li>
            <li> What about other products?</li>
            <li> I usedto have to wash my hair every day (not healthy for the high-lift blonde that I am).</li>
            <li> First off, they sent me the wrong model.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;the\\&quot; Evolution and not some other model with the name Evolution  on it.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY from anyone other than a seller who can provide a warranty from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> So, that when the fan turned, the blades would swing out ever so slightly and drag against the plastic shield surrounding the fan.     </li>
            <li> It started not heating up as much in the last couple weeks, now it just blows cold air.</li>
            <li> It also annoyed other stylists because it was so loud.  </li>
            <li> and I used to color it a dark brown but stopped about 6 months ago.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say when I received the hairdryer I don&#x27;t even think it is a real T3 hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> and is expecting it to act like the average hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about this dryer is a small one and quite minor in the scheme of things.  </li>
            <li> I have mid-back length thick blonde hair which typically has the consistancy of cotton candy after I use a hair dryer...sticky and frizzy.</li>
            <li> One thing that is strange about this dryer (but not in a bad way) is that at first I thought I was seeing \\&quot;smoke\\&quot; rising from my hair when I used it.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t your typical 30 or 90 day warrenty.  </li>
            <li> It is lightweght, ergonomic, dries my hair in half the time and leaves it looking nicer.  </li>
            <li> I have black hair</li>
            <li> I got the hair dryer for half the retail price.</li>
            <li> The ionic ceramic tourmaline dryer is less damaging to hair.</li>
            <li> It cuts my drying time into less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> This dryer makes 70% less noise &amp; drys their hair in way way less than half the time.</li>
            <li> A warning was given to install the black mesh filter before using.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer at Amazon in order to get it for $125 less than the MSR.  </li>
            <li> I had less frizz</li>
            <li> It eliminates friz and drys your hair in half the time.</li>
            <li> This dryer was wrapped in a black plastic bag (looked like a garbage bag) and the serial number didn&#x27;t match at all.</li>
            <li> I feel so much less stressed out using this dryer, too.  </li>
            <li> I too bought this dryer and in less than 3 months the dryer was not working.</li>
            <li> My husband got me this expensive blow dryer for Christmas after hearing me complain how long it takes to dry my long hair..</li>
            <li> they sell the Bespoke dryer, to see if the salespeople there could help me to remove the end so that I could install the little black mesh.  </li>
            <li> (it dried my short/medium length hair in less than 1.5 minutes.</li>
            <li> and after a little research I bought this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> However,  although I tried to remove the area indicated by the little arrow on the dryer...I was unsuccessful.  </li>
            <li> This baby plus a little mousse work wonders.  </li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t turn on, just went dead.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $ or time.</li>
            <li> Finally, one  stylist revealed the secret as being the dryer itself.  </li>
            <li> They have wasted my money, time and now I have to return this piece of garbage.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s supposed to make your hair fluffy though.</li>
            <li> Losers.</li>
            <li> worrying that I am destroying it by using without the filter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ....am I missing something......</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I need hair dryers like this to make my hair presentable, as the curl is unmanageable, unless dried with this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> When I went to register the product I couldn&#x27;t because the sticker on the box that has the serial # was missing.</li>
            <li> and they were all a waste of money compared to this one.    </li>
            <li> the second two were unusable because the diffuser attachments were useless and blew my curly hair all over the place, making a mess of it.  </li>
            <li> This dryer stopped working within 6 months of purchase which is very unfortunate given how much it costs.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that can take up to an hour to dry.</li>
            <li> only a few people thinks that their dryer is a fake?  </li>
            <li> It cut my drying time in at least half.</li>
            <li> Secondly, I believe it was a fake.  </li>
            <li> Ordered my blowdryer, got it, knew it was fake almost instantly</li>
            <li> The thing I read about it being hard to get to the buttons</li>
            <li> any one who thinks that you&#x27;d get a $300 product for $100 with no strings attached is simply naive.  </li>
            <li> Then when I wanted to returne it they said they will be 15% restucking fee which sounds really sucks.</li>
            <li> My least concern was this</li>
            <li> almost every negative review is because of this.</li>
            <li> I bought it and I am dissappointed with as its so slow.</li>
            <li> I often see women with \\&quot;thick curly hair\\</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s that mean?</li>
            <li> I was unable to keep this product due to the fact that the products box was not sealed and there was not a serial code attached to the hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other expensive dryers that women rave about</li>
            <li> Also be warned about the serial number missing!!</li>
            <li> but was tired of NOISY, HEAVY hairdriers!  </li>
            <li> When I contacted T3 they informed me that Amazon was not authorised to sell this product but they would make an exception and for a total cost of $50.00 they would replace my very expensive dryer.    </li>
            <li> Personally, when I have seen bad reviews of this dryer I think it&#x27;s because the person hasn&#x27;t learned how to use it yet</li>
            <li> I have long wavy hair that gets impossibly frizzy in hot/humid weather</li>
            <li> It (sadly) has no magic powers.  </li>
            <li> I have used Amazon but never knew of this dirty little secret.</li>
            <li> I opened it up and one of the blades had broken inside.  </li>
            <li> And it hasn&#x27;t broken yet.</li>
            <li> i am not happy with this company and would not order from them</li>
            <li> I mean a bunch of weird cowlicks.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon because of all the bad experiences with the warranty from other buyers.</li>
            <li> This sucks!!</li>
            <li> something about it is weird.</li>
            <li> and I think unless something is outrageously expensive, she gets it in her head</li>
            <li> I will be sticking with the Elchim line, which I thought was outrageously expensive at $130 but now seems like a bargain.</li>
            <li> But unfortunately, in just under a year, it fizzed out on me this weekend.</li>
            <li> it was a fake.  </li>
            <li> I called them and told them it was fake</li>
            <li> because I called them out for being fake.</li>
            <li> They too were unable to manage the procedure.</li>
            <li> the owner of the salon and my stylist also were unable to manage the procedure.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if somethng changed, or if those reviewers were just looking in the wrong place for the serial number, but mine had everything needed in order to register it with no problems.</li>
            <li> I knew something was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Scary.</li>
            <li> My wife opened it and began using it the day it arrived, so I never had a chance to dispute Bespoke Labs shipping me the wrong item.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived very poorly packed.  </li>
            <li> It is in fact dangerous as when the fan blades crack, then the smell and the noise could create a fire inside the dryer.  </li>
            <li> With the Featherweight, you have two heat choices, flame thrower or cold.     </li>
            <li> Plus, I paid 200 for a dryer where the cold button i have to \\&quot;hold down\\&quot;???  </li>
            <li> I bought this for salon use and it was a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is a fake!</li>
            <li> I was very angry to hear that the T3 dryer I purchased is not covered under warranty because I purchased it through amazon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very expensive machine.  </li>
            <li> Highly disappointed that I fell for a fake!</li>
            <li> I purchase tons of things on Amazon - I was disappointed to hear of the others having issues since Amazon is not an Authorized T3 retailer.  </li>
            <li> I feel stupid for having fallen for this nonsense.</li>
            <li> it is worthless.</li>
            <li> I am appalled that this company would sell a non-working product and then charge its customers to return them.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with my purchase![[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the below, however since my hair dryer blew out I kept the item even through</li>
            <li> After about a year of use, I started smelling burning plastic and the fan was making terrible noise.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> over the years of working in salons, my own included, i have had many dryers. i like working with this as it is extremely light weight and dries the hair very fast and almost frizz free. excellant product for the professional stylist</li>
            <li> This dryer is amazing.</li>
            <li> Beware buying this product through AMAZON.com  The 4 year warranty doesn&#x27;t apply.  I&#x27;ve had mine for less than 2 years and this morning it BURNED my hair because the blower isn&#x27;t working properly.  Had I purchased it elsewhere I would have the warranty available to me.</li>
            <li> this hair dryer has changed my life.. i have super thick hair and tons of it.. i used to cringe at the thought of the long chore of blow drying, but because my hair has a natural wave to it, if i don&#x27;t blow dry it after washing, it looks really messy and unkempt.  this hair dryer takes about half the time (or less) to completely dry my hair as it did to use a normal hair dryer.  not only that.. but my hair feels SO soft and smooth and is shiny and silky.. unlike with old hair dryers that left my hair feeling coarse, dry, and dull.  it&#x27;s the tourmaline or whatever that gives your hair that nice look and feel, so you can dry your hair at the lowest heat setting and it will turn out the same way and cause very little damage.     i don&#x27;t know why every one is making such a big deal about warranties and unauthorized reseller and other trivial matters when you are buying this product at a third of the price.  you get what you pay for.. any one who thinks that you&#x27;d get a $300 product for $100 with no strings attached is simply naive.  my advice if you&#x27;re really worried... try it out for a couple weeks.. if you love it and NEED the warranty.. return it and buy the real deal for 300 bucks at sephora.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer came quickly with no issues.  So far, my wife really enjoy the system.  since she&#x27;s been using the hair dryer, she really notice less split ends.</li>
            <li> I love this T3 hair dryer - it is lightweight and dries your hair very fast.  It&#x27;s just like my previous dryer, but I paid a lot more for the previous one.</li>
            <li> I decided to go ahead and buy from Amazon since the 5-star ratings far exceeded the negatives.  Got it about 15 months ago, and totally loved it. It was light and quiet and fast. I have medium length, super thick, baby fine, curly hair.  About a month ago, it started getting louder. Then it just stopped. I opened it up and one of the blades had broken inside.  I have never dropped this, and it ALWAYS goes back in the drawer...I even wrap and secure the cord every time. I took out the partially broken piece, and used it for a couple more weeks. However, its even louder now, like a jet engine and vibrates ferociously. Never again! I thought I was buying a great hair dryer that would last me for years. HAHA!</li>
            <li> The professional place that i bought my t3 from before stopped selling them, so i had to get one online..the price was right so i took a chance. its still working so far, but t3&#x27;s can be very trick, you never know when they&#x27;ll just break down on you. The only thing that makes me nervous is that it doesn&#x27;t quite look authentic..something about it is weird. maybe it is an older model or maybe the company took an old one and fixed it..because the fan inside is a different color than all the other ones i&#x27;ve seen. and all of the print on it is starting to smudge off. but hey, as long as it still works i&#x27;m fine with that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these hairdryers. The first lasted a good eight years and finally wore out with daily use. It&#x27;s extremely light and I would buy another!</li>
            <li> It arrived quick and worked as stated. It&#x27;s much quieter than my old dryer and cuts drying time in half. This item cost $200 in a store and I got it for around $65...very happy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hairdrier after reading the reviews from Consumer Reports - rated in the top 2.  I tried to find locally, but couldn&#x27;t find any from this manufacturer...but was tired of NOISY, HEAVY hairdriers!  This one works great, has multiple temperature settings and is quiet and light - with an extra long cord to boot.  It is also very attractively styled.  No regrets.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer as a Christmas present for my girlfreind.  She says its the best hair dryer she has ever owned.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the fastest hairdryer i have ever used, it&#x27;s expensive though, Worth it for me for $150 but I&#x27;m not sure it would be worth the full cost of $300</li>
            <li> I too liked this hair dryer very much.  However, I know exactly where the serial number should have been (there is a place on the front of the box so it can be peeled off and applied for warrenty registration) and it had been removed or never applied.  This isn&#x27;t your typical 30 or 90 day warrenty.  It has a 4 year warrenty and for a hair dryer at this price, that is worth something.  Amazon was great about the return, but if I had known for sure that a warrenty was not going to be included, I would never have ordered it from them.  I would have opted to pay more money.</li>
            <li> Amazing.  I didn&#x27;t know a good hairdryer could make such a difference.  I broke down and shelled out for the T3 only after buying three cheaper hairdryers -- the first broke and the second two were unusable because the diffuser attachments were useless and blew my curly hair all over the place, making a mess of it.  I finally decided it was time to invest in something better.  I was prepared to be disappointed in the T3 (could a hairdryer really be worth that much money?), but am totally satisfied.  It is lightweght, ergonomic, dries my hair in half the time and leaves it looking nicer.  Best of all, the diffuser works great significantly improves the look of my curls.      One caveat:  I shopped around and managed to get one of these for about $115.  At that price, it&#x27;s worth the money, but I would never cough up the $300 MSP for the thing.</li>
            <li> I was impressed the first time I used this hairdryer. It cut my drying time in at least half. And it was alot smoother.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product. I bought this for my girlfriend who has very long and beautiful blonde hair. Normally it takes her about 45 min to an hour to thoroughly dry her hair. With this it takes 15-20 min. In addition, her ai ends up softer then ever. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer, but when I recieved it and try it was not as powerful as i thought it would be . Then when I wanted to returne it they said they will be 15% restucking fee which sounds really sucks. If I did not open to try it how do I know that is work for me or not.I would never ever buy anything frome discount jungle.</li>
            <li> Very ergonomic. And plus, made such a great difference to my hair! It dries faster and feels so much softer after.</li>
            <li> I purchased my hairdryer through Amazon and within 9 months it flat out stopped working -- conveniently on the day that I was going to be a bridesmaid in a wedding. It wouldn&#x27;t turn on, just went dead. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one, it will let you down when you need it most.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anything about blow-drying hair, but the lady who I got this for says this is great, that it doesn&#x27;t damage the hair while blow-drying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about 2 months and I really like it.  My hair is fine and very long, but stylists like to say that I have a very high number of follicles per square inch meaning that I just have a lot of hair.  I used to have the Andis Ionic Ceramic hairdryer but after about 3 years that one burned out.  I think hair dryers are like TVs because the biggest improvement is seen when you upgrade from the old version to the High Def TV or Ionic/Ceramic hair dryer; however, once you do upgrade only the slightest differences can be seen between in higher level models.    I do not think my hair dries much faster with the T3 than the Andis Ionic Ceramic, maybe 10% faster.  It is much much much quieter though, and it gets my hair really hot when I have it on the highest setting.  The cool shot button is GREAT, it actually blows cool air.  My previous hair dryer still blew warm air when i used the cool button so i never used it.  It does make my hair nice and shiny and soft (but that also may be attributed to the Biosilk Cure product I&#x27;ve been using).  I have black hair and I used to color it a dark brown but stopped about 6 months ago.  For some reason, maybe it&#x27;s the way this hair dryer smooths the cuticle, people think the lighter coloring at the ends is natural.    Overall, this is a good hair dryer.  I would have been pissed if I paid $300 for it, but I think it&#x27;s worth what I paid (as long as it continues to work and doesn&#x27;t burn out on me :-)</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying a 2000 watt dryer, per the product review on Amazon. But printed on the dryer itself is \\&quot;1600\\&quot; watts.  It works fine, but doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much power as my old dryer, which was 1875. When I wrote to the seller, asking about the discrepancy between the product review and what&#x27;s printed on the dryer, they said:     This dryer is 2000watts. The 1600 that shows on the hair dryer is the power consumption. It is not the watts on the hair dryer. oNce again this hair dryer is 2000watts.  Thank you  Omni Solutions      Baloney?</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer because Amazon was the only place it wasn&#x27;t out of stock. When I rec&#x27;d it in the mail it looked nothing like the picture. I went on Bespoke Labs to sign up for the warranty &amp; they said it was being sold through an unauthorized dealer. I spent the $300 for it. I shipped it back hoping they will credit my account. If I&#x27;m buying something that xpensive it better be the real thing. This dryer wasn&#x27;t. I could tell because Bespoke&#x27;s name was only found on the box...not the dryer at all. Highly disappointed that I fell for a fake! I know how to wait until the product become available at an authorized dealer. Bespoke Labs warranty on this dryer is 4 yrs. if you go on their site. Amazon&#x27;s is only 60 days. Don&#x27;t waste your $ or time. It&#x27;s like buying a knock off Louis in New York City. Don&#x27;t do it!</li>
            <li> This works. It replaces another that was essentially the same that worked for 8 years, perfectly and almost every day, and now is getting a little hitch when it turns on. If I get the same value out of this one I am a  happy camper!</li>
            <li> Upon first use to dry my hair, the dryer failed.  So I really don&#x27;t know if it is the best dryer according to customer rating.  I elected to return for a full refund and went with a SuperSolano 3600.</li>
            <li> Product arrived very poorly packed.  The item was purchased new but looks like a refurbished/used blow dryer.  Will be expected damage and low or no life expectancy.  Would like a new one!  Very disappointed with my purchase![[ASIN:B000LQB5YS T3 Bespoke Labs 83888-SE Special Edition Evolution Professional Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline Hair Dryer]]</li>
            <li> I purchased this hairdryer for my wife in Christmas of 2009 for around $125.  The dryer no longer heats up and the warranty was only good for a year.  I will not purchase this product again.  The price was too high for a hair dryer that lasted less than 2 years.  I am trying my luck with Iso brand due to lifetime warranty.  When the hairdryer did work, my wife loved it.  That is why I gave a 2 rating rather 1.  Maybe being I a guy I don&#x27;t understand, but when I spend more than a $100 on a product, I expect it to last more than 2 years.</li>
            <li> The T3 was sold as new. At best it is a refurb., definitely used. The box on the outside specifically says to look for the serial number tag. There is no serial number so no warrantee. The packaging on the inside looks like it has been dragged through a parking lot. This is going back.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was recommended by my hair stylist. It would cost $200 at a retail store. She suggested I check on Amazon for a better price. I got the hair dryer for half the retail price. The ionic ceramic tourmaline dryer is less damaging to hair. The best thing is that it&#x27;s quiet for a blow dryer ... more of a hum than a high pitch whistle of some blow dryers.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that can take up to an hour to dry. This drier has cut down that time and is very light  weight. So far so good.</li>
            <li> This is my third T3.  The Special Edition comes with a shorter cord.  This is fine for home use; in fact, it might be better not having and 8 ft cord.  This blow dryer is the best I have ever used and the price is less that inferior dryers.</li>
            <li> After about a year of use, I started smelling burning plastic and the fan was making terrible noise.  Opening up the rear of the dryer, I could see that the four fan blades had cracked where they attach to the shaft.  So, that when the fan turned, the blades would swing out ever so slightly and drag against the plastic shield surrounding the fan.     I contacted the company, T3, and they were not helpful.  I could purchase another one, new or refurbrished I don&#x27;t know, for around $70.00.  I asked if I could purchase the fan blade part to replace the cracked one that I have, and he said no they don&#x27;t do that.    Therefore, I can&#x27;t recommend this hair dryer to anyone.  It is in fact dangerous as when the fan blades crack, then the smell and the noise could create a fire inside the dryer.  The company wasn&#x27;t wanting to rectify the cracked fan blades, but was wanting more money from me for this poorly designed fan section of the dryer.  This hair dryer is a safety hazard.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer just stopped working 2 years after I purchased it.  If I had bought it by an \\&quot;Authorized Dealer\\&quot; it would have come with a 5 year warranty.  I have been buying stuff from Amazon for years and never realized that something like this would happen.  Starting to have 2nd thought of purchasing anything through Amazon again.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I was able to get it for such a great price.  This is my 2nd T3 dryer.  This one is so much lighter.  Love it..</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believed, only 6 months, only cold air now, totally no heat come out, dead so easily of this blow-dryer. Total disappoint that from Amazon&#x27;s warranty policy, no factory warranty? What&#x27;s that mean? Where are Amazon&#x27;s stock come from? What about other products?</li>
            <li> I purchased this hairdryer from Amazon.com in September, 2009.  I tried it out and frankly, it does not do a single thing that my cheapo Conair doesn&#x27;t do.  It dries hair.  That&#x27;s all.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair look any more special than any other hair dryer does.  It (sadly) has no magic powers.  It just dries hair.  End of story.  All I can think of is The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes. I feel stupid for having fallen for this nonsense. If you feel like you are doing something better for your hair because you spent this kind of money, then by all means, go for it.  But, please keep this in mind; I have nothing to gain or lose by writing or not writing this review.</li>
            <li> Under no circumstances should a hair blowdryer have a heat setting hot enough to singe your hair OFF. I now have sections of hair that have been burned off. Also, when I put my hair in a ponytail, I have hundreds of tiny short hairs sticking up because hairs were burned off. I also got 2 third degree burns on my skin.     I purchased the Featherweight first, took it back for the Evolution (thought maybe with more settings it would be ok). That&#x27;s when I noticed my hair has been singed off. With the Featherweight, you have two heat choices, flame thrower or cold.     The hottest setting on the Evolution is the one that singed my hair off. The medium setting, isn&#x27;t quite hot enough to get my hair straight. So, back this one is going too.     For what it&#x27;s worth, my sister RAVED about this dryer and she bought the Evolution, AND the Featherweight, AND the travel one. She is made of money though and I think unless something is outrageously expensive, she gets it in her head it is worthless. Also, she always uses the diffuser and always does the curly look (probably on cool).     I will be sticking with the Elchim line, which I thought was outrageously expensive at $130 but now seems like a bargain. I&#x27;m going for the Da Vinci model by Elchim this time. All the best salons use Elchim. It&#x27;s funny that $130 seems like a deal for a blowdryer now.     I purchased mine at Sephora. So, this review is nothing against Amazon. Just want to get the word out there about this product.</li>
            <li> I am a self-professed beauty junkie. If it&#x27;s touted by the big-wigs as being fabulous I&#x27;m sure to hop on the gravy train and at least give it a try. Heck, SOMETHING besides botox has to be keeping the 40 year old stars looking 20. That said, I really am as objective as possible, and when a product just doesn&#x27;t do what it promises, I&#x27;ll tell it like I see it and send it back.     Anyway, before I review this product I should first say that my hair dryer prior to this one was a Super Solerno--also a professional dryer--that I paid $125 for. I just can&#x27;t stress enough the difference a great blow dryer makes when doing one&#x27;s hair. For years I&#x27;ve asked various hair stylists why their blowouts were so much better than mine at home. They&#x27;ll all tell you it&#x27;s the products they use.   Of course, they&#x27;re trying to sell you the products.   So I buy em.   It ain&#x27;t the products.   Undaunted, I kept prodding. Finally, one  stylist revealed the secret as being the dryer itself.  When I finally accpted the fact that no $10-$45 drugstore hair dryer could work the magic, I sprang for the Solerno and never looked back. It just makes such a difference. Five years later, when it finally died, I began looking for a new one and that&#x27;s when I heard of the Evolution. Becuase of the negetive/sketchy reviews about the one&#x27;s sold through Amazon I decided to get it elsewhere but must stress that I paid $125 for the dryer. Does it live up to the promise? Absolutley and I have no regrets. Would I have paid $300 for it? Absolutley not. Not becuase I&#x27;m not crazy enough to spend that kind of money, but because I&#x27;ve seen enough GOOD dryers to know you don&#x27;t need to spend that much to get a quality dryer.     As for the Evolution itself, it does dry hair quickly, though I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s necessarily faster than my Solerno. It is quiet and does have several speeds/settings, and that&#x27;s a plus, but the truly stellar thing about it is that it actually seems to SET your hair in the style you create. I usedto have to wash my hair every day (not healthy for the high-lift blonde that I am). Now I can get away with going several days becuase the blow out LASTS and looks great for days! I&#x27;ve actually gotten compliments on a 3 day old blowout. Fantastic! I&#x27;ve never expereinced that before. (To get this effect I always use the \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; after I get the look I want. I read that it sets the style and this really seems to work.)     So I guess the only issue is the price tag. $300? Insane. If you&#x27;re contemplating this dryer, GET IT. You won&#x27;t regret it. Just make sure it&#x27;s through an authorized retailer (it&#x27;s the only way the company will warranty it). And get it on sale. I got mine through one of the authorized retailers who advertises \\&quot;meeting any competitor&#x27;s price\\&quot; so I finagled the sale that way, obviously quoting any one of the lower prices you can find online. They confirm it, and it&#x27;s yours.      Overall, it&#x27;s a wonderful dryer and WELL worth the $125 I paid for it. It&#x27;s seriously my new favorite thing. But be smart if you&#x27;re going to take the leap: make sure it&#x27;s the REAL DEAL (able to be warranteed) and make sure it&#x27;s on sale!! If all else fails and you can&#x27;t get a bonafide authorized model on the cheap, spring for a better/professional dryer in the $125 range. the Solerno and the Elchim are great dryers that you just can&#x27;t go wrong with. Happy styling!</li>
            <li> While this hairdryer worked, it was great. But unfortunately, in just under a year, it fizzed out on me this weekend. The hot air went from hot to warm and by Saturday, sparks flew and the only setting is cold. I have a lot of hair. I don&#x27;t think it is a compliment to this hyped up product when  my working hairdryer is the one I bought for $40 and is still running after years of use.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer and was skeptical, but I figured it was worth a shot.  First off, they sent me the wrong model.  Secondly, I believe it was a fake.  Either that or a defect.  The dryer was SOOOO LOUD (and I&#x27;ve had a CHI hair dryer before, so I know they&#x27;re usually very quiet).  The entire dryer vibrated and shook your entire arm, it was that LOUD!  I have a very strong feeling it was a fake.  I was able to get my money back and for that I gave it 2 stars, but I had to pay for shipping and waste my time going to the post office. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> this product has been awesome so far. it dries my hair quicker than regular dryers. love it!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend who always has good hair. I bought it and I am dissappointed with as its so slow. I thought since I was paying so much it would be quicker &amp; better. I don&#x27;t personally like it that much. You need to have a lot of time and patience - and for that you can probably get good hair with any priced dryer.</li>
            <li> I was unable to keep this product due to the fact that the products box was not sealed and there was not a serial code attached to the hair dryer.  This code is necessary in order to register it for it&#x27;s 5 yr warranty.  When I informed Amazon of this problem, they sent me another one, and this too did not have a seal and bar code.  This only leads me to wonder where are these dryers coming from?</li>
            <li> I had short hair my whole life until I decided to grow it out a few years ago. Since then I just thought that drying your hair took ages and was a nightmare. Then I got a job with a 2-hour commute and my free time become a lot scarcer and more valuable and eventually I determined to do something about the two hours I had to spend in the bathroom every Sunday evening... and after a little research I bought this hair dryer.  After all those years of inherited, used and just plain cheap \\&quot;pharmacy grade\\&quot; hair dryers, my eyes were opened. Quite honestly I haven&#x27;t a clue whether this rates as a good hair dryer amongst quality hair-dryers, but I have slightly wavy blonde hair past my shoulders and this thing dries it beautifully, quickly, smoothly - and leaves you in total control.  And it hasn&#x27;t broken yet. So, I love it, and I would buy another. Well worth the money. I can&#x27;t even remember how much it was.</li>
            <li> This is everything that they say it is-it is the best of the best. Quick dry, doesn&#x27;t dry out hair by over heating. It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is the best dryer I have ever used. I have frizzy, thick, wavy hair but not in a good way! By wavy I mean a bunch of weird cowlicks. I&#x27;ve spent a lifetime being frustrated by not being able to replicate what my hair looks like at the salon at home. This dryer is the trick!! I just used it for the first time! My hair is smooth, soft, shiny and best of all straight! I didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon because of all the bad experiences with the warranty from other buyers. I bought it from Sephora for the 5 year warranty. It&#x27;s more expensive but I felt with the five year warranty it was worth it. I&#x27;ve only had it one day, but feel it&#x27;s one of the best beauty investments I&#x27;ve ever made!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hairdryer after reading all the reviews that Amazon wasn&#x27;t an authorized retailer for the T3 hairdryer, but I wasn&#x27;t too concerned since it was such a good price.  Needless to say when I received the hairdryer I don&#x27;t even think it is a real T3 hairdryer.  There is no serial number on the box and no serial number on the hairdryer.  I went to Sephora and purchased another one with serial number on the box and a silver tape with serial number looped around the cord of the hairdryer.  The amazon dryer was VERY loud compared to the one that I purchased at Sephora.  The amazon dryer also blew a lot more air than the one purchased from Sephora.  This really makes me question the integrity of Amazon&#x27;s practices.  I have been eyeing a new DSLR camera that just dropped below $1,000 on Amazon and am wondering if it will be the real deal or a knock off too?</li>
            <li> Had been trying to find a blowdryer that would not blow my hair all over but had enough heat to dry it.  this one works!  my hair stylist recommended it.  Yeah, it was $100, but so far it has been worth it.  Love the long cord also.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.  It dries your hair faster as it claims and is light weight for holding.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> I bought this blow dryer from Amazon which sells it through Discount Jungle and as soon as I received it, it would not turn on. I contacted the vendor and I was told that if I wanted to return it, I would be charged a restocking fee. I am appalled that this company would sell a non-working product and then charge its customers to return them. Will definitely never purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase my dryer from Amazon - however after 2years it just stopped working.  Thank goodness I purchased from authorized retailer - I had no issues with the warranty process &amp; received a replacement dryer from T3 (although it did take a couple weeks).  This is a great dryer, I am very happy with it&#x27;s performance &amp; the warranty process - I rated low to warn Amazon shoppers to make sure when you purchase this item the serial # tag is afixed to the cord - it is absolutely necessary for a warranty situation.  I purchase tons of things on Amazon - I was disappointed to hear of the others having issues since Amazon is not an Authorized T3 retailer.  Make sure you do your research on this one before you decide where to purchase. I would definitely recommend the product itself.</li>
            <li> So far , its been great. I hope that it will withstand years of use.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this item again from Amazon.  This dryer stopped working within 6 months of purchase which is very unfortunate given how much it costs.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for a gift and the person I gave it to keeps thanking me for the purchase. Suppose to be one of the best out there.</li>
            <li> the hair dryer works very well to dry hair fast without harsh heat. you can see the difference in stying compared to a traditional hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer! I have very thick naturally curly hair, but not the good kind...the kind that looks like I&#x27;ve been playing with electricity.  So I have been blowing my hair out straight since high school.  This process used to take atleast 30 minutes or more. I am not the kind of person who spends $100 on a beauty product, but once I tried this hair dryer there was no going back.  The high wattage is a must!  It cuts my drying time into less than 10 minutes. The cool shot button works almost immediately and helps to set hair when using a round metal brush to curl ends. The ultra thin nozzle assures no flyaways, giving a smooth and polished look.  When i first started using this hair dryer, my friends thought I had just come from the salon. I havent been to a salon for a blowout since buying this hair dryer. The only reason I rated this product 4 out of 5 stars is that these more expensive hair dryers have the same shelf life as the less expensive ones. They typically only last about a year.  But for me, $100 a year it worth it to have beautiful hair year round, and its still cheaper than the beauty salon.</li>
            <li> I will never buy another brand of hair dryer.  This one is light weight, ergonomically designed, delivers just the right amount of heat/\\&quot;blow\\&quot; for each setting.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Ok Here goes. I will explain why this hair dryer is amazing not the circumstances. My two daughters with hair down to their but dry their hair in my wife &amp; I&#x27;s master bedroom bath. They get up in the morning about 1.5 hours before we do, to go to school. For years the last hour of our sleep was inturupted and we might as well have gotten up with them. This dryer makes 70% less noise &amp; drys their hair in way way less than half the time. The air velocity &amp; heat is not matched by anything out there. Trust me I have bought them all, looking for some peace &amp; quiet in the morning. The velocity alone is triple that of any I have ever seen and the fact that at this air output you can still melt plastic (within 1 inch). They drop this thing every day, yes I hear it even over the use noise and it take a beating. I love this hair dryer even though I used it only 1 time (it dried my short/medium length hair in less than 1.5 minutes. With the other dryers, twenty plus minutes each to dry my girls hair now twenty minutes maybe total. I love this dryer and I only used it once.</li>
            <li> Price-wise, this blow dryer costs a bit more than I usually pay for blow dryers, but I did want a nicer one that would last and not be so harsh on my hair. I&#x27;ve been using this blow dryer for a month now, and so far I&#x27;m happy with it. Because my hair is damaged, I try to let my hair air dry some before I use the blow dryer on, so I can&#x27;t say how this dryer works on wet hair right out of the shower. However, it does seem to quickly finish drying my hair (after I let it air dry some) without leaving my hair feeling too coarse or dried out. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I have owned a T3 hairdryer for over 7 years now.  The first model I owned was the \\&quot;evolution\\&quot; model ($300 retail) and used it for 5 years.  I still have it and it works.  I replaced it with the feather weight model only because I had back surgery and the evolution was a little heavy to hold over the top of my head for any length of time, so I switched.      The feather weight is an excellent hairdryer - my hair is extremely thick and curly.  This dryer dries it from completely wet to dry, smooth and straight in 12 minutes and I have A LOT of hair.  I recommend using the attachment to concentrate the airflow exactly where you want it.  I only take the attachment off when I want to simply blow the water out of my hair before styling it - then I put the attachment back on.    Don&#x27;t hesitate - especially if you have unruly, curly, thick hair that takes a long time to dry.  This one shortens the time, smooths the hair shaft, and straightens great.  I also use John Frieda products (especially the hairspray for curly hair) as well - the hairspray will keep your hair straight for one day - and that is a true fact!</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer HOWEVER after owning it for 22 months (not quite 2 years) it seems to have a short in it...so of course I contact the manufacturer T3 only to find out that amazon is NOT an \\&quot;AUTHORIZED\\&quot; retailer of the T3 products.....excuse me...WTF?  However they were kind enough to say they would replace it for a $$ fee $$    Beware- where are these dryers coming from and why is Amazon still selling them if they are not an authorized retailer?  Hmm  ***UPDATE***  Although Amazon may not be an authorized retailer...please be sure to specify to T3 (if for some reason you have to return or register your product) that your dryer WAS purchased through Sephora/Amazon...in which case Sephora IS AN AUTHORIZED RESELLER of these dryers.  It makes a huge difference!    ***still love my dryer though!***</li>
            <li> The on off switch gets in the way of holding the handle and it often turns off while I am using it.</li>
            <li> The dryer works ok - nothing special but there was no registration card in the box so I called the manufacturer.  They said the warranty is void since Amazon is not an authorized dealer.  I would like to have known that. So far as I know what I received is a knock off of the real thing.  In addition there was no receipt in the box.</li>
            <li> I just paid 189.00 for this hair dryer on another site (not Amazon) because I read the reviews Amazon is NOT an authorized dealer and the problems people had with this dryer and returning it (or warranty, whatever).  My least concern was this I just wanted to be sure I was getting \\&quot;the\\&quot; Evolution and not some other model with the name Evolution  on it.  First, OMG..what /who are these people on here giving this hair dryer such rave reviews?  This dryer is NOT EVEN 1600 WATTS!!!!!!!!!!@!!!!!!!!!!!!!  How can anyone say \\&quot;best hair dryer ever\\&quot;. \\&quot;no need for the low setting as the high is perfect\\&quot;, blah blah.  I am convinced that I can no longer go by reviews on here. This dryer is in NO WAY 2000 watts.  I can hold the nozzle (with the nozzle on which is more extreme air flow) right to my skin and my sking doesnt even get close to warm.  How can this dryer be 20000 watts when it is barely blowing out any air to even directly make it to my round brush and it doesnt burn my skin at all directly up against my skin on the highest setting, which is supposed to be Hot?  This is in now way hot, no way 20000 watts, I dont even think this is 1600.  What are all you people thinking to write reveiws with a dryer that is no stronger than a conair at CVS?  I cannot in good conscious keep a dryer that I paid almost 200 for where my vidal sassoon dryer gives off more air flow.  I have NO RESPECT for a company that LIES to every one, puts out a dryer that is even in the news and yet sells top popele the EXACT OPPOSITE&gt;?  Why are not you all saying the truth.  I have the dryer.  It is not even 1600 watts and that is no lie.  Plus, I paid 200 for a dryer where the cold button i have to \\&quot;hold down\\&quot;???  The cheaper dryers, yes.  But I also bought an 1875 BioIonic dryer and it blows stronger and harder than this piece of garbage.  AND its cool button stays cool without holding it down.  The only positive of this dryer is light weight.  But I can get that at the local drug store for 30.00  Pleaswe people, THINK before you write reviews and be honest.  I have to believe these sites are deceptive becau8se I have the dryer, I used it and it is clearly and no mistake or even \\&quot;maybe\\&quot;..THIS IS CLEARLY NOT EVEN 1600 WATTS, so light air flow I thought my electric ay be the problem.  So light it didnt burn my skin on highest hot setting up agaqinst my arm.  Are you kidding me people?  This is NOT A DRYER WORTH $50.00.  DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE and I for one will never EVER trust this company again. They have wasted my money, time and now I have to return this piece of garbage.  I can&#x27;t believe the LIE of telling people waht a great piece of workmanship?  What is so great?  It is light, plastic, 1600 watt cheap deryer.  That&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> yeah this dryer definitely does dry faster than others and it comes with the top skinny thing which u can take off and make a regular hair dryer. also came with spray, but i havent tried it yet. it&#x27;s supposed to make your hair fluffy though. yeah i guess its worth it!? idk i bought it..</li>
            <li> This is a great dryer. We have a high use home (several people use this dryer daily), so it gets quite a workout.  It is light and powerful which is nice and not too loud either.</li>
            <li> My purchase arrived just a couple of days later!  I had expected longer delivery time.  The T3 was priced much lower than other web sites.  It is light weight and has a little bling on the handle.    Dried quickly and I am thrilled to get the lower price for the exact same product listed elsewhere.  Thanks for quality products at lower price and excellent delivery.  Who says a Grandma can&#x27;t be cool with a new blinged out T3?</li>
            <li> I have mid-back length thick blonde hair which typically has the consistancy of cotton candy after I use a hair dryer...sticky and frizzy. After using the t3, this is no longer a problem.  The next morning when I ran my brush through it, it didn&#x27;t so much as snag.   As for the warranty issue, it should come as no surprise...almost every negative review is because of this. I would rather chance $100 without a warranty than pay $200 more for one.  If my hair dryer blows up, I can buy a new one and still have spent less money.</li>
            <li> I was very angry to hear that the T3 dryer I purchased is not covered under warranty because I purchased it through amazon. T3 charges $14.95 to repair but wanted to charge me $54.95 because I purchased from amazon. Do not purchase if you care about the warranty, and you may need it as my dryer stopped working about 16 months.</li>
            <li> Bought dryer as christmas present for my wife. She loves it. Good features, quick dry and its really quiet compared to her previous one (love that part).</li>
            <li> Hair dryer was amazing until it started to struggle and make sounds after 2 months of use and completely stopped / broke at 6 months. Contacting the company direct for a replacement since Amazon could not help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$135 is too much to pay for a hair dryer that lasts 6 months,... even if it was amazing when it worked!</li>
            <li> I am a professional hairstylist. I cant believe how crappy this deal is!  Ordered my blowdryer, got it, knew it was fake almost instantly( I already own a real one), wanted to return it. I called them and told them it was fake and they said I could return it for a refund. They e- mailed a rma# and I sent it back. Well a month has gone by and they claim they havent recieved it and wont even try to help me find it. Yeah right. Total scam because I called them out for being fake. They wanted to exchange but I was adamant on a refund. I guess they didnt like that. Losers. Dont do it!</li>
            <li> The reason I say this hair dryer is just ok and gave it 3 stars is because I&#x27;ve had 2 of them. The first one only worked for a week and then I had to return it. It would only blow out luke warm air at half the speed it should. The second one works great. I do love how shiny the dryer makes my hair. It is worth the money if you get one that works. My hair looks great!</li>
            <li> A warning was given to install the black mesh filter before using.However,  although I tried to remove the area indicated by the little arrow on the dryer...I was unsuccessful.  I took the hair dryer to Nordstroms,  they sell the Bespoke dryer, to see if the salespeople there could help me to remove the end so that I could install the little black mesh.  They too were unable to manage the procedure.I also took the hairdryer to my hair salon, an upscale salon in Manhattan Beach....the owner of the salon and my stylist also were unable to manage the procedure.  And so I am now using the hairdryer....worrying that I am destroying it by using without the filter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very expensive machine.  Why on earth do they not ship the dryer with the necessary filter installed?  Why leave it for the customer to manage.  And secondly, if.....they continue to market this machine with customer involvement required....make the removable end piece easier to open!!  And so, I am concerned that my significant investment in this hair dryer is being compromised by using without the mesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So....am I missing something......has anyone else had this experience....and if so how have you overcome the need to complete the dryer&#x27;s integrity by installing the mesh?</li>
            <li> Lightweight and super fast. With a vented roll brush, this leaves my hair looking sleek and healthy in record time. I can&#x27;t remember the last time that I left the house with a completely dry head of hair...it used to take way too long to dry. Not anymore! I also like the little \\&quot;bling\\&quot; added to the handle of this special edition (SE) model. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is THE LAST time I order anything but books thru Amazon.  I have a major probelm every time.  I ordered the Featherweight Dryer with a Diffuser.  Instead I got the Special Edition with NO DIFFUSER for more money!  There was NO CONTACT information on the order -- NO PHONE NUMBer -- I called Amazon and got no help at all.  I had to spend more money to Order the Diffuser.  So I ended up spending more money and did not get the product I ordered through the Amazon site.</li>
            <li> This product came in no time at all, actually was not expecting it for another week, and to my surprise it came that weekend.  Product was packed in original box, in perfect condition.  The only concern I have it that I do not have a warrenty on it. Hopefully it will last while.  It is very quiet and lightweight which makes it easy to use.  Barbara Wieloszynski</li>
            <li> Well, I bought this very same dryer from Amazon over a year ago, and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE It. I have had NO problem what so ever with it. It works like a GEM. I have naturally curly hair, and I have no more frizzies, and my hair is so shiny. Now I am going to invest in the travel dryer because I am going on a Cruise this year, so it will better than packing the larger one. Also the T3 brushes are awesome,I have 2 sizes.</li>
            <li> Wow, I cannot believe the difference between T3 Evolution and a regular $20 Conair dryer I used before.  My hair is naturally very curly, and has been very damaged by flat irons, hair dryers, and japanese straightening.  Nevertheless, when I blow-dry my hair straight with the T3 Evolution dryer, it makes my hair look very siky, soft, shiny, and with no frizz.  I also don&#x27;t even have to use the flat iron to finish the straightening job.  I feel like I get a salon blowdry every time I use it.  Well worth the money.  I really hope it doesn&#x27;t break down any time soon, like the other reviews mentioned because there is no warranty...but if it does, I will buy the same dryer from an authorized retailer...it&#x27;s just that great.</li>
            <li> I never realized how much my old hair dryer frizzed my hair until I used this one.  I have used it nearly everyday for the last 6 months and my hair has never looked this shiny. Only caveat is that if you buy online for less than retail, Bespoke will not honor the warranty. But this is the real deal, authentic stickers and all. I am glad I bought it for $40 less than retail. Worst case scenario,if something malfunctions, I will take it to a repair shop.</li>
            <li> If I have this right, this is an older, closeout version of the current $300 Evolution hairdryer but for the price it&#x27;s a great deal.  It is not the identical model to the current one, as it only has 1600 watts vs. 2000 watts for the current one.  But, look at it this way, you could buy 3 of these for the same price as the one from an \\&quot;authorized\\&quot; dealer with a warranty-and you would still have to pay $15+ to have it fixed if it breaks under the warranty.  The one we got came with no serial number as described in other reviews below, but it has been working extremely well and as advertised in that it dries hair significantly faster than our old Conair Yellowbird 2000 watt and leaves your hair feeling much softer.  I&#x27;d rather pay $100 with no warranty than $300 with one (that&#x27;s like spending $200 on an extended warranty).</li>
            <li> I appreciated very much the quietness of the hair dryer; at first I didn&#x27;t believe it could possibly dry my hair in a reasonable amount of time. I have a very old hair dryer now, a conair, that I love, and honestly, I would rather use the conair.    My dislike of the product:  1.) It has only two settings, both very hot. The temperature is very very hot and hurts my scalp (I can&#x27;t imagine it is good for my hair). My hair ends up less manageable and more frizzy.  2.) The cool button must be held down; personally, I don&#x27;t know why most hair dryers don&#x27;t come with a button that keeps the cold air going, but I am not an engineer.    Basically, if you don&#x27;t mind very hot hair dryers, go for it, but if my must older and less advanced conair does a better job than this, I have difficulty justifying the expense.    I hope this was helpful.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer!  Very light weight and easy to use.  Will always have one.</li>
            <li> Ordered this hairdryer on Sunday and received it on Wednesday for very quick service. My wife says the hairdryer is very powerful and reduces the amount of drying time. She can tell a big difference between this hairdryer and one bought at Wal-Mart. Her hair doesn&#x27;t look and feel as dry as compared to a cheaper hairdryer.</li>

            <li> This is a great hair dryer- it works fast and my hair has never looked better. I never thouht i would spend that much on a dryer, but it has been well worth it.      I almost didn&#x27;t get it because of the reviews on here about unauthorized dealers and whatnot. It was a great price though so I went ahead anyway. I&#x27;m glad I did! I don&#x27;t know if somethng changed, or if those reviewers were just looking in the wrong place for the serial number, but mine had everything needed in order to register it with no problems.</li>
            <li> My wife has had the dryer for 4months now.It started not heating up as much in the last couple weeks, now it just blows cold air.Went to look for the warranty caus&#x27; one of the reasons I bought this $200 dryer was the fact it had a 5yr warranty...NOT!!!!.....I started looking for the serial number only to find it had been removed from the box(you can clearly see the location where it used to be and was torn off!)  I came back here to check it out and found all these posts on \\&quot;non-authorized\\&quot; reseller bull$!!it.I do alot of research when I buy stuff, making sure I pay enough money to get quality and not buying cheap.  There is no way to know Amazon is not an authorized reseller.This has been a complete rip off.Make sure you heed the warning....BUY ELSWHERE.  Make sure it has the serial number on the box!I&#x27;m really pissed about this.Now we have to spend more money on another blow dryer.This sucks!!</li>
            <li> I bought the T3 in Oct 2007 as soon as I received it I knew something was wrong.  I have used a real one and this is not a real one, I don&#x27;t understand how everyone loves their hair dryer and only a few people thinks that their dryer is a fake?  Anyway over the weekend my dryer totally blew out I only had it for 6 months, now I have to try to get my money back which should be fun.  It would have been so worth the extra 100.00 to buy a real one instead of paying 200.00 for a $20.00 refurbished Conair motor.</li>
            <li> Good morning, I regret to inform you that this article was mistakenly delivered to another person and never received it. This is why I can not deliver an opinion on the matter ...  I imagine that the hair dryer is very good, so try to buy it but never came to my hands ...    IsaÃ­as Aguilar</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this product. My hair is much smoother and feels healthier. I would definitely recommend this item, but couldn&#x27;t imagine paying full price for it! A $300 hairdryer would have to come with it&#x27;s own stylist to be worth it!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I expected and works very good. Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer at Amazon in order to get it for $125 less than the MSR.  In 6 months it quit working completely and I contacted Amazon about it only to be told that it was past the 30 days.  I emailed Amazon a few time before posting this, in order to give then a chance to make it right, but they offer no help at all.  This is when I learned that these hair dryers are ONLY sold through authorized dealers and Amazon is not one of them.  So my hair dryer is possibly a copy; it is certainly not under any kind of warranty and I just lost that $175.  The real deal is a fabulous dryer and I would suggest buying it for the full $300 and having a 4-year warranty on it.      Amazon is one of the places online that I have always felt safe making purchases, but no more.  Please be aware that you&#x27;re taking a chance that it may not be authentic and it might fail, and, if it does, you will have just lost a lot of money because there is no support for it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this hairdryer. My hair is healthier, shinier and I feel like I&#x27;m done in no time!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Dries much faster than non-pro dryers, and leaves my hair much less frizzy too. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d pay $300 for it, but at this price it&#x27;s worth it...Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was a gift to my daughter, a lawyer with very long hair.  Previous dryers she used resulted in dry, brittle and unmanageable hair without the use of a lot of hair spry.  The evolution dryer has changed this.  She says that the dryer dries her hair quicker and leaves it soft and it doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  All in all, one fantastic hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I though it was a great price. I shouldn&#x27;t have bought it, it came with no serial number which meant no warranty. It does not work like the real T3 at all  because it is not. Waste of money. I cant believe amazon is selling this.</li>
            <li> Just prefect for hair drying. Dry me hair within 10 sec, and my wife&#x27;s in 2 mins.&lt;br /&gt;Hair feel even softer after.</li>
            <li> Love the hairdryer, it works amazing!  My only problem that everyone should know is that I bought it for the 4 year warranty because I have had 2 chi hairdryers that broke just after my 1 year warranty expired!  Therefor this hairdryer was appealing to me.  The only problem is Bespoke Labs wont honor my warranty because it was not purchased by an authorized Beauty Supply dealer.  So I am screwed if this breaks early!</li>
            <li> This is the first time i have spent over $40 on a hair dryer and it was so worth it! My husband could even tell a different in my hair. I had less frizz and my hair is a lot softer. It gets super hot really fast and dries my hair a lot quicker than what i had.</li>
            <li> Superfast shipping.  Item arrived in new condition as described. Very nice hair dryer. Very powerful.  I was a bit concern about the life of this product but so far so good...</li>
            <li> I usually love Amazon and buy a lot of Cd&#x27;s, books, etc. Don&#x27;t buy this hairdryer from any discount supplier. I bought one, expected a genuine article, didn&#x27;t get a manufacturer&#x27;s warranty and am stuck with a dryer that doesn&#x27;t get hot. I contacted the seller, and because I was certain this was authentic, I threw the box away and now I&#x27;m on the hook for $100 plus. DO NOT BUY from anyone other than a seller who can provide a warranty from the manufacturer. These dryers have a tendency after a couple of years to burn up. My last one shorted right at my vanity. Scary. Get the warranty. Please.</li>
            <li> I am not one that is easily impressed by products. They really have to knock my socks off for me to take the time or energy to write a review, but this hair dryer does that and more!! I have been a proud owner for about two years, and purchased it from Amazon.  These babies are $275- $300 in stores. I saw one in Ulta and was so thankful I bought it here when it was $75  - what a Steal!!  I had a cheap Revlon dryer that did the job but this dryer is amazing!! It&#x27;s quiet, it delivers extremely hot heat that you could burn yourself if you leave it one area too long at the highest setting.  It has 3 levels of heat and a cool button although I dry my hair on highest setting, so the cool button doesn&#x27;t get very cool when I use it. It cut my hair drying time in half and that is saying a lot because I have long fine hair but A LOT of it.  It takes 12 minutes to round brush dry and style from start to finish for hair halfway down my back.  My hair is always smooth after using.    The only drawback is that it delivers such power that it has actually tripped the circuits in the bathroom a few times and sometimes cuts off if you have used it too long on the highest setting. After it cools down some, it turns back on no problem. I would definitely buy again!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different hair dryers and usually spend less money on them. This professional dryer does the best job on my hair. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not only did this hair dryer take longer to dry than past professional dryers that I have owned, it burned my hair the two times I used it!  I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
            <li> Blow dryer didn&#x27;t last more than 1 year and was very loud.  I bought this for salon use and it was a disappointment.  It also annoyed other stylists because it was so loud.  Would definitely not recommend in a professional setting. It actually blew itself out!  Lots of billowing smoke.....</li>
            <li> The reason the price is so low is that this is a cheap knock off and not a real Bespoke labs blow dryer. Mine stopped working after 9 mths and there is no warranty. You get what you pay for I guess.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer does what it says it does.  Dries my hair fast leaving it smooth and shiny, quieter than my last dryer, and styles my hair well.  I like the different heat settings because I use it to dry my dog and she needs a low heat blow dry.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this item for my 2 1/2 pound Maltese dog. I didn&#x27;t want to get an animal-specific dryer, because of his size, but I grew weary of waiting (forever) for him to dry with the dryer I was using. After some research, I finally decided to take the plunge. I am sure glad I did. His hair dries much faster, and this dryer is quieter than the prior model. I use the &#x27;cool shot&#x27; most of the time, and the button is easy to push and does not fatigue my hand the way lesser dryers have. He also has fewer split ends and doesn&#x27;t try to escape the T3. The tourmaline and quiet operation seem to do the trick.    Given that he has &#x27;human&#x27; hair, rather than fur, I feel comfortable stating that this is a &#x27;must buy,&#x27; if you are interested in quiet operation, a minimum of frizzies and a better result than standard dryers.</li>
            <li> I am a hair stylist at a busy salon and I don&#x27;t know what I would do without my t3 bespoke dryer. It blows very hot but not too hard so it dries the hair without making it frizz. The only negative is that they&#x27;re not made of the best quality parts. I had my last one for 2 years which is the length of the warranty before it broke which for me is a good run. For an at home use would last longer.</li>
            <li> i ordered the T3Bespoke Labs hair dryer in 2010- within one year dryer stopped working- contacted discount jungle and was told to email dryer back for replacement- had to call several times and was told my dryer would be mailed out shortly or was on the way- one call was answered with \\&quot;it is no longer under warrenty\\&quot; - broken dryer mailed back to me with no explanation- i am not happy with this company and would not order from them again- i am now finding out they are an unauthorized dealer for the hairdryer</li>
            <li> Works very well and fast. I have medium long wavy hair. It looks very healthy after blow drying without even any product. I am saving a lot by not having to use products in my hair anymore.</li>
            <li> This ionic hair dryer does an outstanding job on my hair.  I need hair dryers like this to make my hair presentable, as the curl is unmanageable, unless dried with this hair dryer.  The unit is easy to control, does not get too hot, and is powerful enough to just get the job done quickly.  I have 2 of the units, one for home, one for when I travel.  Compared to other dryers, yes, you can pay less, but these are worth the price.</li>
            <li> I was actually giddy the first time I used this because of how it made my hair so smooth and full of body.  This baby plus a little mousse work wonders.  My hair is fine and not extremely thick, and this dryer does a great job of giving me extra volume when I want a more glamourous look.  I feel it was worth the splurge, although I&#x27;m glad I bought it when I did (a few months ago) because the price has since gone up on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen criticism about warranty and registration- though mine has both (though I have not registered it yet).  Seller was great and very prompt delivery.  Product itself is just another hair dryer to me and I&#x27;d be pissed and take it back if I had paid full price.</li>
            <li> I previously used a Babyliss ProTT tourmaline ceramic that I completely loved. When it had broke down, I only wanted to upgrade and the T3 was supposed to be the best around. And I have to admit, it&#x27;s pretty amazing. I have long wavy hair that gets impossibly frizzy in hot/humid weather and now I&#x27;ve turned off my flat iron permanently. My hair stays straight without it now. My Babyliss dried my hair pretty quickly and so does the T3. But the T3 does it without blowing my hair everywhere, so you have much more control over styling. Allover, it is an amaaaaazing product, a step up from my Babyliss, and I wonder why I didn&#x27;t buy one sooner!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent prouduct. It eliminates friz and drys your hair in half the time. I love mine.</li>
            <li> I chose this model as a birthday gift based on rave reviews from other ladies on a blog I frequent. I know the cardinal rule is that men shouldn&#x27;t buy women gifts with cords.  But I also know how much time DW spends on her hair every morning.  After seeing her burn thru cheap dryer after dryer, I decided to take the plunge and get her a top of the line product. She loves it. Says it is light as a feather and leaves her hair soft and shiny.  But the real kicker is that the office witch actually complimented her on how nice her hair looked.  So I guess it was OK to buy a corded gift after all.  The accompanying earrings didn&#x27;t hurt either. ~:o)</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer- it drys your hair so quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave the frizzy feeling that all drug store brand hair dryers leave.</li>
            <li> Bought the hairdryer for my wife. She was very happy with the performance.  When I went to register the product I couldn&#x27;t because the sticker on the box that has the serial # was missing. I then found out through Amazon that they are NOT a authorized reseller therefore company won&#x27;t honor warranty if something happens.</li>
            <li> I was not too happy with this hair dryer. It&#x27;s a nice hair dryer but doesn&#x27;t blow very hard and it takes me longer to do my hair. I have a Hana professional hair dryer that is ten times the hair dryer this one is. I would say it&#x27;s a fairly good deal for the price. I gave $200 for my Hana professional and it is still my favorite hair dryer.I&#x27;m mainly using the T3 Bespoke hair dryer for a back up.</li>
            <li> This dryer is a fake! I have the original dryer and I know what the real feels and looks like, including the serial number and the packaging. This dryer was wrapped in a black plastic bag (looked like a garbage bag) and the serial number didn&#x27;t match at all. Is sounded funny and loud.  Please be cautious and don&#x27;t buy this dryer on Amazon.  I returned mine and got my money back. I went directly to the T3 website and got the AUTHENTIC T3 hair dryer.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have found the one thing in life a girl cannot compromise on is hair care products and styling tools.  You absolutely get what you pay for and this hair dryer is worth every penny.  I had the blue Chi Ion before for 5 years that I loved dearly, I was worried about switching to something different but the T3 is everything is promises and more.  Hope to have many years with this one :)</li>
            <li> This is my third T3 and it is the ONLY hair dryer that will style my hair, as my hair dresser will verify.  I let her and some friends borrow it for a while to see if they  wanted to get one and they all agree it is great.  My hair is like a sponge but I can dry it very quickly and not have friz from hurricane force winds and still have the heat I need.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> The dryer is very quiet, gets hot quickly and has three levels of speed, but the fastest speed still seems a bit slower than other pro dryers, but I am happy with it and got a lifetime warranty for giving feedback to the site.</li>
            <li> Bought it for her for the birthday.  It is worth spending the extra couple of bucks over the other ones.  Makes a racket but they all do.  The thing I read about it being hard to get to the buttons is kind of ridiculous.  They are not difficult to push/ avoid pushing unless you have the most sausage of sausage fingers.  Apparently does not dry out her hair; or the dogs hair for that matter.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy, fly-away hair that is prone to bushing and frizzing even in non-humid weather and until I found this dryer nothing could smooth, straighten and calm down this wild animal on my head!    This dryer is like a miracle!  Even in hot, humid weather I can walk outside and not feel my hair shrivel and kink up.  OK, there will be a little frizz, but not anywhere near as much as before.  I&#x27;m telling you, if this dryer can work this well on my hair it can work for anyone.  I&#x27;ve tried other expensive dryers that women rave about and they were all a waste of money compared to this one.    First of all, let me warn you that if you are expecting this dryer to be anything like your old dryer you are going to be let down.  In just about every way this dryer makes you think it&#x27;s not up to the task but if you give it a chance you&#x27;ll see that it is light years better than anything else out there.    For instance, this dryer does not seem to put out a lot of air.  People tend to think it doesn&#x27;t have enough power but that&#x27;s not because it isn&#x27;t working, it&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t need to blow your hair to smithereens in order to dry it quickly and thoroughly.  And the benefits from not having to deal with all that wind are amazing.  It actually gives you better control over your hairstyle and doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;poof\\&quot; up your hair.  If you curl your hair around a barrel brush and pull it tight, then pull verrry slowly down to the ends while following it with the dryer, it will dry your hair far more efficiently and smoothly than if you had to deal with tons of wind blowing your hair all over the place.  The only thing is that it takes some getting used to the lack of wind because you are forced to handle your hair differently.  Once you get the knack of it, though, you will never want to go back to your old dryer again.  I feel so much less stressed out using this dryer, too.  It&#x27;s quieter, lighter and doesn&#x27;t require gymnastics to achieve amazing results.    Another thing is thatthe dryer is amazingly light - it weighs just over half a pound!  Again, the control this affords you in being able to hold the dryer at strange angles indefinitely without feeling awkward or tired is amazing.  I used to think that only a professional could dry the hair on the back of my head and style it well, but now I can do it myself to perfection with this dryer.  This dryer is so easy to use you will have more energy when you leave the bathroom.  I&#x27;ll swear it takes less time to dry my hair, although I haven&#x27;t estimated by how much.  It feels like it takes about 25% less time than my old dryer, which was also a professional ionic/ceramic dryer.     One thing that is strange about this dryer (but not in a bad way) is that at first I thought I was seeing \\&quot;smoke\\&quot; rising from my hair when I used it.  This alarmed me because I thought I was damaging my hair.  Now I realize that this is most likely the humidity being blown out of my via the miracle of modern science!  It has no smell and it seems like water vapor.  I had seen this effect a bit with my old dryer, but it happens a LOT with this dryer.  All I know is that my hair comes out silky, smooth, and since I&#x27;ve been using it, in MUCH better condition than before.  I sometimes feel like I&#x27;ve used a relaxer on my hair!    The only complaint I have about this dryer is a small one and quite minor in the scheme of things.  The control buttons are in an awkward place on the grip of the handle and it is easy to accidentally turn the dryer off or change the speed or temperature.  There are 2 independent speed controls and 3 temperature controls.    Other than that, I find the lower speed virtually unecessary because the higher speed is versatile enough to use for any purpose.    In general, I would highly recommend this dryer to anyone regardless of their hair issues.  I often see women with \\&quot;thick curly hair\\&quot; act as if their hair type is the hardest to handle and if a dryer can work on them it can work on anyone.  Well, they never had fine, fly-away, kinky, curly, bushy, virtually weightless hair that will not be tamed for love or money like I do, so I often wonder just who has it harder in that department!  But regardless of that, I think that anyone who wants silkier, smoother, straighter hair will be more than happy with their results with this dryer.  Personally, when I have seen bad reviews of this dryer I think it&#x27;s because the person hasn&#x27;t learned how to use it yet and is expecting it to act like the average hair dryer.  If you have that reaction I would suggest taking some lessons in blow drying techniques because I am pretty sure that will solve your problem.  This dryer has taught me so much about how to dry my hair successfully that I am almost in debt to it for an education as well.  Now if they can only come out with a model that will shine shoes too!  ;-)    UPDATE May, 2008:  I have now owned this blow dryer for about a year and despite daily use it&#x27;s still going strong with absolutely NO issues whatsoever and I am still thrilled with its performance!</li>
            <li> My husband got me this expensive blow dryer for Christmas after hearing me complain how long it takes to dry my long hair.. that of which I recently chopped 6 inches off.  I have a new baby, and would rather spend my time with her instead of drying my hair - so this seemed like the perfect product.    I have long, fine-ish, straight-ish hair.  After giving this dryer a good week for a test drive, my hair only seemed flatter and had more static.  Just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t the weather or my shampoo, I tried my ol&#x27; $20 Conair and the life came back to my hair!     Bottom line - feel free to try it out, but I&#x27;m spending my money elsewhere.  Also be warned about the serial number missing!!</li>
            <li> I too bought this dryer and in less than 3 months the dryer was not working. When I contacted T3 they informed me that Amazon was not authorised to sell this product but they would make an exception and for a total cost of $50.00 they would replace my very expensive dryer.    Amazon should let you know of the issues before you by any product that will not honor it&#x27;s warranty. I have used Amazon but never knew of this dirty little secret. I thought this was a customer service kind of company ,well it is not.</li>
            <li> I use it sometimes to blowdry my hair straight and I&#x27;d say it works okay.  It hasn&#x27;t broken yet like other customers complain, gets nice and hot too.  But I don&#x27;t notice anything special about it that a regular blow dryer wouldn&#x27;t have done.  It&#x27;s supposed to have special ionic magical powers of some sort that help defrizz your hair, but I can&#x27;t really tell the difference.  Would I spend the money on it again, possibly not.  But considering I&#x27;ve owned it for years and it hasn&#x27;t died yet, maybe the money is worth it after all.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t pay full retail for it..because I personally can not afford to pay full retail but I believe it&#x27;s safe to say that this is absolutly one of the best if not THE best hairdryer out there. Very pretty with the jewel studded handle. Powerful,light,quiet and pretty much does everything it claims to do. I can easily see how this can be a favorite of the worlds top stylists. At the price I got it for on Amazon website I am very pleased! You won&#x27;t be dissappointed with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product too, to get it at a lower price. But honestly, its not worth it because it broke within 3 months. The serial number on the product was not legit (should be a silver label), so chances are the products shipped from Amazon are not \\&quot;real\\&quot; t3 hairdryers. Also considering the fact that Amazon is not a licensed distributor, you should avoid buying it because the warranty is not covered by the manufacturer. If you want to invest in this hair dryer try to find it at a local beauty store (I found one with warranty and all for $170) and be sure to look for the silver serial number label!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the dryer I received was not the special edition shown in the picture. It was the regular T3-white.</li>
            <li> Awesome product but did not give 5 stars because it didn&#x27;t last long before it started giving problems. For the money paid, expected the product to hold up longer.</li>
            <li> Wife wanted a professional quality hair dryer.  Has been using for over 2 years and still going strong.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, but sometimes seems to actually get to hot. Also the cord is long which is nice however it seems to get tangled easily.</li>
            <li> Got it.  Used it.  Liked it very much.  Probably the best hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever hadâ€¦and I&#x27;ve had a lot of them.  It&#x27;s quiet and dries hair quickly without frizzled ends.  Adds volume when I use the concentrated tip.</li>
            <li> Bespoke Labs sent me an 1800 watt model.  My wife opened it and began using it the day it arrived, so I never had a chance to dispute Bespoke Labs shipping me the wrong item.  She likes it and continues using it, and I must admit it does the job quite well, but it was not what I ordered and not what I paid the premium for.  Therefore, I am giving 1 star as a judgment more about Bespoke Labs than the product I received.</li>
            <li> But my first one was $300! I was thrilled to find one at this low price, and it has additional features! I love it because it works faster yet quieter than other blow-driers, is supposedly healthier for hair (mine is definitely less dry since using it!), and doesn&#x27;t blow my hair all over at the high setting - it is very pleasant to use. Also my first one was a featherweight and I didn&#x27;t notice that this one was not until it was already shipping. I decided to see if it was heavier, and it is not. So I am completely satisfied! I bring this with me to nice hotels because it&#x27;s always better than whatever they provide.</li>
