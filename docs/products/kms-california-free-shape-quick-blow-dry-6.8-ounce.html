            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I have been buying it at the hair dresser, but it is more convenient for me to order from this seller instead.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s also lead my to buy and love Aquage Uplifting Foam and Kenra Volume 25 hairspray.</li>

            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I pleased to find it here.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It was ok but no miracle product.  </li>
            <li>Think a better hair dryer would do what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Still use it as it works better than not using it</li>
            <li>love the smell and works as described</li>
            <li>so indubitably pleased &#x3D;].</li>
            <li>The smell is very strong and lingers like really cheap hairspray does.</li>
            <li>and this is hands down the best product to make your hair smell amazing and prevent you from spending 30 minutes with the blowdryer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it so cheap.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s very light and clean.</li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent</li>
            <li>and my hair is fine</li>
            <li>And this product works perfectly fine on my hair.</li>
            <li>This spray cuts that in half, which is good for my hair and good for my patience.</li>
            <li>This product has shortened that time to 15-20 minutes which makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>Works great, definitely would recomend!</li>
            <li>think it does the job, this product is worth to try, it will be either you love it</li>
            <li>maybe just deep condition before you blow dry...Will be buying this for everyone for Christmas lol</li>
            <li>I have long hair that was once beautifully curly.</li>
            <li>This product(Free Shape quick blow dry) is awesome if you are in a hurry but do not want to spend forever drying your hair right out of the shower.</li>
            <li>That coupled with a brand new hairdryer has made my life significantly more bearable (and my hair significantly more fabulous)</li>
            <li>I love this product I use it on the root of my hair to get rid of the wave from the rollers and it is amazing it leaves my hair so soft and my hair also lasts straight for a longer time and one more thing</li>
            <li>This product has significantly made my mornings faster.  </li>
            <li>But as I&#x27;ve aged, the beautiful curls have morphed into frizzy waves.</li>
            <li>People were SO complimentary that I went out and bought another bottle immediately!  </li>
            <li>Great product for speeding dry time.</li>
            <li>but so far, I love it!</li>
            <li>For what it did for my hair I would have gladly paid that much again.</li>
            <li>Perfect for thick absorbent hair like mine.</li>
            <li>I have fairly curley hair natually and blow dry it often, this was my first time using a product like this and after 2 weeks of use, I can offically say I love it, and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff not only does it make my hair dry more quickly but it makes my hair look great.</li>
            <li>it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, which is to make the hair dry faster, but i think it depends on what kind of hair type you have since I have read many reviews before purchasing this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She says that it works great without making your hair look greasy, like other products.  </li>
            <li>this cut the time in 1/2 no sweaty neck or hot head!</li>
            <li>Used it for the first time today and it cut about 3-4 minutes off my drying time!</li>
            <li>The light conditioner leaves my hair super soft, silky, and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair with a bit of curl in it and the two products really thicken my hair without drying it out.  </li>
            <li>If you love the smell of old lady flowery perfume, this is the stuff for you.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, really does cut your dry time, feels clean, and a heat protector...</li>
            <li>All in all, not exactly what I was expecting, but a good buy.</li>
            <li>, it leaves my hair full, soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Quick, but I still have too much hair....</li>
            <li>It takes at least 3-4 minutes off drying time, smell SO good and keeps my hair feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>I tend to buy stuff and usually the products are too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>I like this spray because it keeps my hair soft and smooth all day.  </li>
            <li>This product really cuts my drying time by 3 min!</li>
            <li>The first day I did my hair, it took 7 minutes.  </li>
            <li>This really does work!  </li>
            <li>I also have a lot more texture with just a simple blowdry.  </li>
            <li>I think it really works!</li>
            <li>Not only does my hair seem to dry faster but this is a great conditioner,no heaviness and leaving no sticky residue like some products.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really been able to notice a big difference</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would have been able to grow my hair as long without it.</li>
            <li>KMS California Free Shape quick blow dry spray, does seem to shorten my time of blow drying by 3 to 4 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It is great for combing thru long wet hair.  </li>
            <li>I originally got this at my local salon, but here it is much cheaper!</li>
            <li>It smells really nice and might make her hair a little bit softer and shinier</li>
            <li>That said, i feel like it kind of dries out my hair and leaves it a little frizzy.</li>
            <li>You just spritz this in and you don&#x27;t have to use much at all</li>
            <li>but it was fast.....</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li>It also really conditions my hair without making it oily.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Not a big deal, but if you are looking for a product that will smooth your hair AND keep curls in, this is probably not it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes my hair smell really</li>
            <li>Really shortens drying time.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise it really does work.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This product really improved the look and feel of my hair.</li>
            <li>and it really bummed me out.</li>
            <li>I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work because it seemed like a pipe dream, but it really did minimize my blowdry time.</li>
            <li>It helps so much with tangles that I use it even when I am not in a hurry.</li>
            <li>Blow drys go so much faster.</li>
            <li>My hair dries much faster-</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t really condition that much.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product, gotta try it before judging if it really works or not.</li>
            <li>This product works really well with the Aquage Thickening Spraygel.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended by a hairstylist friend of mine who has thick fine hair, so maybe if you have finer hair or it is not thick, it will work better.</li>
            <li>last awhile, I don&#x27;t really blow dry my hair very often; but when I do I thought it would be nice not to have to spend as much time doing it.</li>
            <li>It smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue/greasey feeling on your hair and acutally cuts down blow dry time!</li>
            <li>With this product, I spray it all over on wet hair and it literally cuts the drying time in half and leaves my hair with a nice, smooth texture.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it for fine, thick hair.</li>
            <li>I use a little before the blow dry…………….for easy to manage hair!</li>
            <li>With this product I am able to cut my straightening time down to 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I think it more or less has a placebo effect where you BELIEVE it&#x27;s helping to reduce the drying time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend both of those products as well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who has split ends or breakage</li>
            <li>Smells so good, cheaper than buying in salons, and shipped to my house in a few DAYS!!!</li>
            <li>My hair would get very tangled while drying and this has almost completely solved that problem.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it because it makes my hair so soft, even if it doesn&#x27;t reduce drying time all that much.</li>
            <li>Really dries hair quicker and makes it soooooo soft.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and work full time.</li>
            <li>I bought this to help with drying time, not sure if it really works or not, but to be honest I have not complete a real study to time blow drying my hair with and without the spray.</li>
            <li>It is a light spray and does not leaves your hair feeling sticky or lumpy like other products.</li>
            <li>I really did not expect to see much of a difference in drying time, especially since I had a Brazilian Blowout which helped to reduce drying time.</li>
            <li>Enter the quick blow dry spray.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser got me hooked on this quick dry.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a mom with a very busy job.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, I&#x27;m not really sure that it shortened blow-drying</li>
            <li>but I am not convinced it really makes a huge difference with how long it takes to blow dry her hair.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice and it has a minimal amount of hold to it, while leaving my hair feeling &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and not weighed down by product.</li>
            <li>I saw this product endorsed in a magazine and ordered it specifically to cut blow dry time -- because that&#x27;s what we all want, right?</li>
            <li>my rolled curls tend to fall out early in the day.  </li>
            <li>It also keeps my hair protected from the heat of the blow dryer and keeps my hair looking shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t, stay far away.  </li>
            <li>It is completely overpowering.</li>
            <li>My 5-year old daughter loves this product.  </li>
            <li>Well, I hate to wreck the perfect review record here, but this product did not work for me!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair dry so much faster than normal.</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it everyday!!</li>
            <li>However, I have naturally wavy hair and blow dry it straight, and then put rollers in....</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell much difference in time for hair to dry, but protects well.</li>
            <li>When I blowdry my hair straight, I let it air dry for about 20 minutes</li>
            <li>I use this on top of Goldwell Flat Marvel and it has cut my dry time in half.</li>
            <li>Within 10 minutes my hair is pretty much dry which says a lot because it can take several hours to air dry normally.</li>
            <li>Which, considering that I have a bad shoulder, is a great thing.</li>
            <li>My hair is left shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it really reduced the amount of time spent drying my hair.</li>
            <li>I usually get pretty hot when I&#x27;m trying to blow dry my hair</li>
            <li>The crown especially can take 20-30 minutes to blow dry for some reason no matter how much towel drying I do or</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn’t give it a 1 star is because it smelled nice and did cut down maybe 3-4 minutes of my blow dry time but not worth it overall.</li>
            <li>so maybe it would work better on someone with regular to thin hair.</li>
            <li>I have below the should long and very think hair which takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li>This really does cut your blowdrying time in half.</li>
            <li>So I have to blow dry my hair nearly every day.</li>
            <li>my daughter has super thick hair</li>

            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I pleased to find it here.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It was ok but no miracle product.  </li>
            <li> Think a better hair dryer would do what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Still use it as it works better than not using it</li>
            <li> love the smell and works as described</li>
            <li> so indubitably pleased &#x3D;].</li>
            <li> The smell is very strong and lingers like really cheap hairspray does.</li>
            <li> and this is hands down the best product to make your hair smell amazing and prevent you from spending 30 minutes with the blowdryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found it so cheap.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s very light and clean.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent</li>
            <li> and my hair is fine</li>
            <li> And this product works perfectly fine on my hair.</li>
            <li> This spray cuts that in half, which is good for my hair and good for my patience.</li>
            <li> This product has shortened that time to 15-20 minutes which makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> Works great, definitely would recomend!</li>
            <li> think it does the job, this product is worth to try, it will be either you love it</li>
            <li> maybe just deep condition before you blow dry...Will be buying this for everyone for Christmas lol</li>
            <li> I have long hair that was once beautifully curly.</li>
            <li> This product(Free Shape quick blow dry) is awesome if you are in a hurry but do not want to spend forever drying your hair right out of the shower.</li>
            <li> That coupled with a brand new hairdryer has made my life significantly more bearable (and my hair significantly more fabulous)</li>
            <li> I love this product I use it on the root of my hair to get rid of the wave from the rollers and it is amazing it leaves my hair so soft and my hair also lasts straight for a longer time and one more thing</li>
            <li> This product has significantly made my mornings faster.  </li>
            <li> But as I&#x27;ve aged, the beautiful curls have morphed into frizzy waves.</li>
            <li> People were SO complimentary that I went out and bought another bottle immediately!  </li>
            <li> Great product for speeding dry time.</li>
            <li> but so far, I love it!</li>
            <li> For what it did for my hair I would have gladly paid that much again.</li>
            <li> Perfect for thick absorbent hair like mine.</li>
            <li> I have fairly curley hair natually and blow dry it often, this was my first time using a product like this and after 2 weeks of use, I can offically say I love it, and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff not only does it make my hair dry more quickly but it makes my hair look great.</li>
            <li> it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, which is to make the hair dry faster, but i think it depends on what kind of hair type you have since I have read many reviews before purchasing this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She says that it works great without making your hair look greasy, like other products.  </li>
            <li> this cut the time in 1/2 no sweaty neck or hot head!</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time today and it cut about 3-4 minutes off my drying time!</li>
            <li> The light conditioner leaves my hair super soft, silky, and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair with a bit of curl in it and the two products really thicken my hair without drying it out.  </li>
            <li> If you love the smell of old lady flowery perfume, this is the stuff for you.  </li>
            <li> Smells good, really does cut your dry time, feels clean, and a heat protector...</li>
            <li> All in all, not exactly what I was expecting, but a good buy.</li>
            <li> , it leaves my hair full, soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Quick, but I still have too much hair....</li>
            <li> It takes at least 3-4 minutes off drying time, smell SO good and keeps my hair feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I tend to buy stuff and usually the products are too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> I like this spray because it keeps my hair soft and smooth all day.  </li>
            <li> This product really cuts my drying time by 3 min!</li>
            <li> The first day I did my hair, it took 7 minutes.  </li>
            <li> This really does work!  </li>
            <li> I also have a lot more texture with just a simple blowdry.  </li>
            <li> I think it really works!</li>
            <li> Not only does my hair seem to dry faster but this is a great conditioner,no heaviness and leaving no sticky residue like some products.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really been able to notice a big difference</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would have been able to grow my hair as long without it.</li>
            <li> KMS California Free Shape quick blow dry spray, does seem to shorten my time of blow drying by 3 to 4 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It is great for combing thru long wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I originally got this at my local salon, but here it is much cheaper!</li>
            <li> It smells really nice and might make her hair a little bit softer and shinier</li>
            <li> That said, i feel like it kind of dries out my hair and leaves it a little frizzy.</li>
            <li> You just spritz this in and you don&#x27;t have to use much at all</li>
            <li> but it was fast.....</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li> It also really conditions my hair without making it oily.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Not a big deal, but if you are looking for a product that will smooth your hair AND keep curls in, this is probably not it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Makes my hair smell really</li>
            <li> Really shortens drying time.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise it really does work.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This product really improved the look and feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> and it really bummed me out.</li>
            <li> I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work because it seemed like a pipe dream, but it really did minimize my blowdry time.</li>
            <li> It helps so much with tangles that I use it even when I am not in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Blow drys go so much faster.</li>
            <li> My hair dries much faster-</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t really condition that much.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product, gotta try it before judging if it really works or not.</li>
            <li> This product works really well with the Aquage Thickening Spraygel.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended by a hairstylist friend of mine who has thick fine hair, so maybe if you have finer hair or it is not thick, it will work better.</li>
            <li> last awhile, I don&#x27;t really blow dry my hair very often; but when I do I thought it would be nice not to have to spend as much time doing it.</li>
            <li> It smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue/greasey feeling on your hair and acutally cuts down blow dry time!</li>
            <li> With this product, I spray it all over on wet hair and it literally cuts the drying time in half and leaves my hair with a nice, smooth texture.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it for fine, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I use a little before the blow dry…………….for easy to manage hair!</li>
            <li> With this product I am able to cut my straightening time down to 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I think it more or less has a placebo effect where you BELIEVE it&#x27;s helping to reduce the drying time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend both of those products as well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who has split ends or breakage</li>
            <li> Smells so good, cheaper than buying in salons, and shipped to my house in a few DAYS!!!</li>
            <li> My hair would get very tangled while drying and this has almost completely solved that problem.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it because it makes my hair so soft, even if it doesn&#x27;t reduce drying time all that much.</li>
            <li> Really dries hair quicker and makes it soooooo soft.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and work full time.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with drying time, not sure if it really works or not, but to be honest I have not complete a real study to time blow drying my hair with and without the spray.</li>
            <li> It is a light spray and does not leaves your hair feeling sticky or lumpy like other products.</li>
            <li> I really did not expect to see much of a difference in drying time, especially since I had a Brazilian Blowout which helped to reduce drying time.</li>
            <li> Enter the quick blow dry spray.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser got me hooked on this quick dry.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mom with a very busy job.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, I&#x27;m not really sure that it shortened blow-drying</li>
            <li> but I am not convinced it really makes a huge difference with how long it takes to blow dry her hair.  </li>
            <li> The smell is nice and it has a minimal amount of hold to it, while leaving my hair feeling &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and not weighed down by product.</li>
            <li> I saw this product endorsed in a magazine and ordered it specifically to cut blow dry time -- because that&#x27;s what we all want, right?</li>
            <li> my rolled curls tend to fall out early in the day.  </li>
            <li> It also keeps my hair protected from the heat of the blow dryer and keeps my hair looking shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, stay far away.  </li>
            <li> It is completely overpowering.</li>
            <li> My 5-year old daughter loves this product.  </li>
            <li> Well, I hate to wreck the perfect review record here, but this product did not work for me!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair dry so much faster than normal.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it everyday!!</li>
            <li> However, I have naturally wavy hair and blow dry it straight, and then put rollers in....</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell much difference in time for hair to dry, but protects well.</li>
            <li> When I blowdry my hair straight, I let it air dry for about 20 minutes</li>
            <li> I use this on top of Goldwell Flat Marvel and it has cut my dry time in half.</li>
            <li> Within 10 minutes my hair is pretty much dry which says a lot because it can take several hours to air dry normally.</li>
            <li> Which, considering that I have a bad shoulder, is a great thing.</li>
            <li> My hair is left shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really reduced the amount of time spent drying my hair.</li>
            <li> I usually get pretty hot when I&#x27;m trying to blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> The crown especially can take 20-30 minutes to blow dry for some reason no matter how much towel drying I do or</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn’t give it a 1 star is because it smelled nice and did cut down maybe 3-4 minutes of my blow dry time but not worth it overall.</li>
            <li> so maybe it would work better on someone with regular to thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have below the should long and very think hair which takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> This really does cut your blowdrying time in half.</li>
            <li> So I have to blow dry my hair nearly every day.</li>
            <li> my daughter has super thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, fine long hair and it takes forever to dry it.</li>
            <li> I have super curly long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> This really works to dry my hair in half the time.  </li>
            <li> It definitely cut my blow drying time, it usually takes about 5-10 mns to dry my hair, with hot heat</li>
            <li> I would say my hair normal, maybe a little bit on the thinner side.</li>
            <li> Cuts my drying time in half and leaves hair so soft!</li>
            <li> I used this product a couple of times and thought it was no big deal, but then I didn&#x27;t use it and it took me an extra seven minutes to dry my hair, so</li>
            <li> I have only used the sample size, so I don&#x27;t know about long term use and if it would damage the hair...</li>
            <li> It also helps to minimize damage from flat irons.</li>
            <li> It says to use as the last step before blow drying, on towel dry hair, but since towel drying does nothing for me</li>
            <li> After my Keratin treatment wore off my hair suddenly started taking forever to dry in comparison</li>
            <li> Definitely a must have for people who don&#x27;t like taking 20 mins to dry hair.</li>
            <li> have a chemically treated hair, dyed my hair million times, bleached it, my hair is just dry, and i&#x27;m asian</li>
            <li> I still use it even after I cut my hair into a long bob.</li>
            <li> My hair is down to my mid to lower back now and still about 10 minutes to dry.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for two blow-drys now and don&#x27;t really notice a significant reduction in drying time for my thick, wavy hair, at least not more so than any other similar products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I did not time how long it took to dry my 12&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The trick is to use it the very last ...after applying any other hair products.</li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> and it can take forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> about six minutes to completely dry it</li>
            <li> it used to take me forever to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Now I spritz, brush my teeth, and dry my locks without drying it out.</li>
            <li> and then it takes 20 minutes to blow dry (in sections).</li>
            <li> Works to speed dry time</li>
            <li> However, this product made no discernible difference in blow dry time.</li>
            <li> It did cut dry time to an extent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got shoulder length, fine/thin hair that takes forever to blow dry.</li>
            <li> I just spray this on liberally, blow dry my hair for a couple minutes until its maybe 50% dry, then let it sit while I do my makeup or eat breakfast or whatever.</li>
            <li> and then hopefully my hair is totally dry.</li>
            <li> It quickens the time needed to blow dry your hair and leaves it shiny.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t speed up my hair drying process but what it DID do was make my hair feel really dry and straw-like.</li>
            <li> minutes is n0ot exagerating at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, had this stuff for awhile and still can&#x27;t believe the time it DOESN&#x27;T take me to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair that goes all the way down my back</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair that normally takes 30-35 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> , i forgot to mention i have long hair, (length is around my boobs), now it only takes me 5 mins or less</li>
            <li> it definitely cuts down the blow drying time</li>
            <li> now have time in the morning to wash, blow dry, and style my hair before work!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t make sense to spray stuff on wet hair &amp; expect it to dry quicker; but, that is what this product does.</li>
            <li> Now it has totally cut my dry time down!</li>
            <li> I blow dried my hair in under 10 minutes (black girl, mid length hair, thick/ lightly coarse).</li>
            <li> I never times how long it took to dry my hair bone dry (usually don&#x27;t since it takes so long)</li>
            <li> I would wash it at night and go to bed with wet hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted to loove this product, but I tried it a few different times, and I just can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I always deep condition my hair, so the people that said it dried out your hair</li>
            <li> It smells good and is not that expensive, and won&#x27;t make your hair weird if you do get it.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended it for my long hair to cut down on blowdrying time</li>
            <li> I can take it down to less than ten minutes by using this spray.</li>
            <li> Just spray on towel dried hair to speed up the drying process (blow dry or air dry).  </li>
            <li> Meant to cut your dry time down</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this product cuts my drying time in half, and feels so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t noticed that the dry time has been decreased.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter because she used the other bottle that was given to her up.  </li>
            <li> It works well with other styling products to.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other ones from kms brands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying NOT to continually process my hair for a little while since I am starting to feel the pinch after years of hair abuse, but spending 20+ minutes on blowdrying everyday was taking it&#x27;s toll.</li>
            <li> It literally cut my dry time in half!</li>
            <li> Dry time literally cut in half!</li>
            <li> I buy it online because it is hard to find outside of salons.</li>
            <li> My complaint would be i wish it came in a bigger size</li>
            <li> Maybe that is just because of how thick and coarse my hair is.</li>
            <li> I have lots of hair and this product cuts down drying time.  </li>
            <li> It cuts down on blow drying time.</li>
            <li> I was let down by the scent.</li>
            <li> Detangles and does NOT weigh hair down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m down to 2</li>
            <li> I use this every morning since I am not much of a morning person and this is a life-and time- saver!!</li>
            <li> My hair dries in half the time.</li>
            <li> dries with less time now.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully - this product cuts &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34; in half.</li>
            <li> This helps cut my blow drying time in half, plus I think my hair is a lot softer since I started using it.</li>
            <li> it cuts blow drying time nearly in half.</li>
            <li> Cut my drying time in half and gives my hair a thicker appearance.</li>
            <li> I dried my thick, course mid-back length hair in 10 minutes last night!  </li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t that long (just past my shoulders), but is thick and takes what feels like forever to dry with a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after my stylist used it on my hair - long, thick, and wavy.</li>
            <li> It takes 20 minutes at least just to get it dry, even longer if I want it to be styled.  </li>
            <li> I still use my other products with this (a glosser and a straightening balm) and this cuts my drying time in HALF!!</li>
            <li> and it seals in the moisture while helping to dry your hair faster-cutting blow drying time in half!!!</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has long thick hair and is tired of taking 45 min to dry it.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair that holds moisture extremely well.</li>
            <li> It seems to reduce friction while drying and tame frizz.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and very long hair</li>
            <li> (My hair is thick and down to mid-back.)  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I have to blow dry a few small areas for a minute before I can continue to style, but that&#x27;s nothing compared to 10 minutes of blow drying, stop for 5 because my arm is tired, repeat 3 times</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy/curly hair and cut my blow dry time in half!!!</li>
            <li> and I live in the cold weather in the winter</li>
            <li> it has cut my drying time at least by half</li>
            <li> I bought this at the recommendation of the youtuber Kate from The Small Things Blog</li>

            <li> and I was unable to go as long between washings.</li>
            <li> My hair takes an insane amount of time to dry, so I really hoped this would help out.</li>

            <li> I love this product.  I have very thick and very long hair and it can take forever to dry.  I can take it down to less than ten minutes by using this spray.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell much difference in time for hair to dry, but protects well.</li>
            <li> This product(Free Shape quick blow dry) is awesome if you are in a hurry but do not want to spend forever drying your hair right out of the shower. You just spritz this in and you don&#x27;t have to use much at all and it seals in the moisture while helping to dry your hair faster-cutting blow drying time in half!!! I use this every morning since I am not much of a morning person and this is a life-and time- saver!!</li>
            <li> Wow, this is a great product! I really did not expect to see much of a difference in drying time, especially since I had a Brazilian Blowout which helped to reduce drying time. I have long hair and work full time. Every minute I can save is precious to me. I did not time how long it took to dry my 12&amp;#34; length hair but it was fast..... about six minutes to completely dry it and my hair is fine but I have a lot of it  .... more strands per square inch so to speak. I think this product would work on any type of hair.</li>
            <li> Great product for speeding dry time. I use this on top of Goldwell Flat Marvel and it has cut my dry time in half. My hair is left shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It cuts drying time and leaves my wavy, frizz prone hair shiny and silky!</li>
            <li> Love this products! I have thick, fine long hair and it takes forever to dry it. Now it has totally cut my dry time down! Must have hair product!</li>
            <li> I love this product I use it on the root of my hair to get rid of the wave from the rollers and it is amazing it leaves my hair so soft and my hair also lasts straight for a longer time and one more thing it definitely cuts down the blow drying time</li>
            <li> Smells great. I think it does also help with cutting back blow drying time.</li>
            <li> This really does cut your blowdrying time in half. I have long hair that goes all the way down my back and this is hands down the best product to make your hair smell amazing and prevent you from spending 30 minutes with the blowdryer. I originally got this at my local salon, but here it is much cheaper!</li>
            <li> it used to take me forever to dry my hair. Now I spritz, brush my teeth, and dry my locks without drying it out. I like this product bc it&#x27;s the only thing that has worked and I&#x27;ve been using it for years!</li>
            <li> Way cheaper than buying in store. The only qualm I had, and it doesn&#x27;t even warrant losing a star, is that it shipping without a lid. However, the product was intact and there wasn&#x27;t any spillage.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for products, but this product deserves the 5 stars! I have shoulder-length, thick and wavy hair. When I blowdry my hair straight, I let it air dry for about 20 minutes and then it takes 20 minutes to blow dry (in sections). With this product, I spray it all over on wet hair and it literally cuts the drying time in half and leaves my hair with a nice, smooth texture. I have only used the sample size, so I don&#x27;t know about long term use and if it would damage the hair...but so far, I love it! Buying more now!</li>
            <li> Have been using it and finding it on Amazon for cheaper is even better! Cuts my drying time in half and leaves hair so soft!</li>
            <li> Works to speed dry time</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter because she used the other bottle that was given to her up.  She says that it works great without making your hair look greasy, like other products.  She puts it on before she blows out her hair because her hair is very thick.  It also helps to minimize damage from flat irons.</li>
            <li> This stuff sdmells so good. My hair dresser recommended it for my long hair to cut down on blowdrying time and it does seem to do just that. I still use it even after I cut my hair into a long bob. I love the way it makes my hair smell and feel. I have thicker textured and colored Asian hair.</li>
            <li> This really works to dry my hair in half the time.  I have lots of hair and this product cuts down drying time.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I tried this and fell in love with it. Works great, definitely would recomend!</li>
            <li> Love this product and continue to purchase time after time.  I believe this is my third or fourth time buying.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It cuts down on blow drying time. The company I bought it from was great to deal with</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I can&#x27;t believe how great it really work! I would definitely recommend this product to a friend</li>
            <li> I bought this product after trying a sample size. My hair isn&#x27;t that long (just past my shoulders), but is thick and takes what feels like forever to dry with a hair dryer. This spray speeds up drying moderately, but it&#x27;s not a miracle product. The smell is nice and it has a minimal amount of hold to it, while leaving my hair feeling &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and not weighed down by product. It does not leave my hair shiny or greasy looking like some products designed to make hair shiny or protect hair from heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle itself is great, the pump puts out a very fine mist, as opposed to some pumps which tend to put out a more concentrated spurt. I can cover most of my hair in just 3 sprays.</li>
            <li> KMS California Free Shape quick blow dry spray, does seem to shorten my time of blow drying by 3 to 4 minutes.  (My hair is thick and down to mid-back.)  I also like the feel and texture of my hair after I style my hair.</li>
            <li> I read lots of reviews about this product that raved about the smell. I was let down by the scent. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad... Sort of perfumey.  I just think the build up was too great.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that... This is a Holy Grail product for me! It literally cut my dry time in half! I used to never wash my hair in the morning because I dreaded the daunting task of blow drying it! I would wash it at night and go to bed with wet hair. If I did wash it in the morning I would put it in a bun.&lt;br /&gt;I now have time in the morning to wash, blow dry, and style my hair before work!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have been buying it at the hair dresser, but it is more convenient for me to order from this seller instead.  This product rocks!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really reduced the amount of time spent drying my hair. I think it more or less has a placebo effect where you BELIEVE it&#x27;s helping to reduce the drying time. But it&#x27;s not. Damn. I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li> I like this spray because it keeps my hair soft and smooth all day.  It works well with other styling products to.</li>
            <li> I went through a period of not drying my hair (for almost a year) because I would get SO hot and disgusting while drying my hair. My hair stylist gave me this sample and it&#x27;s the best products I&#x27;ve ever tried. My hair dries in half the time. As soon as the sample ran out, I knew I had to order a larger bottle. It also really conditions my hair without making it oily. My hair would get very tangled while drying and this has almost completely solved that problem.</li>
            <li> Well, I hate to wreck the perfect review record here, but this product did not work for me! I have longish, thick, wavy hair, so a blow out is a chore. I saw this product endorsed in a magazine and ordered it specifically to cut blow dry time -- because that&#x27;s what we all want, right? However, this product made no discernible difference in blow dry time. No. discernible. difference.</li>
            <li> been using this stuff for 3 years. love it.</li>
            <li> Meant to cut your dry time down and I think it does. I bought this at the recommendation of the youtuber Kate from The Small Things Blog and she loves this and has mentioned it in several of her videos. She has not lead me astray yet! She&#x27;s also lead my to buy and love Aquage Uplifting Foam and Kenra Volume 25 hairspray. I highly recommend both of those products as well.</li>
            <li> I have fairly curley hair natually and blow dry it often, this was my first time using a product like this and after 2 weeks of use, I can offically say I love it, and will continue to buy it. It smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue/greasey feeling on your hair and acutally cuts down blow dry time! Since using this product my hair is also noticiably softer, which is always a plus!! Great product, would recommend to anyone who spends a fair amount of time blow drying!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff not only does it make my hair dry more quickly but it makes my hair look great. I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> My stylist turned me on to the product. I usually get pretty hot when I&#x27;m trying to blow dry my hair this cut the time in 1/2 no sweaty neck or hot head!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really been able to notice a big difference</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really like this product.  It did cut dry time to an extent. The bad was that it created build up. I wasn&#x27;t able to comb my hair during drying. Had to use a clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It makes my hair dry so much faster than normal. It also protects it from heat damage, a must buy</li>
            <li> I could not tell any difference.  The smell is very strong and lingers like really cheap hairspray does.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it everyday!! Will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> KMS Free Shape is a great &amp;#34;after shampoo&amp;#34; leave-in style product.  Detangles and does NOT weigh hair down.  Use it every time I wash my hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got shoulder length, fine/thin hair that takes forever to blow dry. The crown especially can take 20-30 minutes to blow dry for some reason no matter how much towel drying I do or what blow dryer I use. This spray cuts that in half, which is good for my hair and good for my patience. It says to use as the last step before blow drying, on towel dry hair, but since towel drying does nothing for me I just spray this on liberally, blow dry my hair for a couple minutes until its maybe 50% dry, then let it sit while I do my makeup or eat breakfast or whatever. Within 10 minutes my hair is pretty much dry which says a lot because it can take several hours to air dry normally. Sometimes I have to blow dry a few small areas for a minute before I can continue to style, but that&#x27;s nothing compared to 10 minutes of blow drying, stop for 5 because my arm is tired, repeat 3 times and then hopefully my hair is totally dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely makes blow drying faster.  I&#x27;m not sure how it works, but it does.  Other than that, it leaves my hair full, soft and smooth.  However, I have naturally wavy hair and blow dry it straight, and then put rollers in.... my rolled curls tend to fall out early in the day.  Not a big deal, but if you are looking for a product that will smooth your hair AND keep curls in, this is probably not it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, I&#x27;m not really sure that it shortened blow-drying time.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair smell really nice.&lt;br /&gt;Should last awhile, I don&#x27;t really blow dry my hair very often; but when I do I thought it would be nice not to have to spend as much time doing it.</li>
            <li> This stuff from is amazing. Moracle in a bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that has to blow dry my hair in stages because my arms get tired!!  This product has significantly made my mornings faster.  I&#x27;m down to 2 dries with less time now.  I was also afraid that it would damage my hair but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any adverse affects and I live in the cold weather in the winter</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works, I just know that it does. Really shortens drying time. Great for longer hair! Nancy C.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair that normally takes 30-35 minutes to dry. This product has shortened that time to 15-20 minutes which makes a HUGE difference. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with drying time, not sure if it really works or not, but to be honest I have not complete a real study to time blow drying my hair with and without the spray.</li>
            <li> It works out, but I don&#x27;t find that my blow dries are any quicker because of this product. It smells good and is not that expensive, and won&#x27;t make your hair weird if you do get it. I just don&#x27;t find that it does what it needs to.</li>
            <li> I picked this item up from a salon for 17.95 and I loved it! For what it did for my hair I would have gladly paid that much again. I was on amazon looking for a halloween costume and decide to see if I could buy this product online and here it is for 6 dollars?! I&#x27;m so glad I found it so cheap. I bought 3 bottles immediately.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that was once beautifully curly. But as I&#x27;ve aged, the beautiful curls have morphed into frizzy waves. So I have to blow dry my hair nearly every day. Grrr. And it takes FOREVER. Thankfully - this product cuts &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34; in half.</li>
            <li> I have super curly long thick hair.  With this product I am able to cut my straightening time down to 15 minutes.  I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.  It is part of my daily morning routine.</li>
            <li> I use a little before the blow dry…………….for easy to manage hair!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I am often in a semi truck with my husband and we take showers at truck stops. I have below the should long and very think hair which takes forever to dry. I was talking to my hairstylist about this and she recommended this product. The only place I could find it was on Amazon so I ordered it. Much to my surprise it really does work. it has cut my drying time at least by half and that is a lot. It leaves my hair very soft and shiny. I would recommend this to anyone who has long thick hair and is tired of taking 45 min to dry it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to loove this product, but I tried it a few different times, and I just can&#x27;t. It left a filmy, sticky residue on my hair. It looked awful.</li>
            <li> This product really cuts my drying time by 3 min! It also keeps my hair protected from the heat of the blow dryer and keeps my hair looking shiny and soft. I strongly recommend it for fine, thick hair. I buy it online because it is hard to find outside of salons.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but I HAD to.  I have incredibly thick hair and I hate blowing it dry.  It takes 20 minutes at least just to get it dry, even longer if I want it to be styled.  I&#x27;m a mom with a very busy job.  I don&#x27;t have time to spend 20-30 minutes on my HAIR!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter this product.  The first day I did my hair, it took 7 minutes.  I died!  I got to work and, instead of my ponytail, I had lucious, flowing locks (seriously!) People were SO complimentary that I went out and bought another bottle immediately!  When I next went to my stylist, I mentioned the product to her.  She said \\&quot;I just learned about it too!  We use it here now!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the Best.Thing.EVER!</li>
            <li> This product really improved the look and feel of my hair. I highly recommend this to anyone who has split ends or breakage</li>
            <li> If you love the smell of old lady flowery perfume, this is the stuff for you.  If you don&#x27;t, stay far away.  It is completely overpowering. I can&#x27;t state anything about how the product works, as I could smell it through the box and returned it unused.</li>
            <li> This product does work....but you have to spray it liberally to see the effect.</li>
            <li> Quick, but I still have too much hair.... instead of 45 minutes, It takes about 25. When I run out, I will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> It quickens the time needed to blow dry your hair and leaves it shiny.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Smells so good, cheaper than buying in salons, and shipped to my house in a few DAYS!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It has a really nice scent(not overbearing)at the time of use and doesn&#x27;t hang around afterwards. Not only does my hair seem to dry faster but this is a great conditioner,no heaviness and leaving no sticky residue like some products. I use this all the time and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> So pleased with this product!!  I use it almost everyday.  Just spray on towel dried hair to speed up the drying process (blow dry or air dry).  It also protects hair from heated styling.</li>
            <li> After my Keratin treatment wore off my hair suddenly started taking forever to dry in comparison and it really bummed me out. I&#x27;ve been trying NOT to continually process my hair for a little while since I am starting to feel the pinch after years of hair abuse, but spending 20+ minutes on blowdrying everyday was taking it&#x27;s toll. Enter the quick blow dry spray. I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work because it seemed like a pipe dream, but it really did minimize my blowdry time. That coupled with a brand new hairdryer has made my life significantly more bearable (and my hair significantly more fabulous)</li>
            <li> It takes at least 3-4 minutes off drying time, smell SO good and keeps my hair feeling smooth. I&#x27;m almost out and will buying it again!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Used it for the first time today and it cut about 3-4 minutes off my drying time!</li>
            <li> Finally received my spray!! Love this stuff. Especially if its humid out.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Good quality and worth the price!</li>
            <li> My wife bought this and said the following: I bought this specifically because a review said that it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. I tried it 3 times and each time my hair felt like straw, I couldn&#x27;t run my fingers through my hair and I was unable to go as long between washings. I was very disappointed in the product as well as BeautyAwards who wouldn&#x27;t let me return the product. The only reason I didn’t give it a 1 star is because it smelled nice and did cut down maybe 3-4 minutes of my blow dry time but not worth it overall.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t make sense to spray stuff on wet hair &amp; expect it to dry quicker; but, that is what this product does. It helps so much with tangles that I use it even when I am not in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after my stylist used it on my hair - long, thick, and wavy. I still use my other products with this (a glosser and a straightening balm) and this cuts my drying time in HALF!! Which, considering that I have a bad shoulder, is a great thing. I have to admit, I was a skeptic, but it works. I hate to be without it! In fact, I&#x27;ve actually CHECKED a suitcase because I couldn&#x27;t travel with this in my carry on! I just wish it came in a travel size, too!!</li>
            <li> Works great and arrived very quickly</li>
            <li> I have used this product for two blow-drys now and don&#x27;t really notice a significant reduction in drying time for my thick, wavy hair, at least not more so than any other similar products I&#x27;ve tried.  However, it does definitely work well as a smoothing and heat protectant product. The light conditioner leaves my hair super soft, silky, and smooth. It seems to reduce friction while drying and tame frizz. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent - it&#x27;s very light and clean. All in all, not exactly what I was expecting, but a good buy. I will continue to use it because it makes my hair so soft, even if it doesn&#x27;t reduce drying time all that much.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser got me hooked on this quick dry. Now that the salon stopped carrying it (why???) and I pleased to find it here. The trick is to use it the very last ...after applying any other hair products. My kids like it to because we are always sooooo rushed!</li>
            <li> A Godsend for thick hair. Dry time literally cut in half!</li>
            <li> Smells good, really does cut your dry time, feels clean, and a heat protector... what else could you want??? I&#x27;m a very happy girl!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I have thick wavy/curly hair and cut my blow dry time in half!!! I love it! So glad I found this!!!</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice but like the way it makes my hair silky. It is a light spray and does not leaves your hair feeling sticky or lumpy like other products. I will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews for anything that I buy, But this product is amazingg.. I have thick hair and this product cuts my drying time in half, and feels so soft afterwards. For this price i higly recommended it.. MUST BUY</li>
            <li> My hair takes an insane amount of time to dry, so I really hoped this would help out. So far, I haven&#x27;t noticed that the dry time has been decreased. Maybe that is just because of how thick and coarse my hair is. It was recommended by a hairstylist friend of mine who has thick fine hair, so maybe if you have finer hair or it is not thick, it will work better.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff! Really dries hair quicker and makes it soooooo soft. Definitely a must have for people who don&#x27;t like taking 20 mins to dry hair.</li>
            <li> Best spray I&#x27;ve ever used. Hair looks silky while holding shapes and textures. You can also put your fingers thru your hair. I&#x27;ve tried other ones from kms brands but I like this one the best. Smells good too!</li>
            <li> My 5-year old daughter loves this product.  It smells really nice and might make her hair a little bit softer and shinier but I am not convinced it really makes a huge difference with how long it takes to blow dry her hair.  Granted my daughter has super thick hair so maybe it would work better on someone with regular to thin hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Blow drys go so much faster. Perfect for thick absorbent hair like mine.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any decrease in drying time with this product.  I have thick hair, so maybe that&#x27;s the reason, but this didn&#x27;t work any miracles for me.</li>
            <li> This helps cut my blow drying time in half, plus I think my hair is a lot softer since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to hasten the process of blow drying my color treated hair.  It was ok but no miracle product.  Think a better hair dryer would do what I was looking for.  Still use it as it works better than not using it and I want to use up the bottle.  It sprays on sonic does not require a lot if the product.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t speed up my hair drying process but what it DID do was make my hair feel really dry and straw-like. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair that holds moisture extremely well. This was recommended to me by my stylist and it does work. My hair dries much faster- it cuts blow drying time nearly in half. That said, i feel like it kind of dries out my hair and leaves it a little frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair solon intoruced me to this.  It is great for combing thru long wet hair.  I don&#x27;t think I would have been able to grow my hair as long without it.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff works. it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, which is to make the hair dry faster, but i think it depends on what kind of hair type you have since I have read many reviews before purchasing this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a chemically treated hair, dyed my hair million times, bleached it, my hair is just dry, and i&#x27;m asian so i have asian hair. I would say my hair normal, maybe a little bit on the thinner side. And this product works perfectly fine on my hair. It definitely cut my blow drying time, it usually takes about 5-10 mns to dry my hair, with hot heat, i forgot to mention i have long hair, (length is around my boobs), now it only takes me 5 mins or less and i&#x27;m very happy with the results. The product smells good, and it&#x27;s definitely easy to use. My complaint would be i wish it came in a bigger size and it doesn&#x27;t really condition that much. i still have to use a leave on conditioner (serum) after drying my hair for treatment, which i think is a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it does the job, this product is worth to try, it will be either you love it or you hate it. I recommend this product, gotta try it before judging if it really works or not.</li>
            <li> This stuff works fab!</li>
            <li> This really does work!  Cut my drying time in half and gives my hair a thicker appearance.</li>
            <li> This product works really well with the Aquage Thickening Spraygel.  I have fine hair with a bit of curl in it and the two products really thicken my hair without drying it out.  I also have a lot more texture with just a simple blowdry.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I used this product a couple of times and thought it was no big deal, but then I didn&#x27;t use it and it took me an extra seven minutes to dry my hair, so I think it really works!</li>
            <li> love the smell and works as described</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews I could before ordering this product.  I tend to buy stuff and usually the products are too good to be true.  This product is not like that.  I dried my thick, course mid-back length hair in 10 minutes last night!  No film left on hair.  I have no idea how it actually works but I don&#x27;t care because it works wonders.  I never times how long it took to dry my hair bone dry (usually don&#x27;t since it takes so long) but I can tell you 30+ minutes is n0ot exagerating at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, had this stuff for awhile and still can&#x27;t believe the time it DOESN&#x27;T take me to dry my hair.  My hair is down to my mid to lower back now and still about 10 minutes to dry.  It leaves no film or product feel on my hair.  I will continue to buy it.  It also lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> As described,  prompt shipping. Works great.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!! I blow dried my hair in under 10 minutes (black girl, mid length hair, thick/ lightly coarse). It&#x27;s really awesome because I am in the Caribbean for a while and its hot over here and my house does not have central air so indubitably pleased &#x3D;]. I always deep condition my hair, so the people that said it dried out your hair maybe just deep condition before you blow dry...Will be buying this for everyone for Christmas lol I love KMS!</li>
