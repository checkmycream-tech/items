            <li>Top notch quality.</li>
            <li>so your stuff will get more jostling around than in one of those.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m hoping this is just a fluke and the next one will be perfect.</li>
            <li>I love it for the price, just wish it has a couple more pockets.</li>
            <li>i just love this bag.</li>
            <li>He enjoyed having something to carry his toiletries in.  </li>
            <li>I was extremely pleased.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it had more</li>
            <li>I was expecting a top opening, not a side opening kit.</li>
            <li>great and reasonably priced</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this pouch, I put ALL of my bathroom stuff in there (not just for travel, but all).</li>
            <li>outstanding product for the price</li>
            <li>Good quality and exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>It seems so good when you first opened the package...</li>
            <li>It was a great size and the leather was  nice and a big hit.</li>
            <li>Nice leather, great handle, big and ample.</li>
            <li>OK if you want something cheap that gets the job done.</li>
            <li>However when I took bag out of the box it has a strong musty smell.  </li>
            <li>Its a strong, durable bag.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s leather and has a fairly strong smell of tanning, but maybe that will wear off over time.</li>
            <li>This bag is very nice and roomy, not stiff so you can fit it in a suitcase.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B003A9UL20 Large Genuine Black Leather Travel Kit Shaving Mens Toiletry Bag Mosaic Pattern]  Great product, leather is beautiful, very pleased with this, very roomy!</li>
            <li>Real Leather and a strong made item.. recieved before time and was amazed to find it of real leather and size was perfect for holding all one would need for the weekend of fun</li>
            <li>Bought this for my fiancÃ© and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>The style and functionality of the item is fine.  </li>
            <li>I expect that it will work just fine after I get used to it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not expecting anything too fancy then it will work out just fine for you.  </li>
            <li>I just throw my razor and accessories in there and it works fine for it&#x27;s job.  </li>
            <li>From the moment I opened the packaging, the room filled with a strong chemical smell.  </li>
            <li>The pattern is actually somewhat attractive.</li>
            <li>Well made with genuine leather.  </li>
            <li>But they&#x27;ll be happy to send you a completely different bag without telling you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is one of those buys that I believe in which you get more than your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Zippers work smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It is soft and good looking leather.</li>
            <li>Would have been a 4 or 5 because it was just what my husband needed for travel and its nice looking, but only a 3 because its not holding up as well as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>Good soft leather.  </li>
            <li>Good so far.  </li>
            <li>great travel bag very happy don&#x27;t think I will need to buy another,  this bag will last a long time ,,,, thanks</li>
            <li>The only downside is it has a very strong odor which hopefully it will go away on its own soon.</li>
            <li>For the purpose of replacing my old kit, this was a good and adequate bag.</li>
            <li>Husband was excited about having an additional bag.</li>
            <li>I wished I had order several more after seeing how nice it was.</li>
            <li>That sure looks like a nice enough bag, doesn&#x27;t it?</li>
            <li>This is not a stiff bag that holds its own shape</li>
            <li>My husband is very picky about his dopp kits, so I wasn&#x27;t sure that this would suit his fancy.</li>
            <li>Son liked the soft leather</li>
            <li>Nice soft leather bag, and</li>
            <li>This would not necessarily be a bad thing, if done well.</li>
            <li>Quality product delivered quickly</li>
            <li>Perfect for packing all the necessary toiletries for a short or longer trip.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery</li>
            <li>Very nice got it before due date</li>
            <li>I got this new leather bag for Christmas and love it.</li>
            <li>Easy to pack and allows for much stuff for long-term vacation.</li>
            <li>This case is nice and big with plenty of pockets and storage.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>two zippered compartments - a third would have been nice.</li>
            <li>Worth having.</li>
            <li>My bag has no smell, it&#x27;s supple and soft, top quality leather.</li>
            <li>It is just the right size.  </li>
            <li>Somewhat small, but great prise.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The outside leather keeps moisture out and gives the bag a great visual appeal</li>
            <li>But the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable and I would recommend a five star rating for this product.</li>
            <li>This has been great, and it is actually a little more roomy that I expected.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>2 stars because everyone should agree that it&#x27;s inexpensive, and nobody should be surprised that it&#x27;s also cheap.  </li>
            <li>However, when it arrive in almost no time, it was exactly what I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li>The big drawback is the odor, which is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Wish inside was different color so could see in the bag better,</li>
            <li>Five days after the day it was supposed to be here, I have finally been able to look at the bag.</li>
            <li>It was bigger than I imagined, so he will just have to find more stuff to fill it.</li>
            <li>The inside lining its torn  and is not quite as sturdy as it seemed when first purchased.</li>
            <li>This one was exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li>I ordered the black leather  bag and was very pleased.</li>
            <li>This has some serious space, and the zipper does a great job keeping it all in&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bag is still holding up, however the outside apperance doesn&#x27;t look anywhere near as nice as it did when I bought it.</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable and I would have expected to pay much more for this quality.</li>
            <li>it holds all the essential shaving stuff that I require and is  easy to access.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a large carry on travel bag for my daughter from another seller; and I purchased this  travel bag for my son.  </li>
            <li>have not had a problem use to carry shower and shaving equip around holds large load  </li>
            <li>Large enough to fit my stuff.</li>
            <li>Extra large and light weight.</li>
            <li>Very roomy.  </li>
            <li>I keep this in my car and filled with personal hygiene items.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t there when he received it, but I&#x27;m told he really likes it.</li>
            <li>Anyone who thinks it smells has never had real leather.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>He really loves it.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected</li>
            <li>and I could not find anything in the stores that I knew would please him at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Nice size, given to my teen grandson for an international trip.</li>
            <li>A little bigger than I thought it was, but for the price it was a good deal.</li>
            <li>My previous review was 0 stars, based on not being able to review the product as it had not arrived.</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t have a decent shave bag, so I loaned him this one.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>Good thin leather travel bag</li>
            <li>Which by the way, still after two years, looks brand new.</li>
            <li>bag held up great for me with heavy duty use, you may think, how can a travel kit get heavy duty use?</li>
            <li>Leather is very soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Very soft leather.</li>
            <li>Leather is very soft.</li>
            <li>I carry a little more stuff than I did in my old one (lost the old one).  </li>
            <li>The bag is nice, especially for the price, but unless the smell dissipates, not sure if I will keep this around.</li>
            <li>soft leather and large enough for all my needs.holds shaving cream, hair spray without a problem.</li>
            <li>Big enough to fit larger items but no so big it takes up too much space.</li>
            <li>Very roomy inside but not too big to carry on vacation.</li>
            <li>I have aired it out, and continue to do so, but the odor permeates anything nearby.</li>
            <li>you are a frequent traveler, do not buy.</li>
            <li>Its too soft.</li>
            <li>I have pleasantly surprised at the size and quality of this bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>too soft Won&#x27;t stand up while using it.</li>
            <li>It holds a lot and the leather is really soft.  </li>
            <li>His twenty year old one was falling apart</li>
            <li>I purchased this travel bag as a gift for a recent high school graduate.</li>
            <li>I have had the same leather shave kit for 37 years and it was time for a new one.</li>
            <li>but it had a processing smell that overwhelmed until it had been aired out for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>patchwork leather, up close, can look a little awkward.&lt;br /&gt;Having only two compartments, the large middle one and one on the outside, doesn&#x27;t leave you much space for organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>If it turned out to also be cheap (i. e. low quality) and only lasted a few trips, I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted much money.  </li>
            <li>1/10/13-- After several months using this product, there are some major signs of wear and tear.</li>
            <li>The bag is solid and I believe it will be large enough for the standard toiletries - razor &amp; cream, toothbrush and paste, and several other items.</li>
            <li>This bag was in the same color black and the same design as the large carry on.  </li>
            <li>Plenty of room to pack a full sized set of shaving cream, body wash, shampoo, razor, deodorant, and a few other odds and ends.</li>

            <li> so your stuff will get more jostling around than in one of those.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hoping this is just a fluke and the next one will be perfect.</li>
            <li> I love it for the price, just wish it has a couple more pockets.</li>
            <li> i just love this bag.</li>

            <li> I was extremely pleased.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it had more</li>
            <li> I was expecting a top opening, not a side opening kit.</li>
            <li> great and reasonably priced</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this pouch, I put ALL of my bathroom stuff in there (not just for travel, but all).</li>
            <li> outstanding product for the price</li>
            <li> Good quality and exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> It seems so good when you first opened the package...</li>
            <li> It was a great size and the leather was  nice and a big hit.</li>
            <li> Nice leather, great handle, big and ample.</li>
            <li> OK if you want something cheap that gets the job done.</li>
            <li> However when I took bag out of the box it has a strong musty smell.  </li>
            <li> Its a strong, durable bag.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s leather and has a fairly strong smell of tanning, but maybe that will wear off over time.</li>
            <li> This bag is very nice and roomy, not stiff so you can fit it in a suitcase.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B003A9UL20 Large Genuine Black Leather Travel Kit Shaving Mens Toiletry Bag Mosaic Pattern]  Great product, leather is beautiful, very pleased with this, very roomy!</li>

            <li> From the moment I opened the packaging, the room filled with a strong chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> The pattern is actually somewhat attractive.</li>
            <li> Well made with genuine leather.  </li>
            <li> But they&#x27;ll be happy to send you a completely different bag without telling you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one of those buys that I believe in which you get more than your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Zippers work smoothly.  </li>
            <li> It is soft and good looking leather.</li>
            <li> Would have been a 4 or 5 because it was just what my husband needed for travel and its nice looking, but only a 3 because its not holding up as well as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li> Good soft leather.  </li>

            <li> The only downside is it has a very strong odor which hopefully it will go away on its own soon.</li>
            <li> For the purpose of replacing my old kit, this was a good and adequate bag.</li>
            <li> Husband was excited about having an additional bag.</li>
            <li> I wished I had order several more after seeing how nice it was.</li>
            <li> That sure looks like a nice enough bag, doesn&#x27;t it?</li>
            <li> This is not a stiff bag that holds its own shape</li>
            <li> My husband is very picky about his dopp kits, so I wasn&#x27;t sure that this would suit his fancy.</li>
            <li> Son liked the soft leather</li>

            <li> This would not necessarily be a bad thing, if done well.</li>
            <li> Quality product delivered quickly</li>
            <li> Perfect for packing all the necessary toiletries for a short or longer trip.</li>

            <li> I got this new leather bag for Christmas and love it.</li>
            <li> Easy to pack and allows for much stuff for long-term vacation.</li>
            <li> This case is nice and big with plenty of pockets and storage.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> two zippered compartments - a third would have been nice.</li>
            <li> Worth having.</li>
            <li> My bag has no smell, it&#x27;s supple and soft, top quality leather.</li>
            <li> It is just the right size.  </li>
            <li> Somewhat small, but great prise.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The outside leather keeps moisture out and gives the bag a great visual appeal</li>
            <li> But the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable and I would recommend a five star rating for this product.</li>
            <li> This has been great, and it is actually a little more roomy that I expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> 2 stars because everyone should agree that it&#x27;s inexpensive, and nobody should be surprised that it&#x27;s also cheap.  </li>
            <li> However, when it arrive in almost no time, it was exactly what I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li> The big drawback is the odor, which is overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Wish inside was different color so could see in the bag better,</li>
            <li> Five days after the day it was supposed to be here, I have finally been able to look at the bag.</li>
            <li> It was bigger than I imagined, so he will just have to find more stuff to fill it.</li>
            <li> The inside lining its torn  and is not quite as sturdy as it seemed when first purchased.</li>
            <li> This one was exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> I ordered the black leather  bag and was very pleased.</li>
            <li> This has some serious space, and the zipper does a great job keeping it all in&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bag is still holding up, however the outside apperance doesn&#x27;t look anywhere near as nice as it did when I bought it.</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable and I would have expected to pay much more for this quality.</li>
            <li> it holds all the essential shaving stuff that I require and is  easy to access.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a large carry on travel bag for my daughter from another seller; and I purchased this  travel bag for my son.  </li>
            <li> have not had a problem use to carry shower and shaving equip around holds large load  </li>
            <li> Large enough to fit my stuff.</li>
            <li> Extra large and light weight.</li>
            <li> Very roomy.  </li>
            <li> I keep this in my car and filled with personal hygiene items.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t there when he received it, but I&#x27;m told he really likes it.</li>
            <li> Anyone who thinks it smells has never had real leather.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> He really loves it.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected</li>
            <li> and I could not find anything in the stores that I knew would please him at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Nice size, given to my teen grandson for an international trip.</li>
            <li> A little bigger than I thought it was, but for the price it was a good deal.</li>
            <li> My previous review was 0 stars, based on not being able to review the product as it had not arrived.</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t have a decent shave bag, so I loaned him this one.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> Good thin leather travel bag</li>
            <li> Which by the way, still after two years, looks brand new.</li>
            <li> bag held up great for me with heavy duty use, you may think, how can a travel kit get heavy duty use?</li>
            <li> Leather is very soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Very soft leather.</li>
            <li> Leather is very soft.</li>
            <li> I carry a little more stuff than I did in my old one (lost the old one).  </li>
            <li> The bag is nice, especially for the price, but unless the smell dissipates, not sure if I will keep this around.</li>
            <li> soft leather and large enough for all my needs.holds shaving cream, hair spray without a problem.</li>
            <li> Big enough to fit larger items but no so big it takes up too much space.</li>
            <li> Very roomy inside but not too big to carry on vacation.</li>
            <li> I have aired it out, and continue to do so, but the odor permeates anything nearby.</li>
            <li> you are a frequent traveler, do not buy.</li>
            <li> Its too soft.</li>
            <li> I have pleasantly surprised at the size and quality of this bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> too soft Won&#x27;t stand up while using it.</li>
            <li> It holds a lot and the leather is really soft.  </li>
            <li> His twenty year old one was falling apart</li>
            <li> I purchased this travel bag as a gift for a recent high school graduate.</li>
            <li> I have had the same leather shave kit for 37 years and it was time for a new one.</li>
            <li> but it had a processing smell that overwhelmed until it had been aired out for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> patchwork leather, up close, can look a little awkward.&lt;br /&gt;Having only two compartments, the large middle one and one on the outside, doesn&#x27;t leave you much space for organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> If it turned out to also be cheap (i. e. low quality) and only lasted a few trips, I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted much money.  </li>
            <li> 1/10/13-- After several months using this product, there are some major signs of wear and tear.</li>
            <li> The bag is solid and I believe it will be large enough for the standard toiletries - razor &amp; cream, toothbrush and paste, and several other items.</li>
            <li> This bag was in the same color black and the same design as the large carry on.  </li>
            <li> Plenty of room to pack a full sized set of shaving cream, body wash, shampoo, razor, deodorant, and a few other odds and ends.</li>
            <li> I bought this bag and less than 3 days later the handle is already frayed and the stitching is almost completely undone, so now I have to get another bag.</li>
            <li> I believe that it will last for long time.</li>
            <li> wonder how long it will last</li>
            <li> It is a soft black leather with two zippers that work.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s of decent quality, but certainly not top quality.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bigger than I though it would be, and I like that.  </li>
            <li> Well, using it in a basic training environment for 16 weeks is what I consider heavy duty.</li>
            <li> Carry loop is a little fragile looking compared to similar bags that I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t bother me, just found it a little bit strange.</li>
            <li> However, (you knew it was coming due to the number of stars)</li>
            <li> Plenty of room for cans of shaving cream and other items.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> It feels thin and soft, but not cheap.</li>
            <li> If the new one arrives and is lousy, I will update my review again.</li>
            <li> IT IS I FEEL JUST A LITTLE PRICY</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do any heavy travel.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will use this.  </li>
            <li> It arrived with three small defects in the leather.</li>
            <li> The leather is created from small 1-3 inch swatches.  </li>
            <li> I used the side zipper pocket for a nail clipper set and a small shaving mirror.</li>
            <li> I would rate it a 5 star for size, it is large, but wish the base of it was firm, sturdy and padded.</li>
            <li> Looking back over the terrible reviews, I really don&#x27;t understand why.</li>
            <li> When I lifted it off the counter, the black leather finish stayed behind stuck to the countertop.  </li>
            <li> It is possible it was just one bad bag.</li>
            <li> Unfortuantely, it had such a bad odor that I wouldn&#x27;t keep it in the house.</li>
            <li> I had the wrong opinion about this item when I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> Why is that so difficult?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Leather is very thin and seems like it would rip easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very poorly made.</li>
            <li> After a month, it isn&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad they don&#x27;t have any.</li>
            <li> returned this item had a really bad smell to it  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> Held my electric shaver, and cord, electric tooth brush with base,, tooth paste, soap and case, all my eye contact supplies, deodorant, and cologne.</li>
            <li> I saw this and the price and thought no way, it would be crap.</li>
            <li> The smell was awful.</li>
            <li> the smell of the leather is absolutely awful!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> It had a moldy smell when I opened box. It must have been stored in a damp location. I had to return it. It is possible it was just one bad bag. The product looked nice.</li>
            <li> I got this new leather bag for Christmas and love it. I didn&#x27;t have anything to carry all my man goods so this is perfect.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son.  He likes it.</li>
            <li> Quality product delivered quickly</li>

            <li> Very roomy.  I keep this in my car and filled with personal hygiene items.</li>
            <li> No problems.  Was a gift so I can&#x27;t give a longterm view, but I saw no problems.</li>
            <li> The bag size and quality was great.  However when I took bag out of the box it has a strong musty smell.  I have been trying to get the musty smell out but no luck yet.  The seller needs to check how they store this item in the warehouse.</li>
            <li> I bought this bag and less than 3 days later the handle is already frayed and the stitching is almost completely undone, so now I have to get another bag. Very disappointing don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> Great toiletry bag, holds a lot and looks GOOD!! I travel a lot and this bag has taken a LOT of abuse at camping facilities, locker rooms, airports, etc. Cheap on price but surprisingly excellent on materials and construction, I&#x27;m happy with it!!</li>
            <li> Good quality, good price.</li>
            <li> Very, very pleased with that!!!</li>
            <li> Good quality and exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Got it for my Hubby for his birthday. Very roomy inside but not too big to carry on vacation. Good quality!</li>
            <li> Nice quality bag.  I use it for my shoe shine things.</li>
            <li> This case is nice and big with plenty of pockets and storage. It is soft and good looking leather. This is not a stiff bag that holds its own shape so your stuff will get more jostling around than in one of those.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Very nice bag and a good value.  I wish it had a divider in the middle of the bag but that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for our son who lives in the dorm at a university.  It looks very nice.  However, it is larger than I thought.  But the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the quality of this shaving kit!  The leather is buttery-soft, and it seems like an exceptional deal for the price.  I say go for it!!</li>
            <li> Great Graduation Gift ðŸŽ“</li>
            <li> great quality leather...will hold all need bath accesories</li>
            <li> Solid material, roomy and waterproof containment.  Good value for the money.  I would recommend it for daily use. Buy it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this travel bag as a gift for a recent high school graduate. I wasn&#x27;t there when he received it, but I&#x27;m told he really likes it. The bag is solid and I believe it will be large enough for the standard toiletries - razor &amp; cream, toothbrush and paste, and several other items.</li>
            <li> I bought this bag for my son who is going into the Army. It is very nice and I was amazed at the price! Very good quality, and large interior. All of his shaving and personal hygene stuff fits with room to spare!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my fiancÃ© and it works just fine. The only downside is it has a very strong odor which hopefully it will go away on its own soon.</li>
            <li> Good flexible roomy bag</li>
            <li> I had read it smelled but bought it anyway. The smell was awful. I wrapped it in newspaper, placed it in kitty litter and sprayed with airspray. Had to go buy another one since this was to be a present. After a month, it isn&#x27;t as bad. Gave it to Goodwill.</li>
            <li> Bought it because it was inexpensive.  If it turned out to also be cheap (i. e. low quality) and only lasted a few trips, I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted much money.  Turns out it&#x27;s made of leather scraps, glued together and then embosed along the seams to look like stitching.  This would not necessarily be a bad thing, if done well. The pattern is actually somewhat attractive. However, (you knew it was coming due to the number of stars), it&#x27;s not done well.  I had it sitting on the counter in the bathroom, and the bottom got a bit damp.  When I lifted it off the counter, the black leather finish stayed behind stuck to the countertop.  I&#x27;ll be looking for a replacement before my next trip.  2 stars because everyone should agree that it&#x27;s inexpensive, and nobody should be surprised that it&#x27;s also cheap.  It might serve longer as a shoe bag.  Just don&#x27;t take it into the bathroom with you.</li>
            <li> Nice bag. Large enough to fit my stuff. I travel 2X per month and it seems to be holding up well.</li>
            <li> From the moment I opened the packaging, the room filled with a strong chemical smell.  I moved the travel kit to another&lt;br /&gt;room and the smell followed.  Not sure if I will use this.  The bag is nice, especially for the price, but unless the smell dissipates, not sure if I will keep this around.</li>
            <li> I had the wrong opinion about this item when I ordered it.  However, when it arrive in almost no time, it was exactly what I had hoped for.  It is a soft black leather with two zippers that work.  it holds all the essential shaving stuff that I require and is  easy to access.  I recommend this purchase and for a good price also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to get a replacement for this. It arrived with three small defects in the leather. I am one to give the benefit of the doubt so I&#x27;m hoping this is just a fluke and the next one will be perfect.</li>
            <li> perfect for what we needed it for. Its a strong, durable bag. If we ever need another one I know where to go...amazon of course.</li>
            <li> Very good quality.  Easy to pack and allows for much stuff for long-term vacation.</li>
            <li> This travel bag was really nice.  I purchased a large carry on travel bag for my daughter from another seller; and I purchased this  travel bag for my son.  This bag was in the same color black and the same design as the large carry on.  This is a quality bag; and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This has been great, and it is actually a little more roomy that I expected.</li>
            <li> Nice with plenty of room</li>
            <li> I love it for the price, just wish it has a couple more pockets.</li>
            <li> Great bag!! Held my electric shaver, and cord, electric tooth brush with base,, tooth paste, soap and case, all my eye contact supplies, deodorant, and cologne.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it! Big enough to fit larger items but no so big it takes up too much space. Leather is nice and did not smell.</li>
            <li> Well made with genuine leather.  Anyone who thinks it smells has never had real leather.&lt;br /&gt;I would have liked some interior pockets,  but great for the price.</li>
            <li> great travel bag very happy don&#x27;t think I will need to buy another,  this bag will last a long time ,,,, thanks</li>
            <li> The style and functionality of the item is fine.  Unfortuantely, it had such a bad odor that I wouldn&#x27;t keep it in the house.</li>
            <li> Product was as advertised.</li>
            <li> good price and delivered quickly</li>
            <li> I bought my grandson a leather duffle bag for Christmas and this goes great with it.  I went to the dollar store and bought a small first aid kit, and nail clipper kit to go in it.  It made a great gift</li>
            <li> It does the job. However, I found pieces of the leather stuck to the surfaces that have moisture. I now put a washcloth underneath it so that it does not leave residue from the leather. I do like the size and the amount of stuff it holds.</li>
            <li> The kit is beautiful, roomy and luxurious. I have only used it once. The big drawback is the odor, which is overwhelming. I have aired it out, and continue to do so, but the odor permeates anything nearby. I think the smell comes from the leather tanning process. I can only hope it eventually dissipates.</li>
            <li> We love these very, very handy</li>
            <li> i just love this bag.</li>
            <li> OK if you want something cheap that gets the job done. Would not make an impressive gift.&lt;br /&gt;Leather is very thin and seems like it would rip easily.&lt;br /&gt;Liner appears to be satin so I doubt it is waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;If you are a frequent traveler, do not buy.</li>
            <li> Nice size, given to my teen grandson for an international trip. He enjoyed having something to carry his toiletries in.  It&#x27;s leather and has a fairly strong smell of tanning, but maybe that will wear off over time.</li>
            <li> soft leather and large enough for all my needs.holds shaving cream, hair spray without a problem. great bag for the money.</li>
            <li> My husband luv it, very nice</li>
            <li> I purchased this bag and it exceeded my expectation of what I wanted. The price was very reasonable and I would recommend a five star rating for this product.</li>
            <li> It is good leather, well made, great price but what the hell else can you say about a leather bag?</li>
            <li> I would rate it a 5 star for size, it is large, but wish the base of it was firm, sturdy and padded. Its too soft.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.  I was extremely pleased.  I wished I had order several more after seeing how nice it was.</li>
            <li> Where to begin. I bought this to replace my rather embarrassing fabric travel bag that had been around for a couple of years. This product has some great features, but could still do with some improvements. I have used this on three trips, including one overseas, and had no issue with the amount of products inside. The bag is sturdy, and I have no doubt it will last several years. I just wish it had more compartments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size! This has some serious space, and the zipper does a great job keeping it all in&lt;br /&gt;The outside leather keeps moisture out and gives the bag a great visual appeal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The patchwork leather, up close, can look a little awkward.&lt;br /&gt;Having only two compartments, the large middle one and one on the outside, doesn&#x27;t leave you much space for organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/10/13-- After several months using this product, there are some major signs of wear and tear. The bottom looks frayed and strained, with the leather pulling apart. The bag is still holding up, however the outside apperance doesn&#x27;t look anywhere near as nice as it did when I bought it.</li>
            <li> Good thin leather travel bag</li>
            <li> The hubs loved it, perfect size.</li>
            <li> works fine, good size. over powering leather smell. Air out for a couple of days great price. extra pocket what I needed.</li>
            <li> That sure looks like a nice enough bag, doesn&#x27;t it? Too bad they don&#x27;t have any. But they&#x27;ll be happy to send you a completely different bag without telling you. Just change the picture to a bag you actually have in stock. Why is that so difficult?</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B003A9UL20 Large Genuine Black Leather Travel Kit Shaving Mens Toiletry Bag Mosaic Pattern]  Great product, leather is beautiful, very pleased with this, very roomy!</li>
            <li> Beautiful toiletry bag.  It was a gift and the recipient loved it.  The price was very reasonable and I would have expected to pay much more for this quality.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do any heavy travel. This bag gets my toiletries into bathroom when I shower and shave. Its nice to have everything in one place in an easy to carry case.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my husband as a replacement. He likes the kit. For the price, I should have bought another one. Good value.</li>
            <li> Nice looking bag and will serve my needs!</li>
            <li> Real Leather and a strong made item.. recieved before time and was amazed to find it of real leather and size was perfect for holding all one would need for the weekend of fun</li>
            <li> very nice just what i wanted</li>
            <li> I was expecting a top opening, not a side opening kit. It does  seem like good leather that will hold up well. I expect that it will work just fine after I get used to it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful &amp; roomie but the smell of the leather is absolutely awful!  I can&#x27;t give this to my nephew for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Wish inside was different color so could see in the bag better, wish for inside pocket, would buy it again</li>
            <li> It is a nice bag. Got some nice compliments on it. Suits my needs. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations and was a great price!  Can&#x27;t wait to use them on my next trip.</li>
            <li> great and reasonably priced</li>
            <li> My previous review was 0 stars, based on not being able to review the product as it had not arrived. Five days after the day it was supposed to be here, I have finally been able to look at the bag. It feels thin and soft, but not cheap. I think it will work great. It was bigger than I imagined, so he will just have to find more stuff to fill it.</li>
            <li> Would have been a 4 or 5 because it was just what my husband needed for travel and its nice looking, but only a 3 because its not holding up as well as I would have liked.  The inside lining its torn  and is not quite as sturdy as it seemed when first purchased.</li>
            <li> The seam was already separated on one side when I opened the package. It is very poorly made.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome bag. My husband still uses daily as his man bag. High quality.</li>
            <li> returned this item had a really bad smell to it  (sicken smell)  not a leather smell</li>
            <li> Great. Extra large and light weight. Perfect for packing all the necessary toiletries for a short or longer trip.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice case. Perfect</li>
            <li> I have pleasantly surprised at the size and quality of this bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those buys that I believe in which you get more than your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Good soft leather.  An inch wider and an inch longer than most.&lt;br /&gt;Only two zippered compartments - a third would have been nice.</li>
            <li> It does everything I need it to do !</li>
            <li> Good quality for the cost! Quick delivery but it had a processing smell that overwhelmed until it had been aired out for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my son for a Christmas present.  It was a great size and the leather was  nice and a big hit.</li>
            <li> For the price this is a good bag.  Plenty of room for cans of shaving cream and other items.  Zippers work smoothly.  Worth having.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a trip to California to be with my friends sister inlaw, what a bitch she turned out to be</li>
            <li> It seems so good when you first opened the package...I just love the smell of leather and its a perfect size.</li>
            <li> The bag stunk! It smelled musty like it was left in a damp place for storage. I sent it back.</li>
            <li> My husband is very picky about his dopp kits, so I wasn&#x27;t sure that this would suit his fancy. But it&#x27;s a perfect size &amp; the leather is really nice.</li>
            <li> Good so far.  A little bigger than I thought it was, but for the price it was a good deal.</li>
            <li> Nice leather shaving bag. Leather is very soft and supple. Carry loop is a little fragile looking compared to similar bags that I have purchased in the past. Still a very good value.</li>
            <li> Son liked the soft leather</li>
            <li> Wonderful value for the price, excellent quality very please with purchase and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have had the same leather shave kit for 37 years and it was time for a new one. I saw this and the price and thought no way, it would be crap. This is a really nice travel shave kit. Made from good quality leather. If your in the need for one, I would recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;Update: 2 years later. Aug 4, 2016&lt;br /&gt;My dad turned 83 and had a heart attack. He didn&#x27;t have a decent shave bag, so I loaned him this one. Which by the way, still after two years, looks brand new. My mom commandeered it. So I had to order another. Looking back over the terrible reviews, I really don&#x27;t understand why. My bag has no smell, it&#x27;s supple and soft, top quality leather. Good zipper. If the new one arrives and is lousy, I will update my review again.</li>
            <li> Very soft leather. too soft Won&#x27;t stand up while using it.</li>
            <li> I use it to carry all my toiletries at the gym.  Nice soft leather bag, and I put my disposable razors in the side zippered pocket.  It&#x27;s a little bigger than I though it would be, and I like that.  I carry a little more stuff than I did in my old one (lost the old one).  I&#x27;m very pleased with it and would buy it again if I lose this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s of decent quality, but certainly not top quality.  The leather is created from small 1-3 inch swatches.  If you&#x27;re not expecting anything too fancy then it will work out just fine for you.  I just throw my razor and accessories in there and it works fine for it&#x27;s job.  The zipper and handle are attached well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for when we travel.  It is just the right size.  It holds a lot and the leather is really soft.  He really loves it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the black leather  bag and was very pleased. I looked at several bags and for the price this is quite a deal. The space inside is great. The quality is awesome. would recommend this bag for any guy.</li>
            <li> I NEEDED SOMETHING TO KEEP MY DIABETIC DAILY SUPPLYS IN AND ITS PERFECT. IT IS I FEEL JUST A LITTLE PRICY BUT I DO RECOMMEND IT.</li>
            <li> A gift to my son who loves it.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected</li>
            <li> My husband does not like keeping his wallet on him.  He has always had a travel shaving kit for this purpose to keep in the car.  His twenty year old one was falling apart and I could not find anything in the stores that I knew would please him at a reasonable price.  This one was exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> For the purpose of replacing my old kit, this was a good and adequate bag. I believe that it will last for long time.</li>
            <li> This is somewhat of a Frankenstein bag, it looks like its put together with lots of small (2x2&amp;#34;) pieces of leather. I didn&#x27;t realize this when I was buying it and it doesn&#x27;t bother me, just found it a little bit strange. This bag was made in China which may give a hint as to why it looks like this.&lt;br /&gt;This bag held up great for me with heavy duty use, you may think, how can a travel kit get heavy duty use? Well, using it in a basic training environment for 16 weeks is what I consider heavy duty. I had no issues with the zipper or any tears in the bag itself. Plenty of room to pack a full sized set of shaving cream, body wash, shampoo, razor, deodorant, and a few other odds and ends. I used the side zipper pocket for a nail clipper set and a small shaving mirror.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this pouch, I put ALL of my bathroom stuff in there (not just for travel, but all). Nice leather, great handle, big and ample. Just perfect.</li>
            <li> perfect for my son when he travles.</li>
            <li> outstanding product for the price</li>
            <li> Kit met expectations and am very satisfied with this product.  Leather is very soft.</li>
            <li> have not had a problem use to carry shower and shaving equip around holds large load  wonder how long it will last</li>
            <li> Very nice got it before due date Thanks</li>
            <li> Somewhat small, but great prise.  Plan on using for just packing medications for trips.  Husband was excited about having an additional bag.</li>
            <li> This bag is very nice and roomy, not stiff so you can fit it in a suitcase. My son is happy with it.</li>
