            <li>My adult Son &amp; Daughter have be buying me an assortment of very gooD and very high priced &#x27;After-Shaves &amp; Colognes&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It is more hassle than it is worth to return the product</li>
            <li>To find 2 big bottles at such a great price was great.</li>
            <li>halston z-14  and armani code are the two best colognes on the market for men in my humble opion.</li>
            <li>My Girlfriend loves Halston on me  she says it makes smell soo sexy and HOT</li>
            <li>It has a unique non-alcohol woodsy, spicy fragrance.</li>
            <li>Just like the original cologne scent I remember.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find in stores, and Amazon is the best source I&#x27;ve found for it.</li>
            <li>Halston Z-14 is an old favorite of mine and not always easy to find in stores.</li>
            <li>This set was reasonably priced and quickly shipped.</li>
            <li>will be ordering more later</li>
            <li>Love the scent,very sophisticated, not too strong, and not too expensive.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I received deals at 1/2 the costs and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>This is an old standard that never fails to deliver.  </li>
            <li>I checked the bottles to be sure the Cologne is a spray type because some reviewers complained about that.</li>
            <li>AS MUCH A OLD SPICE.</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t last much longer than an hour.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure this is not genuine Z-14 and has been watered down considerably.</li>
            <li>Z-14 used to cost as much as the other designer fragrances - such spray colognes, 4.2 oz.</li>

            <li> Good large size. Smells fine, as is great.</li>
            <li> Good price, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> The item description indicates it is one bottle of Halston Z-14 spray cologne and one bottle of Halston Z-14 aftershave. What I received is two bottles of Aftershave. It appears someone along the line did a switch of product. It is more hassle than it is worth to return the product so I am keeping it but I am not happy about it.</li>
            <li> Halston Z14 has been my cologne and aftershave of choice for many, many years.  Love the scent,very sophisticated, not too strong, and not too expensive.  It was a great price, too.  Much less than I would have paid at a department store.  Also, when I ordered, it was the week before Christmas and I was warned that it would be after Christmas before the set would arrive.  Not a problem, it was for me anyway.  However, the next day, Amazon informed me my set had been shipped and it was delivered to my home two days later.  Now that is service.</li>
            <li> Great price and delivery!</li>
            <li> Terrible  smell.not fresh</li>
            <li> i love these cologne, smell delicious</li>
            <li> My husband uses this colonge and it is getting harder and harder to find the after-shave splash.  Most is just the spray colonge.  To find 2 big bottles at such a great price was great.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using Halston Z-14 for a while so when he run out I searched on Amazon and found this great deal of the Cologne Spray and Aftershave 4.2 ounces each! I checked the bottles to be sure the Cologne is a spray type because some reviewers complained about that. It was a spray bottle and the aftershave is the one you have to dab on your fingers so as to apply on shaved sides. It does&#x27;nt smell any different from what he has used in years!</li>
            <li> I specifically searched for a combo pack of cologne aftershave LOTION. I received a splash on after shave which I cannot use. You should make sure it is lotion before you promote it this way!</li>
            <li> The product was in the size I had ordered. It is a good gift to give for a person that like this product</li>
            <li> My man smells so good now.  Have loved this stuff for years and still has not let me down.&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend!</li>
            <li> halston z-14  and armani code are the two best colognes on the market for men in my humble opion. great price and fast shipping through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and so does my girl it lasts a long time unlike these other colognes that last an hour. My favorite and will definitely buy more!!!</li>
            <li> THE GIFT SET IS PERFECT. THE COLOGNE SMELLS REALLY GOOD. SO DOES THE AFTER SHAVE. I LOVE IT AS MUCH A OLD SPICE. EVEN MY HUSBAND LIKES IT.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy, you can return when it come to you and the product has gone bad.  I buy this normally at my local drugstore and recommend you do the same.</li>
            <li> My Girlfriend loves Halston on me  she says it makes smell soo sexy and HOT it turns her on  will be ordering more later</li>
            <li> I have always liked Halston for Women.  When I saw the product for men, I gave it as a Christmas gift.  The person who&lt;br /&gt;received the cologne was very pleased with the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband, but was given water with a hint of Halston Z-14. Both bottles are like this. When he uses it it lasts 1-2 minutes. I feel totally ripped off, as I&#x27;ve never had this happen, but then again I bought from different sellers.&lt;br /&gt;Judee Newman&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Bought this for my granddad. He had been paying double this price for the same product. We were both very happy.</li>
            <li> It is amazing . But could you please add the perfume kind because I see the Toilette kind . Thanks</li>
            <li> Halston Z-14 is an old favorite of mine and not always easy to find in stores. This set was reasonably priced and quickly shipped. From my standpoint the scent is woodsy and has few flowery components. It&#x27;s just a tiny bit musky so it won&#x27;t work for women.</li>
            <li> I love Halston Z-14, been using for 40 years. The combo set is a great buy at $20.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy and use this Cologne set.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to my son. I honestly have no idea if he likes it or not.</li>
            <li> great price and fast delivery.  thanx</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Halston Z-14. It&#x27;s too bad this product doesn&#x27;t have that smell.  They&#x27;ve changed the formula, and it no longer has that smoldering Halston scent. The cologne smells like grass, and the aftershave smells like lighter fluid. I am deeply disappointed. (And slightly nauseous.)</li>
            <li> Great product.  Great price.  Bought for my husband.  We both love it!</li>
            <li> As the saying goes, better than good.</li>
            <li> This is an old standard that never fails to deliver.  Does not have the name and flash of other cologne but meets expectations year after year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Halston Z-14 since the late 1970s. It is my all-time/all-around favorite. It has a unique non-alcohol woodsy, spicy fragrance. It lasts all day. I wear cologne daily, even on casual days. I wear different scents through the week. Z-14 used to cost as much as the other designer fragrances - such spray colognes, 4.2 oz. now costing around $80. Now, it is so relatively inexpensive. It is hard to find in stores, and Amazon is the best source I&#x27;ve found for it. Be sure to get the Halston Z-14 in the spray. I believe the after-shave only comes in splash, and it was just a bonus! It is so inexpensive to even try it now for someone who never has worn it.</li>
            <li> WILL TELL ALL MY FRIENDS ABOUT THE SAVINGS.AT THESE PRICES I&#x27;LL STOCK-UP AND WILL ALWAYS CHECK HERE BEFORE I BUY AGAIN !!!</li>
            <li> At 70 I have been using Halston for 50 years</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this is not genuine Z-14 and has been watered down considerably. The scent doesn&#x27;t last much longer than an hour.</li>
            <li> Just like the original cologne scent I remember. It smells really good and the after shave feels good to the skin also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used HALSTONS before and liked it. My adult Son &amp; Daughter have be buying me an assortment of very gooD and very high priced &#x27;After-Shaves &amp; Colognes&#x27;. I need to purchase some and I was outraged at the prices at the retail mercantile s. Checking Amazon I received deals at 1/2 the costs and shipping was fast.</li>
