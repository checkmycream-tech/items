            <li>I feel great after I wear it</li>
            <li>I use this every 3 days it makes your skin feel great and tightens you up.  </li>
            <li>A great purchase</li>
            <li>I use products like this to keep it looking great, not to improve what I&#x27;ve got.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t recommend this more!</li>
            <li>and when I wake up, my skin is flawless and looks pretty damn good :)</li>
            <li>After using the masque and then the lotion, my skin looked AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to lie, upon close inspection, of course you can see the pores still because they don&#x27;t just magically disappear, but whatever this stuff does, it makes the appearance of your skin look MUCH better.  </li>
            <li>I do love the smell, but I don&#x27;t like the sensation on my skin.</li>
            <li>Twice a week after cleaning your skin, and you&#x27;ll feel the magic.</li>

            <li>and this stuff is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Really good masque, i can feel my skin clean and fresh after using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got good genes, so my skin doesn&#x27;t need a whole lot of help.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high expectations, which is maybe why I was impressed so much, but I absolutely thought this worked AMAZINGLY well.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and comes off easily.  </li>
            <li>and I enjoy using.  </li>
            <li>I put a light coat on before bed time</li>
            <li>After I put it on, the place covered feels hot, and after washing them out, it seems to be better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried alot of beauty masks and this is one of the best - far better than Glamglow which sells at twice the price for half the amount.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had huge pores (and never thought much of it), but my skin has gone from looking like the surface of the moon to looking like a smooth piece of paper.</li>
            <li>On their website, it says \\&quot;Our Rare Earth masque helps purify and detoxify skin while minimizing the appearance of enlarged pores.</li>
            <li>Kiehl&#x27;s \\&quot;Rare Earth Deep Pore Cleansing Masque\\&quot; sounded exotic.</li>
            <li>It was irritative on my face, but it took away all the debris from my pores and left my skin clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Wikipedia listed the company&#x27;s history and I was pretty excited to try this new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I couldn&#x27;t find the list of ingredients anywhere, that&#x27;s the first thing I looked at when the product arrived.</li>
            <li>And I have married with a model.</li>
            <li>Very deep cleansing- wish it was more affordable</li>
            <li>My pores appear smaller and my face feels very clean after using it.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Rare Earth facial wash and received free samples of the masque and the lotion to go along with it.  </li>
            <li>I feel very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this face mask.</li>
            <li>i have been using this rare earth deep pore cleansing masque for two years.</li>

            <li>But now, with Kiehl Rare Deep pore Cleansing Masque everything changed.  </li>
            <li>Use it one a week, it removes the impurities on my face, leaving clear skin and allow my skin to &amp;#34;breathe&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Formulated with Amazonian White Clay to gently draw out oil, dirt and toxins that can clog pores.</li>
            <li>The addition of Oatmeal and Aloe Vera will help soothe, hydrate and protect sensitive skin.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but I&#x27;ve already seen a HUGE difference in my face.</li>
            <li>No doubt I could send the product back, but to package it up and pay for shipping to send it back is too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li>Feels great, doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the masque twice since I got it, but so far I like it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have that instant amazing glow that other products give, but it does seem to do some serious deep pore cleaning.</li>
            <li>This is very comparable to Proactive&#x27;s refining mask (same smell and active ingredients)</li>
            <li>Seriously - this product is WELL worth every penny of it!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of products that say they \\&quot;minimize\\&quot; pores, which don&#x27;t actually work.  I bought the Rare Earth facial wash and received free samples of the masque and the lotion to go along with it.  I didn&#x27;t have high expectations, which is maybe why I was impressed so much, but I absolutely thought this worked AMAZINGLY well.  I can&#x27;t stop recommending it to my friends because it&#x27;s so great.     I have bigger pores around my nose/top of cheek area and then also on my nose and I also have some redness around my nose area.  After using the masque and then the lotion, my skin looked AMAZING.  I&#x27;m not going to lie, upon close inspection, of course you can see the pores still because they don&#x27;t just magically disappear, but whatever this stuff does, it makes the appearance of your skin look MUCH better.  I also noticed the redness around my nose was gone as well.  When you put the lotion on, you can feel the skin tightening, but your skin isn&#x27;t left dry or yucky.    Seriously - this product is WELL worth every penny of it!  I don&#x27;t know Kiehl&#x27;s return policy, but I&#x27;m sure they would give you your money back if you absolutely hated it, but I can&#x27;t imagine that being the case!  Go try it!!!</li>
            <li> I am 61 and you would think I am way past breakouts, but not really.  I use this once or twice a week, and my skin has been great.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned when posting my review of [[ASIN:B000K7J39M LATHER White Clay Deep Pore Cleansing Mask, 4-Ounce Jar]], I planned to order a different clay mask to compare. Kiehl&#x27;s \\&quot;Rare Earth Deep Pore Cleansing Masque\\&quot; sounded exotic. On their website, it says \\&quot;Our Rare Earth masque helps purify and detoxify skin while minimizing the appearance of enlarged pores. Formulated with Amazonian White Clay to gently draw out oil, dirt and toxins that can clog pores. The addition of Oatmeal and Aloe Vera will help soothe, hydrate and protect sensitive skin.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I couldn&#x27;t find the list of ingredients anywhere, that&#x27;s the first thing I looked at when the product arrived. Here&#x27;s what I read:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Kaolin, Bentonite, Propanediol, Glycerin, CI 77891/Titanium Dioxide, Caprylic/ Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol, Lecithin, Aloe barbadensis/ Aloe barbadensis Leaf Juice, Avena sativa Flour/ Oat Kernel Flour, Allantoin Fmla 725095/4 code F.I.L.D34833/1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While researching for the ingredients, I did find out a little bit about the company. L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al acquired Kiehl&#x27;s in 2000 and has been around since 1851. Wikipedia listed the company&#x27;s history and I was pretty excited to try this new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My excitement died after one use. The reason I didn&#x27;t love-love the LATHER White Clay Deep Pore Cleansing was because of the tea tree. I do love the smell, but I don&#x27;t like the sensation on my skin. With Kiehl&#x27;s mask, it flat out burned. I stuck it out for two treatments and stopped. No doubt I could send the product back, but to package it up and pay for shipping to send it back is too much of a hassle. I&#x27;ll consider this a lesson and will go back to using [[ASIN:B000K7J39M LATHER White Clay Deep Pore Cleansing Mask, 4-Ounce Jar]].</li>
            <li> I only used for couple of times now, but I think it may works. After I put it on, the place covered feels hot, and after washing them out, it seems to be better.</li>
            <li> Best one on the market. I&#x60;ve been using it for 3 decades now and I recieve compliments on my complexion all the time and I&#x60;m 64.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found for correcting my aging skin.</li>
            <li> Really good masque, i can feel my skin clean and fresh after using it.</li>
            <li> I use this mask once a week and it has reduced the amount of shine I get throughout the day. I may use it twice a week as the weather gets warmer, but for now it dries my skin quite well using it just once a week. Feels great, doesn&#x27;t smell bad. Definitely a win.</li>
            <li> I use this product weekly. I feel great after I wear it and my skin is noticeably softer after use.</li>
            <li> i have been using this rare earth deep pore cleansing masque for two years. Twice a week after cleaning your skin, and you&#x27;ll feel the magic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried alot of beauty masks and this is one of the best - far better than Glamglow which sells at twice the price for half the amount. No HUGE changes to my skin, it just looks a bit more radiant each time I use this mask (so I use it often!)</li>
            <li> I got it three days ago, and I tried once. It was irritative on my face, but it took away all the debris from my pores and left my skin clean and smooth.  It was an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost 2 years. One bottle can last about 1 year. This is the only clay mask I&#x27;m using now. Use it one a week, it removes the impurities on my face, leaving clear skin and allow my skin to &amp;#34;breathe&amp;#34;. My skin can absorb skincare products much better after using the mask. Very good product.</li>
            <li> It‘s a very good maque.Black  out of the pore.I feel very well.And I will buy it again. You know&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> My fav face cream. I use this every 3 days it makes your skin feel great and tightens you up.  Best mask ive used</li>
            <li> i have been using this rare earth deep pore cleansing masque for two years. Twice a week after cleaning your skin, and you&#x27;ll feel the magic.</li>
            <li> I really like this face mask. It goes on smoothly and comes off easily.  My face seems to like it and I enjoy using.  My pores appear smaller and my face feels very clean after using it.  A great purchase and you can never go wrong with Khiel&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> In the past my face was terrible! It was like a trash, with a lot of spots and wounds. But now, with Kiehl Rare Deep pore Cleansing Masque everything changed.  I feel like Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, all these stars. And I have married with a model. Even my self-confidence has changed. Today I know that I am the best, the coolest guy in my city...</li>
            <li> Very deep cleansing- wish it was more affordable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but I&#x27;ve already seen a HUGE difference in my face. I&#x27;ve always had huge pores (and never thought much of it), but my skin has gone from looking like the surface of the moon to looking like a smooth piece of paper. Couldn&#x27;t recommend this more!</li>

It doesn&#x27;t have that instant amazing glow that other products give, but it does seem to do some serious deep pore cleaning.

For that purpose, I&#x27;m happy with the product!</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne prone skin and this stuff is pretty good. Dries up my skin, tightens my pores, even dries up my problem areas. I put a light coat on before bed time and when I wake up, my skin is flawless and looks pretty damn good :) Not left with any shine or acne. However, I have used cheaper products that do the same thing. This is very comparable to Proactive&#x27;s refining mask (same smell and active ingredients) so know what you&#x27;re buying.</li>
