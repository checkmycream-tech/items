            <li>so when they stopped carrying it, I was glad to be able to find this and the sugar scrub at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>My favorite scent is coconut.  </li>
            <li>me start by saying I have never smelled a better lotion.  </li>
            <li>Remember before we knew better how we&#x27;d lay out in the sun with our Hawaiian Tropic lotion.</li>
            <li>This is that and better.  </li>

            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Ok so I have a history as a Melaleuca rep</li>
            <li>&amp; I used it spearing lay ( mostly after shaving my legs).</li>
            <li>It did all that and more.  </li>
            <li>But my favorite is the coconut lime scent.</li>
            <li>For more information on this product go to (...)</li>
            <li>This lotion is okay.  </li>
            <li>ALOT:)...</li>
            <li>I also love their Shea body butter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>A BIT MORE ONLINE</li>
            <li>And love the fact that its squeeze out and not with a pump...</li>
            <li>The scent is ok, the moisture is ok, the scent is strong, although I love the refreshing citrus smell.  </li>
            <li>Make your hands so soft and beautiful, it&#x27;s healthy to.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells so good and is very moisturizing!  </li>
            <li>Smell is lovely too not too strong &amp; does not trigger my allergies.</li>
            <li>Easy to get out of tube.</li>
            <li>very nice and thick smells great</li>
            <li>A nice fragrance, but sweet and powerful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a huge fan of Bath and Body Works and have been using them for two decades (or longer).  </li>
            <li>This lotion is really hydrating but goes on nice and light so it doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling pasty.  </li>
            <li>The lotion itself is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It leaves  your skin feeling so silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>SO SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>I cannot even explain how smooth.</li>
            <li>STILL SMOOTH and</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also filled with wholesome goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>The scent is light, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and goes on smooth, but I much prefer the Tea Hut body butter.</li>
            <li>Smells so good and leaves skin soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Excited to fine.</li>
            <li>Smells clean doesn&#x27;t overpower any perfume i wear</li>
            <li>/&gt;BaBW is pretty strong and rather sweet smelling.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing and a smell that will make you want to put on your Hawaiian shirt.</li>
            <li>Came very fast!</li>
            <li>Given the all the positive reviews about this lotion, I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and fades quickly enough that it doesn&#x27;t interfere with perfume.</li>
            <li>Many of them are natural and/or organic.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be absorbed the way we like.</li>
            <li>but I didnt use it right away, because I wanted to finish my Bath and Body Works (here on out referred to as BaBW).  </li>
            <li>Their products work even better than many other brands that I have purchased at more than double the price.</li>
            <li>So not only is it amazing smelling, really moisturizing</li>
            <li>Plus, this is the only lotion that I can currently use on my face because it does not cause any allergic reactions and provides great moisture.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to purchase multiple times to keep up with demand:-)</li>
            <li>so much easier to travel with!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the lotion, body butter, shower wash and the sugar body scrub and every single one is just fantastic!</li>
            <li>Beats out a lot of the more expensive lotions i have tried and this scent is amazing without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>and my hands are still as smooth this morning as they were last night when I put it on.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It is RIDICULOUS good smelling.  </li>
            <li>Really sweet, actually.</li>
            <li>We can&#x27;t say anything bad about this moisturizer, but can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, I love the coconut lime scent, but after a few minutes it changes.</li>
            <li>The scent is AMAZING; subtle coconut with a hint</li>
            <li>It is the first product I brought from Tree Hut and won&#x27;t be the last!</li>
            <li>Not oily and makes your skin soft!</li>
            <li>Not greasy, but substantial enough to actually feel like it&#x27;s getting the job done, and with a light coconut scent, it&#x27;s simply</li>
            <li>I am currently oversees and my skin has been super dry..</li>
            <li>The scent is also nice as well, very subtle but still there.  </li>
            <li>it also moisturizes very well and has improved the condition of my skin and my son&#x27;s who has really dry skin.</li>
            <li>For personal, reasons it had to give up my Melaleuca business so not more Renew on the cheap.</li>
            <li>This is the same quality as most of the expensive creams bought in classy stores.</li>
            <li>Started using this stuff exclusively, works great &amp; very little greasy feeling with it helps with my very bad feet too smooth as a baby butt in 2wks</li>
            <li>This is good lotion I recommend to anyone who suffers from almost to dry skin.</li>

            <li> YES, all night long.  </li>
            <li> for feet, elbows and hands which tend to get really dry.</li>
            <li> It is also quite dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t exactly fade; it just sort of changes into a weird smell is the only way I can describe it.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a lotion that would provide enough moisture and would not contain harsh chemicals for a while.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m glad I found it at a store in my area for under $5 because it is absolutely the worst lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion with the hopes that it would deeply moistuize my elbows, heel and other areas in need of a little</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way.  </li>
            <li> some of the other Tree Hut products have.</li>
            <li> But one night I put a little on because it was in reach.  </li>
            <li> As long as Amazon doesn&#x27;t get crazy and raise the price, I will definitely keep buying from them.  </li>
            <li> BaBW is a thick lotion and a little bit sticky.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin all-over that is prone to all sorts of bad reactions to chemicals in lotions, soaps and shampoo.</li>
            <li> I mean that...and all 100 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> seriously need to buy this lotion.</li>
            <li> It retains a little bad smell on the skin.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> My cats hate it : (</li>
            <li> I used this lotion one time and was covered with a horrible rash and hives.  </li>
            <li> NOT pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;Worst of all, it was making my eyes burn horribly if I rubbed them when I had this lotion on.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Taking me taxes unlawfully</li>
            <li> I found this product initially at a popular Beauty Supply chain so when they stopped carrying it, I was glad to be able to find this and the sugar scrub at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for feet, elbows and hands which tend to get really dry. The smell is nice and fades quickly enough that it doesn&#x27;t interfere with perfume.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion but does not have the deep fragrance some of the other Tree Hut products have.</li>
            <li> Only got one and I paid for a 2-pack! It feels nice and has a great fragrance...very tropical and soothing</li>
            <li> very nice - great scent and smooth lotion, a good value for the price; definitely smells like a tropical vacation!  Looking forward to trying related products soon.</li>
            <li> This does smell amazing and It soaks in nicely with no greasy feeling but it leaves your hands still needing moisture after it dries (5min)....</li>
            <li> Could I have 100 stars, please?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say this is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  I mean that...and all 100 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a huge fan of Bath and Body Works and have been using them for two decades (or longer).  My favorite scent is coconut.  THIS is BETTER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My DH got me this for Christmas but I didnt use it right away, because I wanted to finish my Bath and Body Works (here on out referred to as BaBW).  But one night I put a little on because it was in reach.  Now I dont want to finish my BaBW.  What am I going to do with it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by saying I have never smelled a better lotion.  It is RIDICULOUS good smelling.  It&#x27;s like summer in a bottle.  Remember before we knew better how we&#x27;d lay out in the sun with our Hawaiian Tropic lotion. This is that and better.  BETTER I say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was so good I wanted to eat it. It smelled so good I wanted to wake my husband up and tell him how amazing it was.  It smelled so good I wanted to slap my mama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BaBW is pretty strong and rather sweet smelling.  This is not like that.  It&#x27;s more subdued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not just the smell though. (And trust me, it smells amazing.)  The lotion itself is fabulous.  BaBW is a thick lotion and a little bit sticky.  This is a thinner lotion.  A little goes a LONG way.  It&#x27;s not at all sticky. It leaves  your skin feeling so silky smooth.  SO SMOOTH. I cannot even explain how smooth. I&#x27;ve had a bath and washed my hands twice and my hands are still as smooth this morning as they were last night when I put it on.  YES, all night long.  STILL SMOOTH and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can almost pronounce all the ingredients.  Many of them are natural and/or organic. So not only is it amazing smelling, really moisturizing but it&#x27;s also filled with wholesome goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You seriously need to buy this lotion.</li>
            <li> One of the best and  hand cream I ever have. Make your hands so soft and beautiful, it&#x27;s healthy to.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion. I have used it before, but couldn&#x27;t find it any longer. Excited to fine. Came very fast! A++</li>
            <li> Wonderful is rich and non drying which is great at 6,000 feet.  Smells clean doesn&#x27;t overpower any perfume i wear</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so good and is very moisturizing!  As long as Amazon doesn&#x27;t get crazy and raise the price, I will definitely keep buying from them.  The Almond scent is also insanely good.</li>
            <li> I order this body lotion along with the matching sugar scrub that comes in a set of 3 and as a set it&#x27;s like spa day every time I take a shower! The lotion makes my skin feel so silky smooth! I see no reason to ever change my lotion again. It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs quickly. I love the scent and the way it feels! I will be ordering this again and again!</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion ever. I love it I had ran out and I don&#x27;t want to run out so I purchase 2 sets. This is good lotion I recommend to anyone who suffers from almost to dry skin. Thank you</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love? The scent is AMAZING; subtle coconut with a hint a lime and both the moisture and the fragrance linger for hours after application. And the best part? This company does not test on animals. Their products work even better than many other brands that I have purchased at more than double the price. I cannot recommend it enough!</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Super moisturizing and a smell that will make you want to put on your Hawaiian shirt.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell and makes skin feel so nice &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> The scent is ok, the moisture is ok, the scent is strong, although I love the refreshing citrus smell.  My cats hate it : (</li>
            <li> Best lotion from this company. Smells great too</li>
            <li> I used this lotion one time and was covered with a horrible rash and hives.  I would definately do a spot test on yourself before using this product.  Im still suffering from the effects of it after 3 days.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It is the first product I brought from Tree Hut and won&#x27;t be the last! I am currently oversees and my skin has been super dry..i was using St Ives but my skin was still dry and starting to break out. With two days of using this, my skin is already smoother and softer. If you need a good mosturizer, this is it. The scent is also nice as well, very subtle but still there.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Ok so I have a history as a Melaleuca rep (use to think they had the best lotion on the market called Renew). My sister bought this for me one winter &amp; I used it spearing lay ( mostly after shaving my legs). For personal, reasons it had to give up my Melaleuca business so not more Renew on the cheap. Started using this stuff exclusively, works great &amp; very little greasy feeling with it helps with my very bad feet too smooth as a baby butt in 2wks just amazing stuff. I now have it as part of my subscribe &amp; save with Amazon. Smell is lovely too not too strong &amp; does not trigger my allergies.</li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t say anything bad about this moisturizer, but can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best either. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be absorbed the way we like. And the smell is, well, very strong. A nice fragrance, but sweet and powerful.</li>
            <li> This product is exceptional! I would recommend it to all those people who have skin problems wanting a healthy skin!</li>
            <li> This is the same quality as most of the expensive creams bought in classy stores. We reordered another two and will order again.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin all-over that is prone to all sorts of bad reactions to chemicals in lotions, soaps and shampoo. It is also quite dry. I have been searching for a lotion that would provide enough moisture and would not contain harsh chemicals for a while.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion has been a God-sent and is still the best for my very sensitive skin. Plus, this is the only lotion that I can currently use on my face because it does not cause any allergic reactions and provides great moisture.</li>
            <li> I try not to use anything else. This product moisturizes my skin without feeling greasy and the scent is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> smells great, skin feels great, cant beat the price. Gave as gifts and everyone loves this and the body scrub as well. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> ITEM CAME AS DESCRIBED, MY MOTHER IN LAW LOVES THIS STUFF, MAKES YOURSSKIN FEEL SO SOFT, AND NOT GREASY AT ALL, AND SMELLS WONDERFUL, I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE</li>
            <li> very nice and thick smells great</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion with the hopes that it would deeply moistuize my elbows, heel and other areas in need of a little \\&quot;tlc.\\&quot;  It did all that and more.  Not greasy, but substantial enough to actually feel like it&#x27;s getting the job done, and with a light coconut scent, it&#x27;s simply terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A plus that my kids now recognize it as my \\&quot;scent.\\&quot;  Really sweet, actually.</li>
            <li> Smells good and works as good as Bath and body works but for much cheaper.  Fast shipping too! Easy to get out of tube.</li>
            <li> I just love the Tree Huts products! I&#x27;ve tried the lotion, body butter, shower wash and the sugar body scrub and every single one is just fantastic! I&#x27;ve tried the brazilian nut, the original shea and the coconut lime scents and loved them all. But my favorite is the coconut lime scent. The sugar body scrub is awesome!!  For more information on this product go to (...)</li>
            <li> This lotion is okay.  It smells nice and goes on smooth, but I much prefer the Tea Hut body butter.</li>
            <li> I like this product ALOT:)...just wish the fragrance lasted a bit longer...doesn&#x27;t stay with you for long..other than that i like it</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so good and keeps me moisturized for hours!</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells so good and leaves skin soft and not greasy. Everyone is different though.</li>
            <li> I started buying this lotion because it is made in the USA. It is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried. I also love their Shea body butter. I definetly will continue buying this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best moisturizing lotion out there. I used Tree Hut Shea Sugar Body Scrub, Coconut Lime then applied this lotion. The smell isn&#x27;t that bad but it is not the best. It retains a little bad smell on the skin. That&#x27;s just my opinion. But you can feel the softness on your skin when applied.</li>
            <li> I USE TO PURCHASE THIS ITEM AT WALMART BUT THEY STOPPED SELLING IT. COST A BIT MORE ONLINE ONCE THE SHIPPING IS INCLUDED. DECIDED TO START USING SOMETHING ELSE.</li>
            <li> smells wonderful, absolutely delicious. it also moisturizes very well and has improved the condition of my skin and my son&#x27;s who has really dry skin.</li>
            <li> Everyone at work loves this stuff. I&#x27;ve had to purchase multiple times to keep up with demand:-)</li>
            <li> Given the all the positive reviews about this lotion, I was excited to try it. Well, I&#x27;m glad I found it at a store in my area for under $5 because it is absolutely the worst lotion I have ever used. I don&#x27;t get the hype; maybe my skin just does not react well to it. I can handle a greasy lotion as long as it absorbs within ten minutes or so. This stuff just feels like it leaves a film on your skin that doesn&#x27;t absorb and stays there until you wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I love the coconut lime scent, but after a few minutes it changes. It doesn&#x27;t exactly fade; it just sort of changes into a weird smell is the only way I can describe it. NOT pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;Worst of all, it was making my eyes burn horribly if I rubbed them when I had this lotion on. I&#x27;m talking rubbing my eyelid several hours after applying this to my hands.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely going back to my Queen Helene lotion.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for a super good deal!  Beats out a lot of the more expensive lotions i have tried and this scent is amazing without being overpowering.  This lotion is really hydrating but goes on nice and light so it doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling pasty.  Will definitely be buying again!  And love the fact that its squeeze out and not with a pump...so much easier to travel with!</li>
            <li> Smells great...if you like coconut! Not oily and makes your skin soft! This added to the scrub makes a nice gift. The scent is light, not overpowering.</li>
