            <li>It&#x27;s the best and the most elegant fragrances!</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product because I use Versace Bright Crystal.</li>
            <li>I had already loved this perfume &amp; purchased a 1 ounce bottle for fifty bucks at Ulta.</li>
            <li>The price was good.</li>
            <li>and she loves it, not as good as Gaga or some</li>
            <li>I really loved the Versace Bright Crystal, though.</li>
            <li>I found this item to be a fair price.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this fragrance!!!!</li>
            <li>, price is better than the retail stores also, even with the charge of shipping and handling, Happy</li>
            <li>Very sexy smell, not imatation, cheeper on amazon then any where else I&#x27;ve looked.</li>
            <li>I read many great reviews about it</li>
            <li>I LOVE this perfume!</li>
            <li>bottle is beautiful colored glass with a huge, chunky lid that is multifaceted.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Love it I get alot of compliments on it!</li>
            <li>I receive so many compliments on this scent every time I&#x27;m out!</li>
            <li>I work at a perfume store and really liked how Crystal Noir smelled but did not like the price($80).</li>
            <li>this is just as good as the stuff you get from the stores with just a better price.</li>
            <li>i liked it</li>
            <li>pleasant but strong.</li>
            <li>But we smelled a tester to make sure we could get a better priced one through Amazon!</li>
            <li>Thank you SO MUCH!!!!!  :)</li>
            <li>Smells nice I love it and get compliments..</li>
            <li>The scent is made for women who likes heavier scents, the bright crystal is for those that like light floral scents.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my Versace Crystal Noir!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still just as light as the bright crystal, but smells more sumptuous because it&#x27;s made for going out at night.  </li>
            <li>It is a soft exotic vanilla scent that is so awesome.</li>
            <li>many compliments</li>
            <li>and I get so many complements.</li>

            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance which I have been wearing for 4 or more years.  </li>
            <li>When I gave her this, she absolutely was happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with Versace Crystal Noir from Sephora two years ago.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to make sure I still like it..</li>
            <li>This perfume is my favorite for the evening.</li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance.</li>

            <li>I just received this and love it.  </li>

            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim and am pleased.  </li>
            <li>My favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I love this scent and receive so many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li>Scent stays well, better in hair and clothes than on skin.</li>
            <li>Love it as an evening fragrance.</li>
            <li>have had many compliments.</li>
            <li>so glad I can still get it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Crystal Noir..</li>
            <li>and I get so many compliments.  </li>
            <li>Its my favorite and my signature scent, and I always get compliments when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>The scent is captivating but not overbearing just to clarify.</li>
            <li>but it is probably most fitting to wear for dinner date or an evening out dancing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a warm, familiar scent without smelling like candy.</li>
            <li>As compared to a milder scents like maybe Jessica Simpson Fancy love, this scent will probably be strong for some people but this scent is soo sexy and captivating</li>
            <li>I was first given this scent as a gift from my oldest daughter and LOVED IT!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m stuck with it a long time though because I got a 3 oz bottle for a great price!</li>
            <li>I am able to enjoy it once</li>
            <li>I have received my perfume from Amazon and it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>Not only is it identical in every way, except the size of course, it is fresh and perfect.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine how strong the EDP is and have never tried</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this perfume, my new favorite!</li>
            <li>The product was 100 % authentic and item was sent quickly.  </li>
            <li>So clean but something very special as well.</li>
            <li>Also, the look of the bottle is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this perfume from a department store.  </li>
            <li>If you like Angel, you will enjoy Crystal Noir.</li>
            <li>It is my absolute favorite and I&#x27;ve had many compliments.  </li>
            <li>A great, deep and rich perfume that stays on you all day.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s REAL!!!</li>
            <li>Very clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I also buy from zoomkart and these are original.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very warm and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>Men and women - it&#x27;s so classy &amp; sophisticated - try it, won&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
            <li>OMG love this so much</li>
            <li>love this product shipped fast</li>
            <li>I am not a fan of sweet, floral smells and prefer the odor of men&#x27;s colognes over women perfumes.  </li>
            <li>MY absolute favorite perfume and has been for years.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t think it smells as amazing as the other Versace scents, but if you already know you like it, then you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li>I saw it years ago, I didn&#x27;t get it then because I was pregnant(?)</li>
            <li>Reliable and quick to ship and arrive</li>
            <li>Shipping was also quick and that was during Christmas.</li>
            <li>and I have written another review on the real perfume because I loved it so much however this most recent bottle I JUST got from amazon</li>
            <li>Excellent long lasting scent.</li>
            <li>The scent is weak, but the bottle makes a very attractive addition to my dresser collection.  </li>
            <li>They can be a little pricey (that is over 50 dollars usd via Amazon), but compared to department stores which may cost you anything from 80.00 usd upwards, this is a great buy.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife as gift &amp; she has never stopped loving it and showing me some extra care.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice fragrance, but I thought it was too heavy for my taste, and the spiciness reminded me more of a man&#x27;s perfume than a woman&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The product came quickly, and is exactly what you see and expect to smell.</li>
            <li>Beauty Encounter is a great seller too, item arrived on Dec. 24th, which is not bad considering I ordered it late.</li>
            <li>This seller shipped the product quickly and it came NEW in it&#x27;s original box and wrapped in plastic.</li>
            <li>scent itself seems like coconuts, spicy florals and fruits, kind of exotic and hard to describe.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I like your perfume.\\&quot; My other favorite is Thierry Mugler Angel, but I found it is wayyyy too strong for an airplane, so I wear that when I&#x27;m going out.</li>
            <li>It does not small ANYTHING like my genuine bottle of Versace Crystal Noir which smells like root beer floats</li>
            <li>Not a big fan of the top</li>
            <li>My favorite, I only use Versace perfume.</li>
            <li>Perfumes are specific to a person, so try first, but my wife loves it, and gets many comments at work on &amp;</li>
            <li>, that is the first sign to know</li>
            <li>Exactly as it is in the store- love purchasing the tester size at such a discount.</li>
            <li>This is a very competitive price, and the bottle I received was fresh and unopened.</li>
            <li>It has a pronounced scent of coconut which I love and mixed with vanilla and amber.</li>
            <li>My husband likes it so that&#x27;s all that really matters right?</li>
            <li>Not often I will purchase much less pay a bill online, but I must say, this was fast, easy, and safe.</li>
            <li>I received it in less then two days which made me even more excited.</li>
            <li>What I love about Versace Crystal Noir (among countless other things) is that it is suitable for every place I go or anything I wear.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume that I&#x27;ve been wearing for a long time now...</li>
            <li>I tried the small .5 bottle and loved it...</li>
            <li>but the new bottle also smells like straight up alcohol!!</li>
            <li>It is not too strong and not a floral scent which is a BIG plus for me and stays with me without having to reapply during the day.</li>
            <li>I just Love this product, it is my 2nd time I am buying it and will buy  again!Awesome smell, long lasting and Lovely!</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, it may be heavy for some, it&#x27;s worth checking out in the store first.</li>
            <li>I am a flight attendant, so I want a scent that will last the day, but isn&#x27;t too strong and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li>Very dressy and ladylike.</li>
            <li>so I place another one since it took too much space.</li>
            <li>I do think it is the real deal</li>
            <li>And how much is it.</li>
            <li>GET THE REAL DEAL</li>
            <li>A real box will have a scan code (box bar code) on the bottom</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s real.  </li>
            <li>You are the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Not the real deal..</li>
            <li>VERY dissapointed.. Will not purchase anything from Amazon again..</li>
            <li>To much money to take the chance.</li>
            <li>The new bottle top for one does not even fit on my old and genuine bottle of Versace Noir for one and the bottle itself is also shaped a little different</li>
            <li>and it only took seconds for me to place an order with the friendly navagation ease of the website....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got such a rich, sensual fragrance</li>
            <li>love this scent, bought a small bottle and then ended up getting the big bottle for my birthday, smells very clean.</li>
            <li>my favorite perfume smells a little minty and citrus.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fantastic, my order arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>So many compliments when I wear this in just the few days I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li>careful of the sellers you may buy from as it may not be the original.</li>
            <li>and I could live with all of that</li>
            <li>From the first spray, I could tell I&#x27;d received a watered down version which I suppose is fine if you want to reapply several times a day.  </li>
            <li>Not small at all.</li>
            <li>Nobody has small this perfume and daunt love it.</li>
            <li>so I can be assured I am the first person to open and use the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Not sure if this is authentic.</li>
            <li>She has worn it multiple times and she always thanks me.</li>
            <li>Mature smelling but not \\&quot;grandma-ish\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It is warm and inviting and yet subtle at the same time.</li>
            <li>I have finally found my new signature scent!  </li>
            <li>but in future, I will spend the extra dollar to get the real deal.</li>
            <li>It barely has any fragrance to it.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife who has been buying this same scent for years now and this bottle smells very alcoholish and the smell doesnt last as long as prior bottles bought from Macys.</li>
            <li>what I received was a watered down version of the real deal.</li>
            <li>I usually stick with the parfum but settled for the EDT spray a few months back since that was the only option available at the Ulta store on the particular day that I visited.  </li>

            <li> pleasant but strong.</li>
            <li> But we smelled a tester to make sure we could get a better priced one through Amazon!</li>
            <li> Thank you SO MUCH!!!!!  :)</li>
            <li> Smells nice I love it and get compliments..</li>
            <li> The scent is made for women who likes heavier scents, the bright crystal is for those that like light floral scents.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my Versace Crystal Noir!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still just as light as the bright crystal, but smells more sumptuous because it&#x27;s made for going out at night.  </li>
            <li> It is a soft exotic vanilla scent that is so awesome.</li>
            <li> many compliments</li>
            <li> and I get so many complements.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance...</li>

            <li> so many times i was asked  by ppl as what is this perfume, when I walk in to a restaurant or any shop :)</li>
            <li> So many compliments</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance which I have been wearing for 4 or more years.  </li>
            <li> When I gave her this, she absolutely was happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with Versace Crystal Noir from Sephora two years ago.</li>

            <li> This perfume is my favorite for the evening.</li>

            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and am pleased.  </li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and receive so many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Scent stays well, better in hair and clothes than on skin.</li>
            <li> Love it as an evening fragrance.</li>
            <li> have had many compliments.</li>
            <li> so glad I can still get it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Crystal Noir..</li>
            <li> and I get so many compliments.  </li>
            <li> Its my favorite and my signature scent, and I always get compliments when I wear it.  </li>
            <li> Love the scent</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> The scent is captivating but not overbearing just to clarify.</li>
            <li> but it is probably most fitting to wear for dinner date or an evening out dancing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a warm, familiar scent without smelling like candy.</li>
            <li> As compared to a milder scents like maybe Jessica Simpson Fancy love, this scent will probably be strong for some people but this scent is soo sexy and captivating</li>
            <li> I was first given this scent as a gift from my oldest daughter and LOVED IT!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stuck with it a long time though because I got a 3 oz bottle for a great price!</li>
            <li> I am able to enjoy it once</li>
            <li> I have received my perfume from Amazon and it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Not only is it identical in every way, except the size of course, it is fresh and perfect.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine how strong the EDP is and have never tried</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume, my new favorite!</li>
            <li> The product was 100 % authentic and item was sent quickly.  </li>
            <li> So clean but something very special as well.</li>
            <li> Also, the look of the bottle is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this perfume from a department store.  </li>
            <li> If you like Angel, you will enjoy Crystal Noir.</li>
            <li> It is my absolute favorite and I&#x27;ve had many compliments.  </li>
            <li> A great, deep and rich perfume that stays on you all day.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s REAL!!!</li>
            <li> Very clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I also buy from zoomkart and these are original.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very warm and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> Men and women - it&#x27;s so classy &amp; sophisticated - try it, won&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
            <li> OMG love this so much</li>
            <li> love this product shipped fast</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of sweet, floral smells and prefer the odor of men&#x27;s colognes over women perfumes.  </li>
            <li> MY absolute favorite perfume and has been for years.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t think it smells as amazing as the other Versace scents, but if you already know you like it, then you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> I saw it years ago, I didn&#x27;t get it then because I was pregnant(?)</li>
            <li> Reliable and quick to ship and arrive</li>
            <li> Shipping was also quick and that was during Christmas.</li>
            <li> and I have written another review on the real perfume because I loved it so much however this most recent bottle I JUST got from amazon</li>
            <li> Excellent long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> The scent is weak, but the bottle makes a very attractive addition to my dresser collection.  </li>
            <li> They can be a little pricey (that is over 50 dollars usd via Amazon), but compared to department stores which may cost you anything from 80.00 usd upwards, this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife as gift &amp; she has never stopped loving it and showing me some extra care.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice fragrance, but I thought it was too heavy for my taste, and the spiciness reminded me more of a man&#x27;s perfume than a woman&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The product came quickly, and is exactly what you see and expect to smell.</li>
            <li> Beauty Encounter is a great seller too, item arrived on Dec. 24th, which is not bad considering I ordered it late.</li>
            <li> This seller shipped the product quickly and it came NEW in it&#x27;s original box and wrapped in plastic.</li>
            <li> scent itself seems like coconuts, spicy florals and fruits, kind of exotic and hard to describe.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I like your perfume.\\&quot; My other favorite is Thierry Mugler Angel, but I found it is wayyyy too strong for an airplane, so I wear that when I&#x27;m going out.</li>
            <li> It does not small ANYTHING like my genuine bottle of Versace Crystal Noir which smells like root beer floats</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of the top</li>
            <li> My favorite, I only use Versace perfume.</li>
            <li> Perfumes are specific to a person, so try first, but my wife loves it, and gets many comments at work on &amp;</li>
            <li> , that is the first sign to know</li>
            <li> Exactly as it is in the store- love purchasing the tester size at such a discount.</li>
            <li> This is a very competitive price, and the bottle I received was fresh and unopened.</li>
            <li> It has a pronounced scent of coconut which I love and mixed with vanilla and amber.</li>
            <li> My husband likes it so that&#x27;s all that really matters right?</li>
            <li> Not often I will purchase much less pay a bill online, but I must say, this was fast, easy, and safe.</li>
            <li> I received it in less then two days which made me even more excited.</li>
            <li> What I love about Versace Crystal Noir (among countless other things) is that it is suitable for every place I go or anything I wear.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume that I&#x27;ve been wearing for a long time now...</li>
            <li> I tried the small .5 bottle and loved it...</li>
            <li> but the new bottle also smells like straight up alcohol!!</li>
            <li> It is not too strong and not a floral scent which is a BIG plus for me and stays with me without having to reapply during the day.</li>
            <li> I just Love this product, it is my 2nd time I am buying it and will buy  again!Awesome smell, long lasting and Lovely!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, it may be heavy for some, it&#x27;s worth checking out in the store first.</li>
            <li> I am a flight attendant, so I want a scent that will last the day, but isn&#x27;t too strong and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li> Very dressy and ladylike.</li>
            <li> so I place another one since it took too much space.</li>
            <li> I do think it is the real deal</li>
            <li> And how much is it.</li>
            <li> GET THE REAL DEAL</li>
            <li> A real box will have a scan code (box bar code) on the bottom</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s real.  </li>
            <li> You are the real deal.  </li>
            <li> Not the real deal..</li>
            <li> VERY dissapointed.. Will not purchase anything from Amazon again..</li>
            <li> To much money to take the chance.</li>
            <li> The new bottle top for one does not even fit on my old and genuine bottle of Versace Noir for one and the bottle itself is also shaped a little different</li>
            <li> and it only took seconds for me to place an order with the friendly navagation ease of the website....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got such a rich, sensual fragrance</li>
            <li> love this scent, bought a small bottle and then ended up getting the big bottle for my birthday, smells very clean.</li>
            <li> my favorite perfume smells a little minty and citrus.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fantastic, my order arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> So many compliments when I wear this in just the few days I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li> careful of the sellers you may buy from as it may not be the original.</li>
            <li> and I could live with all of that</li>
            <li> From the first spray, I could tell I&#x27;d received a watered down version which I suppose is fine if you want to reapply several times a day.  </li>
            <li> Not small at all.</li>
            <li> Nobody has small this perfume and daunt love it.</li>
            <li> so I can be assured I am the first person to open and use the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is authentic.</li>
            <li> She has worn it multiple times and she always thanks me.</li>
            <li> Mature smelling but not \\&quot;grandma-ish\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It is warm and inviting and yet subtle at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have finally found my new signature scent!  </li>
            <li> but in future, I will spend the extra dollar to get the real deal.</li>
            <li> It barely has any fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife who has been buying this same scent for years now and this bottle smells very alcoholish and the smell doesnt last as long as prior bottles bought from Macys.</li>
            <li> what I received was a watered down version of the real deal.</li>
            <li> I usually stick with the parfum but settled for the EDT spray a few months back since that was the only option available at the Ulta store on the particular day that I visited.  </li>
            <li> but it does not last as long as I thought it initially did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting</li>
            <li> Long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> Although it was an EDT, it did seem to be long lasting, which lead me to believe that the EDT from Amazon would be satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just way too easy to fake.</li>
            <li> I had purchased before and it was fine, just like what you buy at the dept stores, but this time the perfume is just very weak.</li>
            <li> You may just need to give yourself 3/4 sprays and it lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> This is fragrance lasts very long time.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this dark, mysterious scent.</li>
            <li> I usually wear the Yellow Diamond and I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments, so I thought I&#x27;d go out on a limb and order the Crystal Noir before even smelling it.</li>
            <li> so when it ran empty...</li>
            <li> The product that I ordered was exactly as I expected it to be</li>
            <li> Bottle roughly the size of a clenched fist.</li>
            <li> Same day I came on here and saw they had the three ounce for less than the 1 oz at Ulta!</li>
            <li> I ordered directly through Amazon and I must say that the low price caused me to be a bit skeptical about the authenticity and/ or quality of this item.</li>
            <li> I was shopping for shoes the other day and a lady came up to ask what I was wearing, she wrote it down and said she was going to get some.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, she would never of guessed I paid half the price of other retailers.  </li>
            <li> Stays on for a long time, just need to apply a  small amount.</li>
            <li> BUT THIS IS A WATERED DOWN VERSION....</li>
            <li> I found it on Amazon and immediately purchased it when I saw it was half the price of what we were charging.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money..</li>
            <li> I have used this as my winter scent for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Anyone small it of me ask what is the name of this perfume.</li>
            <li> In the past I have brought perfume that was not quality.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how to review this item.  </li>
            <li> Also, Amazon assured me that if the product was old, fake or weak, they would refund my money.</li>
            <li> maybe I just received a weak batch...</li>
            <li> I made a poor decision to save some money and buy it here.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with my purchase</li>
            <li> I bought it on a whim because I was tired of using body mists</li>
            <li> Disappointed because I received a watered down version.  </li>
            <li> In the stores it was always expensive</li>
            <li> is 100% Fake.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I realized that this item falls in the &amp;#</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed</li>

            <li> I LOVE this perfume! It&#x27;s long lasting and I get so many complements. Shipping was fantastic, my order arrived sooner than expected. If you&#x27;re a PERFUME LOVER, this is a MUST HAVE... #WouldDefinitelyOrderFromThisCompanyAgain</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance... It makes you feel feminine and sexy.  Not too heavy. Long lasting scent. One of the best Versace fragrances.</li>
            <li> Have been using Versace Crystal Noir for years!  Get compliments every time I wear it.  Great price too!</li>
            <li> Smells nice I love it and get compliments..</li>
            <li> I have been using it since last 6yrs. so many times i was asked  by ppl as what is this perfume, when I walk in to a restaurant or any shop :)</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this fragrance!!!!</li>
            <li> My fav......  So many compliments, people pass by, and do a u turn to ask what it is that you are wearing. Very clean, fresh scent. I love this., price is better than the retail stores also, even with the charge of shipping and handling, Happy</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance which I have been wearing for 4 or more years.  It is not too strong and not a floral scent which is a BIG plus for me and stays with me without having to reapply during the day. I always get compliments when I wear this fragrance. I was shopping for shoes the other day and a lady came up to ask what I was wearing, she wrote it down and said she was going to get some. I have not found Crystal Noir in the department stores for a while now and I either buy from Perfumania or Amazon now. This seller shipped the product quickly and it came NEW in it&#x27;s original box and wrapped in plastic.</li>
            <li> I have used Versace Crystal Noir for several years.  It is my absolute favorite and I&#x27;ve had many compliments.  I usually stick with the parfum but settled for the EDT spray a few months back since that was the only option available at the Ulta store on the particular day that I visited.  Although it was an EDT, it did seem to be long lasting, which lead me to believe that the EDT from Amazon would be satisfactory.  I was mistaken.  From the first spray, I could tell I&#x27;d received a watered down version which I suppose is fine if you want to reapply several times a day.  I was disappointed when I realized that this item falls in the &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34; category; and is therefore, not a returnable item at Amazon.  I don&#x27;t know...maybe I just received a weak batch... but in future, I will spend the extra dollar to get the real deal.</li>
            <li> My mom loves perfumes. When I gave her this, she absolutely was happy with the product. She has worn it multiple times and she always thanks me.</li>
            <li> If I could give this zero stars I would. It barely has any fragrance to it. I fell in love with Versace Crystal Noir from Sephora two years ago. I made a poor decision to save some money and buy it here.</li>
            <li> I like the cologne but the package was somewhat opened.</li>
            <li> Of course! It&#x27;s the best and the most elegant fragrances! Works for both summer and winter!</li>
            <li> I have finally found my new signature scent!  It&#x27;s sensual and elegant and just makes a woman feel beautiful! Very bewitching!! I suffer with migraines and have had no problem wearing and have not offended anyone nearby.  This is not your younger crowd perfume at all (like the Brittany or Jessica wearers!)  Perfect for day/night wear.  I just feel like a million bucks when I wear this, and when I am asked what I am wearing I simply say Versace.  I am not letting the cat out of the bag on this one...LOL!!!  Thank you House of Versace!</li>
            <li> I tried the small .5 bottle and loved it...so when it ran empty...I bought this big boy...great scent</li>
            <li> Not often I will purchase much less pay a bill online, but I must say, this was fast, easy, and safe. The product that I ordered was exactly as I expected it to be and it only took seconds for me to place an order with the friendly navagation ease of the website....Kudos!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Just like out of the store. Excellent long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, it may be heavy for some, it&#x27;s worth checking out in the store first. I saw it years ago, I didn&#x27;t get it then because I was pregnant(?) and I wanted to make sure I still like it..I do!!</li>
            <li> best scent I&#x27;ve ever worn. Lots of great compliments on the smell.</li>
            <li> Fave perfume. Great size. Not small at all. Bottle roughly the size of a clenched fist. Reliable and quick to ship and arrive</li>
            <li> I ordered directly through Amazon and I must say that the low price caused me to be a bit skeptical about the authenticity and/ or quality of this item. I had already loved this perfume &amp; purchased a 1 ounce bottle for fifty bucks at Ulta. Same day I came on here and saw they had the three ounce for less than the 1 oz at Ulta! I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. I have received my perfume from Amazon and it arrived very quickly. Not only is it identical in every way, except the size of course, it is fresh and perfect. I have since returned the 1 oz back to Ulta as I didn&#x27;t even open it and now have my triple size bottle for an unbeatable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent itself seems like coconuts, spicy florals and fruits, kind of exotic and hard to describe. Very dressy and ladylike. Mature smelling but not \\&quot;grandma-ish\\&quot;. This is strong for an EDT (the perfect strength, however) and two spritz lasts all day for me. I can&#x27;t imagine how strong the EDP is and have never tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is beautiful colored glass with a huge, chunky lid that is multifaceted.&lt;br /&gt;Note: It is made in Italy. Also, Amazon assured me that if the product was old, fake or weak, they would refund my money. People are put off by the no returns policy on fragrances, but Amazon still has the best customer service ever. After this experience, I will definitely keep buying my perfumes here.</li>
            <li> This perfume is my favorite for the evening. I use just one pump and it last all day. Not a big fan of the top so I place another one since it took too much space.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend, I had no idea what to get her for Christmas, we had gone to Perfumania and it was 80 bucks! But we smelled a tester to make sure we could get a better priced one through Amazon! It smells great! Just like the one at the store! Beauty Encounter is a great seller too, item arrived on Dec. 24th, which is not bad considering I ordered it late. Great smell loved it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife who has been buying this same scent for years now and this bottle smells very alcoholish and the smell doesnt last as long as prior bottles bought from Macys. Makes me think that ive been ripped off by Amazon! Not happy at all with my purchase</li>
            <li> One of my favorites ...</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, she would never of guessed I paid half the price of other retailers.  If your considering, go for it.</li>
            <li> I work at a perfume store and really liked how Crystal Noir smelled but did not like the price($80). I found it on Amazon and immediately purchased it when I saw it was half the price of what we were charging. I received it in less then two days which made me even more excited. Unfortunately I have not been satisfied with the longevity of the scent staying on me all day compared with the same fragrance we carry in my store which I did not have to reapply throughout the day. I do think it is the real deal but it does not last as long as I thought it initially did.</li>
            <li> What I love about Versace Crystal Noir (among countless other things) is that it is suitable for every place I go or anything I wear. Also, the look of the bottle is fantastic.</li>
            <li> great perfume!!!i love it!</li>
            <li> My favorite, I only use Versace perfume.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance. I have already received several compliments! Delivery was prompt, and I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Nobody has small this perfume and daunt love it. Anyone small it of me ask what is the name of this perfume. And how much is it.</li>
            <li> Love this scent!!!! Wear it every day!!!! Get loads of compliments!! Finally found my signature scent!!!!!!!!! Versace is just the best perfume ever !!!!</li>
            <li> I get a compliment on this EVERYWHERE I wear it! Men and women - it&#x27;s so classy &amp; sophisticated - try it, won&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
            <li> I bought this one as a gift for my mother in law, this one is one of her&#x27;s favorite perfumes. In the stores it was always expensive but I have found it on Amazon for a great price.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift. And my friend was very happy with it. I am glad I bought it for her.</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> pleasant but strong. Advise for night wear.</li>
            <li> The scent is weak, but the bottle makes a very attractive addition to my dresser collection.  The price was good.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a wonderful smell...BUT THIS IS A WATERED DOWN VERSION....BEWARE.  IT DOESN&#x27;T EVEN FEEL THE SAME AS PERFUME..... GET THE REAL DEAL BUT THIS IS NOT IT.</li>
            <li> Perfumes are specific to a person, so try first, but my wife loves it, and gets many comments at work on &amp;#34;what is that wonderful scent you are wearing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell anything like its suppose to!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money..</li>
            <li> Disappointed because I received a watered down version.  I had purchased before and it was fine, just like what you buy at the dept stores, but this time the perfume is just very weak.</li>
            <li> Love it. Wore it to work and asked opinions of my colleagues.  They all had favorable responses and I have been wearing it ever since.</li>
            <li> I love the spray. Great price.</li>
            <li> A real box will have a scan code (box bar code) on the bottom, that is the first sign to know it&#x27;s real.  The barcode on the box should match the one on the bottle also.  The smell should last almost all day.  With that said, this is a wonderful scent. Its really sexy and you will get many compliments.  The scent is made for women who likes heavier scents, the bright crystal is for those that like light floral scents.  This is a timeless scent that you will buy for years to come.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping! Great product!</li>
            <li> Smells great, bought it for my mom and she loves it, not as good as Gaga or some I have smelled, but its what a person likes...quality perfume definately</li>
            <li> I just received this and love it.  It will be my go to scent for years to come I&#x27;m sure.  So clean but something very special as well.</li>
            <li> Love this. So many compliments when I wear this in just the few days I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li> I get compliments whenever I wear this.  It&#x27;s still just as light as the bright crystal, but smells more sumptuous because it&#x27;s made for going out at night.  I love it.</li>
            <li> The product was 100 % authentic and item was sent quickly.  I will order again from you.  Thank&#x27;s for sellling quality items.  In the past I have brought perfume that was not quality.  You are the real deal.  Thank&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Versace did a great job with this one! It&#x27;s got such a rich, sensual fragrance, I would definitely recommend this to a woman looking for a richer, sexier, darker scent.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favourite partum.This is fragrance lasts very long time.I will buy Versace again ,when it will finish.</li>
            <li> Versace always has the sexiest scents, and this is no different. I usually wear the Yellow Diamond and I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments, so I thought I&#x27;d go out on a limb and order the Crystal Noir before even smelling it. The product came quickly, and is exactly what you see and expect to smell. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t think it smells as amazing as the other Versace scents, but if you already know you like it, then you&#x27;re good to go! Versace Versace Versace.</li>
            <li> Love it I get alot of compliments on it!</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and am pleased.  It has a sort of musky, powdery, floral smell and it deifnitely lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li> The best! As a gift this was a hit at Christmas time!</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this perfume from a department store.  It&#x27;s a nice fragrance, but I thought it was too heavy for my taste, and the spiciness reminded me more of a man&#x27;s perfume than a woman&#x27;s.  I really loved the Versace Bright Crystal, though.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume. Great price.</li>
            <li> I receive so many compliments on this scent every time I&#x27;m out! I absolutely love this perfume, my new favorite!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing smelling perfume and the price is the best I have seen!  Well worth the price I paid. Shipping was also quick and that was during Christmas.</li>
            <li> love this scent, bought a small bottle and then ended up getting the big bottle for my birthday, smells very clean.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and receive so many compliments when I wear it. It is a soft exotic vanilla scent that is so awesome. Will re-purchase when finished.</li>
            <li> I was first given this scent as a gift from my oldest daughter and LOVED IT!&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately when it was all used I couldn&#x27;t afford to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;With Amazon.com I am able to enjoy it once again.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon.com for providing me quality products at a great price!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume that I&#x27;ve been wearing for a long time now... what I received was a watered down version of the real deal. It even feels different.</li>
            <li> the smells doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> No No No ... However used this perfume before will notice immediately that this one is not the same ..This perfume is loaded with alcohol and does&#x27;t smell at all like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> Very sexy smell, not imatation, cheeper on amazon then any where else I&#x27;ve looked. My girl friend was very happy thank u</li>
            <li> Not sure how to review this item.  The scent is a personal preference.  Obviously,I like  I found this item to be a fair price.  The box arrived sealed so I can be assured I am the first person to open and use the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Exactly as it is in the store- love purchasing the tester size at such a discount. Scent stays well, better in hair and clothes than on skin.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product because I use Versace Bright Crystal. Love it as an evening fragrance. Stays on for a long time, just need to apply a  small amount.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of sweet, floral smells and prefer the odor of men&#x27;s colognes over women perfumes.  This perfume has the perfect balance of gardenia, amber and musk.  It is feminine, yet has musky overtones without being overpowering.  I get compliments every time I wear it from both men and women.  This is a very competitive price, and the bottle I received was fresh and unopened.</li>
            <li> Not the real deal.. VERY dissapointed.. Will not purchase anything from Amazon again..</li>
            <li> this is just as good as the stuff you get from the stores with just a better price. i liked it</li>
            <li> I have used this as my winter scent for a few years now. I am a flight attendant, so I want a scent that will last the day, but isn&#x27;t too strong and this fits the bill. It has a pronounced scent of coconut which I love and mixed with vanilla and amber. It is a warm, familiar scent without smelling like candy. I get compliments every day on it and people say \\&quot;you smell great,\\&quot; not \\&quot;I like your perfume.\\&quot; My other favorite is Thierry Mugler Angel, but I found it is wayyyy too strong for an airplane, so I wear that when I&#x27;m going out. If you like Angel, you will enjoy Crystal Noir. It is warm and inviting and yet subtle at the same time.</li>
            <li> my favorite perfume smells a little minty and citrus. have had many compliments. would buy it again. so glad I can still get it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Crystal Noir.. If it&#x27;s REAL!!! and I have written another review on the real perfume because I loved it so much however this most recent bottle I JUST got from amazon is 100% Fake. The new bottle top for one does not even fit on my old and genuine bottle of Versace Noir for one and the bottle itself is also shaped a little different and I could live with all of that but the new bottle also smells like straight up alcohol!! It does not small ANYTHING like my genuine bottle of Versace Crystal Noir which smells like root beer floats and I could literally swim in it. From now on I will NEVER again trust Amazon for perfume. It&#x27;s just way too easy to fake. I will be going with sephora.com or nordstroms.com for perfume from now on. To much money to take the chance. I can get this fragrance at the liquor store.</li>
            <li> I like it. My husband likes it so that&#x27;s all that really matters right? But...some people say I smell like a man. Lol. I guess it&#x27;s a matter of preference. I&#x27;m stuck with it a long time though because I got a 3 oz bottle for a great price!</li>
            <li> I just Love this product, it is my 2nd time I am buying it and will buy  again!Awesome smell, long lasting and Lovely!</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is authentic.</li>
            <li> MY absolute favorite perfume and has been for years.  I continually get compliments no matter where I am.</li>
            <li> Everyone, male and female, ask me what perfume I have on.  They also will keep walking around me to sniff it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my Versace Crystal Noir!  It&#x27;s the ONLY fragrance I wear and I get so many compliments.  It is a beautiful fragrance!  If I could rate it 10 STARS, I would!  Thank you SO MUCH!!!!!  :)</li>
            <li> Bought as Christmas gift for my oldest daughter since she wanted mine!</li>
            <li> A great, deep and rich perfume that stays on you all day.  This bottle lasts me over a year, with 2-3 sprays every day.  Its my favorite and my signature scent, and I always get compliments when I wear it.  Added bonus that I&#x27;ve never met anyone else who also wears this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent price. Love the scent</li>
            <li> My wife loves this dark, mysterious scent. It&#x27;s a wonderful autumn/ winter fragrance. It&#x27;s very warm and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I bought it on a whim because I was tired of using body mists and I wanted a signature scent for myself. I read many great reviews about it so I decided to give it a try. As compared to a milder scents like maybe Jessica Simpson Fancy love, this scent will probably be strong for some people but this scent is soo sexy and captivating, people know when I am in their midst even before they actually see me! The scent is captivating but not overbearing just to clarify. You may just need to give yourself 3/4 sprays and it lasts all day long. I wear it for work but it is probably most fitting to wear for dinner date or an evening out dancing.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful of the sellers you may buy from as it may not be the original. I buy the ones that ships from and sold by amazon. I also buy from zoomkart and these are original. They can be a little pricey (that is over 50 dollars usd via Amazon), but compared to department stores which may cost you anything from 80.00 usd upwards, this is a great buy. I dare you to buy this perfume. You will not be disappointed</li>
