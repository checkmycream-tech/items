            <li>My favorite sunscreen :D</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and it is a great value!!</li>
            <li>Consumer Reports named this the best sunscreen of 2011, with the top quality and also the cheapest price per ounce (59 cents/ounce at the time.</li>
            <li>Consumer reports gave it a best rating and I can confirm that it stays on and protects you for many hours.  </li>
            <li>I was scorched after using two applications of coppertone sport when kayaking on a bright sunny day this summer in San Diego.  </li>
            <li>The good: NO-AD spf 8 did keep me from getting burned in the Keys in 80+ bright and sunny weather.  </li>
            <li>I NEED some really good, long-lasting sun screen.  </li>
            <li>This is a good deal and worked well for my 8 day trip to MB.  </li>
            <li>Good price too.</li>
            <li>It is good.  </li>
            <li>used before, quite good</li>
            <li>And the price is good, too.</li>
            <li>A lotion rated a Best Buy by CR, available at for around $.50 per ounce, with a CR score of 77.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>No-Ad is good stuff.</li>
            <li>It seemed to be fairly water resistant too.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>The cost for the effectiveness of the SPF is a good deal.</li>
            <li>Best high &amp;#34;spf&amp;#34; sunblock out there!!!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with item.  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tried the SPF50 for Kids version of this product &amp; like it much better!</li>
            <li>and I have probably tried every brand of drug store sunblock that exists; No AdD is really amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is non-greasy, disappears on the skin, does not smell, AND my skin is protected from the sun!&lt;br /&gt;Just amazing.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not a tropical smell which can sometimes be nice, it&#x27;s flowery.</li>
            <li>NO-AD is kind of thinnish when it comes out of the bottle</li>
            <li>This is the best and most economical sunscreen that I have found.</li>
            <li>Consumer Report is good for appliance and roofing recommendations, not for healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li>Always liked this product.</li>
            <li>No scent, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I bought three bottles at once to share with my family members, who all liked it.</li>
            <li>Effective sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best!!!!</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and is very effective.  </li>
            <li>Living in AZ, the sun is very strong and my kids never burned while using this product on them.</li>
            <li>I know this sunscreen has health concerns on Environmental Working Group website about the chemicals it uses, but that is controversial.</li>
            <li>Many of our grandchildren have been effectively protected by these products.  </li>
            <li>It is by far the best buy per ounce and you can afford to slather it on.</li>
            <li>works great and priced right -</li>
            <li>BUT MORE EFFECTIVE THAN MANY OF THEM AND</li>
            <li>I like this sun block because it provides broad spectrum protection which studies show offer the best protection.</li>
            <li>after reading all the great reviews I thought this would be better, I found it to be on the greasy side... living in Florida its hot</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got fairly fair skin and have a tendency to burn quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;My &amp;#34;Excellent&amp;#34; means if I need more of this product I would buy from you.</li>
            <li>Most screens stink and are pricey.</li>
            <li>You can spend a lot more on face sunscreen, but if you just want some stout sunscreen, this is it.</li>
            <li>Most sunscreens are greasy but not this one.  </li>
            <li>Guess I better use it all up this summer.</li>
            <li>Have used it for many years.</li>
            <li>My favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li>So when I went to purchase more I found out that Walmart no longer carries it</li>
            <li>My headline says most of it, but you should also know that this is the product that gets praise from consumer agencies and health nuts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced and it does a great job of protecting my skin from getting sunburned.  </li>
            <li>A friend recommended NO-AD to us and we are sooo glad.  </li>
            <li>What more can I ask.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive and according to reviews, great bang for your buck</li>
            <li>We have bottles of the stuff lying around, and always buy more just-in-case.</li>
            <li>I love this sunblock.</li>
            <li>ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions.</li>
            <li>It was listed as the top sunscreen in consumer report for the 2011 and 2012.</li>
            <li>My favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I am 99% sure it&#x27;s this NoAd that did it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an awesome sunscreen and when I saw there were different SPF&#x27;s, I bought those too!!</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I&#x27;m able to find it here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>todo ok.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>and i will buy more.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find in stores any more, so bought a case through Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>and I am completely satisfied with the product and the delivery.</li>
            <li>Sure, it kept us from burning, but it ruined hundreds of dollars of clothing for our family.  </li>
            <li>Most companies tape the lid, and ship it in a plastic bag that is sealed.</li>
            <li>It is top rated by a leading non-profit \\&quot;Consumer Magazine\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I dont get any tans any more or sun burns.</li>
            <li>Use it for many years</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise pretty good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Check out the latest report of EWG and you will see this mix evaluation but more importantly, read the ingredients.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen lotion is very good and low</li>
            <li>I was glad to see it available here.</li>
            <li>With this sunscreen, I am more comfortable frolicking in the sun all day.</li>
            <li>It works very well and is so much more price competitive than all the national brands it is almost too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Fantastic protection, no greasiness or oiliness, protects for a good amount of time, non-offensive odor and high quality ingredients for a bargain price!</li>
            <li>I burn quite easily</li>
            <li>perfume smell is strong and doesn&#x27;t go away over time.  </li>
            <li>We buy No-AD because most of their original sunscreens were fragrance free (including the sport, which still is).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair, my husband also used it and had no negative reaction at all.  </li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned, and am careful about protection because  I had a superficial melanoma removed from a non-exposed part of my body 25 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Economic and effective</li>
            <li>Much more economical than the spray.</li>
            <li>Like any sunscreen, reapplication is important.</li>
            <li>The scent is very pleasing and the lotion applies nicely.  </li>
            <li>This lotion goes on smoothly and does not feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Purchased this as rated by CR and have found it to be a great daily Sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Even though from Lands End, I thought they were just made from cheap material.</li>
            <li>A lotion widely available for around $1.50 per ounce, with a CR score of 75.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>on smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-sticky, doesn&#x27;t &#x27;cling&#x27; to your skin, and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>The product is good, but the expiration date is far too soon.</li>
            <li>Excellent, I have been using No-Ad for 15 years and recently switched to SPF 45 and absolutely will continue to buy this product.  </li>
            <li>The price is right, but I won&#x27;t be able to evaluate the efficacy until I use it for a period of time.</li>
            <li>Very good protection, long lasting and good price</li>
            <li>sunblock is cost effective and comes in a nice large bottle which will last more than one season.</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t burn any more, so he likes this product very much.</li>
            <li>originally bought SPF 8 and this has worked in all situations (beach, pool, working in the yard, etc.).  </li>
            <li>The sunscreen seems to be quite effective and though thicker than what I was using, was absorbed pretty quickly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>Rubs in fairly easy, does not have an offensive smell and does not leave a greasy/sticky feel once absorbed.  </li>
            <li>They really dumped every PARABEN available in the chemical world in this mix and more...</li>
            <li>Sunscreen isn&#x27;t greasy at all, and actually has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>I bought this sun screen after reading an article that indicated that its very important to make sure they say \\&quot;broad spectrum\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing too special about it</li>
            <li>It offers great protection for my fair skin and protects my little one from getting burned.</li>
            <li>If it is good enough for my dermatologist</li>
            <li>it is good enough for me!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the greasy feeling that most sunblocks leave.  </li>
            <li>Excellent sunscreen; not too thick, and not scented.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re good enough to survive without advertising, that means consumers KNOW you&#x27;ve got a quality product and will buy it anyway.</li>
            <li>One application protects us through a full day of racing and car shows and</li>
            <li>I use this product on my full body and face and it seems to resist sweat and water well and keeps me from getting burnt.</li>
            <li>Went on a whale watching voyage for two hours during full sun.</li>
            <li>short, it is just a good product.</li>
            <li>but that goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>Sunscreen absorbs quickly and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Per ounce, it&#x27;s pretty cheap, and I find it&#x27;s acceptably greesy.</li>
            <li>I am fairly light skinned and if I&#x27;m out in the sun a lot, I burn first and then tan for the remainder of the season.  </li>
            <li>I told him that I had tried using a new sunscreen this year since I felt there had to be something better than the sport 50</li>
            <li>and I think I have found a new HG sunblock :)</li>
            <li>No-AD is still a great sunblock, but if you are looking for something less fragrant, this might not be it.  </li>
            <li>Not a big problem because the eyes should be protected by good pair of sunglasses;-)</li>
            <li>Goes on and gets absorbed quickly without any greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin and many sunscreen products irritate my skin, even those that are hypoallergenic.  </li>
            <li>The price is right and this stuff does exactly what I want; it blocks the sun from my northern European fair skin.  </li>
            <li>but it thickens up real fast when you start to rub it in on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making it available.</li>
            <li>I have used this bottle for several summers and it is still as effective as when it was new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali</li>
            <li>I liked it well enough to re-order a 3 pack after having used it for a week.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s purchase, he uses this all the time and finds it economical to buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>call this stuff NORAD for fun.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a big bottle of sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.  </li>
            <li>then most other sunscreens brands and you get more for your money.</li>
            <li>good product worked as advertized left skin feeling very soft would recommend and purchase again arrived quickly and packaged well</li>
            <li>Worked like a charm and the price was right.</li>
            <li>Price is right.</li>
            <li>but was right on the money wrt this product.  </li>
            <li>High SPF, grease-free, water-proof, sweat-proof, fantastic price.</li>
            <li>It is high quality and very economical.  </li>
            <li>I like that this is a bigger bottle than most other sunscreens because I have fair skin and like to apply liberal amounts and reapply as needed without feeling like I need to make it last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly with no overpowering scent, dries quickly with no lingering greasy feel and any white streaks quickly fade.</li>
            <li>I used this product 5 years ago when we went to Jamaica and never got burned even though we were outside most of the day.  </li>
            <li>Used the first day on my chest.</li>
            <li>Costco, Huy Fong (makers of Sri Racha hot sauce), Lululemon, Rolls Royce, Krispy Kreme Donuts, Zara.</li>
            <li>This is the first truly non-greasy sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>With that being said when you put Coppertone on your child that is exactly what you want - something that will not come off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I don&#x27;t suggest using on face as it will irritate your eyes once it&#x27;s melt on your face when it&#x27;s hot.</li>
            <li>I decided to order 45 to have &amp;#34;on hand&amp;#34; for any kids or parents who wanted a higher SPF.  </li>
            <li>This product is totally worth it and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to most sun screens especially those with homoslate.</li>
            <li>I wear sunscreen year round, and it&#x27;s good for that.</li>
            <li>I like the good, big bottle for the low price, since I wear it year-round.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have tried many different kinds of sunscreen and this really works.  </li>
            <li>SO far we have used it and are happy that it is not greasy, and the kids have not complained about it itching like other brands do.</li>
            <li>Pretty much my go to bottle when summer starts.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I ordered a product of this kind, And both times it has arrived with a major leak.</li>
            <li>Applied liberally, 1-2 hours before going out into the sun, and have been in the sun for 4-6 hours, coupled with several dips into the lake to cool off, and without reapplying, have come home looking like I hadn&#x27;t been in the sun at all!</li>
            <li>Then a few months later, my all-time favorite bathing suit started to dissolve around the straps which is right where I apply the most sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The lotion works very well and is non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>I really like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This sunblock was tested in Mexico and Aruba works great, the result is the same as much more expensive sunblocks i used before.</li>
            <li>and it dries extremely fast.  </li>
            <li>It is a great value, and I will use the rest of the bottle up, but I am more aware that it does tend to \\&quot;flake\\&quot; off when re-applied :(</li>
            <li>This arrived very well packaged</li>
            <li>This product really does protect your skin very well and also works well when you are in and out of the water.  </li>
            <li>While the prodicut acts very well as a sunscreen lotion, I was mislead by the product labeling.</li>
            <li>This NO-AD really has saved my skin.  </li>
            <li>and it really does work.  </li>
            <li>Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li>My husband is very fair-skinned and he uses this whenever he goes out in the sun.  </li>
            <li>The material was much thinner in spots throughout the garment.</li>
            <li>So, in using this SPF correctly, I avoid the burn and go straight to tan.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, I really like this.</li>
            <li>Wrapped in shrink wrap so it was ready to travel without concern for leakage during flight.</li>
            <li>This lotion is inexpensive but really does the job, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, even on my face under makeup.</li>
            <li>And reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>My husband really likes this brand.  </li>
            <li>I have a real problem with sun burn.  </li>
            <li>I appreciated that.</li>
            <li>used the whole time in hawaii 5 nights stay.  </li>
            <li>It felt very greasy going on.</li>
            <li>I was expecting much worse, but this is actually one of the best sunscreens I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>In this age of crazy media and social media shoving consumer goods down our throats, it feels nice to support the companies who just do what they do best: make a quality product and let the product speak for itself.</li>
            <li>We were 6 hours in SeaWorld in full sun at 104° and applied it only twice.  </li>
            <li>I bought a bottle a long time ago and it has lasted me for many years (not out in the sun an excessive amount) and when I was looking for more</li>
            <li>This formula goes on very fast, with high saturation (I test my sunblocks with a black light to see how they absorb etc.)</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend trying this sunblock.  </li>
            <li>This product is rated highly by consumer reports and I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>This one came highly recommended from reviews online.</li>
            <li>It goes on very easily, not thick like the Sport 50</li>
            <li>I have been wearing sunblock everyday for most of my life</li>
            <li>This is well worth it, especially for sun protection every day.</li>
            <li>and I was forced to search for it online and ended up paying more than I should have had it been available locally.</li>
            <li>Again, no hard proof, but be warned.</li>
            <li>I love this for beach and other intense sun related activities</li>
            <li>I work outside during the summer mowing pastures and Right Of Ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen and it&#x27;s not easy to find where I am located.</li>
            <li>I live in the Boston area and am outdoors every day.</li>
            <li>I had to order it  because I couldn&#x27;t find the product where I live.  </li>
            <li>Before recapping the bottle I put a small piece of plastic wrap over the top of the bottle opening to prevent leaks and drying.  </li>
            <li>My husband is light-skinned and only burns, so he wanted a higher SPF, so I ordered 16 for him</li>
            <li>this is a very good sunblock , it absorbs easily and lasts a long time, I  have to buy it at Amazon because those idiots at walmart stopped selling it.</li>
            <li>ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I play a lot of tennis and am outside in full sunlight for several hours at a time.  </li>
            <li>No Ad has a great history of, duh, no advertisements, and that allows them to make a quality product for less.</li>
            <li>Worked extremely well in protecting us from afternoon sun, even being in the pool for hours at a time and my friend burns quickly.  </li>
            <li>However, my husband bought this over the weekend - and we can&#x27;t even use it because we have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>But if you have sensitive skin or tend to have allergic reactions to sunscreen, proceed with caution.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin nor does my friend who shared a bottle of this with me while vacationing in the Caribbean.  </li>
            <li>people don&#x27;t apply as much as you should, so you sort of need a big bottle to get you through a summer.</li>
            <li>Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 68 years old</li>
            <li>Recently, I just pulled out my bone leather sandals from last summer and they are stained right where I put sunscreen to protect the tops of my feet.</li>
            <li>We, of course, had wonderful new light-colored clothing for our trip which is now HORRIBLY stained ORANGE thanks to this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>This lotion did not wash off after an hour and a half of snorkeling &amp; diving and was good to go for another round an hour later.  </li>
            <li>This is fabulous compared to the Coppertone body sunblock that I usually use for my arms.  </li>
            <li>No one in the family complains about it being greasy, no one get&#x27;s sunburned, and we only need to buy a new bottle every couple years.</li>
            <li>It might even replace my expensive Shiseido sunblock for my face; I really like the way it looks, but I&#x27;m still testing it out to make sure it doesn&#x27;t break me out.  </li>
            <li>That the UV protection number does not have to be 60 or 100, but rather if it was broad spectrum, it could be a lower number.</li>
            <li>None of the hype and claims of the major brands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it swimming, backpacking at high altitude, and long days on the bike.</li>
            <li>This seems to happen only if you don&#x27;t rub the sunscreen in completely.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a big bottle, double that of your normal size sunscreen</li>
            <li>The bottles are large and inexpensive compared to other brands.  </li>
            <li>Live long and prosper.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also large enough to last for a long time, so you can buy one bottle and use it liberally without thinking about when you&#x27;ll have to buy another.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little greasy looking at first</li>
            <li>I bought this product based on price and other high reviews.  </li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I bought this product based on the high rating it got in Consumer Reports.  </li>
            <li>I bought this one because it was rated highest by Consumer Reports higher than major brands that I usually buy at local stores before.&lt;br /&gt;Turned</li>
            <li>Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks.</li>
            <li>I was not thrilled with the smell initially but it wears off quickly.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have used this product for many years and it is a great value!!</li>
            <li> Consumer Reports named this the best sunscreen of 2011, with the top quality and also the cheapest price per ounce (59 cents/ounce at the time.</li>
            <li> Consumer reports gave it a best rating and I can confirm that it stays on and protects you for many hours.  </li>
            <li> I was scorched after using two applications of coppertone sport when kayaking on a bright sunny day this summer in San Diego.  </li>
            <li> The good: NO-AD spf 8 did keep me from getting burned in the Keys in 80+ bright and sunny weather.  </li>
            <li> I NEED some really good, long-lasting sun screen.  </li>
            <li> This is a good deal and worked well for my 8 day trip to MB.  </li>
            <li> Good price too.</li>
            <li> It is good.  </li>
            <li> used before, quite good</li>
            <li> And the price is good, too.</li>
            <li> A lotion rated a Best Buy by CR, available at for around $.50 per ounce, with a CR score of 77.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> No-Ad is good stuff.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be fairly water resistant too.</li>
            <li> and I loved it.</li>
            <li> The cost for the effectiveness of the SPF is a good deal.</li>
            <li> Best high &amp;#34;spf&amp;#34; sunblock out there!!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with item.  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tried the SPF50 for Kids version of this product &amp; like it much better!</li>
            <li> and I have probably tried every brand of drug store sunblock that exists; No AdD is really amazing.  </li>
            <li> It is non-greasy, disappears on the skin, does not smell, AND my skin is protected from the sun!&lt;br /&gt;Just amazing.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not a tropical smell which can sometimes be nice, it&#x27;s flowery.</li>
            <li> NO-AD is kind of thinnish when it comes out of the bottle</li>
            <li> This is the best and most economical sunscreen that I have found.</li>
            <li> Consumer Report is good for appliance and roofing recommendations, not for healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li> Always liked this product.</li>
            <li> No scent, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I bought three bottles at once to share with my family members, who all liked it.</li>
            <li> Effective sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best!!!!</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and is very effective.  </li>
            <li> Living in AZ, the sun is very strong and my kids never burned while using this product on them.</li>
            <li> I know this sunscreen has health concerns on Environmental Working Group website about the chemicals it uses, but that is controversial.</li>
            <li> Many of our grandchildren have been effectively protected by these products.  </li>
            <li> It is by far the best buy per ounce and you can afford to slather it on.</li>
            <li> works great and priced right -</li>
            <li> BUT MORE EFFECTIVE THAN MANY OF THEM AND</li>
            <li> I like this sun block because it provides broad spectrum protection which studies show offer the best protection.</li>
            <li> after reading all the great reviews I thought this would be better, I found it to be on the greasy side... living in Florida its hot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got fairly fair skin and have a tendency to burn quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;My &amp;#34;Excellent&amp;#34; means if I need more of this product I would buy from you.</li>
            <li> Most screens stink and are pricey.</li>
            <li> You can spend a lot more on face sunscreen, but if you just want some stout sunscreen, this is it.</li>
            <li> Most sunscreens are greasy but not this one.  </li>
            <li> Guess I better use it all up this summer.</li>
            <li> Have used it for many years.</li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li> So when I went to purchase more I found out that Walmart no longer carries it</li>
            <li> My headline says most of it, but you should also know that this is the product that gets praise from consumer agencies and health nuts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably priced and it does a great job of protecting my skin from getting sunburned.  </li>
            <li> A friend recommended NO-AD to us and we are sooo glad.  </li>
            <li> What more can I ask.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive and according to reviews, great bang for your buck</li>
            <li> We have bottles of the stuff lying around, and always buy more just-in-case.</li>
            <li> I love this sunblock.</li>
            <li> ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> It was listed as the top sunscreen in consumer report for the 2011 and 2012.</li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I am 99% sure it&#x27;s this NoAd that did it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awesome sunscreen and when I saw there were different SPF&#x27;s, I bought those too!!</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I&#x27;m able to find it here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> todo ok.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> and i will buy more.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find in stores any more, so bought a case through Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> and I am completely satisfied with the product and the delivery.</li>
            <li> Sure, it kept us from burning, but it ruined hundreds of dollars of clothing for our family.  </li>
            <li> Most companies tape the lid, and ship it in a plastic bag that is sealed.</li>
            <li> It is top rated by a leading non-profit \\&quot;Consumer Magazine\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dont get any tans any more or sun burns.</li>
            <li> Use it for many years</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise pretty good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Check out the latest report of EWG and you will see this mix evaluation but more importantly, read the ingredients.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen lotion is very good and low</li>
            <li> I was glad to see it available here.</li>
            <li> With this sunscreen, I am more comfortable frolicking in the sun all day.</li>
            <li> It works very well and is so much more price competitive than all the national brands it is almost too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Fantastic protection, no greasiness or oiliness, protects for a good amount of time, non-offensive odor and high quality ingredients for a bargain price!</li>
            <li> I burn quite easily</li>
            <li> perfume smell is strong and doesn&#x27;t go away over time.  </li>
            <li> We buy No-AD because most of their original sunscreens were fragrance free (including the sport, which still is).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To be fair, my husband also used it and had no negative reaction at all.  </li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned, and am careful about protection because  I had a superficial melanoma removed from a non-exposed part of my body 25 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Economic and effective</li>
            <li> Much more economical than the spray.</li>
            <li> Like any sunscreen, reapplication is important.</li>
            <li> The scent is very pleasing and the lotion applies nicely.  </li>
            <li> This lotion goes on smoothly and does not feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Purchased this as rated by CR and have found it to be a great daily Sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Even though from Lands End, I thought they were just made from cheap material.</li>
            <li> A lotion widely available for around $1.50 per ounce, with a CR score of 75.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> on smooth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-sticky, doesn&#x27;t &#x27;cling&#x27; to your skin, and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> The product is good, but the expiration date is far too soon.</li>
            <li> Excellent, I have been using No-Ad for 15 years and recently switched to SPF 45 and absolutely will continue to buy this product.  </li>
            <li> The price is right, but I won&#x27;t be able to evaluate the efficacy until I use it for a period of time.</li>
            <li> Very good protection, long lasting and good price</li>
            <li> sunblock is cost effective and comes in a nice large bottle which will last more than one season.</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t burn any more, so he likes this product very much.</li>
            <li> originally bought SPF 8 and this has worked in all situations (beach, pool, working in the yard, etc.).  </li>
            <li> The sunscreen seems to be quite effective and though thicker than what I was using, was absorbed pretty quickly and evenly.  </li>
            <li> Rubs in fairly easy, does not have an offensive smell and does not leave a greasy/sticky feel once absorbed.  </li>
            <li> They really dumped every PARABEN available in the chemical world in this mix and more...</li>
            <li> Sunscreen isn&#x27;t greasy at all, and actually has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> I bought this sun screen after reading an article that indicated that its very important to make sure they say \\&quot;broad spectrum\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing too special about it</li>
            <li> It offers great protection for my fair skin and protects my little one from getting burned.</li>
            <li> If it is good enough for my dermatologist</li>
            <li> it is good enough for me!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the greasy feeling that most sunblocks leave.  </li>
            <li> Excellent sunscreen; not too thick, and not scented.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re good enough to survive without advertising, that means consumers KNOW you&#x27;ve got a quality product and will buy it anyway.</li>
            <li> One application protects us through a full day of racing and car shows and</li>
            <li> I use this product on my full body and face and it seems to resist sweat and water well and keeps me from getting burnt.</li>
            <li> Went on a whale watching voyage for two hours during full sun.</li>
            <li> short, it is just a good product.</li>
            <li> but that goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen absorbs quickly and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Per ounce, it&#x27;s pretty cheap, and I find it&#x27;s acceptably greesy.</li>
            <li> I am fairly light skinned and if I&#x27;m out in the sun a lot, I burn first and then tan for the remainder of the season.  </li>
            <li> I told him that I had tried using a new sunscreen this year since I felt there had to be something better than the sport 50</li>
            <li> and I think I have found a new HG sunblock :)</li>
            <li> No-AD is still a great sunblock, but if you are looking for something less fragrant, this might not be it.  </li>
            <li> Not a big problem because the eyes should be protected by good pair of sunglasses;-)</li>
            <li> Goes on and gets absorbed quickly without any greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin and many sunscreen products irritate my skin, even those that are hypoallergenic.  </li>
            <li> The price is right and this stuff does exactly what I want; it blocks the sun from my northern European fair skin.  </li>
            <li> but it thickens up real fast when you start to rub it in on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for making it available.</li>
            <li> I have used this bottle for several summers and it is still as effective as when it was new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali</li>
            <li> I liked it well enough to re-order a 3 pack after having used it for a week.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s purchase, he uses this all the time and finds it economical to buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> call this stuff NORAD for fun.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a big bottle of sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.  </li>
            <li> then most other sunscreens brands and you get more for your money.</li>
            <li> good product worked as advertized left skin feeling very soft would recommend and purchase again arrived quickly and packaged well</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm and the price was right.</li>
            <li> Price is right.</li>
            <li> but was right on the money wrt this product.  </li>
            <li> High SPF, grease-free, water-proof, sweat-proof, fantastic price.</li>
            <li> It is high quality and very economical.  </li>
            <li> I like that this is a bigger bottle than most other sunscreens because I have fair skin and like to apply liberal amounts and reapply as needed without feeling like I need to make it last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly with no overpowering scent, dries quickly with no lingering greasy feel and any white streaks quickly fade.</li>
            <li> I used this product 5 years ago when we went to Jamaica and never got burned even though we were outside most of the day.  </li>
            <li> Used the first day on my chest.</li>
            <li> Costco, Huy Fong (makers of Sri Racha hot sauce), Lululemon, Rolls Royce, Krispy Kreme Donuts, Zara.</li>
            <li> This is the first truly non-greasy sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> With that being said when you put Coppertone on your child that is exactly what you want - something that will not come off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t suggest using on face as it will irritate your eyes once it&#x27;s melt on your face when it&#x27;s hot.</li>
            <li> I decided to order 45 to have &amp;#34;on hand&amp;#34; for any kids or parents who wanted a higher SPF.  </li>
            <li> This product is totally worth it and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most sun screens especially those with homoslate.</li>
            <li> I wear sunscreen year round, and it&#x27;s good for that.</li>
            <li> I like the good, big bottle for the low price, since I wear it year-round.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried many different kinds of sunscreen and this really works.  </li>
            <li> SO far we have used it and are happy that it is not greasy, and the kids have not complained about it itching like other brands do.</li>
            <li> Pretty much my go to bottle when summer starts.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I ordered a product of this kind, And both times it has arrived with a major leak.</li>
            <li> Applied liberally, 1-2 hours before going out into the sun, and have been in the sun for 4-6 hours, coupled with several dips into the lake to cool off, and without reapplying, have come home looking like I hadn&#x27;t been in the sun at all!</li>
            <li> Then a few months later, my all-time favorite bathing suit started to dissolve around the straps which is right where I apply the most sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The lotion works very well and is non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This sunblock was tested in Mexico and Aruba works great, the result is the same as much more expensive sunblocks i used before.</li>
            <li> and it dries extremely fast.  </li>
            <li> It is a great value, and I will use the rest of the bottle up, but I am more aware that it does tend to \\&quot;flake\\&quot; off when re-applied :(</li>
            <li> This arrived very well packaged</li>
            <li> This product really does protect your skin very well and also works well when you are in and out of the water.  </li>
            <li> While the prodicut acts very well as a sunscreen lotion, I was mislead by the product labeling.</li>
            <li> This NO-AD really has saved my skin.  </li>
            <li> and it really does work.  </li>
            <li> Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li> My husband is very fair-skinned and he uses this whenever he goes out in the sun.  </li>
            <li> The material was much thinner in spots throughout the garment.</li>
            <li> So, in using this SPF correctly, I avoid the burn and go straight to tan.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I really like this.</li>
            <li> Wrapped in shrink wrap so it was ready to travel without concern for leakage during flight.</li>
            <li> This lotion is inexpensive but really does the job, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, even on my face under makeup.</li>
            <li> And reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> My husband really likes this brand.  </li>
            <li> I have a real problem with sun burn.  </li>
            <li> I appreciated that.</li>
            <li> used the whole time in hawaii 5 nights stay.  </li>
            <li> It felt very greasy going on.</li>
            <li> I was expecting much worse, but this is actually one of the best sunscreens I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> In this age of crazy media and social media shoving consumer goods down our throats, it feels nice to support the companies who just do what they do best: make a quality product and let the product speak for itself.</li>
            <li> We were 6 hours in SeaWorld in full sun at 104° and applied it only twice.  </li>
            <li> I bought a bottle a long time ago and it has lasted me for many years (not out in the sun an excessive amount) and when I was looking for more</li>
            <li> This formula goes on very fast, with high saturation (I test my sunblocks with a black light to see how they absorb etc.)</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend trying this sunblock.  </li>
            <li> This product is rated highly by consumer reports and I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> This one came highly recommended from reviews online.</li>
            <li> It goes on very easily, not thick like the Sport 50</li>
            <li> I have been wearing sunblock everyday for most of my life</li>
            <li> This is well worth it, especially for sun protection every day.</li>
            <li> and I was forced to search for it online and ended up paying more than I should have had it been available locally.</li>
            <li> Again, no hard proof, but be warned.</li>
            <li> I love this for beach and other intense sun related activities</li>
            <li> I work outside during the summer mowing pastures and Right Of Ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen and it&#x27;s not easy to find where I am located.</li>
            <li> I live in the Boston area and am outdoors every day.</li>
            <li> I had to order it  because I couldn&#x27;t find the product where I live.  </li>
            <li> Before recapping the bottle I put a small piece of plastic wrap over the top of the bottle opening to prevent leaks and drying.  </li>
            <li> My husband is light-skinned and only burns, so he wanted a higher SPF, so I ordered 16 for him</li>
            <li> this is a very good sunblock , it absorbs easily and lasts a long time, I  have to buy it at Amazon because those idiots at walmart stopped selling it.</li>
            <li> ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I play a lot of tennis and am outside in full sunlight for several hours at a time.  </li>
            <li> No Ad has a great history of, duh, no advertisements, and that allows them to make a quality product for less.</li>
            <li> Worked extremely well in protecting us from afternoon sun, even being in the pool for hours at a time and my friend burns quickly.  </li>
            <li> However, my husband bought this over the weekend - and we can&#x27;t even use it because we have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> But if you have sensitive skin or tend to have allergic reactions to sunscreen, proceed with caution.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin nor does my friend who shared a bottle of this with me while vacationing in the Caribbean.  </li>
            <li> people don&#x27;t apply as much as you should, so you sort of need a big bottle to get you through a summer.</li>
            <li> Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 68 years old</li>
            <li> Recently, I just pulled out my bone leather sandals from last summer and they are stained right where I put sunscreen to protect the tops of my feet.</li>
            <li> We, of course, had wonderful new light-colored clothing for our trip which is now HORRIBLY stained ORANGE thanks to this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> This lotion did not wash off after an hour and a half of snorkeling &amp; diving and was good to go for another round an hour later.  </li>
            <li> This is fabulous compared to the Coppertone body sunblock that I usually use for my arms.  </li>
            <li> No one in the family complains about it being greasy, no one get&#x27;s sunburned, and we only need to buy a new bottle every couple years.</li>
            <li> It might even replace my expensive Shiseido sunblock for my face; I really like the way it looks, but I&#x27;m still testing it out to make sure it doesn&#x27;t break me out.  </li>
            <li> That the UV protection number does not have to be 60 or 100, but rather if it was broad spectrum, it could be a lower number.</li>
            <li> None of the hype and claims of the major brands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it swimming, backpacking at high altitude, and long days on the bike.</li>
            <li> This seems to happen only if you don&#x27;t rub the sunscreen in completely.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a big bottle, double that of your normal size sunscreen</li>
            <li> The bottles are large and inexpensive compared to other brands.  </li>
            <li> Live long and prosper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also large enough to last for a long time, so you can buy one bottle and use it liberally without thinking about when you&#x27;ll have to buy another.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy looking at first</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on price and other high reviews.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I bought this product based on the high rating it got in Consumer Reports.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one because it was rated highest by Consumer Reports higher than major brands that I usually buy at local stores before.&lt;br /&gt;Turned</li>
            <li> Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks.</li>
            <li> I was not thrilled with the smell initially but it wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> I have far fewer wrinkles than other women my age.</li>
            <li> I had no trouble with the peel issue as I rubbed it in completely whereas my friend left a heavy layer for added protection due to his sunburn susceptibility.</li>
            <li> There is almost no smell compared to other major</li>
            <li> I used this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I just got this so the jury is still out, but after a long day in the sun I didn&#x27;t have any burn.</li>
            <li> I teach swim lessons all summer long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used No-Ad multiple times now and have had absolutely no</li>
            <li> The sticky/greasy feeling is non existent with this sunblock; if you have dry skin, this may be an issue for you.  </li>
            <li> typically apply this at 6 AM, but it needs another application by 4 PM if I am going to be staying outside that long.</li>
            <li> It was disappointing this year that the local Wal-Mart did not stock a full line</li>
            <li> The only little problem that can be avoided - don&#x27;t apply it to close to your eyes.  </li>
            <li> only wish that it were a little thicker so that it wouldn&#x27;t run into my eyes when I sweat.</li>
            <li> Few years back, I had no idea that majority of those entities that promote an item are being paid from cancer institutions to magazines.</li>
            <li> It is not available as retail, only on-line did we find it.  </li>
            <li> Complete failure for surfing.</li>
            <li> I know I have to reapply sunscreens often, but this offered little protection for even a short length of time (less than 2 hours).  </li>
            <li> Its a little greasy, but it stays on a long time.</li>
            <li> I use it over a year now and will continue to do so because it feels less greasy than other brands of sunscreens, the bottle is big , cost little and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this at the beach and music festivals, spent hours in the sun with it and no sunburns yet!</li>
            <li> I prefer it to any other screen I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Though I did not tan as well as usual with daily use of it, this pasty-white guy did not suffer from any sunburn either.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t find it in any other stores.  </li>
            <li> I will never buy any other, now that I have found it.</li>
            <li> 16-ounces is almost double of what you&#x27;d usually buy in stores.</li>
            <li> No more designer sunscreens in tiny bottles for $16.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re still sticking to your Coppertone/Banana Boat loyalties, consider this: other companies that don&#x27;t advertise?</li>
            <li> Used this product for the past several years.  </li>
            <li> I put it on no higher than my cheek bones.</li>
            <li> I have not tanned in years but would still burn with other sunblocks.</li>
            <li> Works for active life.  </li>
            <li> My order arrived with half the bottle empty, and had spread all over the box.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this product breaks down in the bottle after opening or being left in a bag or the sun</li>
            <li> out this is less greasy and almost feel like other skin lotions.</li>
            <li> AND IT IS NOT FUN.  </li>
            <li> I have used this in the past but have had trouble finding it locally.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my scalp to keep the burning down</li>
            <li> Maybe they could make the bottle a little heavier like other products.</li>
            <li> $9.44) or less.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less shiny than others but still shiny.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is, however, a little greasy &amp; does have the typical sunscreen</li>
            <li> I used this on my kids since they were little.</li>
            <li> One bottle had a little leak on arrival.</li>
            <li> It absorbs as well as a body lotion and doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;pill\\&quot; up and roll off in little pieces after a few hours like some sunscreens do.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavy and greasy going on, but</li>
            <li> Your skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and in a few minutes, you skin feels like it has nothing on it at all.  </li>
            <li> : I noticed that this sunblock peels off after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, not sticky.  </li>
            <li> Somehow this product scored well with Consumer Reports on one year, and poorly the next.  </li>
            <li> Been using for a few years.</li>
            <li> he is going to use it everyday</li>
            <li> When I go in the sun, I usually re-apply sunblock every few hours, and this sunblock was peeling off my face and legs.  </li>
            <li> However, I noticed that CR has new recommendations posted on their website in late May, 2013, and this product now gets a very poor recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, after using and handling my cell ph, I noticed the hard plastic case on my EVO had shriveled up into a puckered mess.</li>
            <li> Product seems to do the job but the plastic bottle is hard to squeeze and the package came with one bottle having opened and made quite a mess.</li>
            <li> If only I could find it in local stores. :(</li>
            <li> I applied this sunblock to myself and my kids liberally over the past year when needed.</li>
            <li> No sunburn except this past Saturday.</li>
            <li> It spreads very well not too thick or thin.&lt;br /&gt;No unpleasant smell .</li>
            <li> I used to buy this, but haven&#x27;t seen it in the usual store, lately.</li>
            <li> but it has no icky evil stuff in it that causes cancer later in life.</li>
            <li> but lately it is hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> No Ad delivers top-quality protection for a rock-bottom price, and its hard plastic bottle prevents it from accidentally squeezing out in a tightly-packed beach bag.</li>
            <li> In the store I&#x27;d have at least two years.</li>
            <li> It seems to work well as a sunscreen, but I wish it were unscented or at least came in a fragrance-free version.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sunscreen is so expensive, and I bought this based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li> My friend actually preferred the No-Ad over the Coppertone +50 (child version to use on face to prevent stinging of eyes) because the Coppertone was very difficult to get off when he wanted it off.  </li>
            <li> It is less expensive</li>
            <li> My experience with this product was not good.</li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> Weird.</li>
            <li> In my experience, when ST lotion is expensive, you tend to under-apply it.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very thin and my boys got burned as soon as they got into the pool.  </li>
            <li> A coach who asked a player to give 110% is crazy.</li>
            <li> I sail a lot and try like crazy to avoid getting sunburned.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I am afraid of the sun.</li>
            <li> So annoying to have expensive and well-liked things ruined.</li>
            <li> The bad: Before I begin, let me say I have no proof that it was indeed the NO-AD,</li>
            <li> daughter used to complain about bad smell every time she uses sunblocks before.</li>
            <li> Too bad it doesnt come in a spray which my kids prefer to use.</li>
            <li> It was very disappointing and was a horrible way to start our vacation.</li>
            <li> I just hope this doesn&#x27;t have that sickening pina colada fragrance!</li>
            <li> The inflammation / rash I got was awful.  </li>
            <li> Very annoying.</li>

            <li> My wife and I have been using NO-AD sunscreen for several years.  The bottles are large and inexpensive compared to other brands.  The lotion works very well and is non-greasy.  We lotion up all visible skin areas each morning for sun protection.</li>
            <li> Excellent…where &amp;#34;excellent&amp;#34; means 10 on a scale of 1 - 10 with 10 being highest. A coach who asked a player to give 110% is crazy. One can only give 100%. Or a teacher who uses an A+ grade when the scale only goes to A. I now should have enough words to send this on.... but &amp;#34;Excellent&amp;#34; should have said it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My &amp;#34;Excellent&amp;#34; means if I need more of this product I would buy from you.</li>
            <li> I was looking at sun screens today at my WalMart and I saw this product there. So maybe they&#x27;ve started carrying it again. I was more expensive though than Amazon&#x27;s price. I just hope this doesn&#x27;t have that sickening pina colada fragrance!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this at the beach and music festivals, spent hours in the sun with it and no sunburns yet!</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen. I used it for a week at the beach, on the beach every day. It goes on very easily, not thick like the Sport 50 I had been using. It has almost no fragrance. It did not wash off while I was in the ocean. I did not burn at all. I don&#x27;t know about Consumer Reports, but this is the best sunscreen I have ever used and I would highly recommend it. I also noticed that Walmart is now selling it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit July 3, 2013 - Had my annual checkup at my dermatologist this morning. Waited this year until we got back from the beach so he could assess sun damage from our week on the beach. I told him that I had tried using a new sunscreen this year since I felt there had to be something better than the sport 50 I had been using. He asked what I used and I told him the NoAD 45 and his response was that he used the NoAD as well and had been using it for years. If it is good enough for my dermatologist it is good enough for me!</li>
            <li> Sunscreen isn&#x27;t greasy at all, and actually has a pleasant smell.  I was expecting much worse, but this is actually one of the best sunscreens I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, and no perfume!  I prefer it to any other screen I have ever tried. Most screens stink and are pricey.</li>
            <li> I used this for a long time.  I now use Equate Ultra Protection #50 rated number one lotion by Consumer Reports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ed Mandler</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using No-Ad for 15+ years now. Per ounce, it&#x27;s pretty cheap, and I find it&#x27;s acceptably greesy. You can spend a lot more on face sunscreen, but if you just want some stout sunscreen, this is it. I&#x27;ve used it swimming, backpacking at high altitude, and long days on the bike.</li>
            <li> I bought this sun screen after reading an article that indicated that its very important to make sure they say \\&quot;broad spectrum\\&quot;. That the UV protection number does not have to be 60 or 100, but rather if it was broad spectrum, it could be a lower number. Also, the article recommended this brand as having the best value for money. SO far we have used it and are happy that it is not greasy, and the kids have not complained about it itching like other brands do. We will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen :D Economic and effective</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and it is a great value!!</li>
            <li> Most sunscreens are greasy but not this one.  It goes on smoothly and is very effective.  I&#x27;m very happy with theis product.</li>
            <li> No Ad sun block is great stuff. Have used it several years now with no burns!</li>
            <li> Now I know why this sunblock is so hyped. Works just like everyone said. Fantastic protection, no greasiness or oiliness, protects for a good amount of time, non-offensive odor and high quality ingredients for a bargain price!</li>
            <li> The expiration date is too short. In the store I&#x27;d have at least two years.</li>
            <li> Prior to departing for St.John, USVI, I ordered a bottle of this after reading the recent Consumer Reports review of it.   This lotion did not wash off after an hour and a half of snorkeling &amp; diving and was good to go for another round an hour later.  Though I did not tan as well as usual with daily use of it, this pasty-white guy did not suffer from any sunburn either. It gets my recommendation.</li>
            <li> The good: NO-AD spf 8 did keep me from getting burned in the Keys in 80+ bright and sunny weather.  The bad: Before I begin, let me say I have no proof that it was indeed the NO-AD, though, can&#x27;t figure out what else it could be. Put No-Ad lotion on at the beach with my hands, then picked up my pencil to do a puzzle. Within an hour I noticed my pencil was all sticky feeling. Inspection showed the finish on the pencil had dissolved. (Nothing else had come in contact with it.) Also, after using and handling my cell ph, I noticed the hard plastic case on my EVO had shriveled up into a puckered mess. Weird. Again, no hard proof, but be warned.</li>
            <li> The product is good, but the expiration date is far too soon. I purchased this and it arrived today (6/5/15) and it expires in December 2015. Guess I better use it all up this summer.</li>
            <li> This sunblock was tested in Mexico and Aruba works great, the result is the same as much more expensive sunblocks i used before.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing sunblock everyday for most of my life and I have probably tried every brand of drug store sunblock that exists; No AdD is really amazing.  It might even replace my expensive Shiseido sunblock for my face; I really like the way it looks, but I&#x27;m still testing it out to make sure it doesn&#x27;t break me out.  This formula goes on very fast, with high saturation (I test my sunblocks with a black light to see how they absorb etc.) and it dries extremely fast.  Your skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and in a few minutes, you skin feels like it has nothing on it at all.  This is fabulous compared to the Coppertone body sunblock that I usually use for my arms.  I really don&#x27;t like the greasy feeling that most sunblocks leave.  The sticky/greasy feeling is non existent with this sunblock; if you have dry skin, this may be an issue for you.  I would highly recommend trying this sunblock.  It is high quality and very economical.  I am very pleased and I think I have found a new HG sunblock :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I noticed that this sunblock peels off after a few hours.  When I go in the sun, I usually re-apply sunblock every few hours, and this sunblock was peeling off my face and legs.  It is a great value, and I will use the rest of the bottle up, but I am more aware that it does tend to \\&quot;flake\\&quot; off when re-applied :(</li>
            <li> I bought this one because it was rated highest by Consumer Reports higher than major brands that I usually buy at local stores before.&lt;br /&gt;Turned out this is less greasy and almost feel like other skin lotions. There is almost no smell compared to other major brands.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter used to complain about bad smell every time she uses sunblocks before. Not with this one.&lt;br /&gt;Approval from my daughter, priceless.</li>
            <li> NO AD is the best sunblock there is.  Was rated #1 in Consumer Report.  Have used it for many years.</li>
            <li> This arrived very well packaged and it&#x27;s what I needed instead of the 30 spf I took to Rangiroa.  This will accompany on my next island adventure.</li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen. Goes on smoothly with no overpowering scent, dries quickly with no lingering greasy feel and any white streaks quickly fade. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Works for active life.  No sticky/oily residue!</li>
            <li> Was happy to locate at Amazon, the No-Ad sunscreen which Consumer Reports did designate as a \\&quot;Best Buy\\&quot; in their July 2011 article.  BUT . . . they indicated that it was a \\&quot;Best Buy\\&quot; when purchased for 59 cents an ounce.  This 16 ounce bottle, WOULD then appear to be a \\&quot;Best Buy\\&quot; if it sold for $9.44 (16 ounces X $.59 &#x3D; $9.44) or less.  (NOTE: When this opinion was submitted, this 16 ounce No-Ad bottle&#x27;s price was in excess of $19.00)</li>
            <li> after reading all the great reviews I thought this would be better, I found it to be on the greasy side... living in Florida its hot and you sweat a lot...it also left tan looking stain on my shirts.</li>
            <li> I used this product 5 years ago when we went to Jamaica and never got burned even though we were outside most of the day.  So when I went to purchase more I found out that Walmart no longer carries it and I couldn&#x27;t find it in any other stores.  That is why I bought it online.  This product really does protect your skin very well and also works well when you are in and out of the water.  It&#x27;s a little greasy looking at first but that goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> I use it over a year now and will continue to do so because it feels less greasy than other brands of sunscreens, the bottle is big , cost little and it does its job of keeping my skin without freckles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loaded with fragrance.  We buy No-AD because most of their original sunscreens were fragrance free (including the sport, which still is).  However, my husband bought this over the weekend - and we can&#x27;t even use it because we have sensitive skin.  No-AD is still a great sunblock, but if you are looking for something less fragrant, this might not be it.  It&#x27;s also not a tropical smell which can sometimes be nice, it&#x27;s flowery.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with item.  Recommended by Consumer Reports and by a friend &#x27;s Dermatologist.  I play golf regularly so am constantly in the sun.</li>
            <li> this is a very good sunblock , it absorbs easily and lasts a long time, I  have to buy it at Amazon because those idiots at walmart stopped selling it.</li>
            <li> Product seems to do the job but the plastic bottle is hard to squeeze and the package came with one bottle having opened and made quite a mess.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen I have ever used! I will never buy any other, now that I have found it. It is non-greasy, disappears on the skin, does not smell, AND my skin is protected from the sun!&lt;br /&gt;Just amazing.....</li>
            <li> My headline says most of it, but you should also know that this is the product that gets praise from consumer agencies and health nuts. It works as well as the big commercial brands but it has no icky evil stuff in it that causes cancer later in life.</li>
            <li> Great value sun screen. I used to have to use this product multiple times a day when I worked outside and this product keeps your skin protected and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm and the price was right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years but lately it is hard to find in the stores. I used this on my kids since they were little. Living in AZ, the sun is very strong and my kids never burned while using this product on them. It is less expensive then most other sunscreens brands and you get more for your money. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Rated 7 out of 10 on the toxic level. Not uniform protection.</li>
            <li> Very good protection, long lasting and good price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used NO-AD sunscreen for years.  It&#x27;s reasonably priced and it does a great job of protecting my skin from getting sunburned.  I play a lot of tennis and am outside in full sunlight for several hours at a time.  I NEED some really good, long-lasting sun screen.  I don&#x27;t use this on my face because it will sting if it gets in my eyes, but I use it liberally on my neck, chest, arms and the tops of my ears.  I use another suncreen for my face that doesn&#x27;t sting when I sweat.  NO-AD is kind of thinnish when it comes out of the bottle but it thickens up real fast when you start to rub it in on your skin.  I have no complaints about this product at all.</li>
            <li> Gave this one to my daughter who works in the sun and she is very happy for it is protecting her skin.  I will have to buy it here again as I can&#x27;t find it locally.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> They used to carry this in Walgreens but have not done so for quite a while. This is the best and most economical sunscreen that I have found. I&#x27;ll continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> spilled in the box while arrived</li>
            <li> Excellent sunscreen; not too thick, and not scented. 16-ounces is almost double of what you&#x27;d usually buy in stores. This is well worth it, especially for sun protection every day.</li>
            <li> Worked very good. I actually didn&#x27;t get sunburn on where i put sunscreen. I know this sunscreen has health concerns on Environmental Working Group website about the chemicals it uses, but that is controversial.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I used this every day for a month in the blazing sun south of the equator on an island in French Polynesia.  (I know, I know...but SOMEBODY had to go...) I had ZERO sunburn.  It goes on smoothly, not sticky.  Lasts a long time.  It&#x27;s the best sunscreen around.</li>
            <li> We have used No-Ad for years and I&#x27;ve never had a sunburn even when I did not reapply the sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is a good deal and worked well for my 8 day trip to MB.  Much more economical than the spray.</li>
            <li> NO-AD products are the best!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased product NO-AD 45 before going to Florida. Used the first day on my chest. Used a Brand name on my legs. Next 4 days I had to wear a shirt I was so RED. May as well sprayed water on my chest.</li>
            <li> No Ad has a great history of, duh, no advertisements, and that allows them to make a quality product for less. Consumer Reports named this the best sunscreen of 2011, with the top quality and also the cheapest price per ounce (59 cents/ounce at the time. At $11.80 for 16 ounces, it&#x27;s now 74 cents per ounce). I would wager that the quality hasn&#x27;t changed. My girlfriend and I both used this all summer and had plenty for the both of us. No more designer sunscreens in tiny bottles for $16. No Ad delivers top-quality protection for a rock-bottom price, and its hard plastic bottle prevents it from accidentally squeezing out in a tightly-packed beach bag. It&#x27;s also large enough to last for a long time, so you can buy one bottle and use it liberally without thinking about when you&#x27;ll have to buy another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re still sticking to your Coppertone/Banana Boat loyalties, consider this: other companies that don&#x27;t advertise? Costco, Huy Fong (makers of Sri Racha hot sauce), Lululemon, Rolls Royce, Krispy Kreme Donuts, Zara. All quality products. If you&#x27;re good enough to survive without advertising, that means consumers KNOW you&#x27;ve got a quality product and will buy it anyway. In this age of crazy media and social media shoving consumer goods down our throats, it feels nice to support the companies who just do what they do best: make a quality product and let the product speak for itself. Why would you buy anything else?</li>
            <li> Just as good as anything else at lower prices! Not greasy and best of all:  unscented! No visible residue either. None of the hype and claims of the major brands.  The fact that it is marketed by a non-profit did not determine purchase - the price did.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended NO-AD to us and we are sooo glad.  One application protects us through a full day of racing and car shows and if you know this hobby, you know it&#x27;s fans ALL bake in the sun.  Perfect!!!  If only I could find it in local stores. :(</li>
            <li> Sunscreen is so expensive, and I bought this based on other reviews.  Plus it seemed like it would be non-allergenic.  Not so for me. The inflammation / rash I got was awful.  I itched for 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, my husband also used it and had no negative reaction at all.  But if you have sensitive skin or tend to have allergic reactions to sunscreen, proceed with caution.</li>
            <li> I just got this so the jury is still out, but after a long day in the sun I didn&#x27;t have any burn. Liquidy enough to go on smoothly without being too thin and drippy. Good price too.</li>
            <li> What more can I ask. No one in the family complains about it being greasy, no one get&#x27;s sunburned, and we only need to buy a new bottle every couple years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got fairly fair skin and have a tendency to burn quickly.  I use this product on my full body and face and it seems to resist sweat and water well and keeps me from getting burnt.</li>
            <li> I sail a lot and try like crazy to avoid getting sunburned.&lt;br /&gt;This was recommended on a sailor site and it seems to work well! Like any sunscreen, reapplication is important. Plus, it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li> Just what I need.  I wear sunscreen year round, and it&#x27;s good for that. It&#x27;s not greasy and works well</li>
            <li> Used this product for the past several years.  Was purchasing locally at Walmart but they discontinued the product.  Its non sticky non greasy and works.  Price is right.</li>
            <li> Excellent, I have been using No-Ad for 15 years and recently switched to SPF 45 and absolutely will continue to buy this product.  I didn&#x27;t burn one time when using and re-applying as needed.</li>
            <li> This is the first truly non-greasy sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I decided to try this after the Consumer Report recommendation was published, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product.  It absorbs as well as a body lotion and doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;pill\\&quot; up and roll off in little pieces after a few hours like some sunscreens do.  It&#x27;s a great value for the price too!  I was happy to purchase this from Amazon as I could not find it in any stores.</li>
            <li> I purchased NO-AD Sun Block Lotion and received Suncreeen lotion instead. While the prodicut acts very well as a sunscreen lotion, I was mislead by the product labeling.</li>
            <li> I am a tennis pro, so I spend the day in the sun.  This NO-AD really has saved my skin.  Consumer reports gave it a best rating and I can confirm that it stays on and protects you for many hours.  I like the aloe as that keeps my skin from drying out from the wind and sun.  Best part is that it isn&#x27;t sticky or oily feeling and has no odor once you put it on.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.</li>
            <li> Its very good sunsceen</li>
            <li> I used to buy this, but haven&#x27;t seen it in the usual store, lately. I was glad to see it available here. I like the good, big bottle for the low price, since I wear it year-round.</li>
            <li> I work outside during the summer mowing pastures and Right Of Ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff goes on and dries. If it left an oily film, dust would stick to me out in the 110°F heat. That is just nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically apply this at 6 AM, but it needs another application by 4 PM if I am going to be staying outside that long.</li>
            <li> BUY THIS  -  I&#x27;M AN 18 YEAR POST-SURGERY CANCER SURVIVOR AND IT IS NOT FUN.  NO-AD BRAND IS A GREAT PRODUCT AT LOWER PRICE THAN THE HIGHLY-ADVERTISED BRANDS BUT MORE EFFECTIVE THAN MANY OF THEM AND SECOND TO NONE.</li>
            <li> I have never been a big sunblock user.  I am out in the sun all of the time so I have finally started using this product.  It is good.  Simple.  No big odor.  Rubs in and is not greasy.  Very inexpensive and according to reviews, great bang for your buck and it really does work.  No sunburn on these arms that are always out there.</li>
            <li> Rated the best among lotions by Consumer Reports, -not always a guaranty- but was right on the money wrt this product.  The only little problem that can be avoided - don&#x27;t apply it to close to your eyes.  Not a big problem because the eyes should be protected by good pair of sunglasses;-)</li>
            <li> The price is right and this stuff does exactly what I want; it blocks the sun from my northern European fair skin.  It&#x27;s a little heavy and greasy going on, but in 10 minutes you wouldn&#x27;t even know you had it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on price and other high reviews.  I do not have sensitive skin nor does my friend who shared a bottle of this with me while vacationing in the Caribbean.  Neither of us suffered from any rashes, itching or breakout issues.  Worked extremely well in protecting us from afternoon sun, even being in the pool for hours at a time and my friend burns quickly.  Rubs in fairly easy, does not have an offensive smell and does not leave a greasy/sticky feel once absorbed.  My friend actually preferred the No-Ad over the Coppertone +50 (child version to use on face to prevent stinging of eyes) because the Coppertone was very difficult to get off when he wanted it off.  With that being said when you put Coppertone on your child that is exactly what you want - something that will not come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for the 4 stars vs. 5 stars is that I did notice that after a while, the No-Ad does appear to &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; off.  This seems to happen only if you don&#x27;t rub the sunscreen in completely.  I had no trouble with the peel issue as I rubbed it in completely whereas my friend left a heavy layer for added protection due to his sunburn susceptibility.</li>
            <li> Hits all the marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people don&#x27;t apply as much as you should, so you sort of need a big bottle to get you through a summer. Pretty much my go to bottle when summer starts.</li>
            <li> High SPF, grease-free, water-proof, sweat-proof, fantastic price. We have bottles of the stuff lying around, and always buy more just-in-case.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I bought this product based on the high rating it got in Consumer Reports.  It seems to work well as a sunscreen, but I wish it were unscented or at least came in a fragrance-free version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfume smell is strong and doesn&#x27;t go away over time.  Very annoying.</li>
            <li> I love this sunblock. Took this bottle, used it three times a day and I didn&#x27;t burn from sun exposure atthe beach or while boating. Too bad it doesnt come in a spray which my kids prefer to use.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past but have had trouble finding it locally.  I found it on Amazon and decided to order it as I had an upcoming vacation.  The product arrived a couple days later, enclosed in a plastic bag in addition to the box packaging.  The item arrived in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and many sunscreen products irritate my skin, even those that are hypoallergenic.  This No-Ad 45 does not bother me at all, even when worn all day.  The scent is very pleasing and the lotion applies nicely.  I like that this is a bigger bottle than most other sunscreens because I have fair skin and like to apply liberal amounts and reapply as needed without feeling like I need to make it last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using No-Ad products for years and this is the best.</li>
            <li> Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben, Isobutylparaben... They really dumped every PARABEN available in the chemical world in this mix and more...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.

Consumer Report is good for appliance and roofing recommendations, not for healthy ingredients.

            <li> After 2 days of using left hives on my wife and son. Also got sunburned after just 1 hour on 3rd day. Not sure if this product breaks down in the bottle after opening or being left in a bag or the sun</li>
            <li> Best high &amp;#34;spf&amp;#34; sunblock out there!!!</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a timely manner and well packaged for liquid contents.  We ordered this as a recommended product by Consumer Reports. It is not available as retail, only on-line did we find it.  The product is great. We were 6 hours in SeaWorld in full sun at 104° and applied it only twice.  No one suffered sunburn.</li>
            <li> I like this sun block because it provides broad spectrum protection which studies show offer the best protection. This lotion goes on smoothly and does not feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunblock is cost effective and comes in a nice large bottle which will last more than one season. When I store the sun block in the fall, I remove the lid and stuff a cotton ball in the neck of the bottle. Before recapping the bottle I put a small piece of plastic wrap over the top of the bottle opening to prevent leaks and drying.  I have used this bottle for several summers and it is still as effective as when it was new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> It was listed as the top sunscreen in consumer report for the 2011 and 2012. It&#x27;s really good! It comes with a big bottle, double that of your normal size sunscreen and I don&#x27;t get burn using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t suggest using on face as it will irritate your eyes once it&#x27;s melt on your face when it&#x27;s hot.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen seems to be quite effective and though thicker than what I was using, was absorbed pretty quickly and evenly.  I have not used it while swimming, but haven&#x27;t had stinging in my my eyes during somewhat sweaty workouts. I liked it well enough to re-order a 3 pack after having used it for a week.</li>
            <li> I have used this unadvertised sun screen for years.  It was disappointing this year that the local Wal-Mart did not stock a full line and I was forced to search for it online and ended up paying more than I should have had it been available locally.</li>
            <li> My husband is very fair-skinned and he uses this whenever he goes out in the sun.  He doesn&#x27;t burn any more, so he likes this product very much.</li>
            <li> used before, quite good</li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen. I love this for beach and other intense sun related activities</li>
            <li> I teach swim lessons all summer long.  This is the best sunscreen I have ever used.  Great price, too!!  PS.  I am 63 and have no wrinkles!</li>
            <li> Purchased this as rated by CR and have found it to be a great daily Sunscreen.  Not greasy like some of the others and doesn&#x27;t have that Zinc Oxide feel.</li>
            <li> good product worked as advertized left skin feeling very soft would recommend and purchase again arrived quickly and packaged well</li>
            <li> I applied this sunblock to myself and my kids liberally over the past year when needed. I couldn&#x27;t figure out why my kids&#x27; rash guards were literally dissolving in patches. The material was much thinner in spots throughout the garment. Even though from Lands End, I thought they were just made from cheap material. Then a few months later, my all-time favorite bathing suit started to dissolve around the straps which is right where I apply the most sunscreen. Recently, I just pulled out my bone leather sandals from last summer and they are stained right where I put sunscreen to protect the tops of my feet. So annoying to have expensive and well-liked things ruined. I am 99% sure it&#x27;s this NoAd that did it.</li>
            <li> I am so grateful that Amazon carries this brand since I can&#x27;t find it in stores anywhere!  I bought a bottle a long time ago and it has lasted me for many years (not out in the sun an excessive amount) and when I was looking for more, I realized stores don&#x27;t have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought SPF 8 and this has worked in all situations (beach, pool, working in the yard, etc.).  I am fairly light skinned and if I&#x27;m out in the sun a lot, I burn first and then tan for the remainder of the season.  So, in using this SPF correctly, I avoid the burn and go straight to tan.  My husband is light-skinned and only burns, so he wanted a higher SPF, so I ordered 16 for him and he actually goes between 8 and this and never gets burned.  I decided to order 45 to have &amp;#34;on hand&amp;#34; for any kids or parents who wanted a higher SPF.  I&#x27;m prepared for anything!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t any smell, it&#x27;s not sticky and I even put it on my face without any problems.  It&#x27;s an awesome sunscreen and when I saw there were different SPF&#x27;s, I bought those too!!</li>
            <li> I am afraid of the sun. This protects you wonderfully. I burn quite easily and I&#x27;m not even a ginger. With this sunscreen, I am more comfortable frolicking in the sun all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of No-Ad sunscreen and have been for quite some time. I love this sunscreen and it&#x27;s not easy to find where I am located. Thankfully, I&#x27;m able to find it here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish that it were a little thicker so that it wouldn&#x27;t run into my eyes when I sweat. Otherwise, I really like this. It offers great protection for my fair skin and protects my little one from getting burned.</li>
            <li> The price is right, but I won&#x27;t be able to evaluate the efficacy until I use it for a period of time.</li>
            <li> Always liked this product.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s purchase, he uses this all the time and finds it economical to buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Put some baby powder over it if you think it&#x27;s too greasy, which you will. Live long and prosper.</li>
            <li> It did the job, while we were in Central America on a Cruise and would recommend it for others, as well.</li>
            <li> I found it from the consumer report. It&#x27;s the best one I ever bought. Not sticky at all. And the price is good, too.</li>
            <li> Somehow this product scored well with Consumer Reports on one year, and poorly the next.  It leaves white residue.  Meh.</li>
            <li> todo perfecto rapido buen producto y grande el tamano. perfecto a++++. El shippin correcto todo ok. aaaa+  bbbb+ cccc ++++ ++++ cccc</li>
            <li> Went on a whale watching voyage for two hours during full sun. Protected us well. Wrapped in shrink wrap so it was ready to travel without concern for leakage during flight. Great product ! Recommended by Consumer,Reports.</li>
            <li> consumer report rated this sunscreen as one of the best and i love it. it feels like a lotion not greasy</li>
            <li> This sunscreen lotion is very good and low price.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it twice ago.&lt;br /&gt;i recommend and i will buy more.</li>
            <li> Living in Florida, it&#x27;s critical that I wear sunscreen every day. In my experience, when ST lotion is expensive, you tend to under-apply it. This lotion is inexpensive but really does the job, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, even on my face under makeup. Love it.</li>
            <li> I was scorched after using two applications of coppertone sport when kayaking on a bright sunny day this summer in San Diego.  I&#x27;ve used No-Ad multiple times now and have had absolutely no sunburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I call this stuff NORAD for fun.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I recently repurchased this sunscreen based on Consumer Report&#x27;s recommendations from 2012. However, I noticed that CR has new recommendations posted on their website in late May, 2013, and this product now gets a very poor recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CR currently recommends the following lotions as best:&lt;br /&gt;1. Walmart&#x27;s Equate Ultra Protection Sunscreen SPF 50. A lotion rated a Best Buy by CR, available at for around $.50 per ounce, with a CR score of 77.&lt;br /&gt;2. Coppertone Water Babies SPF 50. A lotion widely available for around $1.50 per ounce, with a CR score of 75.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to throw out what I bought and get one of the above.</li>
            <li> Use this when going fishing/boating in the Arizona summer: wind/heat/sun/light reflection off of water...&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:  Goes on and gets absorbed quickly without any greasy feeling.  Has no odor/fragrance. Doesn&#x27;t attrack bugs.  Doesn&#x27;t stain clothes. Applied liberally, 1-2 hours before going out into the sun, and have been in the sun for 4-6 hours, coupled with several dips into the lake to cool off, and without reapplying, have come home looking like I hadn&#x27;t been in the sun at all! Couldn&#x27;t find in stores any more, so bought a case through Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:  NONE!!!&lt;br /&gt;Best product out there!  And reasonably priced.  I use the spf 45.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this brand.  There&#x27;s nothing too special about it but it does its job well.  No scent, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years and it  seems to have all but disappeared from retailers shelves. Thanks for making it available. What makes this &amp;#34;The Best&amp;#34; is the fact that it has no fancy perfume and it does not burn your eyes.</li>
            <li> I have used NO AD sun blocks for years.  Many of our grandchildren have been effectively protected by these products.  I purchased this one to use when I do not need the strength of the water resistant one..( 85 SPF which can irritate skin after a while  so I use that one only when necessary).  I am very fair skinned, and am careful about protection because  I had a superficial melanoma removed from a non-exposed part of my body 25 years ago.  ( and I was NEVER a sun sitter)..Using NO AD products, I have never had a burn or a tan...not even a smidgen of one.</li>
            <li> Works well. Very effective. I live in the Boston area and am outdoors every day. I have been using it daily for the last 4 to 6 weeks. No sunburn except this past Saturday. Applied it before I went sailing. Later in the day, I borrowed someone&#x27;s spray-on Neutrogena 70+ and applied it to the back of my neck. The only redness/mild sunburn I had that day was on the back of my neck ... not on my face, arms or legs which were equally exposed. No-Ad is good stuff. It is also recommended by Consumer Reports.</li>
            <li> This product is a creamy wipe-on sun screen that rapidly becomes invisible on the skin.  It is one of the best skin protectors I have found.  I bought it through Amazon and I am completely satisfied with the product and the delivery.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! My wife and I used up a bottle of this in Fiji for our honeymoon and neither one ended up with a sunburn. It seemed to be fairly water resistant too.</li>
            <li> I bought three bottles at once to share with my family members, who all liked it. It spreads very well not too thick or thin.&lt;br /&gt;No unpleasant smell . One bottle had a little leak on arrival. Maybe they could make the bottle a little heavier like other products.</li>
            <li> Surfing requires sunblock that will stand up to the waves, not wash off and not burn my eyes. No-Ad sunblock migrates it into my eyes with sweat or water. Complete failure for surfing. It is the best sunblock for everything else though. It is by far the best buy per ounce and you can afford to slather it on. I put it on no higher than my cheek bones. Then I use a non migrating sun block above it. Great sunblock. Just use it properly.</li>
            <li> This product is rated highly by consumer reports and I have been using it for years. It works very well and is so much more price competitive than all the national brands it is almost too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I have a real problem with sun burn.  This is the best sun screen I have used.  Over the years I have tried many different kinds of sunscreen and this really works.  Its a little greasy, but it stays on a long time.</li>
            <li> Effective sunscreen. Been using for a few years.Great price from Amazon. Happy mom.</li>
            <li> It stained the collars of my tennis shirts and did not apply evenly on the skin.</li>
            <li> After my careful research before a trip to Mexico, I threw out all of our old sunscreen and bought this one.  We, of course, had wonderful new light-colored clothing for our trip which is now HORRIBLY stained ORANGE thanks to this sunscreen.  Sure, it kept us from burning, but it ruined hundreds of dollars of clothing for our family.  DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> The product is very good, The way you ship it, is not. This is the second time I ordered a product of this kind, And both times it has arrived with a major leak. Most companies tape the lid, and ship it in a plastic bag that is sealed. My order arrived with half the bottle empty, and had spread all over the box. You did provide a refund, without having to return the bottle, which made me very happy. I appreciated that. But I no longer will order this type of product through the mail, since it happened twice.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the way you handled the situation. You are a great company to order from.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. We&#x27;ve applied to everyone in the family from 4 yrs. to 40 yrs. It is top rated by a leading non-profit \\&quot;Consumer Magazine\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is, however, a little greasy &amp; does have the typical sunscreen odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tried the SPF50 for Kids version of this product &amp; like it much better!</li>
            <li> Have been using daily as a moisturizer under make-up for some 15+ years.  I have far fewer wrinkles than other women my age.</li>
            <li> I bought this to go on vacation in the Dominican Republic. I have not tanned in years but would still burn with other sunblocks. This one came highly recommended from reviews online. I decided to order some and I loved it. I did not get burnt once while on vacation. I reapplied every so often especially after going in the water. This product is totally worth it and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most sun screens especially those with homoslate. This product works great! I thought it had been discontinued by No-Ad.</li>
            <li> Product provides great protection from sun.</li>
            <li> worked great. no sunburn. used the whole time in hawaii 5 nights stay.  did not bother me or my skinn.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen absorbs quickly and is not greasy at all. I was not thrilled with the smell initially but it wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a really good sunscreen company! When ever i go any where i use this and it works great! I dont get any tans any more or sun burns. I would consider any of whos thinking about buying it, BUY IT!</li>
            <li> My experience with this product was not good. Even with multiple applications still burned. It felt very greasy going on.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who is very fair and she did not burn. works great and priced right -</li>
            <li> Smells like you just got back from Hawaii or the  Caribbean. I use it on my scalp to keep the burning down</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband. He loves it. The cost for the effectiveness of the SPF is a good deal. Give it a try</li>
            <li> Very good lotion . Use it for many years</li>
            <li> the best sunscreen lotion, it is perfect for summer, It was a gift for my dad and loved it. he is going to use it everyday</li>
            <li> I started using this after Consumer Reports gave it a Best Buy rating (I think they rated the SPF 30 version, though).  I&#x27;ve been happy with the product ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smooth.  Is inexpensive (but not as inespensive as CR got it for).  Smells O.K. Isn&#x27;t greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it is just a good product.</li>
            <li> Not great. I applied as directed and still burned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less shiny than others but still shiny.  Otherwise pretty good.</li>
            <li> Nowhere on the bottle it says that it is sunblock so I am sending it back.  I wanted Sunblock.  The bottle says Sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Excellent and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a big bottle of sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.  It inspires me to use a lot and use it often.  Have used it on our family for several months now of high-elevation hiking and two trips to the beach.  No sunburns!</li>
            <li> This lotion is very thin and my boys got burned as soon as they got into the pool.  I know I have to reapply sunscreens often, but this offered little protection for even a short length of time (less than 2 hours).  It was very disappointing and was a horrible way to start our vacation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 68 years old and I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens.  NO-AD Sunscreen is the best I&#x27;ve ever used!!!!  I had to order it  because I couldn&#x27;t find the product where I live.  It&#x27;s non-sticky, doesn&#x27;t &#x27;cling&#x27; to your skin, and goes on smoothly.  I use it like I would a lotion.  Absolutely the best!!!!</li>
