            <li>Very good hair clip.  </li>
            <li>And anyone else who sleeps with a claw clip in their hair knows how incredibly uncomforatable that feels.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also great since it&#x27;s all flexible plastic</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these Updo Barrettes, and couldn&#x27;t find them any longer in the stores, so was so happy to find them on Amazon.</li>

            <li>They look good too.</li>
            <li>I have finer hair, and found these are perfect for a quick ponytail, updo, or half-updo.  </li>
            <li>Love these, they work great</li>
            <li>I love that I get to keep my hair and that the barrette does not!</li>
            <li>and so glad I did!</li>
            <li>the packaging provides some ideas, and experimenting generates more !  </li>
            <li>I wondered if the clip would have been able to hold all my hair &amp; it did!  </li>
            <li>So glad I found them here!</li>
            <li>They are amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice option to a hair tie.</li>
            <li>I love the brown color because it blends with my hair nicely and my barrette is not competeing with my make-up or jewelry for attention.  </li>
            <li>There are also bright and pastel colors available if one searches Amazon.</li>
            <li>easy to use!</li>
            <li>Luckily, I have Amazon on my side :o)</li>
            <li>price was pretty great</li>
            <li>Also, nice because it&#x27;s so easy to use, just grab your hair, hold this around the clumped hair and clip it.  </li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>but they actually ended up being perfect!</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I bought these on a whim now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I will order more from this seller.</li>
            <li>Love these barrettes.  </li>
            <li>My favorite hair fastener.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these.</li>
            <li>I love these hair clips......</li>
            <li>And hold it - and hold it some more - and more - and even through sleep.  </li>
            <li>These are truly the most non-damaging hair clips I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I do love them and cannot get them in Walgreens store anymore, but found them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Just okay.</li>
            <li>and I am trying to grow it longer to donate it. :)</li>
            <li>I am hesitant to order the colors though as most of the ones offered say &amp;#34;colors may vary&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>There are many ways one can wear ones hair with these clips --</li>
            <li>I cannot find these in any stores anymore, so I think I will have to find some more.  </li>
            <li>i bought these on a whim, but am glad i got them.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>if i put more hair it doesnt close up.</li>
            <li>They do have the grippy things on them, but you need much more hair than I have to make it work.  </li>
            <li>These are my favorite and I can no longer find them in stores.</li>
            <li>Love these barrettes with a passion</li>
            <li>I wear them every night to sleep and most days too.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love them and get comments on them all the time.</li>
            <li>and I just bought four more.</li>
            <li>For as many compliments and inquiries as I receive about these barrettes, I don&#x27;t know why they aren&#x27;t sold in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>They are light, flexible and very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find hair clips made for fine hair and that do not pull or damage hair.</li>
            <li>These work so great on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>They hold a good deal of hair or not so much.</li>
            <li>So easy to put on and to take off.</li>
            <li>These are easy to put in and easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Stay in hair easily.</li>
            <li>No pulling, easy to use.</li>
            <li>They are still great at holding my hair without breaking it and looking much better than most other barrettes.</li>
            <li>These hold my fine hair and can hold a lot.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all well and fine..</li>
            <li>I think these barretts would be fine for fine hair or on a child.  </li>
            <li>Luckily there are inexpensive!</li>
            <li>With a little gel, this clip is AWESOME!!!  </li>
            <li>and I am so comfortable that I forget I have them in.  </li>
            <li>I was totally comfortable.  </li>
            <li>They are fantastic.</li>
            <li>They are so comfortable that I forget they are there sometimes.</li>
            <li>I am buying several because everytime I find a great product it gets discontinued.</li>
            <li>I can even sleep in these comfortably.</li>
            <li>They are so comfortable, you can even sleep on them with no discomfort.</li>
            <li>That are nowhere to be found, but were fantastic in concept.  </li>
            <li>and they hold my ponytail all day, comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Excited to have found them online.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is made of flexible plastic which allows it to be able to take in a large &amp;#34;glob&amp;#34; of hair with no problem.  </li>
            <li>Pro:  ok, gentle, doesn&#x27;t pull hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>I really need to by some more.</li>
            <li>am middle aged and even though these barettes are good for children, they look great on a woman of my age too...</li>
            <li>and I would recommend them if you want something simple and good to your hair-</li>
            <li>they cost a lot and they don&#x27;t come in cool colors.    </li>
            <li>If you have thick or curly hair, these will work perfectly for you.  </li>
            <li>My hair is quite thick, and these hold it up beautifully, and they&#x27;re so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Grab one of these, clip your hair back into a low pony tail and unload the dishwasher, when done, unclip and your hair will still look great with no kink where the clip was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing more as they are my go to clips.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Classic look, very pretty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these for a long time and they are still good.</li>
            <li>I bought these (and the large sized barrette too) on the recommendation of my daughter because metal barrettes break my hair so easily.  </li>
            <li>At first glance they look flimsy and you wonder how they will hold, but I have thick hair and they are wonderful and hold quite well.</li>
            <li>Very flexible and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li>Surprised to discover bright new colors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These barrettes used to be easy to find in retail stores, but I have not been able to for several months.  </li>
            <li>they are not heavy, easy to use, look cute and are gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li>These are great little barretts.  </li>
            <li>My hands are very damaged, so ease of use is important, and these are easier than hair bands.</li>
            <li>It is safe for holding my natural 4A/4B hair.  </li>
            <li>love being able to twist my hair in the morning and slipping a claw clip in and head out the door.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice to have a different style once in awhile.</li>
            <li>Worth a shot.</li>
            <li>These clips are so lightweight and comfortable, and I love that they&#x27;re flat.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>For me, they slip right out.</li>
            <li>...I was really looking forward to trying these since they&#x27;re made all of plastic with no hard metals, but they are so flimsy that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to use them at all.</li>
            <li>These feel a little flimsy on their own, but with hair in them they are quite secure.</li>
            <li>it can take on a large amount of hair gathered in one place!  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I argue over who gets to use them, and they are really easy for her (at 5 years old) to put in her hair.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They fit comfortably and flat to the head.  </li>
            <li>As expected, they work very well for fine hair  : )</li>
            <li>The small ones are great for just pulling back a small amount on the crown of my head, and the large one perfectly holds all of my hair in a twist.  </li>
            <li>I will order more in future.</li>
            <li>I really like the larger size as well, though that tends to slip through my hair, so this smaller size is great for a pony tail.  </li>
            <li>They make a demi&#x3D;twist in seconds and they are not uncomfortable at all.  </li>
            <li>Hence, my search for more recent inovations to the hair clip industry which led me to this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are my favorite barrettes/hair clips; almost the only ones I wear.  </li>
            <li>I really, really like these barrettes!  </li>
            <li>I use one for sleeping when it&#x27;s hot to keep hair off my neck.  </li>
            <li>I have had these for several years and use them once a week or more.</li>
            <li>A very nice featur for long car rides when you want to rest your head on the head rest and such.  </li>
            <li>instead I use Goody mini spin pins much more often as they hold hair securely even with fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>They hold straight, super silky hair in place when it normally falls out of everything else.</li>
            <li>So when I&#x27;m out of work and take my hair down, it looks nice and not kinked.</li>
            <li>I own both sizes of these barrettes and in both black and brown.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t snag the hair and they are easy enough for them to use by themselves.  </li>
            <li>I have long thick hair, work great!</li>
            <li>this never snag or hurt my hair and help me prevent breakage because I use these rather than hair ties which is great since my hair is down my back</li>
            <li>If you want to put the whole head of hair up, you will need the large updo barette.</li>
            <li>The larger ones do work as well, but aren&#x27;t as secure and will slip out with much activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they really do hold the hair</li>
            <li>it holds my hair really well.</li>
            <li>If you hair is straight and very thin/fine</li>
            <li>Gentle on the hair and scalp...</li>
            <li>The plastic of these is gentle on my scalp and hair as they don&#x27;t cause breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They look rediculous with straight hair.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t work very well for me.  </li>
            <li>Also, they&#x27;re gentle with my hair - No breakage, and the hair doesn&#x27;t snag on the clip.</li>
            <li>This barrette does not hold very well.  </li>
            <li>and they are very durable.  </li>
            <li>They are incredibly comfortable and can make your hair look fancy instantly.</li>
            <li>These are really nice; took a few times before I got it to do what I needed</li>
            <li>Very nice to just pull up your hair for a short while because again per their design if you only use it for a short time, it doesn&#x27;t leave a kink in your hair like a normal hair tie would.  </li>
            <li>Cannot live without these!  </li>
            <li>Such a simple little hair accessory but really effective and easy to use.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s mainly why I use these.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving these a try.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these little things.</li>
            <li>However, in my case, they tend to slide down my fine and straight hair.</li>
            <li>This are great if your hair isn&#x27;t to thick or long.</li>
            <li>Out of the two sizes I purchased, I prefer these small ones better just because they are so versatile and really do hold quite a bit of hair...</li>
            <li>Someone with normal hair would probably not have any issues with them.</li>
            <li>As a busy mom, I LOVE that I can have an updo in less than one minute.</li>
            <li>These little barrettes are great for little girls.  </li>
            <li>like most other barrettes and hair clips do, because of the way they are designed -- no metal, no sharp edges, no tight joints in which anything can catch.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would use very frequently, but</li>
            <li>Looks neat, simple &amp; pretty.</li>
            <li>These are great for my long, thick hair!</li>
            <li>I have had the larger one of these and loved it, until I misplaced it shortly afterward.  </li>
            <li>I have soft, fine, curly hair and my daughter has coarse, thick, curly hair, but we both can use these barrettes and achieve long-lasting and COMFORTABLE hair styles.  </li>
            <li>These are just plastic with a plastic hinge that looks like it would come apart easily with a few bendings.  </li>
            <li>I USE THEM TO PULL THE TOP OF MY HAIR AND LEAVE THE BACK DOWN.  </li>
            <li>These barrettes are comfortable and cause far less damage than even the rubber coated metal ones.</li>
            <li>I never feel a pinch or a tug and there are no horrible barrette headaches that you get at the end of a long day with other barrette.</li>
            <li>Thin, fine hair means no matter what I do, this still slides right out.  </li>
            <li>i like having just to pull it back and not fuss too much with it...</li>
            <li>I use it to put my hair back but haven&#x27;t really figured out how to do an up-do yet.</li>
            <li>They are quite soft and pliable... hold well without any pinching or pulling or breaking.</li>
            <li>They go with everything and are not childish or glitzy.</li>
            <li>This will only hold a portion of your hair, which really doesn&#x27;t work for the updos I had in mind.</li>
            <li>i got these at my local walmart for less than amazon is charging(i paid $4.95) for em they are easy to put in</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and past my shoulders.</li>
            <li>Fine if you want all black, even though they said various colors.</li>
            <li>They were exactly what I expected with the exception that the color advertising was misleading.  </li>
            <li>Brought them with me on a recent trip when I knew I probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to do my hair everyday, and one clip stayed in the entire day!</li>
            <li>i havent tried much with different hairstyles as i have only had it for about 12hrs</li>
            <li>They hold a lot more hair than they appear to,  so unless you have really thick hair, go for the smaller size.</li>
            <li>was so happy to find them on Amazon, and then saw that they also come in different colors (I have only seen brown and black in the small ones and only black in the large).  </li>
            <li>The small size is ideal for medium length or thin long hair.  </li>
            <li>Love these for my long thick hair.</li>
            <li>need a little gel or spray in my hair to get this clip to work, but my hair is thinning due to medical problems (and that&#x27;s on top of the thinness I&#x27;ve had since chemo).</li>
            <li>I wish they were a little smaller so that they do not need so much hair to hold them in place, but I have adjusted the amount I normally put up</li>
            <li>For very long or thick hair the larger size is better.</li>
            <li>I usually use it to hold my hair back in something like a bun/updo twist combo, but there are many other ways to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not sure what I was expecting, something less flimsy for sure.  </li>
            <li>These are VERY small....way smaller than other Goody updo barrettes purchased on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>:  doesn&#x27;t really hold well, hair still slides down.  </li>
            <li>and when i dont put as much hair it seem to slide down my hairs.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Perfect barrettes that don&#x27;t pull your hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using these barrettes and have become very happy with them.</li>
            <li> If you have finer hair, these are perfect!</li>
            <li> Perfect for those who react to metal on skin.</li>
            <li> PERFECT all around !  </li>
            <li> These hold my hair in place, and the best thing is they do not break my hair!</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE!!!  </li>
            <li> Very good hair clip.  </li>
            <li> And anyone else who sleeps with a claw clip in their hair knows how incredibly uncomforatable that feels.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also great since it&#x27;s all flexible plastic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these Updo Barrettes, and couldn&#x27;t find them any longer in the stores, so was so happy to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Would work great for kids.</li>
            <li> I have used these before and they work great.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea why, these are great.  </li>
            <li> These are great.</li>
            <li> They work great though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great alternative to the scrunchy and looks nicer.  </li>
            <li> These clips are great.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> LOL.  </li>
            <li> They work GREAT for my purposes</li>
            <li> These make for amazing half-ponytail holders!</li>
            <li> I just wish that they were more attractive!</li>
            <li> My mother has issues with most metals used in hair clips and these are 100% plastic and are absolutely perfect for her.  </li>
            <li> I loved these barrettes for their ease of use and versatality.  </li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> They work good</li>
            <li> They look good too.</li>
            <li> I have finer hair, and found these are perfect for a quick ponytail, updo, or half-updo.  </li>
            <li> Love these, they work great</li>
            <li> I love that I get to keep my hair and that the barrette does not!</li>
            <li> and so glad I did!</li>
            <li> the packaging provides some ideas, and experimenting generates more !  </li>
            <li> I wondered if the clip would have been able to hold all my hair &amp; it did!  </li>
            <li> So glad I found them here!</li>
            <li> They are amazing.</li>
            <li> Nice option to a hair tie.</li>
            <li> I love the brown color because it blends with my hair nicely and my barrette is not competeing with my make-up or jewelry for attention.  </li>
            <li> There are also bright and pastel colors available if one searches Amazon.</li>
            <li> easy to use!</li>
            <li> Luckily, I have Amazon on my side :o)</li>
            <li> price was pretty great</li>
            <li> Also, nice because it&#x27;s so easy to use, just grab your hair, hold this around the clumped hair and clip it.  </li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> but they actually ended up being perfect!</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I bought these on a whim now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> I will order more from this seller.</li>
            <li> Love these barrettes.  </li>
            <li> My favorite hair fastener.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these.</li>
            <li> I love these hair clips......</li>
            <li> And hold it - and hold it some more - and more - and even through sleep.  </li>
            <li> These are truly the most non-damaging hair clips I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I do love them and cannot get them in Walgreens store anymore, but found them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Just okay.</li>
            <li> and I am trying to grow it longer to donate it. :)</li>
            <li> I am hesitant to order the colors though as most of the ones offered say &amp;#34;colors may vary&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> There are many ways one can wear ones hair with these clips --</li>
            <li> I cannot find these in any stores anymore, so I think I will have to find some more.  </li>
            <li> i bought these on a whim, but am glad i got them.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> I love these.  </li>
            <li> if i put more hair it doesnt close up.</li>
            <li> They do have the grippy things on them, but you need much more hair than I have to make it work.  </li>
            <li> These are my favorite and I can no longer find them in stores.</li>
            <li> Love these barrettes with a passion</li>
            <li> I wear them every night to sleep and most days too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them and get comments on them all the time.</li>
            <li> and I just bought four more.</li>
            <li> For as many compliments and inquiries as I receive about these barrettes, I don&#x27;t know why they aren&#x27;t sold in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> They are light, flexible and very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find hair clips made for fine hair and that do not pull or damage hair.</li>
            <li> These work so great on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> They hold a good deal of hair or not so much.</li>
            <li> So easy to put on and to take off.</li>
            <li> These are easy to put in and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Stay in hair easily.</li>
            <li> No pulling, easy to use.</li>
            <li> They are still great at holding my hair without breaking it and looking much better than most other barrettes.</li>
            <li> These hold my fine hair and can hold a lot.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all well and fine..</li>
            <li> I think these barretts would be fine for fine hair or on a child.  </li>
            <li> Luckily there are inexpensive!</li>
            <li> With a little gel, this clip is AWESOME!!!  </li>
            <li> and I am so comfortable that I forget I have them in.  </li>
            <li> I was totally comfortable.  </li>
            <li> They are fantastic.</li>
            <li> They are so comfortable that I forget they are there sometimes.</li>
            <li> I am buying several because everytime I find a great product it gets discontinued.</li>
            <li> I can even sleep in these comfortably.</li>
            <li> They are so comfortable, you can even sleep on them with no discomfort.</li>
            <li> That are nowhere to be found, but were fantastic in concept.  </li>
            <li> and they hold my ponytail all day, comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Excited to have found them online.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is made of flexible plastic which allows it to be able to take in a large &amp;#34;glob&amp;#34; of hair with no problem.  </li>
            <li> Pro:  ok, gentle, doesn&#x27;t pull hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> I really need to by some more.</li>
            <li> am middle aged and even though these barettes are good for children, they look great on a woman of my age too...</li>
            <li> and I would recommend them if you want something simple and good to your hair-</li>
            <li> they cost a lot and they don&#x27;t come in cool colors.    </li>
            <li> If you have thick or curly hair, these will work perfectly for you.  </li>
            <li> My hair is quite thick, and these hold it up beautifully, and they&#x27;re so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Grab one of these, clip your hair back into a low pony tail and unload the dishwasher, when done, unclip and your hair will still look great with no kink where the clip was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing more as they are my go to clips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Classic look, very pretty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a long time and they are still good.</li>
            <li> I bought these (and the large sized barrette too) on the recommendation of my daughter because metal barrettes break my hair so easily.  </li>
            <li> At first glance they look flimsy and you wonder how they will hold, but I have thick hair and they are wonderful and hold quite well.</li>
            <li> Very flexible and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Surprised to discover bright new colors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These barrettes used to be easy to find in retail stores, but I have not been able to for several months.  </li>
            <li> they are not heavy, easy to use, look cute and are gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li> These are great little barretts.  </li>
            <li> My hands are very damaged, so ease of use is important, and these are easier than hair bands.</li>
            <li> It is safe for holding my natural 4A/4B hair.  </li>
            <li> love being able to twist my hair in the morning and slipping a claw clip in and head out the door.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to have a different style once in awhile.</li>
            <li> Worth a shot.</li>
            <li> These clips are so lightweight and comfortable, and I love that they&#x27;re flat.</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> For me, they slip right out.</li>
            <li> ...I was really looking forward to trying these since they&#x27;re made all of plastic with no hard metals, but they are so flimsy that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to use them at all.</li>
            <li> These feel a little flimsy on their own, but with hair in them they are quite secure.</li>
            <li> it can take on a large amount of hair gathered in one place!  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I argue over who gets to use them, and they are really easy for her (at 5 years old) to put in her hair.</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They fit comfortably and flat to the head.  </li>
            <li> As expected, they work very well for fine hair  : )</li>
            <li> The small ones are great for just pulling back a small amount on the crown of my head, and the large one perfectly holds all of my hair in a twist.  </li>
            <li> I will order more in future.</li>
            <li> I really like the larger size as well, though that tends to slip through my hair, so this smaller size is great for a pony tail.  </li>
            <li> They make a demi&#x3D;twist in seconds and they are not uncomfortable at all.  </li>
            <li> Hence, my search for more recent inovations to the hair clip industry which led me to this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are my favorite barrettes/hair clips; almost the only ones I wear.  </li>
            <li> I really, really like these barrettes!  </li>
            <li> I use one for sleeping when it&#x27;s hot to keep hair off my neck.  </li>
            <li> I have had these for several years and use them once a week or more.</li>
            <li> A very nice featur for long car rides when you want to rest your head on the head rest and such.  </li>
            <li> instead I use Goody mini spin pins much more often as they hold hair securely even with fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> They hold straight, super silky hair in place when it normally falls out of everything else.</li>
            <li> So when I&#x27;m out of work and take my hair down, it looks nice and not kinked.</li>
            <li> I own both sizes of these barrettes and in both black and brown.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t snag the hair and they are easy enough for them to use by themselves.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair, work great!</li>
            <li> this never snag or hurt my hair and help me prevent breakage because I use these rather than hair ties which is great since my hair is down my back</li>
            <li> If you want to put the whole head of hair up, you will need the large updo barette.</li>
            <li> The larger ones do work as well, but aren&#x27;t as secure and will slip out with much activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they really do hold the hair</li>
            <li> it holds my hair really well.</li>
            <li> If you hair is straight and very thin/fine</li>
            <li> Gentle on the hair and scalp...</li>
            <li> The plastic of these is gentle on my scalp and hair as they don&#x27;t cause breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They look rediculous with straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t work very well for me.  </li>
            <li> Also, they&#x27;re gentle with my hair - No breakage, and the hair doesn&#x27;t snag on the clip.</li>
            <li> This barrette does not hold very well.  </li>
            <li> and they are very durable.  </li>
            <li> They are incredibly comfortable and can make your hair look fancy instantly.</li>
            <li> These are really nice; took a few times before I got it to do what I needed</li>
            <li> Very nice to just pull up your hair for a short while because again per their design if you only use it for a short time, it doesn&#x27;t leave a kink in your hair like a normal hair tie would.  </li>
            <li> Cannot live without these!  </li>
            <li> Such a simple little hair accessory but really effective and easy to use.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s mainly why I use these.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving these a try.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these little things.</li>
            <li> However, in my case, they tend to slide down my fine and straight hair.</li>
            <li> This are great if your hair isn&#x27;t to thick or long.</li>
            <li> Out of the two sizes I purchased, I prefer these small ones better just because they are so versatile and really do hold quite a bit of hair...</li>
            <li> Someone with normal hair would probably not have any issues with them.</li>
            <li> As a busy mom, I LOVE that I can have an updo in less than one minute.</li>
            <li> These little barrettes are great for little girls.  </li>
            <li> like most other barrettes and hair clips do, because of the way they are designed -- no metal, no sharp edges, no tight joints in which anything can catch.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would use very frequently, but</li>
            <li> Looks neat, simple &amp; pretty.</li>
            <li> These are great for my long, thick hair!</li>
            <li> I have had the larger one of these and loved it, until I misplaced it shortly afterward.  </li>
            <li> I have soft, fine, curly hair and my daughter has coarse, thick, curly hair, but we both can use these barrettes and achieve long-lasting and COMFORTABLE hair styles.  </li>
            <li> These are just plastic with a plastic hinge that looks like it would come apart easily with a few bendings.  </li>
            <li> I USE THEM TO PULL THE TOP OF MY HAIR AND LEAVE THE BACK DOWN.  </li>
            <li> These barrettes are comfortable and cause far less damage than even the rubber coated metal ones.</li>
            <li> I never feel a pinch or a tug and there are no horrible barrette headaches that you get at the end of a long day with other barrette.</li>
            <li> Thin, fine hair means no matter what I do, this still slides right out.  </li>
            <li> i like having just to pull it back and not fuss too much with it...</li>
            <li> I use it to put my hair back but haven&#x27;t really figured out how to do an up-do yet.</li>
            <li> They are quite soft and pliable... hold well without any pinching or pulling or breaking.</li>
            <li> They go with everything and are not childish or glitzy.</li>
            <li> This will only hold a portion of your hair, which really doesn&#x27;t work for the updos I had in mind.</li>
            <li> i got these at my local walmart for less than amazon is charging(i paid $4.95) for em they are easy to put in</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> Fine if you want all black, even though they said various colors.</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I expected with the exception that the color advertising was misleading.  </li>
            <li> Brought them with me on a recent trip when I knew I probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to do my hair everyday, and one clip stayed in the entire day!</li>
            <li> i havent tried much with different hairstyles as i have only had it for about 12hrs</li>
            <li> They hold a lot more hair than they appear to,  so unless you have really thick hair, go for the smaller size.</li>
            <li> was so happy to find them on Amazon, and then saw that they also come in different colors (I have only seen brown and black in the small ones and only black in the large).  </li>
            <li> The small size is ideal for medium length or thin long hair.  </li>
            <li> Love these for my long thick hair.</li>
            <li> need a little gel or spray in my hair to get this clip to work, but my hair is thinning due to medical problems (and that&#x27;s on top of the thinness I&#x27;ve had since chemo).</li>
            <li> I wish they were a little smaller so that they do not need so much hair to hold them in place, but I have adjusted the amount I normally put up</li>
            <li> For very long or thick hair the larger size is better.</li>
            <li> I usually use it to hold my hair back in something like a bun/updo twist combo, but there are many other ways to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not sure what I was expecting, something less flimsy for sure.  </li>
            <li> These are VERY small....way smaller than other Goody updo barrettes purchased on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> :  doesn&#x27;t really hold well, hair still slides down.  </li>
            <li> and when i dont put as much hair it seem to slide down my hairs.</li>
            <li> After losing the black one and having the brown one get a little stretched out (more than expected after years of wear!), I went to look for replacements and found they don&#x27;t sell them in stores anymore, so I stocked up online.</li>
            <li> These have been great gifts for friends, often I take my hair down and hand one over to someone frustrated with whatever they are currently using.</li>
            <li> I have a set of the large and small and could not imagine living without them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased both these 2 packs of smaller barrettes, and the larger size which comes singly.</li>
            <li> The Goody Ouchless Flex Small Updo Barrettes looked promising.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that I pull the front up and clip at the back crown of my head.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my pom really loves to chew these and he will even try to take them out of my hair, so I am constantly buying new packs.  </li>
            <li> The back one has to handle alot of hair because my hair is ong and when twisted, it strains most typical barrestts.  </li>
            <li> Slept with it in my hair last night and what a joy!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually very surprised when I started slipping it in my twisted hair that my first thought was &amp;</li>
            <li> I love theses little barrettes and they are so difficult to find locally.  </li>
            <li> I can wear an updo all day long without hairspray and it never falls out.  </li>
            <li> you have long or curly hair</li>
            <li> My hair stays in place and managed all day long.</li>
            <li> When I pull my hair back and put this clip in, it holds very loosely.  </li>
            <li> I have medium texture, long hair</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t hold much hair.</li>
            <li> They can&#x27;t hold extremely thick hair very well though and you have to get the amount of hair</li>
            <li> It works well to put half of my hair back or a low pony tail.</li>
            <li> When I do this using several small versions of this barrette, at the top and back of my head, it&#x27;s dramatic!</li>
            <li> The price on these little guys can get steep since they seem to be hard to find, but they are worth the couple dollars because you will save time and frustration and money over buying others that won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> There are tiny little soft &#x27;teeth&#x27; inside the barrette that at first glance look like they&#x27;d be useless</li>
            <li> I have long hair, down to the end of my back.  </li>
            <li> it never grabs that single strand of hair and just pulls, with</li>
            <li> I have even worn the large one on the back of my head to hold a twisted updo whist lying on my back for an hour and a half last extention appointment.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t hurt or stab me in the back of my head if I lay my head down.  </li>
            <li> That being said, if you have normal to thick hair, this would only work for a half updo for you.  </li>
            <li> The picture currently shows to black barrettes.</li>
            <li> These were bigger then what I expected and they are hard to open and close while I was playing with it.</li>
            <li> I found them a few years ago in my local Wal-Mart and again at Walgreens a few months later (I tend to lose them).  </li>
            <li> It seems that the part that holds two ends together is not strong enough for prolonged use.  </li>
            <li> They hold tight all day long, even withstanding naps, kids, and sports or swimming.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have thin hair and always have trouble finding barrettes that won&#x27;t slide through my hair.  </li>
            <li> These hold my hair in place with out pulling, breaking or slipping!  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave kinks in your hair like other barrettes or hair ties.</li>
            <li> It dosent pull or break my hair like ALL of the other designs I have tried.</li>
            <li> They do come in both a small (this one, in a pack of two), or a larger size.  </li>
            <li> My hair is average thickness, but I have a lot of it.</li>
            <li> It holds all of my hair though I think I&#x27;m at it&#x27;s limit, I have coarse, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> There is no problem if you lay down with one in you hair.  </li>
            <li> I can lay my head down and no poking or jabbing.  </li>
            <li> These barrettes are fantastic for anyone who likes barrettes but is sick of the type that tend to snag and pull hair.  </li>
            <li> The one good quality is that they don&#x27;t cut the hair, but if the main purpose is to hold the hair then they fail miserably.</li>
            <li> and i got the two pack with one black and one brown.</li>
            <li> And what was delivered was a black and a brow.</li>
            <li> Mine arrived both in black.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These barrettes work for me for both ponytails and half up styles.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting one brown and one black barrette within the packs</li>
            <li> and they both black instead</li>
            <li> I would like to find a place that can guarantee the brown and black barrettes though.</li>
            <li> These probably cost less than a dime to manufacture,  I feel ripped off because of the price.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy these as long as I can get my little paws on them!!</li>
            <li> It also lets my hair have a softer look because it is not pulling it tight like a rubber band does.</li>
            <li> The set of two small can have, in my experience, either two black or a black and dark brownish barrette.  </li>
            <li> I use the small ones to hold my bangs and side hair up and then use the larger ones to hold the back of my twisted updo.  </li>
            <li> I do this by pulling some hair through the hole creating a little pouf of hair.  </li>
            <li> These stayed in place for a little bit but then started to slip so</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t mind the plain brown plastic color underneath, I&#x27;ll probably just take off the rest of the paint to make it look less scratched-up.</li>
            <li> An everyday use barrette.  </li>
            <li> These have become my everyday hair tamer.</li>
            <li> Amazon is one of the few online stores I have found that stocks them.  </li>
            <li> They are a little small than I thought they were going to be</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and have a horrible time finding anything that will stay holding it in place.  </li>
            <li> I have heavy thick hair and hair bows hurt.</li>
            <li> I have thinner hair, just past shoulder length</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!</li>
            <li> They are the only barette I can wear that isn&#x27;t uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> And like I said, even with thin hair with a little product in it, it works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a thick hair and this clips are peefect.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and there is a lot of it.</li>
            <li> They hold my shoulder length thick hair all day without moving.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they&#x27;re so hard to find in stores!</li>
            <li> I have ALOT of thick hair!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy unless you have very thick or curly hair.</li>
            <li> I do not have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I use it for a low one at the base of my neck.  </li>
            <li> Which has proven difficult lately as I can no longer find them in any stores.</li>
            <li> they hold well, which can be a problem for me since i have thin hair.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t loosened or broken.</li>
            <li> Holds my thin hair well without breakage.</li>
            <li> The ad said these barrette&#x27;s would work well for thin hair.</li>
            <li> previous review:&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed with these barrettes.</li>
            <li> I butt length hair and finding a barrette that can hold it up with breaking it has been difficult.</li>
            <li> I needed a flexible barrette that could hold my twisted up hair style.</li>
            <li> #34;there is no way this clip will take in all this &amp;#34;glob&amp;#34; of twisted hair</li>
            <li> I, unfortunately, have neither.  </li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> I have 20 of them because I&#x27;m afraid they&#x27;ll be discontinued.</li>
            <li> so it is difficult to find a clip that will hold all of my hair and this one does the trick!</li>
            <li> They also do not &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; the hair causing painful &amp;#34;ouches&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> BUT I also hate, hate, hate hair on my neck while I sleep.  </li>

            <li> I have heavy thick hair and hair bows hurt. Not these. I love them. I have 20 of them because I&#x27;m afraid they&#x27;ll be discontinued.</li>
            <li> These barrettes are awesome! My daughter and I argue over who gets to use them, and they are really easy for her (at 5 years old) to put in her hair. They don&#x27;t pinch, pull, or snag hair. Awesome find.</li>
            <li> Pro:  ok, gentle, doesn&#x27;t pull hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:  doesn&#x27;t really hold well, hair still slides down.  I thought I would use very frequently, but instead I use Goody mini spin pins much more often as they hold hair securely even with fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> ...I was really looking forward to trying these since they&#x27;re made all of plastic with no hard metals, but they are so flimsy that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to use them at all. I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> These are great little barretts.  They are truly ouchless.  At first glance they look flimsy and you wonder how they will hold, but I have thick hair and they are wonderful and hold quite well. I use the small ones to hold my bangs and side hair up and then use the larger ones to hold the back of my twisted updo.  The back one has to handle alot of hair because my hair is ong and when twisted, it strains most typical barrestts.  I never feel a pinch or a tug and there are no horrible barrette headaches that you get at the end of a long day with other barrette. I can wear an updo all day long without hairspray and it never falls out.  There are tiny little soft &#x27;teeth&#x27; inside the barrette that at first glance look like they&#x27;d be useless but they really do hold the hair and I am so comfortable that I forget I have them in.  I have even worn the large one on the back of my head to hold a twisted updo whist lying on my back for an hour and a half last extention appointment.  I was totally comfortable.  I love the brown color because it blends with my hair nicely and my barrette is not competeing with my make-up or jewelry for attention.  The price on these little guys can get steep since they seem to be hard to find, but they are worth the couple dollars because you will save time and frustration and money over buying others that won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have thin hair and always have trouble finding barrettes that won&#x27;t slide through my hair.  These are it!  It holds up my hair in a pony tail without sliding through, doesn&#x27;t hurt or press against your head when lying on the back, and it doesn&#x27;t ruin your hair style when you remove the barrettes.      I wear them all the time around the house and is very happy I found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these little things. They are fantastic. You can lay on the with out messing up your hair. They are a little small than I thought they were going to be but they actually ended up being perfect!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair clip I have. I have a thick hair and this clips are peefect. So easy to put on and to take off. I will order more in future. Just hope that they were abit cheaper.</li>
            <li> These barrettes are fantastic for anyone who likes barrettes but is sick of the type that tend to snag and pull hair.  With this set you don&#x27;t have to worry about hair getting caught when you&#x27;re trying to take them out.  They hold well but aren&#x27;t a struggle to get out.</li>
            <li> i got these at my local walmart for less than amazon is charging(i paid $4.95) for em they are easy to put in and i got the two pack with one black and one brown. i like having just to pull it back and not fuss too much with it... i havent tried much with different hairstyles as i have only had it for about 12hrs but i would recommend it and i plan on giving these as a gift for a friend who is in nursing school as soon as i can get it...</li>
            <li> I have ALOT of thick hair! These hold my hair in place with out pulling, breaking or slipping!  Excited to have found them online.</li>
            <li> I had bought them in town, but I can no longer find them.  So, I went to Amazon, and of course there they were.  I really like the larger size as well, though that tends to slip through my hair, so this smaller size is great for a pony tail.  I use it for a low one at the base of my neck.  It holds all of my hair though I think I&#x27;m at it&#x27;s limit, I have coarse, thick hair.  I like that it never grabs that single strand of hair and just pulls, with it&#x27;s design it doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great since it&#x27;s all flexible plastic I can rest my head, or even sleep with it in and it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t hurt or stab me in the back of my head if I lay my head down.  A very nice featur for long car rides when you want to rest your head on the head rest and such.  Also, nice because it&#x27;s so easy to use, just grab your hair, hold this around the clumped hair and clip it.  Very nice to just pull up your hair for a short while because again per their design if you only use it for a short time, it doesn&#x27;t leave a kink in your hair like a normal hair tie would.  So, say you want to unload the dishwasher before your guests arrive, but don&#x27;t want your hair in your way.  Grab one of these, clip your hair back into a low pony tail and unload the dishwasher, when done, unclip and your hair will still look great with no kink where the clip was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing more as they are my go to clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you kindly,&lt;br /&gt;Leah</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these Updo Barrettes, and couldn&#x27;t find them any longer in the stores, so was so happy to find them on Amazon. My hair is quite thick, and these hold it up beautifully, and they&#x27;re so easy to use.</li>
            <li> smaller than i thought they would be.</li>
            <li> it holds my hair really well. easy to use!</li>
            <li> Very flexible and easy to use.  Do not slip in my hair.</li>
            <li> An everyday use barrette.  I love that I get to keep my hair and that the barrette does not!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave kinks in your hair like other barrettes or hair ties. That&#x27;s mainly why I use these. So when I&#x27;m out of work and take my hair down, it looks nice and not kinked.</li>
            <li> I love these. However I purchased this from Amazon. With product being delivered by Amazon. The picture currently shows to black barrettes. And what was delivered was a black and a brow.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, curly hair and I am so glad I bought these on a whim now. They are my daily clip now to manage my hair. They are so comfortable that I forget they are there sometimes. They stay in place without pulling on my hair. I will continue to buy these as long as I can get my little paws on them!! Which has proven difficult lately as I can no longer find them in any stores. Luckily, I have Amazon on my side :o)</li>
            <li> These work so great on my natural hair. I use the all the time to help keep my hair detangled. I really need to by some more. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the cooper one started peeling.</li>
            <li> These have become my everyday hair tamer. I butt length hair and finding a barrette that can hold it up with breaking it has been difficult. These barrettes are comfortable and cause far less damage than even the rubber coated metal ones. I have a set of the large and small and could not imagine living without them now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have long or curly hair I highly recommend giving these a try. If you hair is straight and very thin/fine these might not be the best choice for you.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for barrettes like these forever! I needed a flexible barrette that could hold my twisted up hair style. I put this barrette in and forget about it. It dosent pull or break my hair like ALL of the other designs I have tried. It holds my hair all day. I am buying several because everytime I find a great product it gets discontinued.</li>
            <li> I heard about this item through Youtubes Kimmaytube.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.  It is safe for holding my natural 4A/4B hair.  I will order more from this seller.</li>
            <li> As expected, they work very well for fine hair  : )</li>
            <li> Love these barrettes.  I don&#x27;t know why they&#x27;re so hard to find in stores!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find hair clips made for fine hair and that do not pull or damage hair. The Goody Ouchless Flex Small Updo Barrettes looked promising. Just as claimed, these barrettes do not pull or damage your hair or scalp. However, in my case, they tend to slide down my fine and straight hair. Keep in mind that it might not be the case for someone with thicker or wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Gentle on the hair and scalp... no metal parts&lt;br /&gt;- Very reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Tends to slip, but I think that depends on the individual&#x27;s hair type</li>
            <li> I love theses little barrettes and they are so difficult to find locally.  They make a demi&#x3D;twist in seconds and they are not uncomfortable at all.  My favorite hair fastener.</li>
            <li> This are great if your hair isn&#x27;t to thick or long. My hair is fine and past my shoulders. I use it to put my hair back but haven&#x27;t really figured out how to do an up-do yet. It works well to put half of my hair back or a low pony tail. Would work great for kids.</li>
            <li> These hold my fine hair and can hold a lot.</li>
            <li> I loved these barrettes for their ease of use and versatality.  But, just 2 weeks later, one of them broke beyond repair. It seems that the part that holds two ends together is not strong enough for prolonged use.  And, by the way, keep in mind that you are not guaranteed the colors pictured. Mine arrived both in black.</li>
            <li> Good product.  If you want to put the whole head of hair up, you will need the large updo barette.</li>
            <li> I adore these Barrettes! No hair caught and pulled when removing. They hold a good deal of hair or not so much. My hair is thick and there is a lot of it. These are easy to put in and easy to remove. Perfectly named - Ouchless! My hands are very damaged, so ease of use is important, and these are easier than hair bands. No pain or discomfort when I wear them to bed, no pinching or pulling so I forget I am wearing one. These have been great gifts for friends, often I take my hair down and hand one over to someone frustrated with whatever they are currently using.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these. I could not find them in any store and just happened to find them on here. They keep my hair up without pulling my hair. It also lets my hair have a softer look because it is not pulling it tight like a rubber band does.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these several times in stores and finally found them on Amazon. They hold my shoulder length thick hair all day without moving.</li>
            <li> I love these hair clips...... They dont hurt i can even sleep with these on ... Buy them every 6 months cos thts the only thing i put in my hair.</li>
            <li> LUV, LUV, LUV.  I USE THEM TO PULL THE TOP OF MY HAIR AND LEAVE THE BACK DOWN.  DON&#x27;T DAMAGE  OR PULL YOUR HAIR.  A WONDERFUL PRODUCT.  HAVE BOUGHT SEVERAL PACKAGES IN CASE THEY EVERY BREAK.</li>
            <li> These are really nice; took a few times before I got it to do what I needed but once I learned....gosh these are great!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love being able to twist my hair in the morning and slipping a claw clip in and head out the door.  That&#x27;s all well and fine..BUT I also hate, hate, hate hair on my neck while I sleep.  And anyone else who sleeps with a claw clip in their hair knows how incredibly uncomforatable that feels.  Hence, my search for more recent inovations to the hair clip industry which led me to this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need a little gel or spray in my hair to get this clip to work, but my hair is thinning due to medical problems (and that&#x27;s on top of the thinness I&#x27;ve had since chemo). With a little gel, this clip is AWESOME!!!  Slept with it in my hair last night and what a joy!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually very surprised when I started slipping it in my twisted hair that my first thought was &amp;#34;there is no way this clip will take in all this &amp;#34;glob&amp;#34; of twisted hair but I pressed on.  And let me tell you...it can take on a large amount of hair gathered in one place!  And hold it - and hold it some more - and more - and even through sleep.  Never thought it possible with this clip but it truly has won me over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is made of flexible plastic which allows it to be able to take in a large &amp;#34;glob&amp;#34; of hair with no problem.  It holds without the clip pressure against your skull that you get from a claw clip.  And it STAYS PUT where you put it all day and all night.  Such a simple little hair accessory but really effective and easy to use. And like I said, even with thin hair with a little product in it, it works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never seen this in any store so when I came across it on Amazon I was intrigued.  Read the wonderful reviews and took the plunge and placed my order and so glad I did!</li>
            <li> I bought these (and the large sized barrette too) on the recommendation of my daughter because metal barrettes break my hair so easily.  Out of the two sizes I purchased, I prefer these small ones better just because they are so versatile and really do hold quite a bit of hair... I have long hair that I pull the front up and clip at the back crown of my head.  It turns out perfect with these.&lt;br /&gt;I am middle aged and even though these barettes are good for children, they look great on a woman of my age too...&lt;br /&gt;Classic look, very pretty. (see my uploaded photo) .. No breakage that I have noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line... They are quite soft and pliable... hold well without any pinching or pulling or breaking. My hair stays in place and managed all day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased both these 2 packs of smaller barrettes, and the larger size which comes singly. My hair is medium thickness and these smaller ones are just barely big enough to hold all of my hair in a ponytail. The larger ones do work as well, but aren&#x27;t as secure and will slip out with much activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These barrettes work for me for both ponytails and half up styles. If my hair was any thicker these wouldn&#x27;t work for a ponytail though. These clips are so lightweight and comfortable, and I love that they&#x27;re flat. I can even sleep in these comfortably. These are truly the most non-damaging hair clips I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like these because the design makes them flimsy, and they fall out of your hair.  Don&#x27;t buy unless you have very thick or curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have used these before and they work great.  Over time, they do wear out and the rubber connecting piece breaks.  I do love them and cannot get them in Walgreens store anymore, but found them on Amazon.  Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Fine if you want all black, even though they said various colors.</li>
            <li> Just okay. I have thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t hold much hair.</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I expected with the exception that the color advertising was misleading.  I thought I was getting one brown and one black barrette within the packs and they both black instead</li>
            <li> I own both sizes of these barrettes and in both black and brown.  I am allergic to nickle so traditional barrettes can irritate my scalp. The plastic of these is gentle on my scalp and hair as they don&#x27;t cause breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to have a different style once in awhile. I do this by pulling some hair through the hole creating a little pouf of hair.  When I do this using several small versions of this barrette, at the top and back of my head, it&#x27;s dramatic!</li>
            <li> They work good but they&#x27;re hideous. You have to have curly hair to hide them. They look rediculous with straight hair.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot. They go with everything and are not childish or glitzy. They can&#x27;t hold extremely thick hair very well though and you have to get the amount of hair just right or it fights you to close. But they work well for my purpose and I would recommend them if you want something simple and good to your hair- this never snag or hurt my hair and help me prevent breakage because I use these rather than hair ties which is great since my hair is down my back and I am trying to grow it longer to donate it. :)</li>
            <li> These are great for my long, thick hair!</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE!!!  I found them a few years ago in my local Wal-Mart and again at Walgreens a few months later (I tend to lose them).  But then...all of a sudden...everyone stopped selling them.  I have no idea why, these are great.  The small ones are great for just pulling back a small amount on the crown of my head, and the large one perfectly holds all of my hair in a twist.  All with no poking or prodding, they don&#x27;t rip my hair and they don&#x27;t give me headaches.&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy to find them on Amazon, and then saw that they also come in different colors (I have only seen brown and black in the small ones and only black in the large).  I am hesitant to order the colors though as most of the ones offered say &amp;#34;colors may vary&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> These are VERY small....way smaller than other Goody updo barrettes purchased on Amazon.  This will only hold a portion of your hair, which really doesn&#x27;t work for the updos I had in mind.</li>
            <li> These little barrettes are great for little girls.  They don&#x27;t snag the hair and they are easy enough for them to use by themselves.  They are so comfortable, you can even sleep on them with no discomfort.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite barrettes/hair clips; almost the only ones I wear.  The barrettes grip well, but do not pull on the hair.  They also do not &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; the hair causing painful &amp;#34;ouches&amp;#34; like most other barrettes and hair clips do, because of the way they are designed -- no metal, no sharp edges, no tight joints in which anything can catch.  There are many ways one can wear ones hair with these clips -- the packaging provides some ideas, and experimenting generates more !  I usually use it to hold my hair back in something like a bun/updo twist combo, but there are many other ways to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These barrettes used to be easy to find in retail stores, but I have not been able to for several months.  Amazon is one of the few online stores I have found that stocks them.  They do come in both a small (this one, in a pack of two), or a larger size.  The set of two small can have, in my experience, either two black or a black and dark brownish barrette.  There are also bright and pastel colors available if one searches Amazon.</li>
            <li> My hair never falls out of these barrettes.  I tried the larger ones and soon after inserting it, all of my hair has fallen out of it.  I have straight hair.  I thought that the colors would be as pictured which is why I am only giving this product four stars.  I cannot find these in any stores anymore, so I think I will have to find some more.  I would like to find a place that can guarantee the brown and black barrettes though.</li>
            <li> These are great. They hold straight, super silky hair in place when it normally falls out of everything else. I would definitely recommend these and will probably order another set.</li>
            <li> i bought these on a whim, but am glad i got them. they hold well, which can be a problem for me since i have thin hair. they are not heavy, easy to use, look cute and are gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and have a horrible time finding anything that will stay holding it in place.  These stayed in place for a little bit but then started to slip so don&#x27;t work very well for me.  Someone with normal hair would probably not have any issues with them.</li>
            <li> They were inexpensive and mailed in a short amount of time</li>
            <li> These are the best barrettes ever.  They are light, flexible and very comfortable.  I have recommended them to several of my friends and they all rave about them.  The small size is ideal for medium length or thin long hair.  For very long or thick hair the larger size is better.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying more. I&#x27;ve had these for a long time and they are still good. Haven&#x27;t loosened or broken. They are still great at holding my hair without breaking it and looking much better than most other barrettes.</li>
            <li> They are easier on hair than regular hair clips.  Stay in hair easily.</li>
            <li> These are the closest things to the \\&quot;Swedish\\&quot; clips we had in the 80&#x27;s.  That are nowhere to be found, but were fantastic in concept.  They are painless, keep hair held perfectly all day and work flawlessly.    My big complaints - they cost a lot and they don&#x27;t come in cool colors.    They work great though.</li>
            <li> I wondered if the clip would have been able to hold all my hair &amp; it did!  Looks neat, simple &amp; pretty.</li>
            <li> These make for amazing half-ponytail holders! Also, they&#x27;re gentle with my hair - No breakage, and the hair doesn&#x27;t snag on the clip. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have had the larger one of these and loved it, until I misplaced it shortly afterward.  I still have no idea where it disappeared to.  I do like these also.  I have long hair, down to the end of my back.  They fit comfortably and flat to the head.  There is no problem if you lay down with one in you hair.  I love these.  I do recommend these to someone, rather than a pony tail holder.  There is no pulling of the hair with these.  They are amazing.</li>
            <li> This barrette does not hold very well.  When I pull my hair back and put this clip in, it holds very loosely.  Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> it does not hold my hair that well. if i put more hair it doesnt close up. and when i dont put as much hair it seem to slide down my hairs.</li>
            <li> I think these barretts would be fine for fine hair or on a child.  I have medium texture, long hair and they don&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great alternative to the scrunchy and looks nicer.  Holds well without pulling hair.</li>
            <li> Wish Goody made smaller ones.  Perfect barrettes that don&#x27;t pull your hair.</li>
            <li> If you have thick or curly hair, these will work perfectly for you.  I, unfortunately, have neither.  Thin, fine hair means no matter what I do, this still slides right out.  They do have the grippy things on them, but you need much more hair than I have to make it work.  Worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I feel in all fairness that I must edit my review. I have been using these barrettes and have become very happy with them. I wish they were a little smaller so that they do not need so much hair to hold them in place, but I have adjusted the amount I normally put up and they work well; they stay in place all day and never cut my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous review:&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed with these barrettes. I bought them thinking they were similar to barrettes I had purchased in the 80&#x27;s that are similar in shape but have a sliding back . These simply do not hold the hair in place. I am consantly having to put them back in. The one good quality is that they don&#x27;t cut the hair, but if the main purpose is to hold the hair then they fail miserably.</li>
            <li> I have finer hair, and found these are perfect for a quick ponytail, updo, or half-updo.  Brought them with me on a recent trip when I knew I probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to do my hair everyday, and one clip stayed in the entire day! I only had to adjust it twice. That being said, if you have normal to thick hair, this would only work for a half updo for you.  If you have finer hair, these are perfect! And they don&#x27;t weigh enough to pull on your hair like some heavier barrettes do.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those who react to metal on skin. They stay in place with comfort and ease. I am so thankful that Amazon carries these barrettes. After using two barrettes for years, I needed replacements. Surprised to discover bright new colors.</li>
            <li> These were bigger then what I expected and they are hard to open and close while I was playing with it. Can&#x27;t imagine what they would be like trying to style my hair with them. I threw them away.</li>
            <li> PERFECT all around !  Quality, ship time, price !!</li>
            <li> These clips are great.  I do not have very thick hair but I have a lot of it so it is difficult to find a clip that will hold all of my hair and this one does the trick!</li>
            <li> I really, really like these barrettes!  I have thinner hair, just past shoulder length and they hold my ponytail all day, comfortable.  Nice option to a hair tie.</li>
            <li> Great product. Holds my thin hair well without breakage.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair, work great!</li>
            <li> These hold my hair in place, and the best thing is they do not break my hair! They look good too.</li>
            <li> These barrettes hold my hair in place all day, they do not pull on my hair at all and they are very durable.  I just wish that they were more attractive!</li>
            <li> These are my favorite and I can no longer find them in stores. So glad I found them here! They hold my hair and are never damaging.</li>
            <li> LOL.  Love these barrettes with a passion</li>
            <li> I am not sure what I was expecting, something less flimsy for sure.  These are just plastic with a plastic hinge that looks like it would come apart easily with a few bendings.  These probably cost less than a dime to manufacture,  I feel ripped off because of the price. I tried them in my hair and they did work, but did not stay in well.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!</li>
            <li> Very good hair clip.  I have soft, fine, curly hair and my daughter has coarse, thick, curly hair, but we both can use these barrettes and achieve long-lasting and COMFORTABLE hair styles.  We can wear them all day with no pulling, plus you can lean back against them with no pain or lumpy sensations.</li>
            <li> The ad said these barrette&#x27;s would work well for thin hair. Wrong. For me, they slip right out. You must have thicker hair to use them.</li>
            <li> I have about 12 of these floating all around the house so I&#x27;ll always have one.  They are the only barette I can wear that isn&#x27;t uncomfortable.  I can lay my head down and no poking or jabbing.  I use one for sleeping when it&#x27;s hot to keep hair off my neck.  Unfortunately, my pom really loves to chew these and he will even try to take them out of my hair, so I am constantly buying new packs.  Luckily there are inexpensive!</li>
            <li> My mother has issues with most metals used in hair clips and these are 100% plastic and are absolutely perfect for her.  This add-on price was pretty great so I bought her five packs.  She loves them!</li>
            <li> Love these for my long thick hair. No pulling, easy to use.</li>
            <li> These feel a little flimsy on their own, but with hair in them they are quite secure. The brown ones I got have a metallic-colored coating painted on the front side which started to scratch off almost immediately. Since I don&#x27;t mind the plain brown plastic color underneath, I&#x27;ll probably just take off the rest of the paint to make it look less scratched-up.</li>
            <li> Love these, they work great</li>
            <li> Cannot live without these!  I wear them every night to sleep and most days too. They are incredibly comfortable and can make your hair look fancy instantly. They hold a lot more hair than they appear to,  so unless you have really thick hair, go for the smaller size.</li>
            <li> I have had these for several years and use them once a week or more. I absolutely love them and get comments on them all the time. After losing the black one and having the brown one get a little stretched out (more than expected after years of wear!), I went to look for replacements and found they don&#x27;t sell them in stores anymore, so I stocked up online. As a busy mom, I LOVE that I can have an updo in less than one minute. They hold tight all day long, even withstanding naps, kids, and sports or swimming. My hair is average thickness, but I have a lot of it. I have really only used the barrettes for updos where they are holding a lot of hair, so I can&#x27;t vouch for how well they stay in for smaller ponytails or half-ponytails. They work GREAT for my purposes and I just bought four more. For as many compliments and inquiries as I receive about these barrettes, I don&#x27;t know why they aren&#x27;t sold in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. I have medium length african-american hair, and this did not keep my hair up.</li>
