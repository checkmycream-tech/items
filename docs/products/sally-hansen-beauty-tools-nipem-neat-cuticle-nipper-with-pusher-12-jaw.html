            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li>The nippers are great if you like them to pull the skin rather than cut it.</li>
            <li>Happy wih my purchase.  </li>
            <li>The cuticle pusher is great.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a pair of good nippers</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s where anything good about this item ends.</li>
            <li>Works good but it gets stuck.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I am a person who reads MANY reviews before making a purchase, I thought I had made a good choice.</li>
            <li>My two favorite tools for manicures and pedicures.</li>
            <li>You will love the feel in your hands.</li>
            <li>SUPER AFFORDABLE and super great quality.</li>
            <li>Handle grip feels &amp;#34;stiff,&amp;#34; does not squeeze easily.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that both pieces are metal and can be easily cleaned with alcohol if I use them for someone else.</li>
            <li>Liked it so much, kept it for myself.  </li>
            <li>They were shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>The nippers started out nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>As good as more expensive options for cuticle maintenance.</li>
            <li>asked if there was anything she could do to satisfy me so that I could give her a positive review.</li>
            <li>Better than expected.  </li>
            <li>Besides for the fact that the roller mechanism really doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>I even noticed that the clippers actually had little flakes of skin on them and the pusher had some kind of substance on them!</li>
            <li>Despite what this advertisement says the seller is not sending this new!</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>Overall this works really well!</li>
            <li>They are OK tools, but too sharp that it feels like you taking off the layer of the nail when scraping cuticle down, and the spring in cuticle remover is coming off often.</li>
            <li>Major dissapointment</li>
            <li>Not even remotely &amp;#34;extra sharp.&amp;#34; These are more dull out of the package that the 2 year old nippers they were meant to replace.</li>
            <li>The nippers are very sharp, and are small enough to be very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The cuticle nippers are sharp and cut really well.</li>

            <li> Cuticle nipper is sticky and difficult to open/close. The roller mechanism that springs the device open catches and is making a gouge on the inside of the handle. The cuticle pusher has sharp edges and scratches the nail. Overall, a poor product.</li>
            <li> SUPER AFFORDABLE and super great quality. I am very pleased with this purchase! I use both of these tools all the time.</li>
            <li> If I could I would give this product AND the seller ZERO stars. The nippers are great if you like them to pull the skin rather than cut it. I contacted the seller about the issue and customer service was terrible! The woman who responded was rude, inconsiderate, and accused me of threatening her! All I simply stated was that I was not happy with my purchase, and asked if there was anything she could do to satisfy me so that I could give her a positive review. I am a person who reads MANY reviews before making a purchase, I thought I had made a good choice. If you are looking for a pair of good nippers I suggest you keep looking, and avoid this product AND the seller!!</li>
            <li> I was planning to give it away.  Liked it so much, kept it for myself.  Happy wih my purchase.  Will use and see.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little off... the point of the sessiors</li>
            <li> Better than expected.  Very Sharp</li>
            <li> The cuticle pusher is great. That&#x27;s where anything good about this item ends. The spring in the cuticle nipper pops out after about three squeezes and flies across the room, making the tool useless. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> The nippers started out nice and sharp. They ended up broken within weeks.</li>
            <li> My two favorite tools for manicures and pedicures. And I have a lot of tools. You will love the feel in your hands. High quality.</li>
            <li> Not even remotely &amp;#34;extra sharp.&amp;#34; These are more dull out of the package that the 2 year old nippers they were meant to replace. Even brief inspection reveals unevenly milled cutting surfaces between the 2 sides. Major dissapointment</li>
            <li> Handle grip feels &amp;#34;stiff,&amp;#34; does not squeeze easily.  This makes cutting / trimming especially awkward when a right-handed person is operating the tool with left hand.</li>
            <li> Overall this works really well! Besides for the fact that the roller mechanism really doesn&#x27;t work at all. Despite what this advertisement says the seller is not sending this new! When mine arrived I could tell it had been opened and someone had attempted to glue the packaging back together! I even noticed that the clippers actually had little flakes of skin on them and the pusher had some kind of substance on them! I didn&#x27;t want to deal with the hassle of returning and everything, so I just cleaned them thoroughly with rubbing alcohol and am still using it!</li>
            <li> Works good but it gets stuck. You have to open it up after you cut one thing. Hoping after awhile it won&#x27;t be so stiff.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set to add to my personal supplies of nail art. I am very pleased with it. The nippers are very sharp, and are small enough to be very easy to use. I like the fact that both pieces are metal and can be easily cleaned with alcohol if I use them for someone else. They were shipped quickly. Good product!</li>
            <li> They are OK tools, but too sharp that it feels like you taking off the layer of the nail when scraping cuticle down, and the spring in cuticle remover is coming off often.</li>
            <li> Was missing the pusher out of the package and product did not work well at all.i would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> The cuticle nippers are sharp and cut really well. The cuticle pushers also works well for cleaning up your nails while your polishing. great product and great price!</li>
            <li> Definitely a quality product. As good as more expensive options for cuticle maintenance.</li>
