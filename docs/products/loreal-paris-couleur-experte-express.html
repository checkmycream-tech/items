            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>Nothing else has ever lifted my natural color to a beautiful caramel shade like it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>YES, so easy even a husband can do it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li>Easy to peraonalize the lightness of the highlights.</li>
            <li>The highlighting part is easy to do, once you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell any difference in color - that seems fine.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, works great, CONSTANT compliments, On Amazon auto ship schedule every 2 months, never without !!!</li>
            <li>Color is so nice on my hair.i really like this gray color.</li>
            <li>This product promised to give me a medium brown look with light brown &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; highlights.</li>
            <li>My new favorite color!</li>
            <li>Takes a while to do (two steps) but looks great and lasts long.</li>
            <li>The coolness in this shade (5.1 Medium Ash Brown Truffle) counteracts this and my hair color turns out warm, but not harsh or brassy.</li>
            <li>Results were okay, though, but very time consuming.</li>
            <li>Would Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>I love the coloring,  deep brown with blondish highlights.  </li>
            <li>Start in the front and work towards the back, and make sure to pick up some pieces of hair underneath if you wear your hair up.  </li>
            <li>There is not an exact match for any of these kits, and that works too.  </li>
            <li>though, I still had a red tint in the light afyer dying, but it looked kinda cool.</li>
            <li>I understand other people may have had better luck than I did, judging from all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>This product works very well for my hairstyle and hair type.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>However, my use of this hair color was very</li>
            <li>I had so much hope for this product, but I guess I will be looking for another solution.</li>
            <li>Just like all the other things that you love they discontinue it and your just out of luck.</li>
            <li>Have never had any problems; have used this product for years, many different colors in the red shades.  </li>
            <li>This color does not get that orange brassiness that happens so easily with other colors.  </li>
            <li>I really wish I could go back to the old formulation for 6 months and see, but I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The highlights look natural.  </li>
            <li>You should disregard any reviews for the old formulation.</li>
            <li>The base color perfectly matches my natural hair color and covers grays well.</li>
            <li>Again, this is report of my personal experience, but those with dark brown hair need to be aware that this could happen.</li>
            <li>First my hair turned out VERY dark.</li>

            <li> My natural hair is dark brown</li>
            <li> natural hair color is dark brown</li>
            <li> Despite my efforts, when I finished the last blow dry, I was horrified to see that the &amp;#34;golden&amp;#34; highlights</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this on other women my age, and it does make them look younger, so I was hopeful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all and this one is by far the easiest one to use and is the only one that doesn&#x27;t turn my dark dark dark brown hair orange.</li>
            <li> One of my biggest peeves with all the hair dyes I tried was the fact that my hair, after a week or two, started to turn a brassy red from the dark brown, which I detest.  </li>
            <li> I paid close attention to detail, as in how to carefully apply the highlights and how long to keep the cream on the strands, etc.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe the highlights (next step) would tone it down.</li>
            <li> A few days later you may have to start worrying about dryness of your hair.</li>
            <li> When applying the highlights be very careful to not let it glob onto the root/scalp area.  </li>
            <li> and I have been using other L&#x27;Oreal dark brown hair dyes for the past several years.</li>
            <li> There is nothing worse that having your hair all one color, it does not look natural.</li>
            <li> But overall, I love my highlights and the base color this product gave me!</li>
            <li> The highlights turned orange and to make matters worse there wasn&#x27;t enough mix for my medium length hair.</li>
            <li> However one of the packages had a product (the color) that leaked and is dried up.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to use by yourself, especially on short hair.  </li>
            <li> Also if you have long or very thick hair you must use two boxes of base color for complete coverage.  </li>
            <li> Now it is getting so hard to find it.</li>
            <li> But over the last several months the quality of my hair has become absolutely horrible, and I don&#x27;t know what else I can blame.</li>
            <li> hair looks terrible, and I am not sure how long I need to wait to apply another hair color.</li>
            <li> Waste of money :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere in stores for it, but had been unable to find it.  </li>
            <li> Fades into a weird color.</li>
            <li> Too bad for them, cause we will buy at Amazon now till the cows come home.</li>
            <li> wife applies the base color, I (husband)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the coloring,  deep brown with blondish highlights.  Only I left it on for the shorter time duration (highlights) next time (purchased two when ordered)  I plan on leaving it on for the longest time duration.  Would Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> nice color but fade away a two weeks.</li>
            <li> I used 5.1 Truffle. My natural hair is dark brown but I wanted a hint of highlights without going too drastic on the change. I followed all the steps and applied the product as instructed. First my hair turned out VERY dark. I thought maybe the highlights (next step) would tone it down. NOT! The highlights turned orange and to make matters worse there wasn&#x27;t enough mix for my medium length hair. So I don&#x27;t know what they talk about that the mix is enough. Waste of money :(</li>
            <li> This product works very well for my hairstyle and hair type. I am very happy with it. The product was shipped and received promptly. I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> A few days later you may have to start worrying about dryness of your hair. I notice this a lot with at home highlights and dyes. Before you buy this, buy a deep conditioner or you can use it with the one that is provided with the product. But overall, I love my highlights and the base color this product gave me! If I would have known the amount of care I had to put into my hair afterwards...I would have never done this.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for being able to put dimension in your hair without going to the salon.  Medium Ash is a cooler color and works well if you spend anytime out in the sun.  This color does not get that orange brassiness that happens so easily with other colors.  When applying the highlights be very careful to not let it glob onto the root/scalp area.  This will make it look like you did it yourself.  You can achieve close to salon results with some time and patience during your application process. Start in the front and work towards the back, and make sure to pick up some pieces of hair underneath if you wear your hair up.  Also if you have long or very thick hair you must use two boxes of base color for complete coverage.  There is not an exact match for any of these kits, and that works too.  There is nothing worse that having your hair all one color, it does not look natural.</li>
            <li> I bought this color last week. Color is so nice on my hair.i really like this gray color. i truly recommended this color.</li>
            <li> Found the perfect color and I love it! Now it is getting so hard to find it. Just like all the other things that you love they discontinue it and your just out of luck.</li>
            <li> Love this for a at home hair color!! Very easy to use!! My new favorite color! Would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Great product - contains base color and highlights.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!!! Easy to use, works great, CONSTANT compliments, On Amazon auto ship schedule every 2 months, never without !!!&lt;br /&gt;The wife applies the base color, I (husband) do the highlights. YES, so easy even a husband can do it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Used to buy at Walmart, but they no longer carry. Too bad for them, cause we will buy at Amazon now till the cows come home.</li>
            <li> Easy to peraonalize the lightness of the highlights. Great seller, fast shippong as well. Loved it all!</li>
            <li> I get complements on my hair all the time..</li>
            <li> Best highlighting kit ever! I&#x27;ve tried them all and this one is by far the easiest one to use and is the only one that doesn&#x27;t turn my dark dark dark brown hair orange. I tried the Truffle 5.1 hoping to cover my grays and blend them with highlights. Nothing else has ever lifted my natural color to a beautiful caramel shade like it was supposed to. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Best hair color ever!  Takes a while to do (two steps) but looks great and lasts long.</li>
            <li> So happy to find this color on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere in stores for it, but had been unable to find it.  Love that the highlights come with the kid and have been using it for years.  Comes out perfect every time and much, much affordable for me than a salon.</li>
            <li> Great product and I love the color!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff..... I only buy my Loreal hair color online now because Amazon has colors that I can&#x27;t find in the stores.  I ALWAYS get lots of compliments on my hair color :)  The highlighting part is easy to do, once you get the hang of it.  Have never had any problems; have used this product for years, many different colors in the red shades.  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The base color perfectly matches my natural hair color and covers grays well. The highlights look natural.  My hair has a lot of warm undertones and tends to turn brassy. The coolness in this shade (5.1 Medium Ash Brown Truffle) counteracts this and my hair color turns out warm, but not harsh or brassy.</li>
            <li> I did my ombre with this. Comes with everything and color last awhile. If you have red hair or dyed red hair I would leave in longer than the time givin though, I still had a red tint in the light afyer dying, but it looked kinda cool.</li>
            <li> Fades into a weird color. But loved it for the first week!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE.  However one of the packages had a product (the color) that leaked and is dried up.  Did not even try to return</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife. She is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I dye my own hair and this product is great for giving me highlights I can do myself. I always get compliments on my hair -- highlights are perfect</li>
            <li> Difficult to use by yourself, especially on short hair.  Results were okay, though, but very time consuming.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Coverage was good.</li>
            <li> I have used Couleur Experte (5.1) for about 8 years now. It was always great. About 6 months ago or so the formulation changed. It used to take 30 minutes, now it takes 15 minutes. You should disregard any reviews for the old formulation. I can&#x27;t tell any difference in color - that seems fine. But over the last several months the quality of my hair has become absolutely horrible, and I don&#x27;t know what else I can blame. It&#x27;s never been like this, frizzy looking, curling out of control, dry-looking. It looks severely unconditioned, but I&#x27;m using the same conditioner I have always used, including the conditioner that comes in the box. Has anyone else noticed this? I really wish I could go back to the old formulation for 6 months and see, but I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This review is based on my experience today with this product. I understand other people may have had better luck than I did, judging from all the positive reviews. However, my use of this hair color was very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My natural hair color is dark brown and I have been using other L&#x27;Oreal dark brown hair dyes for the past several years. One of my biggest peeves with all the hair dyes I tried was the fact that my hair, after a week or two, started to turn a brassy red from the dark brown, which I detest.  This product promised to give me a medium brown look with light brown &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; highlights. I&#x27;ve seen this on other women my age, and it does make them look younger, so I was hopeful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I not only read the instructions thoroughly, but I also watched the video on how to apply the product on L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s web site. I meticulously went through all the steps today, which are relatively time-consuming. I paid close attention to detail, as in how to carefully apply the highlights and how long to keep the cream on the strands, etc. Despite my efforts, when I finished the last blow dry, I was horrified to see that the &amp;#34;golden&amp;#34; highlights I had hoped to achieved resulted in brassy red streaks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks terrible, and I am not sure how long I need to wait to apply another hair color. Again, this is report of my personal experience, but those with dark brown hair need to be aware that this could happen. I had so much hope for this product, but I guess I will be looking for another solution.</li>
