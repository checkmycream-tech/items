            <li>I tried that... loved it...</li>
            <li>They smell good of lemon.</li>

            <li>Conditioner isn&#x27;t as good as Lavender Mint though.</li>
            <li>: Good lather with the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair look and smell good.</li>

            <li>Good product</li>

            <li>Very good product although a bit pricey compared to the cheap brand shampoos...</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product; I am very glad I bought it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the happy lemon fragrance.</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a lovely lemon scent and works great.</li>
            <li>I love this brand and buying in bulk with the pumps is great.</li>
            <li>It had so many great reviews, so I decided to try.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I rally love this shampoo and conditioner!  </li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>Love the products!</li>
            <li>The bottles don&#x27;t break easily and the pump has always worked great</li>
            <li>He liked it so much that he went out and bought some---he says it is the best he&#x27;s ever used in 65 years.</li>
            <li>I really liked it</li>
            <li>Nice tingly.</li>
            <li>it looks so nice.</li>
            <li>its great... love the easy pump too...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The most amusing thing about this product is that, when my in-laws were visiting, my father-in-law assumed this was my husband&#x27;s shampoo and borrowed some.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser gave this duo to me for Christmas and wow am I impressed!  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair seem a bit thicker but the best feature is how soft it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I love this line of product from PM, it smells so nice</li>
            <li>no regret buying this duo shampoo and conditioner,smells great and fresh.</li>
            <li>The smell is good and refreshing, but I&#x27;m noticing more thinning in my lion mane (ok, ok, my thinning forest) after switching from nioxin System 2.</li>
            <li>GREAT product and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>These bottles are HUGE!  </li>
            <li>Love the shampoo and conditioner just did not like how it was shipped.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, my hair feels healthy and thicker again :)  </li>
            <li>Because they are for thickening my hair does have more volume when I use it</li>
            <li>When a replacement is needed I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li>I bought this on the advice of a hairdresser after my favorite Suave (Matrix knockoff)</li>
            <li>It is not unscented---it smells delightfully of tea tree, peppermint, lemon and sage---but the essential oils don&#x27;t bother me or my chemically-sensitive</li>
            <li>love ya...</li>
            <li>So I bought it and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Love the way it cleans, the scent</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t quite decided if I&#x27;m pleased with the shampoo</li>
            <li>Much better.</li>
            <li>Best part, I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Never even tried conditioner before this, and love how it makes my hair feels.</li>
            <li>I will buy more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner, the smell is glorious.</li>
            <li>I was happy to get this for a more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>After trying these products at a Mariott Courtyard, I fell in love with the quality.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is okay.</li>
            <li>my hair feels so much better after using it -, hairt is fuller-love</li>
            <li>Love the smell and make my hair feel fuller.</li>
            <li>The conditioner made it feel better.</li>
            <li>cheapest I have bought... love the smell of the shampoo</li>
            <li>love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo</li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Nioxin and this product is better.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the shampoo + conditioner for almost a month now, I can feel the difference in my hair, it feels smoother!, better than the Nioxin 2</li>
            <li>I love this smell.</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love Paul Mitchell products.</li>
            <li>Along with that, it will also remove any healthy hair you had to begin with.</li>
            <li>I lost more hair in one shower than I do in a week.</li>
            <li>Unless you know you love this stuff</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love Tea Tree products.</li>
            <li>this is the best pair for daily use ever.  </li>
            <li>Love the citrus aroma.</li>
            <li>Love both the conditioner and shampoo.  </li>
            <li>i can say that i&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that I am losing more hair too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am glad to use this product.  </li>
            <li>however I like this just slightly better.  </li>
            <li>so I think the stores online that sell these can do a better job with pricing to be competitive because when I buy them through my friend with her discounts, the product is still sold in guaranteed form even though it is not a hair shop itself.  </li>
            <li>Love the very CLEAN smell.</li>
            <li>It is more for oily hair where it would work best, I have to supplement a more moisturizing conditioner on my dry hair in between, but I love it</li>
            <li>My hair is now more volume and very soft, smelts great.</li>
            <li>My Mrs Hair again has Nice full body &amp; no greasy after effect with conditioner.</li>
            <li>I originally tried the Tea Tree Special which was great, made my hair feel squeaky clean, head tingle, and smelled like peppermint.  </li>
            <li>unhealthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the price!!</li>
            <li>Smells great and you get huge bottles for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Great for my fine long hair, keeps my hair looking good, thicker, and lustrous.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>Love the easy to use pump.</li>
            <li>and you know it&#x27;s getting your hair clean!</li>
            <li>I was a huge Paul Mitchell fan until my hair started to fall out more with their products.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before; however i have not been able to find the liter bottles available in store.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair clean, and healthy.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, lasts a long time, does a great job on my long fine hair.</li>
            <li>So I have fine frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>For men with oily baby fine hair</li>
            <li>Had such a nice smell and is one of my favorite shampoo and conditioners!</li>
            <li>Love the this products, it really work!!</li>
            <li>leave your hair so smooth and thicker</li>
            <li>Cannot find this locally and it&#x27;s here at a great price.</li>
            <li>but it depends on how important your hair is to you.</li>
            <li>LOVE the lemony fresh smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Just as my days are running out, so is the hair on my head, but hopefully I can find a cure or become comfortable with the idea of deforestation.</li>
            <li>The shampoo seems to do a great job of stripping out any extra grease or oil in your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>Christmas gift well received and securely packaged</li>
            <li>A good natural herbal.  </li>
            <li>The natural oils are good.</li>
            <li>thanks!!!</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s definitely worth asking the doc!</li>
            <li>but once I opened it I had to clean off the bottle and lost about 25% of the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice, but after time I do not notice that my hair is more &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; I infact notice the same amount of hair in my drain as before</li>
            <li>Works great for dry scalp</li>
            <li>The conditioner is very light and doesn&#x27;t feel very quenching.  </li>
            <li>Has less of a &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34; scent and more a pleasant scent that sticks with your hair throughout the majority  of the day and just smells clean.  </li>
            <li>it really works for my hair &amp; my hair feels better each time i use it.  </li>
            <li>But overall, this is a good product.</li>
            <li>and if you have fine hair it certainly gives you the volume You need!  </li>
            <li>Super product, super value</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to color my hair as often as the fullness keeps my gray from showing so quickly.</li>
            <li>I have to switch to another brand, or I will end up being bold.</li>
            <li>Not bad, and the price was right.</li>
            <li>I worried it would take alot of trial and error to find a new thickening shampoo and conditioner when I could not find my old favorite of many years anymore.</li>
            <li>I have waist length, very fine hair,  and am pretty sensitive to heavily-scented products---I loved Herbal Essences long hair product until they changed their packaging and tripled the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Great product, but one cap was missing a spring and leaked all over the package.</li>
            <li>Great value for the price,for a product you use everyday.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for quite a few years and have always been happy with both the shampoo and rinse.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this shampoo and conditioner so far.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>but I think it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a nice smelling shampoo, but people actually noticed.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Wish it didn&#x27;t cost quite so much--but it&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>so I think I got good value for the money spent.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo gives great body and extra thickness while the conditioner leaves your hair soft.</li>
            <li>I like the smell, I like that it works on my dandruff, and my hair is healthy feeling and soft.</li>
            <li>After using these products my hair is more manageable, soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I have very long hair, and I love the way my hair feels, and it&#x27;s even easy to brush after washing if I use the conditioner too.  </li>
            <li>It gives a clean and refreshing scent both the shampoo and especially the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found anything like it and highly recommend it to those with fine hair.</li>
            <li>more suitable for mens hair, not heavy enough for my course hair</li>
            <li>I was always on the hunt for a shampoo that would clean really well.</li>
            <li>I have ultra oily hair/scalp, and very fine blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>I do like it because my hair feel really soft and easy to comb.  </li>
            <li>got dent lucky not broken and said to myself</li>
            <li>It actually gives body and shine to my very fine, straight hair!</li>
            <li>Ever since the very first use of this product, and every day since, my hair is much lighter, fuller, and bouncier.</li>
            <li>Yes it is alot more costly than your basic store brand</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone interested in quality shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>but it does get pretty tangled.</li>
            <li>My hubby and I fell in love with the smell and can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff.</li>
            <li>Tried a sample of the shampoo/conditioner first and then decided I needed to find it.</li>
            <li>Such a refreshing feeling every time.</li>
            <li>Will ABSOLUTELY purchase again!</li>
            <li>One the first use</li>
            <li>I bought this set the first time at a salon.  </li>
            <li>not an over powering smell although I would love a longer lasting scent</li>
            <li>I will purchase this more in the future.</li>
            <li>Figuring this was a first time experience, I continued to use the products for two weeks.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t make this your first purchase.</li>
            <li>Hair is light and soft.</li>
            <li>so I was pleased to see the size of these big boys.</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair that weighs down easily, breaks at the drop of a hat, and damages even easier, this stuff is golden.</li>
            <li>This tea tree shampoo line is great and no more dandruff!</li>
            <li>I really like the smell straight from the bottle, but after a day your hair starts to smell like old cheap beer.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I started with a small bottle of this and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Good buy and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Product is great however the shampoo lid was not screwed down properly</li>
            <li>Shampoo: Certainly eliminates any build-up on your hair.</li>
            <li>I received two large bottles of the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Lemon Sage Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner....</li>
            <li>These are really large and don&#x27;t really produce the &amp;#34;chilling&amp;#34; effect of tea tree or peppermint shampoo.</li>
            <li>Bottles are huge, and will probably last me 6month-year.</li>
            <li>I do not think this shampoo/conditioner is real.</li>
            <li>Used for 2-3 weeks already, I can feel a difference in my hair, not by much though, but I think that is because I am expecting too much</li>
            <li>but when pay so much for ahampoo and conditioner the pumps should work.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t really made my hair feel thicker.</li>
            <li>Shipped very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks Paul...</li>
            <li>The reason, she says, it feels like your hair gets tangled after conditioning is because it uses a very lightweight one</li>
            <li>The price is so reasonable.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li>Came packaged very well.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li>Take excess and gently work up hair by squeezing.  </li>
            <li>I usually really like Paul Mitchell products but the one I did not care for..</li>
            <li>so it is a real bargain.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like to buy into the idea that one product can make a truly noticable difference in the way my hair looks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very close to the Bliss Lemon and Sage shampoo smell, for a much lower cost.</li>
            <li>really* see a difference.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen almost all of the reviews, a couple people say this is not the real thing.</li>
            <li>The seller is a real Salon.</li>
            <li>I get body wave perms for body and curl; otherwise I&#x27;d have stick straight flyaway hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>i received shipment fast, no problems with packaging.</li>
            <li>Works  very well for wife&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that I am not losing as much hair as I was.</li>
            <li>a mature white silver blonde woman, am noticing a lot less thinning  using this product compared to othe products I have used, Tea tree oil has so many healthy uses, cures many problems, it&#x27;s a natural choice for hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy</li>
            <li>I personally use sulfate free to keep my brunette color vibrant.</li>
            <li>wash your hair every other day (at the most.)  </li>
            <li>I noticed my hair stays nice and thick on top for a long time instead of getting stringy within the day, and I don&#x27;t have my mom asking me in horror when I visit,</li>
            <li>Great product, the company did a pretty sorry job in packing the bottles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and my hair feels thicker, mainly because it doesn&#x27;t fall out as much using this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair look thicker, not sure if it actually is thicker, but I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Smells nice but leaves hair with a straw like feeling and does little to moisturize it!</li>
            <li>I formerly used just P Mitchell Tea Tree Special shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
            <li>Do it before.&lt;br /&gt;-Gently work shampoo into the top of your head and squeeze the foam down</li>
            <li>I have very, very fine hair that always looks limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li>My bottles are only half full now, but I can&#x27;t take it any more.</li>
            <li>I love the product but the shipping was a mess.  </li>
            <li>I find the shampoo to be super easy on very thin light hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews and had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is much lighter weight and separates a lot better than with other types, this one definitely thickens the appearance of my hair more than any other product I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised it was very drying....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite surprised, but I have stopped losing as much hair since using this shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li>and she can get them for a much discounted price as a licensed professional</li>
            <li>A conditioner was something I don&#x27;t normally use but seeing it was a set</li>
            <li>I normally buy the tea tree stuff that makes the scalp tingle, but thought I would try this.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve been getting compliments left and right.</li>
            <li>I have not opened the new shampoo bottle yet</li>
            <li>When I saw the new Tee Tree line I wanted to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s me, maybe it&#x27;s the stress of trying something new, maybe it&#x27;s fate.</li>
            <li>The smell is subtle and nice.</li>
            <li>But after I dyed my hair it made my hair feel SUPER dry.</li>
            <li>it has a light formula &amp; doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, something that is important since my hair is both thin &amp; fine.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair very soft and untangled.</li>
            <li>It left my hair softer, fuller, and shinier with the first use.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>After 2-3 weeks of use, the most I have noticed is that rather than 5-6 strands lost per brush stroke, I&#x27;m down to about 3-5 per overall brushing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many shampoos/conditioners to find something that helps repair my fragile hair without weighing it down or making it frizzy</li>
            <li>Personally, i have thin hair and this product seemed to make it more boncy and full...</li>
            <li>However, I have to apply more conditioner at the roots of my hair because if I use less (the same number of pump as shampoo), I start to have a lot of split ends.</li>
            <li>The shampoo alone gives my hair body as well as keeping it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair is so light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>as a side note for the guys out there who lost hair way too early, like me---- go to your doctor and ask him about Propecia.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s consistency is about that of any over the counter conditioner you can buy and I have to use just as much as those low end conditioners.</li>
            <li>Rinsing the product is a complete nightmare.</li>
            <li>So far, I think it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo cleans very well while still managing to both rid the hair of oil and maintain its softness and the conditioner adds further softness and style-ability.  </li>
            <li>The products can never be &amp;#34;Guaranteed&amp;#34; because they are not from a professional store however it seems that it works well</li>
            <li>It gets oily fast, which means that the hair laying on top gets thin and stringy, and I start looking like I&#x27;m going bald.</li>
            <li>My current perm is 8 months old and after using this product my hair looks like I got a new perm!</li>
            <li>A quick brush and it calms down</li>
            <li>Even if it don&#x27;t I love the way it suds up with such a small amount.</li>
            <li>The minty sensation as described was definitely not felt and it was the main reason for me to purhase this item...</li>
            <li>I live in AK where the winter months can let your hair get pretty dark.</li>
            <li>the fragrance, and since one needs to use so little of the shampoo, it is quite economical.</li>
            <li>Threw away my old S&amp;C the same day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever, EVER purchased a hair care product that actually delivered near immediate results.</li>
            <li>You only need to use small amount of the shampoo and get your hair clean.</li>
            <li>It actually makes my thin hair feel more coarse and gives it volume.</li>
            <li>My mom gave me small bottles of this shampoo, tried it a few times and I love it.</li>
            <li>My hair did get thicker, but also became a dry, crisp, mess.</li>

            <li> I am very satisfied with this product; I am very glad I bought it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the happy lemon fragrance.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a lovely lemon scent and works great.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and buying in bulk with the pumps is great.</li>
            <li> It had so many great reviews, so I decided to try.</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I rally love this shampoo and conditioner!  </li>
            <li> Love this!  </li>
            <li> Love the products!</li>
            <li> The bottles don&#x27;t break easily and the pump has always worked great</li>
            <li> He liked it so much that he went out and bought some---he says it is the best he&#x27;s ever used in 65 years.</li>
            <li> I really liked it</li>
            <li> Nice tingly.</li>
            <li> it looks so nice.</li>
            <li> its great... love the easy pump too...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The most amusing thing about this product is that, when my in-laws were visiting, my father-in-law assumed this was my husband&#x27;s shampoo and borrowed some.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser gave this duo to me for Christmas and wow am I impressed!  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair seem a bit thicker but the best feature is how soft it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I love this line of product from PM, it smells so nice</li>
            <li> no regret buying this duo shampoo and conditioner,smells great and fresh.</li>
            <li> The smell is good and refreshing, but I&#x27;m noticing more thinning in my lion mane (ok, ok, my thinning forest) after switching from nioxin System 2.</li>
            <li> GREAT product and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> These bottles are HUGE!  </li>
            <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner just did not like how it was shipped.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, my hair feels healthy and thicker again :)  </li>
            <li> Because they are for thickening my hair does have more volume when I use it</li>
            <li> When a replacement is needed I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the advice of a hairdresser after my favorite Suave (Matrix knockoff)</li>
            <li> It is not unscented---it smells delightfully of tea tree, peppermint, lemon and sage---but the essential oils don&#x27;t bother me or my chemically-sensitive</li>
            <li> love ya...</li>
            <li> So I bought it and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Love the way it cleans, the scent</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t quite decided if I&#x27;m pleased with the shampoo</li>
            <li> Much better.</li>
            <li> Best part, I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Never even tried conditioner before this, and love how it makes my hair feels.</li>
            <li> I will buy more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner, the smell is glorious.</li>
            <li> I was happy to get this for a more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> After trying these products at a Mariott Courtyard, I fell in love with the quality.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is okay.</li>
            <li> my hair feels so much better after using it -, hairt is fuller-love</li>
            <li> Love the smell and make my hair feel fuller.</li>
            <li> The conditioner made it feel better.</li>
            <li> cheapest I have bought... love the smell of the shampoo</li>
            <li> love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo</li>
            <li> Glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin and this product is better.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo + conditioner for almost a month now, I can feel the difference in my hair, it feels smoother!, better than the Nioxin 2</li>
            <li> I love this smell.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love Paul Mitchell products.</li>
            <li> Along with that, it will also remove any healthy hair you had to begin with.</li>
            <li> I lost more hair in one shower than I do in a week.</li>
            <li> Unless you know you love this stuff</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love Tea Tree products.</li>
            <li> this is the best pair for daily use ever.  </li>
            <li> Love the citrus aroma.</li>
            <li> Love both the conditioner and shampoo.  </li>
            <li> i can say that i&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that I am losing more hair too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am glad to use this product.  </li>
            <li> however I like this just slightly better.  </li>
            <li> so I think the stores online that sell these can do a better job with pricing to be competitive because when I buy them through my friend with her discounts, the product is still sold in guaranteed form even though it is not a hair shop itself.  </li>
            <li> Love the very CLEAN smell.</li>
            <li> It is more for oily hair where it would work best, I have to supplement a more moisturizing conditioner on my dry hair in between, but I love it</li>
            <li> My hair is now more volume and very soft, smelts great.</li>
            <li> My Mrs Hair again has Nice full body &amp; no greasy after effect with conditioner.</li>
            <li> I originally tried the Tea Tree Special which was great, made my hair feel squeaky clean, head tingle, and smelled like peppermint.  </li>
            <li> unhealthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the price!!</li>
            <li> Smells great and you get huge bottles for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Great for my fine long hair, keeps my hair looking good, thicker, and lustrous.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Love the easy to use pump.</li>
            <li> and you know it&#x27;s getting your hair clean!</li>
            <li> I was a huge Paul Mitchell fan until my hair started to fall out more with their products.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before; however i have not been able to find the liter bottles available in store.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair clean, and healthy.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, lasts a long time, does a great job on my long fine hair.</li>
            <li> So I have fine frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> For men with oily baby fine hair</li>
            <li> Had such a nice smell and is one of my favorite shampoo and conditioners!</li>
            <li> Love the this products, it really work!!</li>
            <li> leave your hair so smooth and thicker</li>
            <li> Cannot find this locally and it&#x27;s here at a great price.</li>
            <li> but it depends on how important your hair is to you.</li>
            <li> LOVE the lemony fresh smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Just as my days are running out, so is the hair on my head, but hopefully I can find a cure or become comfortable with the idea of deforestation.</li>
            <li> The shampoo seems to do a great job of stripping out any extra grease or oil in your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift well received and securely packaged</li>
            <li> A good natural herbal.  </li>
            <li> The natural oils are good.</li>
            <li> thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s definitely worth asking the doc!</li>
            <li> but once I opened it I had to clean off the bottle and lost about 25% of the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice, but after time I do not notice that my hair is more &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; I infact notice the same amount of hair in my drain as before</li>
            <li> Works great for dry scalp</li>
            <li> The conditioner is very light and doesn&#x27;t feel very quenching.  </li>
            <li> Has less of a &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34; scent and more a pleasant scent that sticks with your hair throughout the majority  of the day and just smells clean.  </li>
            <li> it really works for my hair &amp; my hair feels better each time i use it.  </li>
            <li> But overall, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> and if you have fine hair it certainly gives you the volume You need!  </li>
            <li> Super product, super value</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to color my hair as often as the fullness keeps my gray from showing so quickly.</li>
            <li> I have to switch to another brand, or I will end up being bold.</li>
            <li> Not bad, and the price was right.</li>
            <li> I worried it would take alot of trial and error to find a new thickening shampoo and conditioner when I could not find my old favorite of many years anymore.</li>
            <li> I have waist length, very fine hair,  and am pretty sensitive to heavily-scented products---I loved Herbal Essences long hair product until they changed their packaging and tripled the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Great product, but one cap was missing a spring and leaked all over the package.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price,for a product you use everyday.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for quite a few years and have always been happy with both the shampoo and rinse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this shampoo and conditioner so far.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> but I think it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a nice smelling shampoo, but people actually noticed.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Wish it didn&#x27;t cost quite so much--but it&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> so I think I got good value for the money spent.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo gives great body and extra thickness while the conditioner leaves your hair soft.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, I like that it works on my dandruff, and my hair is healthy feeling and soft.</li>
            <li> After using these products my hair is more manageable, soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair, and I love the way my hair feels, and it&#x27;s even easy to brush after washing if I use the conditioner too.  </li>
            <li> It gives a clean and refreshing scent both the shampoo and especially the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found anything like it and highly recommend it to those with fine hair.</li>
            <li> more suitable for mens hair, not heavy enough for my course hair</li>
            <li> I was always on the hunt for a shampoo that would clean really well.</li>
            <li> I have ultra oily hair/scalp, and very fine blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> I do like it because my hair feel really soft and easy to comb.  </li>
            <li> got dent lucky not broken and said to myself</li>
            <li> It actually gives body and shine to my very fine, straight hair!</li>
            <li> Ever since the very first use of this product, and every day since, my hair is much lighter, fuller, and bouncier.</li>
            <li> Yes it is alot more costly than your basic store brand</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone interested in quality shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> but it does get pretty tangled.</li>
            <li> My hubby and I fell in love with the smell and can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Tried a sample of the shampoo/conditioner first and then decided I needed to find it.</li>
            <li> Such a refreshing feeling every time.</li>
            <li> Will ABSOLUTELY purchase again!</li>
            <li> One the first use</li>
            <li> I bought this set the first time at a salon.  </li>
            <li> not an over powering smell although I would love a longer lasting scent</li>
            <li> I will purchase this more in the future.</li>
            <li> Figuring this was a first time experience, I continued to use the products for two weeks.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t make this your first purchase.</li>
            <li> Hair is light and soft.</li>
            <li> so I was pleased to see the size of these big boys.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair that weighs down easily, breaks at the drop of a hat, and damages even easier, this stuff is golden.</li>
            <li> This tea tree shampoo line is great and no more dandruff!</li>
            <li> I really like the smell straight from the bottle, but after a day your hair starts to smell like old cheap beer.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I started with a small bottle of this and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Good buy and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Product is great however the shampoo lid was not screwed down properly</li>
            <li> Shampoo: Certainly eliminates any build-up on your hair.</li>
            <li> I received two large bottles of the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Lemon Sage Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner....</li>
            <li> These are really large and don&#x27;t really produce the &amp;#34;chilling&amp;#34; effect of tea tree or peppermint shampoo.</li>
            <li> Bottles are huge, and will probably last me 6month-year.</li>
            <li> I do not think this shampoo/conditioner is real.</li>
            <li> Used for 2-3 weeks already, I can feel a difference in my hair, not by much though, but I think that is because I am expecting too much</li>
            <li> but when pay so much for ahampoo and conditioner the pumps should work.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t really made my hair feel thicker.</li>
            <li> Shipped very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks Paul...</li>
            <li> The reason, she says, it feels like your hair gets tangled after conditioning is because it uses a very lightweight one</li>
            <li> The price is so reasonable.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> Came packaged very well.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li> Take excess and gently work up hair by squeezing.  </li>
            <li> I usually really like Paul Mitchell products but the one I did not care for..</li>
            <li> so it is a real bargain.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like to buy into the idea that one product can make a truly noticable difference in the way my hair looks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very close to the Bliss Lemon and Sage shampoo smell, for a much lower cost.</li>
            <li> really* see a difference.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen almost all of the reviews, a couple people say this is not the real thing.</li>
            <li> The seller is a real Salon.</li>
            <li> I get body wave perms for body and curl; otherwise I&#x27;d have stick straight flyaway hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> i received shipment fast, no problems with packaging.</li>
            <li> Works  very well for wife&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that I am not losing as much hair as I was.</li>
            <li> a mature white silver blonde woman, am noticing a lot less thinning  using this product compared to othe products I have used, Tea tree oil has so many healthy uses, cures many problems, it&#x27;s a natural choice for hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy</li>
            <li> I personally use sulfate free to keep my brunette color vibrant.</li>
            <li> wash your hair every other day (at the most.)  </li>
            <li> I noticed my hair stays nice and thick on top for a long time instead of getting stringy within the day, and I don&#x27;t have my mom asking me in horror when I visit,</li>
            <li> Great product, the company did a pretty sorry job in packing the bottles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and my hair feels thicker, mainly because it doesn&#x27;t fall out as much using this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair look thicker, not sure if it actually is thicker, but I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but leaves hair with a straw like feeling and does little to moisturize it!</li>
            <li> I formerly used just P Mitchell Tea Tree Special shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
            <li> Do it before.&lt;br /&gt;-Gently work shampoo into the top of your head and squeeze the foam down</li>
            <li> I have very, very fine hair that always looks limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li> My bottles are only half full now, but I can&#x27;t take it any more.</li>
            <li> I love the product but the shipping was a mess.  </li>
            <li> I find the shampoo to be super easy on very thin light hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews and had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is much lighter weight and separates a lot better than with other types, this one definitely thickens the appearance of my hair more than any other product I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised it was very drying....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite surprised, but I have stopped losing as much hair since using this shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li> and she can get them for a much discounted price as a licensed professional</li>
            <li> A conditioner was something I don&#x27;t normally use but seeing it was a set</li>
            <li> I normally buy the tea tree stuff that makes the scalp tingle, but thought I would try this.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve been getting compliments left and right.</li>
            <li> I have not opened the new shampoo bottle yet</li>
            <li> When I saw the new Tee Tree line I wanted to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me, maybe it&#x27;s the stress of trying something new, maybe it&#x27;s fate.</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle and nice.</li>
            <li> But after I dyed my hair it made my hair feel SUPER dry.</li>
            <li> it has a light formula &amp; doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, something that is important since my hair is both thin &amp; fine.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair very soft and untangled.</li>
            <li> It left my hair softer, fuller, and shinier with the first use.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> After 2-3 weeks of use, the most I have noticed is that rather than 5-6 strands lost per brush stroke, I&#x27;m down to about 3-5 per overall brushing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many shampoos/conditioners to find something that helps repair my fragile hair without weighing it down or making it frizzy</li>
            <li> Personally, i have thin hair and this product seemed to make it more boncy and full...</li>
            <li> However, I have to apply more conditioner at the roots of my hair because if I use less (the same number of pump as shampoo), I start to have a lot of split ends.</li>
            <li> The shampoo alone gives my hair body as well as keeping it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair is so light and fluffy.</li>
            <li> as a side note for the guys out there who lost hair way too early, like me---- go to your doctor and ask him about Propecia.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s consistency is about that of any over the counter conditioner you can buy and I have to use just as much as those low end conditioners.</li>
            <li> Rinsing the product is a complete nightmare.</li>
            <li> So far, I think it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo cleans very well while still managing to both rid the hair of oil and maintain its softness and the conditioner adds further softness and style-ability.  </li>
            <li> The products can never be &amp;#34;Guaranteed&amp;#34; because they are not from a professional store however it seems that it works well</li>
            <li> It gets oily fast, which means that the hair laying on top gets thin and stringy, and I start looking like I&#x27;m going bald.</li>
            <li> My current perm is 8 months old and after using this product my hair looks like I got a new perm!</li>
            <li> A quick brush and it calms down</li>
            <li> Even if it don&#x27;t I love the way it suds up with such a small amount.</li>
            <li> The minty sensation as described was definitely not felt and it was the main reason for me to purhase this item...</li>
            <li> I live in AK where the winter months can let your hair get pretty dark.</li>
            <li> the fragrance, and since one needs to use so little of the shampoo, it is quite economical.</li>
            <li> Threw away my old S&amp;C the same day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever, EVER purchased a hair care product that actually delivered near immediate results.</li>
            <li> You only need to use small amount of the shampoo and get your hair clean.</li>
            <li> It actually makes my thin hair feel more coarse and gives it volume.</li>
            <li> My mom gave me small bottles of this shampoo, tried it a few times and I love it.</li>
            <li> My hair did get thicker, but also became a dry, crisp, mess.</li>
            <li> My hair was like concrete -A tangled mess.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount because it lathers very well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it actually thickens my hair, though.</li>
            <li> #34;Guaranteed only when sold by a professional hairdresser, otherwise it may be counterfeit, black market, and or tempered with.&amp;#34; - which is probably the case here.</li>
            <li> Long story short: Don&#x27;t use John Frieda \\&quot;Breakage Prone Strengthening\\&quot; Shampoos or Conditioners.  </li>
            <li> , I just wish they were long enough to reach the bottom of the bottles.</li>
            <li> And also leaves my hair soft and lighter, and not weighed down.</li>
            <li> , this is going to last me a VERY long time.  </li>
            <li> So if you are a recovering alcoholic and you dont want people throwing you stink faces, avoid this particular brand.</li>
            <li> buy it, and save money in the long run.</li>
            <li> Now I just have to wait for the other hairs to grow back in.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t happen, my hair was still quite dry.</li>
            <li> but it leaves my hair tangly when dry.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair dry.</li>
            <li> my hair feels dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> well, I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair so dry &amp;</li>
            <li> Even while rinsing the conditioner, I could feel how dry my hair was from the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely recommend it to my other thin-haired friends!</li>
            <li> If you reduce the amount of washing, you will overall have less greasy hair because your oil glands wont be compensating for all the oil lost by the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gave the small bottle back to my mom and ordered the big ones.</li>
            <li> Shampoo made my scalp and hair very dry however.</li>
            <li> Very dry hair and itchy scalp-</li>
            <li> It also smells fantastic without being over powering or artificial.</li>
            <li> Expensive and dissappointed that I do not see or feel much of a difference, compared to a regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> It makes a real difference with my have thin, graying hair.  </li>
            <li> When i received this item i was unable to use it right away..</li>
            <li> This is the first thickening shampoo I have tried that actually thickens--and without making my hair feel dirty.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is giving my hair less dry feeling, but I do not feel like it is getting any thicker.</li>
            <li> Not sure it made my hair thicker but definitely made a difference in smoothness and shine.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re unsure about the cost, try the other shampoos or try the mini-sized version of this and see if you like it.</li>
            <li> other hair thickening advice tips:&lt;br /&gt;-Do not brush your hair when wet!</li>
            <li> Use a wide tooth comb and start and ends and work your way up.&lt;br /&gt;-Do not brush or comb your hair in the shower!</li>
            <li> When I received the box, one of the bottles was half way empty.</li>
            <li> but I will write a review later I would have given it at least four stars if my pumps for the shampoo bottle and the rinse bottle worked.</li>
            <li> This product is &amp;#34;the real thing&amp;#34; why would some sell this and make these bottles to put fake product inside.</li>
            <li> yet it seemed like the dandruff shampoos were making him loose his hair!!!</li>
            <li> so your hair isn&#x27;t weighed down and your follicles stay cleaner longer.</li>
            <li> That being said, it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered it on line immediately and it has not let me down.  </li>
            <li> DOES NOT WEIGH IT DOWN.</li>
            <li> Come down on price</li>
            <li> Others have claimed to see less hair loss, I haven&#x27;t noticed that at all.</li>
            <li> hair dresser used this product on my hair previously.</li>
            <li> Both bottles had leaked inside the box and made a mess.</li>
            <li> The conditioner does little to help unless you use half the bottle.</li>
            <li> it was pack tightly so the box did not arrive leaking</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin on top, thick on the bottom, which can end up looking horrible if not styled right.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not terribly excited about using it.</li>
            <li> I also take Natrol Biotin 10,000 mcg a day... just to help my hair to stay a little longer on my head...</li>
            <li> It has just been a few days since I started using this</li>
            <li> The conditioner is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It seems that less of my hair falls out during showers!</li>
            <li> and it helped tame her hair as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy taking the pump out to get to the shampoo</li>
            <li> I have alot of extrememly thin hair that is long</li>
            <li> I have thin and long hair, getting volume and thickening hair was my goal when I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> The only thing that&#x27;s annoying is the pump which is too short for the bottles.  </li>
            <li> Not a very pleasant experience with this product.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is also a little thin in consistency</li>
            <li> My girlfriend at the salon reccomended this to me when I complained about it and also mentioned it helped with dandruff.</li>
            <li> I also noticed if you have thick hair like I do, sometimes it can get poofie depending on the humidity</li>
            <li> This is one of the few shampoos that didn&#x27;t have any chemicals that are listed as the worse for your hair/body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: Product smells herbal.  </li>
            <li> Three of the pumps were broken.</li>
            <li> I have really thin, stringy hair.</li>
            <li> The pumps arrived broken and the shampoo had spilled inside the packaging.</li>
            <li> For those confused, this is a pack of two 1-liter (33.8 ounce) bottles.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair 100% worse than it was.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do, however the shampoo came with a broken dispenser head.</li>
            <li> a result, my hair looks much worse as it used to.</li>
            <li> not good!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing really wrong with this product, I have used Paul Mitchell shampoos for a while now, but I just don&#x27;t care for this one.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;WHAT&#x27;S WRONG WITH YOUR</li>
            <li> for this duo, I got it to try and rectify the situation--which is sadly thinner hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair, and when I use this product I notice the swelling in my strands!</li>
            <li> I am not easily impressed</li>
            <li> and it was just too expensive in salons, so</li>
            <li> Helps plump up those thin hair strands!  :0)</li>
            <li> It is hair falling out bad</li>
            <li> My hubby has bad dandruff</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed as I have never had this happen with any product from Amazon.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product, but one cap was missing a spring and leaked all over the package.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner just did not like how it was shipped.</li>
            <li> I do not think this shampoo/conditioner is real. The conditioner literally tangles my hair. I am extremely disappointed as I have never had this happen with any product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Husband loves now at the age with thinning hair, great smell!</li>
            <li> more suitable for mens hair, not heavy enough for my course hair</li>
            <li> it really works for my hair &amp; my hair feels better each time i use it.  it has a light formula &amp; doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, something that is important since my hair is both thin &amp; fine.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Not sure it made my hair thicker but definitely made a difference in smoothness and shine.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is great and does a nice job.  I&#x27;m was hoping for a good moisturizing conditioner for the AZ sun...didn&#x27;t happen, my hair was still quite dry.</li>
            <li> Used for 2-3 weeks already, I can feel a difference in my hair, not by much though, but I think that is because I am expecting too much so soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my hair feels healthy and thicker again :)  I am very satisfied with this product; I am very glad I bought it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is going to last me a VERY long time.  These bottles are HUGE!  Great for the price.</li>
            <li> The shampoo works great but the conditioner doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything. Because they are for thickening my hair does have more volume when I use it but it leaves my hair tangly when dry.  I have to brush it often. The shampoo alone gives my hair body as well as keeping it soft and manageable. I do take biotin for my hair health. The bottle says that it could be a counterfeit product if not purchased by a salon. Don&#x27;t know if that is an issue. I have not opened the new shampoo bottle yet so I don&#x27;t know if that works the same as the bottle I am currently using. I recommend the Paul Mitchell tea tree lemon sage shampoo for volumizing and smoothness. Keeps hair very soft and untangled.</li>
            <li> This product appears to be working</li>
            <li> leave your hair so smooth and thicker</li>
            <li> I rally love this shampoo and conditioner!  It smells so good and if you have fine hair it certainly gives you the volume You need!  It came earlier than I expedted!</li>
            <li> I bought four bottles. Three of the pumps were broken. Not that big of a deal, I know, but when pay so much for ahampoo and conditioner the pumps should work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this shampoo and conditioner so far. Worth the price! These are also quite big jugs of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Hopefully the shampoo will help thicken my hair. Even if it don&#x27;t I love the way it suds up with such a small amount. A conditioner was something I don&#x27;t normally use but seeing it was a set I figured I&#x27;d try this one.  I do like it because my hair feel really soft and easy to comb.  Even after using a dryer my hair does not get all frizz.  When a replacement is needed I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the advice of a hairdresser after my favorite Suave (Matrix knockoff) changed it&#x27;s formula.  I have waist length, very fine hair,  and am pretty sensitive to heavily-scented products---I loved Herbal Essences long hair product until they changed their packaging and tripled the fragrance.  Anyway, I started with a small bottle of this and loved it.  It is not unscented---it smells delightfully of tea tree, peppermint, lemon and sage---but the essential oils don&#x27;t bother me or my chemically-sensitive husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most amusing thing about this product is that, when my in-laws were visiting, my father-in-law assumed this was my husband&#x27;s shampoo and borrowed some.  He liked it so much that he went out and bought some---he says it is the best he&#x27;s ever used in 65 years.</li>
            <li> This item arrived with the shampoo pump not in the locked position which caused it to leak all over the place it was pack tightly so the box did not arrive leaking but once I opened it I had to clean off the bottle and lost about 25% of the shampoo.  I would never buy this product from this vendor again.  It was a total rip off and I should have just gone into the store.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell straight from the bottle, but after a day your hair starts to smell like old cheap beer.  So if you are a recovering alcoholic and you dont want people throwing you stink faces, avoid this particular brand.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t really made my hair feel thicker.</li>
            <li> Cannot find this locally and it&#x27;s here at a great price. Shipped very well. Very happy. Just placed my second order last week.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and the tea tree oil keeps the dandruff away! I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it actually thickens my hair, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with my hair for last couple of yrs &amp; have tried all kinds of product... my hairdresser told me about thicken up... I tried that... loved it... then thought Id expand my search &amp; look for shampoo... found this... its great... love the easy pump too... this is my 2nd time around with the product &amp; I see this as my \\&quot;only\\&quot; shampoo... well into the future...    Thanks Paul... love ya...</li>
            <li> I normally buy the tea tree stuff that makes the scalp tingle, but thought I would try this.  Not bad, and the price was right.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing really wrong with this product, I have used Paul Mitchell shampoos for a while now, but I just don&#x27;t care for this one.  I prefer the lavender shampoo but wanted to try something different.  Definitely won&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
            <li> I have really thin, stringy hair. My girlfriend at the salon reccomended this to me when I complained about it and also mentioned it helped with dandruff. So I bought it and absolutely love it. The reason, she says, it feels like your hair gets tangled after conditioning is because it uses a very lightweight one so your hair isn&#x27;t weighed down and your follicles stay cleaner longer. I simply bought a leave in conditioner to help with that. Also if your anything like me, you also appreciate that these products are not animal tested and anytime you buy the tea tree line, some money is donated to plant a tree.</li>
            <li> I like this product alot. Yes it is alot more costly than your basic store brand but it depends on how important your hair is to you. I can feel this stuff tingle and it makes my hair shiny. I recommend this to anyone interested in quality shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> I like both products, it does make my hair look thicker. However, I have to apply more conditioner at the roots of my hair because if I use less (the same number of pump as shampoo), I start to have a lot of split ends. But overall, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, lasts a long time, does a great job on my long fine hair. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problem hair. It&#x27;s thin on top, thick on the bottom, which can end up looking horrible if not styled right. It gets oily fast, which means that the hair laying on top gets thin and stringy, and I start looking like I&#x27;m going bald. I have tried tons of stuff that supposedly for volumizing, buuut they never quite worked as well as I wanted them to.   With that said, this set works GREAT! I noticed my hair stays nice and thick on top for a long time instead of getting stringy within the day, and I don&#x27;t have my mom asking me in horror when I visit, \\&quot;WHAT&#x27;S WRONG WITH YOUR HAIR?!\\&quot; anymore. The only problem I have with it that might not be an issue for others are the frizz and tangles I get after using it. A quick brush and it calms down but it does get pretty tangled. It smells great, too.   Worth the cost. For a shoulder length haired girl like myself, it should last 3-6++ months unless you glob the stuff on there. Are there cheaper alternatives? Yeah. I would also recommend Herbal Essences Featherweight Shampoo/Conditioner for oil-prone hair like mine, and Kirkland&#x27;s Shampoo/Conditioner is just as big as this and helped my hair a bit as well. For maximum volume, though, I would suggest this. I&#x27;ll definitely try to get another set. If you&#x27;re unsure about the cost, try the other shampoos or try the mini-sized version of this and see if you like it. I&#x27;ll definitely recommend it to my other thin-haired friends!</li>
            <li> I have used Paul Mitchell products off and on for many years and have been very happy. When I saw the new Tee Tree line I wanted to give it a shot.  I originally tried the Tea Tree Special which was great, made my hair feel squeaky clean, head tingle, and smelled like peppermint.  I also noticed if you have thick hair like I do, sometimes it can get poofie depending on the humidity, I noticed with this one that it actually helps that out a bit.  I had my mom try it too when I went to see her and it helped tame her hair as well. I couldn&#x27;t find the lemon sage at Great Clips or Hair Masters they were always out so we stayed at a Marriott in Portland for a convention and they had lemon sage as our room shampoo/conditioner.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to shower that night to try it out, I was not dissapointed.  My hubby and I fell in love with the smell and can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff. This is our go-to shampoo/conditioner and will continue to order the Lemon Sage scent.</li>
            <li> The pumps arrived broken and the shampoo had spilled inside the packaging.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Super product, super value</li>
            <li> Great product, the company did a pretty sorry job in packing the bottles.  When I received the box, one of the bottles was half way empty.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner are great. They smell good of lemon. Good for dandruff and hair gets volume well. The price is so reasonable. Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> I have ultra oily hair/scalp, and very fine blonde hair.  I was always on the hunt for a shampoo that would clean really well. Have I gone through the shampoo&#x27;s!   My hairdresser gave this duo to me for Christmas and wow am I impressed!  Love the way it cleans, the scent, it&#x27;s great.  Didn&#x27;t realize how pricey it was...but I think it is worth it.  -Julie</li>
            <li> Love it.  Came packaged very well.  Thank you so much.  Tried a sample of the shampoo/conditioner first and then decided I needed to find it.</li>
            <li> Great smell and seems to be a quality product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t quite decided if I&#x27;m pleased with the shampoo yet but I will write a review later I would have given it at least four stars if my pumps for the shampoo bottle and the rinse bottle worked. It&#x27;s not easy taking the pump out to get to the shampoo everytime I use it and you get to the cream rinse everytime I use it.</li>
            <li> Such a refreshing feeling every time. My hair is so light and fluffy.</li>
            <li> Product is great however the shampoo lid was not screwed down properly and it leaked all over the inside of the shipping package.</li>
            <li> Very good. Conditioner isn&#x27;t as good as Lavender Mint though.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Long story short: Don&#x27;t use John Frieda \\&quot;Breakage Prone Strengthening\\&quot; Shampoos or Conditioners.  It is hair falling out bad news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this duo, I got it to try and rectify the situation--which is sadly thinner hair.  After 2-3 weeks of use, the most I have noticed is that rather than 5-6 strands lost per brush stroke, I&#x27;m down to about 3-5 per overall brushing! Much better. Now I just have to wait for the other hairs to grow back in.  This is one of the few shampoos that didn&#x27;t have any chemicals that are listed as the worse for your hair/body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: Product smells herbal.  A good natural herbal.  If you want perfume scented, this isn&#x27;t it.  I find that the smell does not linger after it is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel: Good lather with the shampoo.  The conditioner is very light and doesn&#x27;t feel very quenching.  That being said, it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: This is probably the best deal I have found on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other hair thickening advice tips:&lt;br /&gt;-Do not brush your hair when wet! Use a wide tooth comb and start and ends and work your way up.&lt;br /&gt;-Do not brush or comb your hair in the shower! Do it before.&lt;br /&gt;-Gently work shampoo into the top of your head and squeeze the foam down (don&#x27;t pile on your head and/or rub.  It breaks hairs.)&lt;br /&gt;-Gently apply conditioner to the ends of your hair. Take excess and gently work up hair by squeezing.  (Again, Don&#x27;t pile and/or rub!)&lt;br /&gt;-Only wash your hair every other day (at the most.)  The natural oils are good. If you are sweaty, just rinse the sweat out.  If you reduce the amount of washing, you will overall have less greasy hair because your oil glands wont be compensating for all the oil lost by the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Thickening Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great product and does add some body to my thinning hair.  It works so well my husband began using it.</li>
            <li> I was surprised it was very drying....I usually really like Paul Mitchell products but the one I did not care for..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and my hair feels thicker, mainly because it doesn&#x27;t fall out as much using this shampoo and conditioner. It does make it feel coarser, so I use a Keratin or Morrocan oil product after washing.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but after time I do not notice that my hair is more &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; I infact notice the same amount of hair in my drain as before</li>
            <li> I love the product but the shipping was a mess.  Both bottles had leaked inside the box and made a mess.</li>
            <li> My wife says it does a great job of thickening and cleaning her hair, and it smells good. She would recommend it to anyone--family and friends.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair that weighs down easily, breaks at the drop of a hat, and damages even easier, this stuff is golden. I&#x27;ve tried so many shampoos/conditioners to find something that helps repair my fragile hair without weighing it down or making it frizzy (I have ringlets) and this is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. It is a bit on the spendy side for my taste, but you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get results. It also smells fantastic without being over powering or artificial. I&#x27;ve ever noticed it&#x27;s added some blond shine back to my hair. I live in AK where the winter months can let your hair get pretty dark. I figure it must be the lemon in it that lightens and shines.</li>
            <li> LOVE the lemony fresh smell of this shampoo. Will ABSOLUTELY purchase again!</li>
            <li> Very good. You only need to use small amount of the shampoo and get your hair clean.</li>
            <li> If you have dandruff and don&#x27;t want to use dandruff shampoo, this is the product line for you. My hubby has bad dandruff yet it seemed like the dandruff shampoos were making him loose his hair!!! This tea tree shampoo line is great and no more dandruff! He won&#x27;t use anything else now!!</li>
            <li> Love the this products, it really work!!</li>
            <li> Perhaps at the age of 22 this might be consider minimum preventive care,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but let tell you. This stuff works! I was expecting a nice smelling shampoo, but people actually noticed. Never in my life have people complimented my hair. But I&#x27;ve been getting compliments left and right. Best part, I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks. Bottles are huge, and will probably last me 6month-year. Never even tried conditioner before this, and love how it makes my hair feels. buy it, and save money in the long run.</li>
            <li> This is the first thickening shampoo I have tried that actually thickens--and without making my hair feel dirty. Totally worth the cost.</li>
            <li> So I have fine frizzy hair. One the first use I could tell a difference in thickness. The smell is subtle and nice. I will buy more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner, the smell is glorious. It is more for oily hair where it would work best, I have to supplement a more moisturizing conditioner on my dry hair in between, but I love it and you know it&#x27;s getting your hair clean!</li>
            <li> I bought this set the first time at a salon.  I really liked it but it was pricey.  I was happy to get this for a more reasonable price.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> After trying these products at a Mariott Courtyard, I fell in love with the quality.  I ordered it on line immediately and it has not let me down.  These products are used in beauty salons all over the country.  That should tell you what a great product this is.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo.  It makes a real difference with my have thin, graying hair.  Gives it shine and fullness,  Plus, the price for the combo pack was awesome.  Its a lot of $$ at once, but the bottles last a looooonnnggg time so it is a real bargain.</li>
            <li> I love the happy lemon fragrance. It left my hair softer, fuller, and shinier with the first use.  I hooked already!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. It makes my hair look and smell good.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has the smell and consistency of dish soap, and it dried out my hair too much. The conditioner is good, though.</li>
            <li> The smell is good and refreshing, but I&#x27;m noticing more thinning in my lion mane (ok, ok, my thinning forest) after switching from nioxin System 2. Maybe it&#x27;s me, maybe it&#x27;s the stress of trying something new, maybe it&#x27;s fate. Just as my days are running out, so is the hair on my head, but hopefully I can find a cure or become comfortable with the idea of deforestation.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is okay. I picked it up hoping to like the scent and get that tingly feeling from the shampoo which did not happen at all. The shampoo is also a little thin in consistency so I&#x27;m not terribly excited about using it.</li>
            <li> my hair feels so much better after using it -, hairt is fuller-love the pump works well.  Wish it didn&#x27;t cost quite so much--but it&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
            <li> GREAT product and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Best value for these I&#x27;ve seen. My husband and I both use this soaps and like that it actually gives your hair texture without adding a film.</li>
            <li> It has just been a few days since I started using this and my hair looks and feels fuller.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and make my hair feel fuller. But after I dyed my hair it made my hair feel SUPER dry. The conditioner made it feel better.</li>
            <li> cheapest I have bought... love the smell of the shampoo</li>
            <li> Great for my fine long hair, keeps my hair looking good, thicker, and lustrous.&lt;br /&gt;As a mature white silver blonde woman, am noticing a lot less thinning  using this product compared to othe products I have used, Tea tree oil has so many healthy uses, cures many problems, it&#x27;s a natural choice for hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the fragrance, and since one needs to use so little of the shampoo, it is quite economical.</li>
            <li> I just wasn&#x27;t impressed with this. It did not make my hair feel any softer or smoother then stuff I could get at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Lemon Sage Thickening Shampoo &amp; Conditioner is terrific! It actually gives body and shine to my very fine, straight hair! I&#x27;ve never found anything like it and highly recommend it to those with fine hair.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product. I was a huge Paul Mitchell fan until my hair started to fall out more with their products. I switched to Joico and haven&#x27;t had an issue since. I personally use sulfate free to keep my brunette color vibrant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite surprised, but I have stopped losing as much hair since using this shampoo &amp; conditioner. This is after having tried everything else for almost two years.</li>
            <li> love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Leaves hair dry. Nothing like the lavender one.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like to buy into the idea that one product can make a truly noticable difference in the way my hair looks but I might have to change that view after using this stuff. The shampoo seems to do a great job of stripping out any extra grease or oil in your hair and scalp. When followed up by the conditioner the results have been great. My hair is much lighter weight and separates a lot better than with other types, this one definitely thickens the appearance of my hair more than any other product I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as a side note for the guys out there who lost hair way too early, like me---- go to your doctor and ask him about Propecia. This has been a wonder drug and helped grow back my hair to over double what I had remaining. I try and pass that along to everyone who might be in need, it&#x27;s definitely worth asking the doc!</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a lovely lemon scent and works great. The conditioner is a waste of money. It&#x27;s consistency is about that of any over the counter conditioner you can buy and I have to use just as much as those low end conditioners. Others have claimed to see less hair loss, I haven&#x27;t noticed that at all.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo it leaves my hair soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> A gift for someone else</li>
            <li> Good buy and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Smells great and you get huge bottles for a reasonable price. I have very long hair but this will last me quite awhile. It makes my hair seem a bit thicker but the best feature is how soft it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. Love the very CLEAN smell. not an over powering smell although I would love a longer lasting scent</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product. It does not make my hair thicker...my hair feels dry and brittle. I would definitely not recommend it.</li>
            <li> The smell is great. You only need a small amount because it lathers very well. My hair is now more volume and very soft, smelts great. I will purchase this more in the future. The only problem is that it will get a bit tangles.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before; however i have not been able to find the liter bottles available in store.  This is a great product!</li>
            <li> When i received this item i was unable to use it right away.. However i used it yesterday and again today .. The minty sensation as described was definitely not felt and it was the main reason for me to purhase this item...&lt;br /&gt;My hair dresser used this product on my hair previously. With that in mind i did not hesitate to purchase the item but now i regret it since it does not seem to be the product as described .. &#x27;</li>
            <li> I had seen where this pair was voted #1 shampoo &amp; conditioner in 2013. Had to try it. Glad I did. Threw away my old S&amp;C the same day. Leaves hair clean, and healthy. Use some leave in conditioner afterwards for a great finish (Bumble &amp; Bumble).</li>
            <li> THIS SHAMPOO AND CONDITION WORKS BEST FOR MY HAIR AND SCALP. DOES NOT WEIGH IT DOWN. MY HAIR STAYS SHINY ALL DAY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin and this product is better.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference this made in the appearance of my hair.  I don&#x27;t have to color my hair as often as the fullness keeps my gray from showing so quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo + conditioner for almost a month now, I can feel the difference in my hair, it feels smoother!, better than the Nioxin 2 I used to use before. I also take Natrol Biotin 10,000 mcg a day... just to help my hair to stay a little longer on my head...</li>
            <li> I love this smell. It&#x27;s very close to the Bliss Lemon and Sage shampoo smell, for a much lower cost. I find the shampoo to be super easy on very thin light hair. The conditioner I can&#x27;t use every day.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has even migrated over to using my Tea Tree Lemon Sage products.  I have very long hair, and I love the way my hair feels, and it&#x27;s even easy to brush after washing if I use the conditioner too.  Highly recommended.  The only thing that&#x27;s annoying is the pump which is too short for the bottles.  I have resorted to putting the last inch or so of product into a separate container to use the end up.  The bottles don&#x27;t break easily and the pump has always worked great, I just wish they were long enough to reach the bottom of the bottles.</li>
            <li> For those confused, this is a pack of two 1-liter (33.8 ounce) bottles.  My wife has been using the Paul Mitchell products for over five years.  She LOVES them.  Amazon has the best prices.</li>
            <li> My daughter does hair and was buying for me at the store but she moved away so I found it on amazon as same price</li>
            <li> Great product, best shampoo and conditioner combo i have ever used on my hair. Personally, i have thin hair and this product seemed to make it more boncy and full... and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Product is great but it did not ship well. Opened during shipment.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to see some awesome results when I read thd reviews here ... well, I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair so dry &amp; unhealthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the price!!</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering the big pumps, and each time the product lasted about a year. It actually makes my thin hair feel more coarse and gives it volume.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo. Had such a nice smell and is one of my favorite shampoo and conditioners!</li>
            <li> Wow! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever, EVER purchased a hair care product that actually delivered near immediate results. I have very, very fine hair that always looks limp and lifeless. I&#x27;ve only used these products a total of three times, but I can already *really* see a difference. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this line of product from PM, it smells so nice and it feels tingly in the hair when you use it.  Nice tingly.</li>
            <li> Love Paul Mitchell products.Great value for the price,for a product you use everyday. Will definitely buy this duo again. Wonderful!</li>
            <li> My mom gave me small bottles of this shampoo, tried it a few times and I love it. Gave the small bottle back to my mom and ordered the big ones.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and had high hopes for this product. Shampoo: Certainly eliminates any build-up on your hair. Along with that, it will also remove any healthy hair you had to begin with. Rinsing the product is a complete nightmare. You can&#x27;t even run your fingers through your hair to get it out. My hair was like concrete -A tangled mess. I lost more hair in one shower than I do in a week. The conditioner does little to help unless you use half the bottle. Even while rinsing the conditioner, I could feel how dry my hair was from the shampoo. Figuring this was a first time experience, I continued to use the products for two weeks. My hair did get thicker, but also became a dry, crisp, mess. It felt like sandpaper. Add a blow dryer and you can imagine the ball of frizz I had to deal with. I&#x27;m unimpressed with this product. It made my hair 100% worse than it was. After a month of deep protein treatments, my hair has finally restored moisture and shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen almost all of the reviews, a couple people say this is not the real thing. I totally disagree. I have thin hair, and when I use this product I notice the swelling in my strands! This product is &amp;#34;the real thing&amp;#34; why would some sell this and make these bottles to put fake product inside. The seller is a real Salon. I&#x27;m impressed and I have done my research. The smaller bottle they sell at target is like $10.</li>
            <li> It seems that less of my hair falls out during showers! And also leaves my hair soft and lighter, and not weighed down.</li>
            <li> These are really large and don&#x27;t really produce the &amp;#34;chilling&amp;#34; effect of tea tree or peppermint shampoo. Unless you know you love this stuff I wouldn&#x27;t make this your first purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s smells so good and great for my hair&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I love Tea Tree products. They were delivered on time and I will order again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is giving my hair less dry feeling, but I do not feel like it is getting any thicker. I have been using it for almost 3 months. Expensive and dissappointed that I do not see or feel much of a difference, compared to a regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> For men with oily baby fine hair this is the best pair for daily use ever.  Love the citrus aroma.</li>
            <li> great stuff......I will never buy anything else ever.  Hair is light and soft. I dye my hair and now it feels great.</li>
            <li> I am not easily impressed but this is really a great thickening duo! I worried it would take alot of trial and error to find a new thickening shampoo and conditioner when I could not find my old favorite of many years anymore. Based on reviews I tried this. Ever since the very first use of this product, and every day since, my hair is much lighter, fuller, and bouncier. I have alot of extrememly thin hair that is long (mid-back). I get body wave perms for body and curl; otherwise I&#x27;d have stick straight flyaway hair. My current perm is 8 months old and after using this product my hair looks like I got a new perm! I don&#x27;t even want to tie it back it looks so nice. The &amp;#34;essential oil&amp;#34; smell is also wonderful but not girly. Very happy with this purchase. Will definitely buy again if results continue this way!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! Its size is biggggg. I like the smell. Anyway, I like it and maybe I&#x27; ll buy it again</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It does what it is supposed to do, however the shampoo came with a broken dispenser head. It still dispenses and works great so I would recommend it to any buyer.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for quite a few years and have always been happy with both the shampoo and rinse.</li>
            <li> Good product no regret buying this duo shampoo and conditioner,smells great and fresh. The only complain is the packaging I receive the bottle got dent lucky not broken and said to myself oh the most important is the conditioner inside the bottle!!!!</li>
            <li> Christmas gift well received and securely packaged</li>
            <li> Works great for dry scalp</li>
            <li> Will not use anything else! Evey thing I need in hair care along with the accompanying Hair and Scalp Treatment</li>
            <li> Lov&lt;br /&gt;Love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I received two large bottles of the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Lemon Sage Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner.... it&#x27;s going to last me awhile so I think I got good value for the money spent.  So far, I think it&#x27;s working.  I am using Aveda&#x27;s scalp spray in addition so it may be a combination of the two brands.  My hair look thicker, not sure if it actually is thicker, but I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but leaves hair with a straw like feeling and does little to moisturize it!</li>
            <li> The product met my expectations.  No issues with shipping.</li>
            <li> Truly is a thickening shampoo/conditioner that leaves hair feeling and smelling great.</li>
            <li> The product is great but the pumps were broke when I received them;(</li>
            <li> There is no tingling sensation like my salon bought Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo I have. The bottle actually states that it is &amp;#34;Guaranteed only when sold by a professional hairdresser, otherwise it may be counterfeit, black market, and or tempered with.&amp;#34; - which is probably the case here.</li>
            <li> Love both the conditioner and shampoo.  I go through 2 bottles of conditioner for every one of the shampoo so have to order the conditioner separate from time to time.  Love the easy to use pump.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and buying in bulk with the pumps is great. Helps not to over use product and last for months. This is a great deal and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> These products are reaaly perfect! it smells so good and after washing, my hair  shines  so bright like at the advertisement.&lt;br /&gt;So i can say that i&#x27;m satisfied. Thanks</li>
            <li> I have always been impressed by the Tea Tree collection by Paul Mitchell. The lemon sage has a great scent and does what it advertises. My hair feels thicker after one use.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for quite some time and it was just too expensive in salons, so I will continue to buy it here!</li>
            <li> Not a very pleasant experience with this product. I have thin and long hair, getting volume and thickening hair was my goal when I purchased this product. It had so many great reviews, so I decided to try. i received shipment fast, no problems with packaging. Shampoo made my scalp and hair very dry however. Very dry hair and itchy scalp- not good! I&#x27;ve noticed that I am losing more hair too.&lt;br /&gt;As a result, my hair looks much worse as it used to. My bottles are only half full now, but I can&#x27;t take it any more. I have to switch to another brand, or I will end up being bold.</li>
            <li> It gives a clean and refreshing scent both the shampoo and especially the conditioner.  The shampoo cleans very well while still managing to both rid the hair of oil and maintain its softness and the conditioner adds further softness and style-ability.  The products can never be &amp;#34;Guaranteed&amp;#34; because they are not from a professional store however it seems that it works well and I am glad to use this product.  I formerly used just P Mitchell Tea Tree Special shampoo &amp; conditioner however I like this just slightly better.  Has less of a &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34; scent and more a pleasant scent that sticks with your hair throughout the majority  of the day and just smells clean.  I can recommend this product, however it is still overpriced.  I have a friend who is a hair stylist and she can get them for a much discounted price as a licensed professional so I think the stores online that sell these can do a better job with pricing to be competitive because when I buy them through my friend with her discounts, the product is still sold in guaranteed form even though it is not a hair shop itself.  Come down on price and then you&#x27;ll get more stars!!! :).</li>
            <li> I was expecting the smaller bottles so I was pleased to see the size of these big boys. It&#x27;s a deal.  Dispenser works great too.</li>
            <li> The shampoo gives great body and extra thickness while the conditioner leaves your hair soft. Love the products!</li>
            <li> Ive been using the regular Tea Tree shampoo for about a year now and wanted to change it up. I like the smell, I like that it works on my dandruff, and my hair is healthy feeling and soft.</li>
            <li> Very good product although a bit pricey compared to the cheap brand shampoos...Works  very well for wife&#x27;s hair. Suggested by her local hair dresser .  Check prices and sizes here on Amazon for best deals...My Mrs Hair again has Nice full body &amp; no greasy after effect with conditioner. Helps plump up those thin hair strands!  :0) ... now if only I could find one to make my hair start re-growing! :0)</li>
            <li> The perfect shampoo. Not to strong just perfect!</li>
            <li> After using these products my hair is more manageable, soft and shiny.  I have also noticed that I am not losing as much hair as I was.</li>
