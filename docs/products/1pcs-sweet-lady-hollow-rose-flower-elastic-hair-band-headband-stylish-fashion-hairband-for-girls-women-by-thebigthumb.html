            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Frickin cute headband, easy to dress up or down!</li>
            <li>This is adorable and nice and cute, but quite tight, and that is saying something since I have a moderately small head, also it broke twice.</li>
            <li>The headband is beautiful but the quality is poor.</li>
            <li>The coils was so cheap that the multiple leafs broke as I first put it on</li>
            <li>Decent quality for the price!</li>
            <li>I really was looking forward to wearing it.</li>
            <li>Very durable and can be worn as a necklace if wanted.</li>
            <li>You cannot wear it like the picture, your hair will get tangled up in it fast.  </li>
            <li>Thanks you much</li>
            <li>If you really like this product.</li>
            <li>Such a nice head band to wear with plenty of hairstyles especially fr the spring &amp; summer.</li>
            <li>The price was right and so far it seems to be staying intact after a couple of wears.  </li>
            <li>Overall, cute to wear for short period of time.</li>
            <li>very fragile wouldn&#x27;t recommend for people that are always play with there hair but very pretty</li>
            <li>I love the way it fits tight</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I ordered it on March 25th and received it way sooner than expected on April 2nd :).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I only spent $2 on this headband.</li>
            <li>Came very early</li>
            <li>Broke on first try but put back together.</li>
            <li>Really cheap and not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>but now I have to be super careful when putting it on</li>
            <li>tight fit</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 13 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>it can be easily fixed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tarnished or unpainted (can&#x27;t really tell which) in several places.</li>
            <li>As soon as I tried to put it on my head it snapped apart into pieces and everytime I fixed it</li>
            <li>guess its not meant for ppl with natural hair.</li>
            <li>For it to be sold at such a very affordable price is such a score for anyone!!</li>
            <li>I think you should paint the back of the metal with clear nail polish so it won&#x27;t turn colors.</li>
            <li>Worth the few dollars.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, as described , only thing before slightly change colors before I got a chance to wear it</li>
            <li>But if its a little small on you it will leave marks on your forehead just as a warning and gets tangled in hair, But this is very very cute head band and can work with quite a few outfits.</li>

            <li> But if its a little small on you it will leave marks on your forehead just as a warning and gets tangled in hair, But this is very very cute head band and can work with quite a few outfits.</li>
            <li> It broke as the other reviews stated, but I fixed it by just tightening the closures.</li>
            <li> The little piece that holds the entire band together was not fully soldered closed, and the whole thing fell apart.</li>
            <li> but she said it hurt her head, and you have to work to adjust the leaves to lay flat or they make your hair stick up.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after 2 uses it broke, it was a cheap purchase though</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected since it was from over seas.</li>
            <li> This arrived from a third party seller with foreign packaging.</li>
            <li> It took a very long time to get to us, and the rings that hole the leaves and band together</li>
            <li> No buy the products that first time i used immediately was broken.</li>
            <li> cause it can come loose at the leaf</li>
            <li> Mine came loose during shipping.</li>
            <li> keep coming apart, so I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last.  </li>
            <li> It can be a bit tricky to get into your hair just where you want it, and the leaves can be a bit prickly--just be careful.  </li>
            <li> but you have to be careful when your putting it on your head</li>
            <li> such a waste.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see any other time we would use it.</li>
            <li> Only downside is it&#x27;s very heavy</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely not for thick hair.</li>
            <li> Way to tight for my average size head.</li>
            <li> it broke in half in between the leaves.</li>
            <li> I had this for less then 2 minutes out of the package.</li>
            <li> Ripped out half my hair &amp; broke..</li>
            <li> Not worth it!</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that the front is the metal material and it always gets stuck in my hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap looking and gets caught in your hair when you try to remove and is super painful and annoying.</li>
            <li> I regret purchasing it unless you like messy hair and poking your face.</li>
            <li> The slipping may not be a problem if you have textured or thick hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It was missing hooks and looks nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li> Small so it is tight.  </li>
            <li> It also seems really small - meant for little girls and not women.</li>
            <li> Little tight on my head, hard to keep hair strait without bumps, and took 3 weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s something super annoying about it:</li>
            <li> My hair is a little thin and fine-textured, so the headband does tend to slip every so often when I wear it.  </li>
            <li> Very tight and hard to get it off!</li>
            <li> Broken since the first day I got :(</li>
            <li> Holds my thick hair quite well.  </li>
            <li> Very small as well.</li>
            <li> easily broken.</li>
            <li> It was broken when I recieved it was broken</li>
            <li> but it came broken.</li>
            <li> Broken when I tried putting it on</li>
            <li> It was broken when I got it</li>
            <li> It was broken when I received it</li>
            <li> This idem was clearly broken before it was shipped.</li>
            <li> The product arrived broken.</li>
            <li> I am usually generous when rating an item, but this item was nothing but a disappointment.</li>
            <li> The leaves are pointy so its rather difficult to fix your hair then apply this headband</li>
            <li> and it was uncomfortable after an hour or so.  </li>
            <li> Sadly it broke almost immediately.</li>
            <li> so unfortunately I had to throw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Bad quality.&lt;br /&gt;It came broken.</li>
            <li> I am not too crazy about it , it got detached when I got it</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if I knew the quality was so bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed this broke immediately</li>
            <li> i was sadden :(</li>
            <li> Sooo disappointed</li>
            <li> Just hate when it gets stuck in my hair</li>
            <li> Instead shows a lot of pressure on your hair which is terrible!!!</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> very fragile wouldn&#x27;t recommend for people that are always play with there hair but very pretty</li>
            <li> Bought this and it doesn&#x27;t even fit</li>
            <li> I really liked it product when I ordered it but there&#x27;s something super annoying about it: all of those leaves get stuck to your hair and when you want to remove it it literally pull of your hair from root! Also the strap is very short so doesn&#x27;t look lose and nice at all. Instead shows a lot of pressure on your hair which is terrible!!!</li>
            <li> Do not buy. I was so excited to get this item and after I waited over a month for it I finally recieved and when I went to put it on it broke in half in between the leaves. Very soft cheap metal. I wish I could give it zero stars.</li>
            <li> easily broken. cute though and cheap. took almost a month to be shipped.</li>
            <li> nice but hurts my head when i wear it.</li>
            <li> pretty much broke after one use, cheap item, i would not suggest to anyone.</li>
            <li> this is really cute and seems very well made but I only wore it a couple times and then it broke</li>
            <li> literally fell apart as I took it out of the packaging</li>
            <li> beautifull!! adorable</li>
            <li> Loved this headband fit perfect</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even get the chance to wear it before it broke!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it! Snapped as soon as I put it on!</li>
            <li> It snapped the second I tried to stretch it to put on. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> fell apart the first time I used it</li>
            <li> Broke when I took it out, but was easily repairable.</li>
            <li> Bad quality.&lt;br /&gt;It came broken. I wont buy it again.</li>
            <li> It rip at the first use !!</li>
            <li> This is very pretty and feels more like jewelry for hair.</li>
            <li> It broke the same day I got it in the mail and wore it. I was upset that it broke.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. It&#x27;s cheap looking and gets caught in your hair when you try to remove and is super painful and annoying.</li>
            <li> Fits well and looks cute</li>
            <li> Horrible. Couldnt wear it because  it gets stuck in my hair and pokes me.</li>
            <li> It took a very long time to get to us, and the rings that hole the leaves and band together keep coming apart, so I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last.  It looks pretty when it is working, however.</li>
            <li> It broke immediately after opening the package.  Oh well, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this product, and couldn&#x27;t wait to have it shipped. Rip it open once received, and after putting it on the elastic ripped because it wasn&#x27;t even attached together correctly. I made use of it still by having to hot glue it. I guess that&#x27;s what I get for only paying a couple bucks for something.</li>
            <li> The leaves are pointy so its rather difficult to fix your hair then apply this headband I regret purchasing it unless you like messy hair and poking your face.</li>
            <li> Love the look of this headband!  So pretty!  I get lots of compliments when I wear it.  It can be a bit tricky to get into your hair just where you want it, and the leaves can be a bit prickly--just be careful.  My hair is a little thin and fine-textured, so the headband does tend to slip every so often when I wear it.  I just reposition it.  The slipping may not be a problem if you have textured or thick hair.</li>
            <li> Its a good product and i don&#x27;t think that it is fragile.But if its a little small on you it will leave marks on your forehead just as a warning and gets tangled in hair, But this is very very cute head band and can work with quite a few outfits.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will purchase this item again as it faded before I hadd the chance to wear it.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 13 yr old daughter. Super cute...shipping takes a while bc it comes from overseas. Worth the few dollars.</li>
            <li> Frickin cute headband, easy to dress up or down! Only downside is it&#x27;s very heavy and  hurts my forehead. A</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay item very pretty but you have to be careful when your putting it on your head cause it can come loose at the leaf and if you don&#x27;t know how to fix it...you&#x27;ll end up throwing it out..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed this broke immediately and it was so pretty I really was looking forward to wearing it. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if I knew the quality was so bad.</li>
            <li> No buy the products that first time i used immediately was broken.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly and pretty decent quality. I think you should paint the back of the metal with clear nail polish so it won&#x27;t turn colors.</li>
            <li> This is the headband design of the stars. For it to be sold at such a very affordable price is such a score for anyone!!</li>
            <li> Broke on first try but put back together. tight fit and i have a smaller head..</li>
            <li> Very good product. Well packaged. I would highly recommend this product. I will purchase this product again and except the same results. Very durable and can be worn as a necklace if wanted.</li>
            <li> It is really pretty and I always get compliments on it, but it can fall apart easy. I just used some pliers and cinched the two ends and haven&#x27;t had problems since. It was so inexpensive that it didn&#x27;t even matter that I had to cinch it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible. I had to saw off a chunk of my hair just to get it out.</li>
            <li> This headband is very cute.  Great elastic and holds well.  Downfall:  You cannot wear it like the picture, your hair will get tangled up in it fast.  I tried it more around the forehead and it was uncomfortable after an hour or so.  Left indention in the forehead.  Overall, cute to wear for short period of time.</li>
            <li> The headband came apart during the first day of use. I tried putting it back together but it kept falling apart again. Really cheap and not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful. it broke as soon as I took it out of the packaging bag.</li>
            <li> It was broken when I recieved it was broken</li>
            <li> Buuutt . . . it can be easily fixed.  It&#x27;s got good bones so it is ok. Thanks you much</li>
            <li> Broken since the first day I got :(</li>
            <li> Very nice piece. I wore it once but it&#x27;s already starting to look tarnished. But for the price it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Beautiful piece. Little tight on my head, hard to keep hair strait without bumps, and took 3 weeks to arrive. Otherwise, no complaints! Patience to look awesome is fine with me!</li>
            <li> This is a great headband and everyone else comments on it and loves it too!  The price was right and so far it seems to be staying intact after a couple of wears.  I wished it came in silver too, but haven&#x27;t seen it yet.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, as described , only thing before slightly change colors before I got a chance to wear it</li>
            <li> The headband is beautiful but the quality is poor. The elastic strap broke while trying to put it on the first time.</li>
            <li> Small so it is tight.  You can&#x27;t have the leaves on ur skin as it will leave colored marks</li>
            <li> good quality I like the item a lot it is in perfect likeness to the picture also, its a good buy.</li>
            <li> Very tight and hard to get it off!</li>
            <li> I had this for less then 2 minutes out of the package. Went to put it on and it literally disintegrated in my hand before I could even fit it on my head! Wow!</li>
            <li> It broke as the other reviews stated, but I fixed it by just tightening the closures. It came earlier than expected since it was from over seas. I love the way it fits tight I know if I wear it a lot it will loosen up.</li>
            <li> Omg love  love.........</li>
            <li> This arrived from a third party seller with foreign packaging. The little piece that holds the entire band together was not fully soldered closed, and the whole thing fell apart. I would need to replace that piece in order to use this. It also seems really small - meant for little girls and not women. Definitely not for thick hair.</li>
            <li> Was cute, but fell apart when put in my Purse, and got caught in my hair very easily.</li>
            <li> Very Cute! Decent quality for the price! Very stylish!</li>
            <li> Stuck in the 70&#x27;s, maybe. But, this stylish band makes me feel like the inner me, love it. Good price, stylish, fits good and looks good too.</li>
            <li> I am not too crazy about it , it got detached when I got it so I had to fix it then I never wore it , I tried it but I think I need more hair</li>
            <li> Mine came out great(: I love this headband.</li>
            <li> Pop the minute I put it over my hair!!waste of money</li>
            <li> Like several others I ordered at the same time, it broke immediately. I suppose I will use bobby pins and wrap buns with the olive leaves to hold them in place. Cheap cheap cheap</li>
            <li> Sadly it broke almost immediately. Very small as well.</li>
            <li> The headband broke as i went to put it on my head. After fixing it, i put it on my head, it squeezed my head to the point that i got a headache, and the leaves got stuck in my hair. Do not.</li>
            <li> Broke the second i got it</li>
            <li> Looks just like thhe picture, but it does take a while to ship.</li>
            <li> Went to wear it for the first time and it broke... Not worth it!</li>
            <li> Broke as soon as I took it out of the package 😞</li>
            <li> Put it in, had to take it out.. Ripped out half my hair &amp; broke..</li>
            <li> This is adorable and nice and cute, but quite tight, and that is saying something since I have a moderately small head, also it broke twice.</li>
            <li> This headband is adorable. The only complaint is that the front is the metal material and it always gets stuck in my hair!</li>
            <li> its so pretty but it came broken. didnt even get to wear it. such a waste. i was sadden :(</li>
            <li> Broken when I tried putting it on</li>
            <li> It was broken when I got it and there was no return information!</li>
            <li> Super cheaply made.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Came very early but I&#x27;m honestly scared to wear it.. It feels so fragile im scared it&#x27;ll snap the second I put it on!</li>
            <li> Nice head piece got plenty of compliments</li>
            <li> I am 100% satisfied with this product it fit me perfectly and to my astonishment I ordered it on March 25th and received it way sooner than expected on April 2nd :). Such a nice head band to wear with plenty of hairstyles especially fr the spring &amp; summer.</li>
            <li> Cute and good quality but it gets stuck in your hair</li>
            <li> I got this fast and its gorgeous !</li>
            <li> broke the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li> I am usually generous when rating an item, but this item was nothing but a disappointment. It broke within the first 10 minutes I received it, so I was not able to wear it even once. I would advice against this purchase.</li>
            <li> Very Pretty.  Holds my thick hair quite well.  Make sure you squeeze the clamps at end of elastic before putting on your head.  Mine came loose during shipping. I used a pair of pliers.  I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Cute head piece but it BROKE!!!!</li>
            <li> If you really like this product. handle it with care.  The leaf came off after first use and pulled out a bunch of hair strands from my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I only spent $2 on this headband. It was broken when I received it but I was able to mend it with a spare jewelry hoop I had. It&#x27;s tarnished or unpainted (can&#x27;t really tell which) in several places.</li>
            <li> It breaks easily, but besides that it is cute.</li>
            <li> This idem was clearly broken before it was shipped. It was missing hooks and looks nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li> This review is for the Olive Leaf headband - I purchased this for my daughter to wear with a toga in a school play. It was nicely constructed, and the leaves are made of some kind of metal. It looked very cute with her costume, so it served it&#x27;s purpose - but she said it hurt her head, and you have to work to adjust the leaves to lay flat or they make your hair stick up. She wore it over the forehead, so it&#x27;s good for a costume but I don&#x27;t see any other time we would use it.</li>
            <li> Love it. Just hate when it gets stuck in my hair</li>
            <li> The product arrived broken.</li>
            <li> Looked very pretty when you wear it; however, the handband automatically snapped as I first tried it on. The coils was so cheap that the multiple leafs broke as I first put it on so unfortunately I had to throw it in the trash. Very beautiful when you put it on though.</li>
            <li> Ut is very cheaply made. As soon as I tried to put it on my head it snapped apart into pieces and everytime I fixed it another piece would break.. I can&#x27;t wear it.. Sooo disappointed</li>
            <li> Way to tight for my average size head.</li>
            <li> The head band broke the first time I tried to put it on.</li>
            <li> Broke the same day I got it in the mail! So upset because I wanted to flaunt it but nope couldn&#x27;t even flaunt it in the mirror.</li>
            <li> I loved my headband when it arrived. Unfortunately after 2 uses it broke, it was a cheap purchase though so I wasn&#x27;t too upset.</li>
            <li> my wife looks so cute every time she wears them...meeeeeeeeeeeow!  ;)</li>
            <li> guess its not meant for ppl with natural hair. very pretty but it gets stuck in my hair and pulls...not my favorite thing to wear</li>
            <li> Really cute, took awhile to ship though</li>
            <li> Love the way it looks!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful but one of the connectors broke the minute I put it on. I was able to fix it but now I have to be super careful when putting it on but that&#x27;s ok. Gets 4 stars because I love the style. Would get 5 if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that it broke.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  I received compliments.</li>
