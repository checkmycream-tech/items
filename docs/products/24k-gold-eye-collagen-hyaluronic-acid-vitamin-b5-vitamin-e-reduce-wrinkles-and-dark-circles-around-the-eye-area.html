            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>It was amazing that the effect was still working even after the product had not been applied for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I set aside 30 minutes with some nice, meditative music.  </li>
            <li>Hyaluronic serum is actually an excellent antioxidant, and when your serum is capable of reaching the deepest layers of your skin, it can be incredibly effective at reversing damage to your cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put these eye masks in the refrigerator before I put them on my eyes so that they would have a nice cooling effect and to help with the swelling/bags under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>When I wake up, I noticed my skin have become nice and refresh.</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s ONE time, sign me up for many more!</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews (close to practically all) were from people who received a complementary set, in exchange for their honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>But these babies are PURE GOLD!!!!</li>
            <li>OK, the rose water or whatever they&#x27;re packed in smells nice, and they feel OK on your eyes, but so does a cheap ice mask, which gives better temporary results...not to mention,</li>
            <li>so pleased with these.  </li>
            <li>I would buy these again for sure.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering over and over again. :-)</li>
            <li>My bags are way better</li>
            <li>This product is making my eye area feel and look a lot better, so I do notice improvement.</li>
            <li>I love that they extend out from the eye</li>
            <li>Im glad I had the time to do so.  </li>
            <li>When I removed the eye mask I was really pleased.  </li>
            <li>What amazed me most was this though</li>
            <li>Im glad it came with 10 pairs</li>
            <li>What amazed me most was this though</li>
            <li>Im glad it came with 10 pairs</li>
            <li>and I think that the more often they are used the more</li>
            <li>After a couple more days passed we decided to go out for a date night.</li>
            <li>and she was now able to apply the make up</li>
            <li>I loved it so much.  </li>
            <li>Feels cool and soothing!</li>
            <li>easy to use and in convenient packaging.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I liked it very much.</li>
            <li>The 24K Gold Eye Collagen Hyaluronic Acid masks are pure heaven!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more, because it simply Works amazingly!</li>
            <li>So I wake up with huge bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how fabulous this was.  </li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how fabulous this was.  </li>
            <li>Considering it was such a great price</li>
            <li>When it got here, which didnâ€™t take long at all, the package was in great condition.</li>
            <li>What fun eye masks!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super cooling and feel nice on your face and plump up the eye area, particularly after looking at a computer all day.</li>
            <li>They do leave a cool sensation on the skin &amp; helped me to relax.</li>
            <li>Apparently Gold not only gives a beautiful, glowing and youthful skin but is also beneficial in many ways.</li>
            <li>Good item but prefer the Luxurious 24k Gold Bio-collagen Facial Mask.</li>
            <li>Also, because I was keeping my eyes closed, I was able to have the mask on the lid where I have some aging skin that doesnt play nicely when I put my eye shadow on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been to many spa&#x27;s, tried many different types of products and chemicals that do not work at all.</li>
            <li>my skin felt so refreshed and smooth after first use</li>
            <li>This product worked great for my dark circles and puffy eyes.</li>
            <li>Bright yellow gold and very very slippery.  </li>
            <li>The fine lines were either gone so really reduced so that I had to look close to find them.  </li>
            <li>The fine lines were either gone so really reduced so that I had to look close to find them.  </li>
            <li>I received this complimentary to test &amp; review.</li>
            <li>AT A DISCOUNT FOR TESTING AND REVIEW, I honestly tell you that I have used this, my experience is above and if you dont like yours, contact me.  </li>
            <li>AT A DISCOUNT FOR TESTING AND REVIEW, I honestly tell you that I have used this, my experience is above and if you dont like yours, contact me.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely effective in helping to produce healthier, younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>but overall I really liked this product.  </li>
            <li>I felt fresh and gained confidence after using it.</li>
            <li>I figured it would be worth it</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I will be the first to admit I have no idea</li>
            <li>so I made sure to open them up over the sink.  </li>
            <li>so you are not blind when wearing these.  </li>
            <li>Works like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many products similar to this one to reduce my wrinkles on my eyes.</li>
            <li>After my first use I started nothing a difference.</li>
            <li>After the first day of use my wife said that she was already noticing a difference.</li>
            <li>and I am one-hundred percent positive that you will too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mask is cool but soft.  </li>
            <li>The eye masks were pure gold.  </li>
            <li>So now that I knew what I was putting on my eyes, I was ready to try this out.  </li>
            <li>This one goes around the whole outer part of your eye.</li>
            <li>you can really see a difference.  </li>
            <li>- My eyes really shine like 24 karate gold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just as described moisturising and nourishing for the eye area, would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>considering how much of a beauty guru she is.</li>
            <li>That may not seem like much</li>
            <li>but you would really have to see it to believe it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is when the product really blew me and her away.</li>
            <li>She was applying an eye shadow that she had received from a friend, however, it never applied very well.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li>First, it felt tighter and fresher and new.  </li>
            <li>The eye masks are super soft, wet and slippery as I have said and went on just fine.  </li>
            <li>We had tried so many things before this but this product that the only one that actually delivered the results she wanted.</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>The results so far had been promising.</li>
            <li>so I gave it a few more minutes and then got up to look at the results.  </li>
            <li>She said the when she normally wakes up her eyes</li>
            <li>For me, this was like a brand new</li>
            <li>, it felt tighter and fresher and new.  </li>
            <li>For me, this was like a brand new lid.  </li>
            <li>These masks are jelly-like when moist &amp; turn to what appears to be foil paper when dried, which I think is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I recommend that the first 10 minutes you stay in place with your head back so the mask can &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Once the product had ran out we noticed that the swelling and large bags under her eyes were totally gone!</li>
            <li>It is produced naturally in the body and is responsible for the rejuvenation of not only the skin but also joints and nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems like the Ancient Greeks and Romans were onto gold for skin care since early times.  </li>
            <li>I even got my 67 year old mother hooked on them.</li>
            <li>That is the only draw back, but for the results I am getting I would give it my opinion that it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I have the hardest time erasing the dark circles under my eyes and the puffiness that results from too many long days at work!</li>
            <li>Lots of women can barely eek out 5 minutes to themselves.  </li>
            <li>A low molecular weight hyaluronic serum can penetrate deep into your skin, hydrating cells, restoring collagen and elastin function, and even destroying the free radicals that form from sun, chemical, and pollutant exposure.</li>
            <li>- right where all the little wrinkles hang out.  </li>
            <li>they really do help with puffiness and dark circles.</li>

            <li> For me, this was like a brand new lid.  </li>
            <li> These masks are jelly-like when moist &amp; turn to what appears to be foil paper when dried, which I think is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I recommend that the first 10 minutes you stay in place with your head back so the mask can &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;.  </li>

            <li> It is produced naturally in the body and is responsible for the rejuvenation of not only the skin but also joints and nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems like the Ancient Greeks and Romans were onto gold for skin care since early times.  </li>
            <li> I even got my 67 year old mother hooked on them.</li>
            <li> That is the only draw back, but for the results I am getting I would give it my opinion that it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I have the hardest time erasing the dark circles under my eyes and the puffiness that results from too many long days at work!</li>
            <li> Lots of women can barely eek out 5 minutes to themselves.  </li>
            <li> A low molecular weight hyaluronic serum can penetrate deep into your skin, hydrating cells, restoring collagen and elastin function, and even destroying the free radicals that form from sun, chemical, and pollutant exposure.</li>
            <li> - right where all the little wrinkles hang out.  </li>
            <li> they really do help with puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using the same product as all the rest of those 5 star reviewers, but these do absolutely zero/zilch.</li>
            <li> They are a little slippery and a couple of times I ended up getting the liquid in my eyes so it takes a little bit of practice to get it right.  </li>
            <li> positioning these super thin, slimy gizmos is a pain in the butt.  </li>
            <li> The night she applied the eye shadow, after using the face mask for so long, she noticed that skin around her eyes had tightened</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though it is not rapid but gradually the signs start showing on your face in the form of dullness, fine lines, age spots, bags and dark circles under eyes and later on sadly wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gold Eye Collagen Hyaluronic Acid prevent my skin to dry out and reduce oil.</li>
            <li> Im addicted to beauty products and as most women we have a draw or a box of stuff we purchased and have not liked.  </li>
            <li> However, when she woke up the first morning after applying the mask the bags and swelling around her eyes had decreased by around, I would say, five (5) percent.</li>
            <li> It was not the eye shadow that did but the fact that her eye lids were too loose and stretchy.</li>
            <li> I wish the eye holes were just a little bit larger</li>
            <li> At about the 40 minute point I noticed that mask was not as wet or slippery</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hyaluronic serum can offer a wide range of benefits.</li>
            <li> I would use it on hot and cold days because the sun can damage the skin whatever the weather is outside.</li>
            <li> Other products, that I wont name, caused her eyes to swell while others caused her face to break out.</li>
            <li> I have bags under my eyes, and after using these five times (every other day)</li>
            <li> The second day it decreased about the same amount as the day before.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first and had a hard time keeping them on, but the skin around and under my eyes were instantly smoother and less puffy after sitting with these on for 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> and I still have some dark circles.</li>
            <li> Your dark circles and puffiness are gone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Solution For All Your Skin Care Problems&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you are not using the collagen that is specifically designed to eliminate the dark circles and bags under your eyes.</li>
            <li> benefits of collagen for skin are that you will slow down all the conditions mentioned above and hence reduce the aging process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Holy cow!  </li>
            <li> Holy cow!  </li>
            <li> After that with each passing year the body produces less and less collagen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Less eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> I did not find the eye hole to be too small as some have said, but then again I planned to  have my eyes closed.  </li>
            <li> It slows down the collagen depletion, increases skinâ€™s elasticity, lightens the skinâ€™s complexion, stimulates the cells making the skin firm, improves blood circulation and prevents premature aging, wrinkles,etc.  </li>
            <li> so I was a little nervous at first.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i would use them a few times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some of the ones we tried just plain out did not work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of the unfortunate ones who actually had to pay for these.</li>
            <li> I even tried them first thing in the morning when my eyes were at their worst.  </li>
            <li> The reason I say this is because I have had experiences where the package was in terrible condition as well as not having what I order</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Im addicted to beauty products and as most women we have a draw or a box of stuff we purchased and have not liked.  Well im so pleased with these.  OMG you must try them.  I dont look like im sleepy after using these.  so great.</li>
            <li> easy to use and in convenient packaging. my skin felt so refreshed and smooth after first use</li>
            <li> these are great. your eyes look and feel so great after using these. the bags under your eyes no longer exist after using these. I would buy these again for sure. my daughter loves them as well</li>
            <li> These masks are jelly-like when moist &amp; turn to what appears to be foil paper when dried, which I think is pretty cool. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet in my under eye appearance yet, but hopefully that will change as I continue to use them. They do leave a cool sensation on the skin &amp; helped me to relax. I received this complimentary to test &amp; review.</li>
            <li> Wow!! Speechless!! I drink lots of water, get my sleep and I still have some dark circles. After one treatment of this it suddenly vanished! Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Will be ordering over and over again. :-)</li>
            <li> My bags are way better but I would try another eye patch not the best product.</li>
            <li> This product is making my eye area feel and look a lot better, so I do notice improvement. I just have issues with the application of the gel type mask and positioning them in place. That is the only draw back, but for the results I am getting I would give it my opinion that it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I love these things! They&#x27;re super cooling and feel nice on your face and plump up the eye area, particularly after looking at a computer all day. I feel like Cleopatra wearing them. Love!!</li>
            <li> I will be the first to admit I have no idea what the gold was all about so I looked it up.  Seems like the Ancient Greeks and Romans were onto gold for skin care since early times.  Apparently Gold not only gives a beautiful, glowing and youthful skin but is also beneficial in many ways. It slows down the collagen depletion, increases skinâ€™s elasticity, lightens the skinâ€™s complexion, stimulates the cells making the skin firm, improves blood circulation and prevents premature aging, wrinkles,etc.  Ok.  So now that I knew what I was putting on my eyes, I was ready to try this out.  I set aside 30 minutes with some nice, meditative music.  Im not a big TV fan.  I noticed that the packages had liquid in them so I made sure to open them up over the sink.  The eye masks were pure gold.  Bright yellow gold and very very slippery.  As you will see from pictures of those that posted reviews, there is an eye hole so you are not blind when wearing these.  I did not find the eye hole to be too small as some have said, but then again I planned to  have my eyes closed.  The eye masks are super soft, wet and slippery as I have said and went on just fine.  I recommend that the first 10 minutes you stay in place with your head back so the mask can &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;.  Then you can stand and they wont move around on you.  I love that they extend out from the eye - right where all the little wrinkles hang out.  Also, because I was keeping my eyes closed, I was able to have the mask on the lid where I have some aging skin that doesnt play nicely when I put my eye shadow on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask is cool but soft.  I have to say that I loved every minute of it.  I even went to 45 minutes I loved it so much.  Im glad I had the time to do so.  Lots of women can barely eek out 5 minutes to themselves.  At about the 40 minute point I noticed that mask was not as wet or slippery so I gave it a few more minutes and then got up to look at the results.  When I removed the eye mask I was really pleased.  First, it felt tighter and fresher and new.  That&#x27;s the best way I can explain it.  The skin was tighter too.  The fine lines were either gone so really reduced so that I had to look close to find them.  What amazed me most was this though - my eyelid tightened.  I cannot tell you how fabulous this was.  My eyelid skin has gotten &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34; over the years and it is a  pain to put on eyeliner and shadow.  Holy cow!  For me, this was like a brand new lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there were a way to give this 10 stars I would.  I have no idea who is using this product and not getting results.  I guess it depends on the type of skin you have.  My skin LOVES hyaluronic acid, which this has (hyaluronic acid draws moisture to itself) and it shows in the results.  I am now hoping to get a product like this that does the entire face.  This is one of my favorites and Im glad it came with 10 pairs so I can get effect again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVEN THOUGH I PURCHASED THIS AT A DISCOUNT FOR TESTING AND REVIEW, I honestly tell you that I have used this, my experience is above and if you dont like yours, contact me.  I will happily take them off your hands!  Awesome.rst, it felt tighter and fresher and new.  That&#x27;s the best way I can explain it.  The skin was tighter too.

            <li> So I tried out a similar eye mask that was only for under the eyes. This one goes around the whole outer part of your eye. Let me say that these collagen eye mask work fantastic!! After 30 to 60 minutes of use. Your dark circles and puffiness are gone. Its almost like having a mini facelift!  i would use them a few times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collagen  protein is present in the connective tissue of the human body. It is produced naturally in the body and is responsible for the rejuvenation of not only the skin but also joints and nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The production of collagen is slowed around the age of 25. After that with each passing year the body produces less and less collagen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it is not rapid but gradually the signs start showing on your face in the form of dullness, fine lines, age spots, bags and dark circles under eyes and later on sadly wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefits of collagen for skin are that you will slow down all the conditions mentioned above and hence reduce the aging process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solution For All Your Skin Care Problems&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you are not using the collagen that is specifically designed to eliminate the dark circles and bags under your eyes. This will rejuvenate your skin making it radiant, youthful, and flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic serum can offer a wide range of benefits. It is definitely effective in helping to produce healthier, younger looking skin. A low molecular weight hyaluronic serum can penetrate deep into your skin, hydrating cells, restoring collagen and elastin function, and even destroying the free radicals that form from sun, chemical, and pollutant exposure. Hyaluronic serum is actually an excellent antioxidant, and when your serum is capable of reaching the deepest layers of your skin, it can be incredibly effective at reversing damage to your cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Works great makes my eyes look great I&#x27;m  loving it!!!!</li>
            <li> I put these eye masks in the refrigerator before I put them on my eyes so that they would have a nice cooling effect and to help with the swelling/bags under my eyes.  They are a little slippery and a couple of times I ended up getting the liquid in my eyes so it takes a little bit of practice to get it right.  I wish the eye holes were just a little bit larger but overall I really liked this product.  My eye area appears to be refreshed after I&#x27;ve used them and I think that the more often they are used the more you can really see a difference.  I purchased this item at a promotional rate for review purposes.</li>
            <li> My eyes looked immediately brighter and refreshed!</li>
            <li> This product worked great for my dark circles and puffy eyes. I liked it very much. I felt fresh and gained confidence after using it. I will definitely continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I have the hardest time erasing the dark circles under my eyes and the puffiness that results from too many long days at work! But these babies are PURE GOLD!!!! After just one use everyone has commented on how bright-eyed and youthful I look.  If that&#x27;s ONE time, sign me up for many more! Can&#x27;t wait to re-purchase after I run out.</li>
            <li> This is my favor product, made me feeling great. I put it around my eyes area before I went back to sleep. It was on almost one hour. I kept using it twice a week. I could see the different. I felt great with result. The price is very reasonable. The service is excellent.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt the best Collagen Eye Mask Masks I have ever had!!! I swear by them! I dont get a lot of sleep. So I wake up with huge bags under my eyes. After using them /the bags are always gone. I even got my 67 year old mother hooked on them. They are our life savers!!! A must buy!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I saw immediate results, but they are really refreshing!  I will use them again!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many products similar to this one to reduce my wrinkles on my eyes. I have been to many spa&#x27;s, tried many different types of products and chemicals that do not work at all. In Fact they make it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I started using 24k Gold Eye - My eyes really shine like 24 karate gold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My puffy eyes have reduced and my wrinkles on the side of my eyes are all gone! After my first use I started nothing a difference. I recommend everyone try this product. I&#x27;ll be buying more, because it simply Works amazingly!</li>
            <li> I have been using 24k Gold Eye Collagen Hyaluronic Acid for my daily basis. I would use it on hot and cold days because the sun can damage the skin whatever the weather is outside. 24k Gold Eye Collagen Hyaluronic Acid prevent my skin to dry out and reduce oil. I also use it before I to bed. Simply apply the 24k Gold Eye Collagen Hyaluronic Acid for 30-45 mins then sleep. When I wake up, I noticed my skin have become nice and refresh. I recommended 24k Gold Eye Collagen Hyaluronic Acid to anyone looking for facial care product!</li>
            <li> Feel good!! Waiting for results!!!</li>
            <li> Just as described moisturising and nourishing for the eye area, would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> ã€€ã€€I ordered this product for my wife as a gift. Considering it was such a great price I figured it would be worth it considering how much of a beauty guru she is. We had tried so many things before this but this product that the only one that actually delivered the results she wanted. Other products, that I wont name, caused her eyes to swell while others caused her face to break out. Some of the ones we tried just plain out did not work so I was a little nervous at first.&lt;br /&gt;ã€€ã€€ When it got here, which didnâ€™t take long at all, the package was in great condition. There were bends or rips on the box. I was very pleased by this. Once I opened it up I saw that I had indeed gotten what I ordered. The reason I say this is because I have had experiences where the package was in terrible condition as well as not having what I order but I assure that you can trust this buyer.&lt;br /&gt;ã€€ã€€After the first day of use my wife said that she was already noticing a difference. She said the when she normally wakes up her eyes a swollen up as if she was stung by a bee. However, when she woke up the first morning after applying the mask the bags and swelling around her eyes had decreased by around, I would say, five (5) percent. That may not seem like much but you would really have to see it to believe it.&lt;br /&gt;ã€€ã€€The second day it decreased about the same amount as the day before. The results so far had been promising. She was very happy with the results and she continued using it until we ran out.&lt;br /&gt;ã€€ã€€Once the product had ran out we noticed that the swelling and large bags under her eyes were totally gone! It was amazing that the effect was still working even after the product had not been applied for a couple of days. After a couple more days passed we decided to go out for a date night. This is when the product really blew me and her away. She was applying an eye shadow that she had received from a friend, however, it never applied very well. It was not the eye shadow that did but the fact that her eye lids were too loose and stretchy. The night she applied the eye shadow, after using the face mask for so long, she noticed that skin around her eyes had tightened and she was now able to apply the make up she had always wanted!&lt;br /&gt;ã€€ã€€That night we met up with a couple of friends and all her girlfriend could talk about was how great her skin looked! We never told them about the product before this so we know that they were not looking for any changes. People can see the difference and I am one-hundred percent positive that you will too. Me, my wife, and her friends were all blown away by this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where to start!  The 24K Gold Eye Collagen Hyaluronic Acid masks are pure heaven!!! I was a little skeptical at first and had a hard time keeping them on, but the skin around and under my eyes were instantly smoother and less puffy after sitting with these on for 30 minutes.  These are absolutely a great way to pamper yourself and take care of your skin.  I use them twice a week and the effects from them last.  I would highly recommend these to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> What fun eye masks! Remove from package are two separate eye masks with perfect cut outs. These masks are gold gelatinous oval masks concentrated with vitamins! Easy to apply. Feels cool and soothing! Great for fatigued eyes. Eyes feel instantly hydrated after 30 minutes of application. Less eye puffiness. Never used anything like this!</li>
            <li> Good item but prefer the Luxurious 24k Gold Bio-collagen Facial Mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of the unfortunate ones who actually had to pay for these. Most of the reviews (close to practically all) were from people who received a complementary set, in exchange for their honest opinion.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using the same product as all the rest of those 5 star reviewers, but these do absolutely zero/zilch. OK, the rose water or whatever they&#x27;re packed in smells nice, and they feel OK on your eyes, but so does a cheap ice mask, which gives better temporary results...not to mention, positioning these super thin, slimy gizmos is a pain in the butt.  Eventually, you&#x27;ll get them to stick and assume all that work will pay off.  I have bags under my eyes, and after using these five times (every other day) there&#x27;s not even a 0.1% difference. I even tried them first thing in the morning when my eyes were at their worst.  This is the placebo effect at its best!</li>
            <li> Love these! They feel so good on. they really do help with puffiness and dark circles.</li>
