    <ol>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>These are the BEST eyelid tapes I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>These are perfect.</li>
            <li>This is very good product and can be used on your eyelids without someone noticing you have them.</li>
            <li>Which is GOOD!</li>
            <li>for what its designed for it works great</li>
            <li>If you need the width tho, I believe it will be a great one to use.</li>
            <li>they will work great...</li>
            <li>Gonna take some getting used to, but it works fantastic !!!</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>I would of give it more star because the product was really good!</li>
            <li>If you can get it applied just right, the effect is wonderful, but it&#x27;s tricky.</li>
            <li>Magic!  </li>
            <li>Will be ordering more, thank you!</li>
            <li>then try it on your own eyes...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how your supposed to use these, but, I will tell you what is the easiest and most effective</li>
            <li>I find this is more effective for my eye depth.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable and effective.  </li>
            <li>which has become more pronounced with age...</li>
            <li>Hope this helps :-)</li>
            <li>The glue is strong, which I like.</li>
            <li>strong adhesive.</li>
            <li>The product itself was fine.</li>
            <li>so you can remove it easily once you secure it on you skin.</li>
            <li>If yours are, you might have more success getting them applied correctly.</li>
            <li>but these are sooo much better and the sipping was fast!</li>
            <li>these should fit most anyone who wants to use eyelid tape...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say, but maybe they would work better on someone with a monolid.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure your lids are free of oils or powders... perhaps use a make up remover before hand on lid... but make sure lid is dry when applying...</li>
            <li>They are pretty narrow in very good quality.</li>
            <li>You do have to play a bit with the placement, but once you find the right placement on your eyes...</li>
            <li>They came here so fast that I didn&#x27;t even think to be looking for them!</li>
            <li>but the tape really showed!  </li>
            <li>I got pretty discouraged.  </li>
            <li>They give me the perfect double lid that I have been trying to get back for the last 10 years!  </li>
            <li>Everytime I use it over my eye lid, it magically creates double eye lid for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible that the glue will not be as strong.</li>
            <li>It was good, but not thick enough to give me a double lid that really made a difference.  </li>
            <li>This works really well</li>
            <li>But the ones that are we&#x27;re very sticky and it came with instruction and picture which I really like ..</li>
            <li>They really work and allow me to see without invasive plastic surgery.  </li>
            <li>but it really works and</li>
            <li>my lids started to droop some and it really bothered me.  </li>
            <li>I tried absolutely everything I could think of to disguise it and nothing worked.  </li>
            <li>I was really considering eye surgery...</li>
            <li>The also hold very well.  </li>
            <li>they were very helpful.  </li>
            <li>They are a tad hard to figure out because the instructions aren&#x27;t in English, but once you figure it out, they work great and stay until you&#x27;re ready to remove them!</li>
            <li>Sticks better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>As I got older [now 49]</li>
            <li>I found that putting them just above the line where your lid normally folds and off center towards the outside (i.e. on right eye more on right side of face) versus centering them...</li>
            <li>Anyway, highly recommended -</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>, it took going through several sets of strips to get it right.</li>
            <li>If you get these, look for an envelope, not a small package.</li>
            <li>Be sure you lift the middle of the other side</li>
            <li>like I had an instant eye lift with a pretty effect.</li>
            <li>If you remove the white cover over the strips by mistake before you are ready to apply them</li>
            <li>I tried another type and while they were effective they were too thin and the shape was pointy...</li>
            <li>In other words I had to remember which side to remove from the package first.</li>
            <li>I have almond shaped eyes and used to have a natural double lid.  </li>
            <li>they are wider than the previous product I was using but not like they made it sound like it was ridiculously wide...</li>
            <li>For the few times I got it on right</li>
            <li>You will need to try that a few times but once you get it down it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>bad sticker but stick is a good usage</li>

            <li> Very sticky, but really hard to manipulate.  </li>
            <li> Oh and I am using them not because I have wide almond eyes with almost asian like monolid</li>
            <li> My fingers are not long and thin or very dexterous however.</li>
            <li> For me, it takes several tries and several wasted strips.</li>

            <li> I also should mention that I am Caucasian and only have a slightly droopy eyelid, not a monolid.</li>

            <li> the product description says WIDE...</li>
            <li> I will wear this a day or two and when I remove them my eyes stay the same way for a few days.</li>
            <li> Perhaps they may work for a model going to a short photo shoot, which I am not, but for everyday use I can&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
            <li> Then peel it off using the other side with the tab for support.</li>
            <li> I usually use the smaller size eyelid tape</li>
            <li> but the quantity was very minimal.</li>
            <li> Oh one last note, another reviewer complained they are too wide...</li>
            <li> Unlikely other product, this has DOUBLE SIDED adhesive, gentle to your skin and stays on for a few days!  </li>
            <li> However I could tell that I was only a half hour or so away from an eyelid tape malfunction before my eyelid may let loose and look wonky.</li>
            <li> Product was a little too wide for me.  </li>
            <li> A little too wide.</li>
            <li> Placement takes a few tries .  </li>
            <li> Press it down and peel away the remaining tab.</li>
            <li> I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the risk of looking stupid in public and never wore them out.</li>
            <li> that was just a mess.  </li>
            <li> I dust on a little powder</li>
            <li> it took me few times trying it</li>
            <li> Then I tried the thin double sided tape.  </li>
            <li> I will cuz this product is totally not working for the eyelid way too big :(</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when another reviewer said they stayed on for several days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased eyelid tape before but the previous ones were really thin, so I decided to try this one.  </li>
            <li> I was trying these to give my eye a less tired look.</li>
            <li> There was a difference, it was just so subtle as to be hardly noticeable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive after adding shipipng charge.  </li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for the poor package</li>
            <li> Seriously!  </li>
            <li> These are difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> and it was awful.  </li>
            <li> worst product ever</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This works really well but the quantity was very minimal.</li>
            <li> I receive it in an envelope that looked like someone was trying to open it . There were rip and tear alone the sealing area. I was not please with that at all. I was also in fear that the product wasn&#x27;t there any longer. Thank god it was. The product itself was fine. Some plastic on the tape weren&#x27;t place on neatly .. But the ones that are we&#x27;re very sticky and it came with instruction and picture which I really like .. If it wasn&#x27;t for the poor package I would of give it more star because the product was really good!</li>
            <li> Very sticky, but really hard to manipulate.  The pictures don&#x27;t help nor does the Chinese directions.  You&#x27;ll burn a couple; they may bunch up at the end, but use the stick; you can with practice have your eyes looking much younger!!!!</li>
            <li> Sticks better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried! Gives the desired look. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> bad sticker but stick is a good usage</li>
            <li> for what its designed for it works great but I might be allergic because it gets itchy after about 15 min</li>
            <li> I use these to help with a medical condition called CPEO.  They really work and allow me to see without invasive plastic surgery.  They are comfortable and effective.  They stay on all day with no irritation and no one can see them.  Great product!</li>
            <li> it took me few times trying it but it really works and it is double tape it.</li>
            <li> If you get these, look for an envelope, not a small package. They came here so fast that I didn&#x27;t even think to be looking for them! They are a tad hard to figure out because the instructions aren&#x27;t in English, but once you figure it out, they work great and stay until you&#x27;re ready to remove them!</li>
            <li> Gonna take some getting used to, but it works fantastic !!!</li>
            <li> Product was a little too wide for me.  If you need the width tho, I believe it will be a great one to use.</li>
            <li> I cannot use this product as it is too wide.  I&#x27;ve purchased eyelid tape before but the previous ones were really thin, so I decided to try this one.  I do not like it.</li>
            <li> OMG!  These are the BEST eyelid tapes I have ever used!  I have almond shaped eyes and used to have a natural double lid.  As I got older [now 49] my lids started to droop some and it really bothered me.  I missed my younger eyes!  I tried the regular lid tape, that is one sided and it was awful.  You could totally see the tape on your lid.  I tried absolutely everything I could think of to disguise it and nothing worked.  Maybe my lids weren&#x27;t droopy enough...but the tape really showed!  It was embarassing.  Then I tried the thin double sided tape.  It was good, but not thick enough to give me a double lid that really made a difference.  There was a difference, it was just so subtle as to be hardly noticeable.  I got pretty discouraged.  So I tried the lid glue...that was just a mess.  It is like eyelash adhesive and does not stick enough and you can see it flake etc throughout the day.  THEN I TRIED THESE!!!!!  Literally - an answer to my prayers!  Seriously!  They are double sided so you CAN NOT see them.  You do have to play a bit with the placement, but once you find the right placement on your eyes...WHAAALAAA!  Magic!  They give me the perfect double lid that I have been trying to get back for the last 10 years!  I was really considering eye surgery...but now don&#x27;t need to.  These are perfect.</li>
            <li> If I can return it I will cuz this product is totally not working for the eyelid way too big :( worst product ever</li>
            <li> A little too wide. Doesnt last very long. .</li>
            <li> I gave this product a two star, only because it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I try putting them on but couldn&#x27;t get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> The glue is strong, which I like. You have to be careful when removing them. If you remove the white cover over the strips by mistake before you are ready to apply them It&#x27;s possible that the glue will not be as strong. In other words I had to remember which side to remove from the package first. The white strips are for handling until your tape is positioned on the lid.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item number of times. Everytime I use it over my eye lid, it magically creates double eye lid for me.  Unlikely other product, this has DOUBLE SIDED adhesive, gentle to your skin and stays on for a few days!  It&#x27;s a little expensive after adding shipipng charge.  I wished they would reduce shipping charge for multiple purchase but they don&#x27;t.  Only for this reason - shipping charge, I give them 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I tried another type and while they were effective they were too thin and the shape was pointy... Not so with these, edges are rounded so no discomfort.  The also hold very well.  I was skeptical when another reviewer said they stayed on for several days. I concur now that I use them , could be worn for days.  strong adhesive. Placement takes a few tries .  I found that putting them just above the line where your lid normally folds and off center towards the outside (i.e. on right eye more on right side of face) versus centering them... You will need to try that a few times but once you get it down it is easy to apply. I checked out videos on Youtube for how to apply eyelid tape... they were very helpful.  Also, make sure your lids are free of oils or powders... perhaps use a make up remover before hand on lid... but make sure lid is dry when applying... Anyway, highly recommended - Oh and I am using them not because I have wide almond eyes with almost asian like monolid which has become more pronounced with age... had considered doing eyelid surgery but these do the trick.. These will be my product of choice... Oh one last note, another reviewer complained they are too wide... helloooooo the product description says WIDE... they are wider than the previous product I was using but not like they made it sound like it was ridiculously wide... NOT so... these should fit most anyone who wants to use eyelid tape... the problem was probably with that reviewers placement of the tape.. So again go online watch some videos to get a feel for how to place them. then try it on your own eyes... they will work great... Hope this helps :-)</li>
            <li> Which is GOOD! I don&#x27;t know how your supposed to use these, but, I will tell you what is the easiest and most effective way I use them. Before you peel the tape off the plastic. Bend the tape in half and remove one of the white tabs over it. Then peel it off using the other side with the tab for support. Be sure you lift the middle of the other side so you can remove it easily once you secure it on you skin. Using the end with no tab. Place it on the crease of your eye. Press it down and peel away the remaining tab. From that point you can either open and close your eyes so the tape on the outside sticks to your skin or do what I do. I find this is more effective for my eye depth. I dust on a little powder so the tape doesn&#x27;t stick to my skin. I will wear this a day or two and when I remove them my eyes stay the same way for a few days. Good luck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what made me think this would really work. Yes, it technically does lift your lids if applied correctly and believe me, it took going through several sets of strips to get it right. However I could tell that I was only a half hour or so away from an eyelid tape malfunction before my eyelid may let loose and look wonky. I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the risk of looking stupid in public and never wore them out. Perhaps they may work for a model going to a short photo shoot, which I am not, but for everyday use I can&#x27;t recommend these. I also should mention that I am Caucasian and only have a slightly droopy eyelid, not a monolid. I was trying these to give my eye a less tired look. I can&#x27;t really say, but maybe they would work better on someone with a monolid.</li>
            <li> I usually use the smaller size eyelid tape but these are sooo much better and the sipping was fast! Will be ordering more, thank you!</li>
            <li> These are difficult to work with. If you can get it applied just right, the effect is wonderful, but it&#x27;s tricky. My fingers are not long and thin or very dexterous however. If yours are, you might have more success getting them applied correctly. For me, it takes several tries and several wasted strips. For the few times I got it on right I felt like I had an instant eye lift with a pretty effect. They have to be covered well in eye shadow, however, or it&#x27;s obvious you have a strip of something stuck to your eyelid.</li>
            <li> This is very good product and can be used on your eyelids without someone noticing you have them. They are pretty narrow in very good quality. I highly recommend this product.</li>
