            <li>and it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li>Great buy!</li>
            <li>Beautiful color!</li>
            <li>It looks great with everything and was perfect for my end of summer, beginning of fall attire.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful year around color for your nails.</li>
            <li>I was a bit nervous about the house fly sheen, just knowing that made me somewhat reluctant.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I like it and the price was great.</li>
            <li>No allergic reaction, great long-lasting manicures.</li>
            <li>I love the color and it lasts so well!!</li>
            <li>I got the color before at a salon, and it is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and a nice color.</li>
            <li>It does not look good with my skin tone though.</li>
            <li>I love using Shellac, and this color is beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and it is the best gel polish ever!</li>
            <li>Cnd is the best shellac I have used love love it.</li>

            <li>I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>and I am extremely pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li>It has a nice shimmery finish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite, most versatile color I own!</li>
            <li>It peels very easily and does not stay on nail.</li>
            <li>so I make sure I always have my own.</li>
            <li>and I have the tiniest barely noticeable chip on my ring finger, but everything else looks perfect.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much!!!</li>
            <li>Love love love this color</li>
            <li>A must buy for sure.</li>
            <li>Love this color.</li>
            <li>I love this color.  </li>
            <li>If I was darker or paler it&#x27;d be better.</li>
            <li>Like the Shellac best as it seems to last longer.  </li>
            <li>This is my signature color! :)</li>
            <li>It is a great color to use on its own, or to layer on top of other colors for an added sheen.  </li>
            <li>and this doesn&#x27;t start peeling away as easily.  </li>
            <li>She chose to try this color, and it looks just as beautiful on her short nails as it does on longer ones.  </li>
            <li>The color is very light and has an orange iridescence when it shines, very pretty.  </li>
            <li>It looks fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It is the perfect peach neutral and then I move my hands and there is this flash of green.  </li>
            <li>Would be great as a second coat over romantique color.</li>
            <li>The color is more of an orange than coral and it has a very bright green iridescent sheen!</li>
            <li>So far, I love it!  </li>
            <li>look good over darker colors to get the greenish or turquoise finish or on itw own if you don&#x27;t mind ALIEN looking nails</li>
            <li>It flashes a beautiful green.  </li>
            <li>If you have pale skin, the pinks would probably be beautiful on you...</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase this new color before others in this area had it.  </li>
            <li>Very cool and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Yup, the green of house fly wings.  </li>
            <li>It looks very elegant and lasts a long time, almost 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Also jsyk, it is transparent not opaque, so it may be nice if you layer it over a solid opaque color?</li>
            <li>It can be used alone to give a golden shimmer to the nail, or over two coats of an opaque color to give a golden shimmer to the color.</li>
            <li>As a busy professional, I appreciate that my nails always look good.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, edgy color.</li>
            <li>I just had my first CND Shellac manicure.  </li>
            <li>I sent an e-mail to CND and sure enough, it&#x27;s supposed to be like that (who made that decision</li>
            <li>This is the color I picked for my first DIY shellac manicure.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with this color the first time I chose it in a local nail shop.</li>
            <li>Not too much difference between the two,</li>
            <li>The product shipped so fast</li>
            <li>, just wish the color was really coral.</li>
            <li>However it is very translucent.  </li>
            <li>As always, try to find a swatch of the nail color on an actual finger nail, or other surface (a google search of &amp;#34;Shellac swatch ___color____&amp;#34; will give you a good start).  </li>
            <li>It is very different, striking and quite pretty - especially with a tan.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this color or any others.</li>
            <li>My favorite gel color, not very many salons carry it</li>
            <li>The light pink is pretty but the green holographic color that you see in certain light completely confuses me.</li>
            <li>I love the coral color of this but the \\&quot;iced\\&quot; part is actually green.  </li>
            <li>It goes from demure to fun and back.  </li>
            <li>It arrived on time in new condition.</li>
            <li>do really like the polish in general</li>
            <li>This color works great layering with other shellac colors, or for a subtle effect by itself.</li>
            <li>hated for the greenish hue depending on the light, some loved it saying it exactly looks like pearls on my fingertips.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for a few qualities 1) transparent enough for shorter nails 2) interesting enough to be pretty 3)</li>
            <li>( hahaha, that&#x27;s the quote form my male coworker).</li>
            <li>The shellac really does last even with cleaning and gardening.  </li>
            <li>The bottle looks like a nice coral color with a pearl type sheen, but it&#x27;s false hope.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to soak off nails and have tried the Shellac and the various gel products.  </li>
            <li>Iced Coral is a little more iridescent green than the bottle would lead you to believe.  </li>
            <li>Loved Gellish until I started having an allergic reaction - crazy itchy fingers for several days after a manicure.</li>
            <li>I usually use it with several other colors as a top coat.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s iridescent, so any light which hits your nails will show the pale \\&quot;green sheen\\&quot; to it.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it takes some special lamp, or some special base or sealer, but I&#x27;ve tried this TWICE and both times had to rub it off my nails after waiting literally HOURS FOR IT TO DRY.  </li>
            <li> but it dries clear with a green pearl like tint.</li>
            <li> I got two different extreme reactions from people.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> I have found that the bottle color on CND polishes is almost always a little different from the actual color of the polish inside.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too sheer and \\&quot;green\\&quot; by itself.  </li>
            <li> She said \\&quot;everyone tries this one first\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I would describe it as tannish / pale greenish with a tiny bit pink.  </li>
            <li> Even though I have a lot of other colors, I found myself wearing this combination for 3 applications in a row.  </li>
            <li> It does look neat over other colors however.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and ordered the Cocoa as a base for this color and it looks FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li> I have no idea why they would combine green with pink.</li>
            <li> This color is a pale shiny pink, but sometimes the sheen has a pale green color.  </li>
            <li> Something is wrong somewhere -- this is Texas in August and there IS no humidity to factor in -- the stuff is NOT ordinary nail polish and should not be sold under that heading.</li>
            <li> But be warned, unless you like the &#x27;green sheen&#x27;</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of this color.</li>
            <li> So that was a little disturbing.  </li>
            <li> I have medium tone skin and think the pale pinks tend to look wrong on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an equestrian and very hard on my hands.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, on their advice I used this as the 1st color layer (verrry thin)</li>
            <li> and I hate it.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love love love this color its my go to... I think its been dc&#x27;d tho? Boooo</li>
            <li> I just had my first CND Shellac manicure.  So far, I love it!  My manicurist suggested this color, Iced Coral over a coat of Cocoa.  It looks fabulous.  This color is a pale shiny pink, but sometimes the sheen has a pale green color.  It is very different, striking and quite pretty - especially with a tan.</li>
            <li> I love the coral color of this but the \\&quot;iced\\&quot; part is actually green.  Yup, the green of house fly wings.  So that was a little disturbing.  I sent an e-mail to CND and sure enough, it&#x27;s supposed to be like that (who made that decision, I wonder).  Anyway, on their advice I used this as the 1st color layer (verrry thin) and then \\&quot;Beau\\&quot; for the 2nd color layer and it&#x27;s perfect.  But be warned, unless you like the &#x27;green sheen&#x27; you won&#x27;t want to use this color alone!</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous about the house fly sheen, just knowing that made me somewhat reluctant.  But I already had the Cocoa and decided why not.  I LOVE it!  It&#x27;s still a neutral color but adds that extra \\&quot;something\\&quot; to a neutral shade.  I would describe it as tannish / pale greenish with a tiny bit pink.  It&#x27;s iridescent, so any light which hits your nails will show the pale \\&quot;green sheen\\&quot; to it.  My mother in law was visiting today, and she has very short nails.  She chose to try this color, and it looks just as beautiful on her short nails as it does on longer ones.  I&#x27;m wearing it over Cocoa, and she chose just Iced Coral.  Not too much difference between the two, so I suggest not buying Cocoa just to use with the Iced Coral.</li>
            <li> I agree with a lot of reviewers on this product.  It&#x27;s a little too sheer and \\&quot;green\\&quot; by itself.  I went ahead and ordered the Cocoa as a base for this color and it looks FANTASTIC!  Even though I have a lot of other colors, I found myself wearing this combination for 3 applications in a row.  It looks great with everything and was perfect for my end of summer, beginning of fall attire.</li>
            <li> This color works great layering with other shellac colors, or for a subtle effect by itself. It has a nice shimmery finish.</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase this new color before others in this area had it.  Thank you very much!!!</li>
            <li> I love the color and it lasts so well!!</li>
            <li> I got the color before at a salon, and it is gorgeous. The product shipped so fast and I am extremely pleased with my purchase! A must buy for sure.</li>
            <li> My favorite gel color, not very many salons carry it so I make sure I always have my own.</li>
            <li> I was expect a peachy coral, but it shows greenish and I hate it.  I wish the manicurist would have warned me.  She said \\&quot;everyone tries this one first\\&quot;.  I should have inquired further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do really like the polish in general, just wish the color was really coral.</li>
            <li> Is extremely sheer, next to no coverage. The bottle looks like a nice coral color with a pearl type sheen, but it&#x27;s false hope. It does look neat over other colors however.</li>
            <li> I thought this color would be as displayed but it dries clear with a green pearl like tint. I think I&#x27;ll use this in a coat to mix colors and see what I&amp;#34;ll come up with. All in all, I like it and the price was great.</li>
            <li> I got two different extreme reactions from people.&lt;br /&gt;Some hated for the greenish hue depending on the light, some loved it saying it exactly looks like pearls on my fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;ll look good over darker colors to get the greenish or turquoise finish or on itw own if you don&#x27;t mind ALIEN looking nails ( hahaha, that&#x27;s the quote form my male coworker).</li>
            <li> Perhaps it takes some special lamp, or some special base or sealer, but I&#x27;ve tried this TWICE and both times had to rub it off my nails after waiting literally HOURS FOR IT TO DRY.  Something is wrong somewhere -- this is Texas in August and there IS no humidity to factor in -- the stuff is NOT ordinary nail polish and should not be sold under that heading.</li>
            <li> I love using Shellac, and this color is beautiful.  ***As always, try to find a swatch of the nail color on an actual finger nail, or other surface (a google search of &amp;#34;Shellac swatch ___color____&amp;#34; will give you a good start).  I have found that the bottle color on CND polishes is almost always a little different from the actual color of the polish inside.

It&#x27;s my favorite, most versatile color I own!</li>
            <li> Love this color. You can use it alone or with another color. I usually use it with several other colors as a top coat.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and it is the best gel polish ever! It looks very elegant and lasts a long time, almost 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, edgy color. It arrived on time in new condition. I would definitely use this seller again. Great buy!</li>
            <li> The shellac really does last even with cleaning and gardening.  I love this color.  It is the perfect peach neutral and then I move my hands and there is this flash of green.

            <li> This is a beautiful year around color for your nails. Cnd is the best shellac I have used love love it. Highly recommend this color or any others. And it last</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of this color. The light pink is pretty but the green holographic color that you see in certain light completely confuses me. I have no idea why they would combine green with pink. I will not get this color again.</li>
            <li> Loved Gellish until I started having an allergic reaction - crazy itchy fingers for several days after a manicure. Switched to Shellac, with trepidation but hopeful. It&#x27;s been terrific. No allergic reaction, great long-lasting manicures.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the shimmery look.</li>
            <li> This is the color I picked for my first DIY shellac manicure.  I was looking for a few qualities 1) transparent enough for shorter nails 2) interesting enough to be pretty 3) would look good with my warm undertones.  I&#x27;m an equestrian and very hard on my hands.  I&#x27;m on day 4 and I have the tiniest barely noticeable chip on my ring finger, but everything else looks perfect.  YouTube videos have been invaluable in teaching me how to do it myself.  The color is an iridescent duo chrome coral.  It flashes a beautiful green.  Very cool and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and a nice color. It does not look good with my skin tone though. If I was darker or paler it&#x27;d be better. I&#x27;m olive and it blends in with my skin.</li>
            <li> The color is more of an orange than coral and it has a very bright green iridescent sheen! Also jsyk, it is transparent not opaque, so it may be nice if you layer it over a solid opaque color?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to soak off nails and have tried the Shellac and the various gel products.  Like the Shellac best as it seems to last longer.  I go in the pool a lot and this doesn&#x27;t start peeling away as easily.  This color is like a transparent gold color.  It can be used alone to give a golden shimmer to the nail, or over two coats of an opaque color to give a golden shimmer to the color.</li>
            <li> This nail shellac does not add any color to nails. It peels very easily and does not stay on nail.</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; color. Shellac stays on for me for 10-14 days. As a busy professional, I appreciate that my nails always look good. This color goes with anything.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the color with my skin tone. Will likely give it away to a friend who would use it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color! I fell in love with this color the first time I chose it in a local nail shop. This is my signature color! :)</li>
            <li> The color is very light and has an orange iridescence when it shines, very pretty.  However it is very translucent.  Would be great as a second coat over romantique color.</li>
