    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>With Aveeno Ultra-Calming, my skin is in the best shape of my life--and it&#x27;s cheaper and lasts longer than the \\&quot;fragrance counter\\&quot; brands.</li>
            <li>Best face wash ever.  </li>
            <li>and it was GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>My wife has been using this for years and is very happy with it.</li>
            <li>This is a great product!!</li>
            <li>excellent handle</li>
            <li>What is best is my skin feels smoother after I wash my face with this.</li>
            <li>The foam turns into a great lather and cleanses my skin without over drying (like a lot of foam cleansers).</li>
            <li>one is great for my dryness.  </li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>It is also an exceptional product.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser at night and it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all, but I don&#x27;t feel like it does the best job of cleaning my face and removing makeup.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from light rosacea, this is the best calming soap i have used , it significantly reduces the redness on my face.</li>
            <li>The smell is great and my skin feels like it is really, really clean.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it rinses off very easily and completely.  </li>
            <li>I have tried all of the products from the ultra calming line and this face wash is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno Ultra-Calming cleanser and moisturizer for more than a year now, and I have NO problems with my skin.</li>
            <li>that works okay for me.)     </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It is better than the EL cleanser I got for about $20.</li>
            <li>A great product at a good price, fragrance free for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Many products that claim to be for acne have pore clogging ingredients in them.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t believe me you can look up a list of comodegenic ingredients and you will be sure to find them in almost every cleanser &amp; moisturizer on the market.</li>
            <li>I love easy to use products that work and</li>
            <li>The foaming action feels good and creates a nice lather.  </li>
            <li>This is great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I switched from Neutrogena Pore Refining Cleanser to the Aveeno after I read on WebMD that they felt it was the best facial cleanser for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It gets your face clean and removes makeup without dryness or irritation.</li>
            <li>there is no point in a drying cleanser that doesnt clean, so i probably will not ever repurchase this.</li>
            <li>I did not know there was a special calming formula for rosacea until I ran across a magazine advertisement and, of course, I went online to see where I could find it.</li>
            <li>All their products are hypoallergenic and oil/soap free so just find the right one for you.</li>
            <li>At first you don&#x27;t think the light foam is going to clean, but it does and the moisturizer is SPF 15 and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Bless Amazon, almost anything I want can be found here, and their delivery is always super quick.</li>
            <li>My skin breaks out to most soaps (even ones that are for sensitive skin and perfume free.)  </li>
            <li>Whether or not it will actually calm the rosacea problem</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite Aveeno product.  </li>
            <li>After reading many reviews on skincare products, this is the one I bought for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I really cannot say enough good things about this foaming cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I use it together with the Ultra-Calming cream and it keeps my face fresh all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li>This is very gentle.</li>
            <li>Just be aware that the item listed on this page is the Calming/Soothing one, not the complexion formula.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, it is creamier than the regular Aveeno foaming face cleanser, so I will stick with it.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this cleanser I was hooked.  </li>
            <li>Aveeno Active Naturals is a very mild and easy to use cleanser.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice cleanser that is hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li>use their Positively Radiant line and give it 5 plus stars.  </li>
            <li>Try the Positively Radiant.  </li>
            <li>I just used this cleanser for the first time, and my face is really stinging and irritated.  </li>
            <li>It is so gentle on my skin and leaves my face feeling so clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>I have written Aveeno praising them for creating such a fine</li>
            <li>Leaves me skin fresh, soft, and relieved.</li>
            <li>So a relative of mine sells this product and this foam is fantastic.</li>
            <li>works very well without over drying my face.</li>
            <li>It even works great at washing my make up off without irritating.</li>
            <li>im torn on this cleanser because on the one hand it is very calming and reduces the redness in my skin (</li>
            <li>not just temporarily, it really changes my skin with continued use)</li>
            <li>and i believe it either breaks me out, or doesnt clean very well at all, and i only use mineral powder makeup.</li>
            <li>Also, it barely washed my skin and left it oily and actually more</li>
            <li>I can usually use one of the cloths with the soap that comes on it, and then get 4-5 additional uses out of the cloth by pre-wetting them in warm water and adding a puff of the foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li>Aveeno, please notify me if this line is ever going to be discontinued so I can rent a warehouse and stock it full of this stuff to last the rest of my life.  </li>
            <li>I cannot live without it!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Aveeno Ultra Calming cleanser and moisturizers.</li>
            <li>It cleanses gently and does not irritate my sensitive skin at all -- I&#x27;m allergic to about 99% of all cosmetics and soaps -- but not this one.   </li>
            <li>(If you really want to scrub off old skin, switch off with the Aveeno Radiant Scrub once in a while--</li>
            <li>Only took me 15 years to find the right face products.</li>
            <li>The Clear Complexion version of this foaming product also has a matching lotion, as well as prepared scrubbing cloth discs in a jar.  </li>
            <li>My skin is clearly smoother and softened.</li>
            <li>I gave it a clear shot but found it to be like washing with air</li>
            <li>I have stopped using Dial soap and use this exclusively, as it has all natural products and no alcohol.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and sensitive skin which this product promotes itself as being made for.  </li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin from years of acne treatments.</li>
            <li>however i find this can be very drying (especially to my bf</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, &amp; this cleanser is  gentle enough for me to use three times a day without drying my skin out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having both oily and sensitive skin, it can be a challenge finding a product that cleans well and is not an irritant.</li>
            <li>You just pump the foam out of the top; the product lasts a long time even though I use it everyday.</li>
            <li>Aveeno makes 2 kinds of foaming cleansers -- the beige packaging is the Calming and Soothing cleanser -- especially good if your skin is sensitive, or just sensitive to the cold, wind, polutants, sandstorms etc... of everyday life.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the regular Aveeno face cleansing foam for a long time, as it is very gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I recently tried the NEW Aveeno Calming face wash</li>
            <li>I had acne for years &amp; finally found how to clear it.</li>
            <li>I use this product daily on my sensitive skin and it does not irritate at all.</li>
            <li>Did NOT dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>The foaming cleanser in the pale green packaging is to help clear your complexion -- it&#x27;s got actual acne-fighting components and is, I suspect, what the first two reviews of the Calming product were really for.  </li>
            <li>I tend to have mostly dry, though I get greasy in the T-zone, and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Which is a boon for dry sensitive</li>

            <li> Plus, even though it is slightly medicated, it does not bother my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Calming\\&quot; is the only line I have ever found that my skin can tolerate and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face, like acne</li>

            <li> Why did it take them so long to invent this?</li>
            <li> None of them work for very long, and eventually I develop a sensitivity to ANY of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had incredibly dry skin since my mid-20s, and I&#x27;m a guy.</li>
            <li> It degreases my face, but doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.  </li>
            <li> This one seemed to remove make-up better, but my face feels very tight and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Not much smell at all...</li>
            <li> but there is no new redness or bumps and my facial itching is a think of the past.  </li>
            <li> It gets red, tight, and dry if I use harsh</li>
            <li> St. Ive&#x27;s, and a bunch of other \\&quot;fragrance counter\\&quot; and \\&quot;face cleaning aisle\\&quot; brands.</li>
            <li> is a little pricey though I think it should be either 7 or 8 oz for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with pretty bad rosacea for 10 years.</li>
            <li> Wish it was cheaper though... :/</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I am left with some acne scars on my face from years of using and trying the wrong products, I&#x27;d like to say BRAVO to Aveeno for making this one.  </li>
            <li> Believe me, if I don&#x27;t use something on my face, it starts to peel off, and people ask if I&#x27;m sick (from red cheeks).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so bad that I&#x27;m afraid to try it again, but so far it feels anything but soothing.</li>
            <li> It gets the makeup off and leaves nothing behind.  </li>
            <li> Antibacterial soaps and foams are too irritating..</li>
            <li> it made his skin peel terribly with a few uses)</li>

It cleanses gently and does not irritate my sensitive skin at all -- I&#x27;m allergic to about 99% of all cosmetics and soaps -- but not this one.

I&#x27;ve tried Clinique, Prescriptives, Lancome, Metrogel for rosacea, St. Ive&#x27;s, and a bunch of other \\&quot;fragrance counter\\&quot; and \\&quot;face cleaning aisle\\&quot; brands. None of them work for very long, and eventually I develop a sensitivity to ANY of them. But I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno Ultra-Calming cleanser and moisturizer for more than a year now, and I have NO problems with my skin. At first you don&#x27;t think the light foam is going to clean, but it does and the moisturizer is SPF 15 and not greasy. (If you really want to scrub off old skin, switch off with the Aveeno Radiant Scrub once in a while--that works okay for me.)     I CANNOT recommend this product highly enough. Believe me, if I don&#x27;t use something on my face, it starts to peel off, and people ask if I&#x27;m sick (from red cheeks). With Aveeno Ultra-Calming, my skin is in the best shape of my life--and it&#x27;s cheaper and lasts longer than the \\&quot;fragrance counter\\&quot; brands. Aveeno, PLEASE keep making this!</li>
            <li> I switched from Neutrogena Pore Refining Cleanser to the Aveeno after I read on WebMD that they felt it was the best facial cleanser for sensitive skin.  I tend to have mostly dry, though I get greasy in the T-zone, and sensitive skin.  It gets red, tight, and dry if I use harsh soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aveeno Active Naturals is a very mild and easy to use cleanser.  The foaming action feels good and creates a nice lather.  The best part is that it rinses off very easily and completely.  Which is a boon for dry sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only qualms I have about this cleanser is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the Neutrogena and the price is a bit high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... it&#x27;s expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the regular Aveeno face cleansing foam for a long time, as it is very gentle on my sensitive skin. Also, I have a tendency to blepharitis (granulated eyelashes) and my eye doctor told me to shampoo my eyelashes regularly. Aveeno cleanser is find for this as well. I did not know there was a special calming formula for rosacea until I ran across a magazine advertisement and, of course, I went online to see where I could find it. Bless Amazon, almost anything I want can be found here, and their delivery is always super quick. I love this product, it is creamier than the regular Aveeno foaming face cleanser, so I will stick with it. Whether or not it will actually calm the rosacea problem I do not know yet, so I only geve it four stars.</li>
            <li> Love it. My skin is clearly smoother and softened. I got it on sale in a supermarket for $5. It is better than the EL cleanser I got for about $20.</li>
            <li> I suffer from light rosacea, this is the best calming soap i have used , it significantly reduces the redness on my face. I will definitely purchasee again and again</li>
            <li> Best face wash ever.  It degreases my face, but doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.  Not much smell at all...no perfumes added, yet doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals either.  Good stuff.  Wish it was cheaper though... :/</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite Aveeno product.  The foam turns into a great lather and cleanses my skin without over drying (like a lot of foam cleansers). I have dry, sensitive skin with acne and this product line has helped keep my skin moisturized and has actually helped some with my breakouts.  I have tried all of the products from the ultra calming line and this face wash is by far the best.  Leaves me skin fresh, soft, and relieved.</li>
            <li> I just used this cleanser for the first time, and my face is really stinging and irritated.  I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser at night and it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all, but I don&#x27;t feel like it does the best job of cleaning my face and removing makeup.  This one seemed to remove make-up better, but my face feels very tight and uncomfortable.  It&#x27;s not so bad that I&#x27;m afraid to try it again, but so far it feels anything but soothing.</li>
            <li> So a relative of mine sells this product and this foam is fantastic. I have stopped using Dial soap and use this exclusively, as it has all natural products and no alcohol. The smell is great and my skin feels like it is really, really clean. At over age 50 you would think the acne (especially on the neck from shaving) would be gone, but this foaming cleanser has cleared up everything. Why did it take them so long to invent this?</li>
            <li> I recently tried the NEW Aveeno Calming face wash and it was GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Did NOT dry my skin out. The 6oz. is a little pricey though I think it should be either 7 or 8 oz for the price.</li>
            <li> This is great for sensitive skin.  It gets your face clean and removes makeup without dryness or irritation.</li>
            <li> A great product at a good price, fragrance free for sensitive skin.  It truly has calming properties in it.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and sensitive skin which this product promotes itself as being made for.  I gave it a clear shot but found it to be like washing with air - the foam did nothing for me.  Also, it barely washed my skin and left it oily and actually more irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use their Positively Radiant line and give it 5 plus stars.  It works miracles for my skin and the problems I have.  My comment here is that when you have problem skin different products work for different people.  If this one does not work for you don&#x27;t give up on Aveeno.  Try the Positively Radiant.  All their products are hypoallergenic and oil/soap free so just find the right one for you.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews on skincare products, this is the one I bought for my sensitive skin.  This is very gentle.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin from years of acne treatments. works very well without over drying my face. i also use there face lotion</li>
            <li> I really cannot say enough good things about this foaming cleanser.  You know how when you have rosacea and you just bend your head forward to splash water and your face turns red?  With this cleanser that doesn&#x27;t happen!  I use it morning and night and have done so for about a year.  It gets the makeup off and leaves nothing behind.  Follow it up with the Ultra Calming moisturizers - the day one has SPF15 and the night one is great for my dryness.  Rosacea is under control.  Not gone altogether- that would take IPL treatmetns but there is no new redness or bumps and my facial itching is a think of the past.  I&#x27;ve suffered with pretty bad rosacea for 10 years. I highly recommend Aveeno Ultra Calming cleanser and moisturizers.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this cleanser I was hooked.  It is so gentle on my skin and leaves my face feeling so clean and soft.  It even works great at washing my make up off without irritating.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily on my sensitive skin and it does not irritate at all. I use it together with the Ultra-Calming cream and it keeps my face fresh all day.</li>
            <li> im torn on this cleanser because on the one hand it is very calming and reduces the redness in my skin (not just temporarily, it really changes my skin with continued use) however i find this can be very drying (especially to my bf it made his skin peel terribly with a few uses) and i believe it either breaks me out, or doesnt clean very well at all, and i only use mineral powder makeup. there is no point in a drying cleanser that doesnt clean, so i probably will not ever repurchase this. maybe if i didnt have such an acne issue and only had redness issues.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice cleanser that is hard to find in stores.  My wife has been using this for years and is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Unlike 99% of face washes on the market this is non comodegenic. Many products that claim to be for acne have pore clogging ingredients in them. If you don&#x27;t believe me you can look up a list of comodegenic ingredients and you will be sure to find them in almost every cleanser &amp; moisturizer on the market. I had acne for years &amp; finally found how to clear it. I have oily skin, &amp; this cleanser is  gentle enough for me to use three times a day without drying my skin out. If you are prone to breakouts this cleanser&lt;br /&gt; is a must!</li>
            <li> This is a great product!! I have used it for years, it is all I use on my face. My face feels refreshed after using this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Upgrading my prior review from 4 to 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having both oily and sensitive skin, it can be a challenge finding a product that cleans well and is not an irritant. After using this product daily for a long time, my skin still responds well to this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE REGARDING PURCHASING:&lt;br /&gt;This product is listed as a &#x27;Prime&#x27; item sold by Amazon (as of today 11/7/2012). However, a shipping charge was applied when I went to check out. Will look for the item locally.</li>
            <li> great product. excellent handle</li>
            <li> I have written Aveeno praising them for creating such a fine product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have numerous autoimmune conditions and am allergic to everything.  My skin breaks out to most soaps (even ones that are for sensitive skin and perfume free.)  BUT, not to this product.  The \\&quot;Ultra Calming\\&quot; is the only line I have ever found that my skin can tolerate and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face, like acne cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I am left with some acne scars on my face from years of using and trying the wrong products, I&#x27;d like to say BRAVO to Aveeno for making this one.  I am having regular microdermabrasion treatments to help revive the skin that the other cleansers ruined and left scarred.  Aveeno, please notify me if this line is ever going to be discontinued so I can rent a warehouse and stock it full of this stuff to last the rest of my life.  I cannot live without it!  Only took me 15 years to find the right face products.</li>
            <li> I love easy to use products that work and this was is both. You just pump the foam out of the top; the product lasts a long time even though I use it everyday. What is best is my skin feels smoother after I wash my face with this. No reaction to this product even though I have rosacea.</li>
            <li> I like this product, keeps my hands from breaking out... Good stuff.  Antibacterial soaps and foams are too irritating..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sincerely</li>
