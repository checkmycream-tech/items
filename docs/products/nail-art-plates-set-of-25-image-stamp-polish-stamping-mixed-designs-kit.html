            <li>I was thrilled!</li>
            <li>I used Sally Hansen on a fairly detailed scorpion and that came out perfectly as well.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say that as a beginner, I loved it.  </li>
            <li>just that I need, so good, It&#x27;s a pleasure to do business whith them.</li>
            <li>When This Product Came I Loved</li>

            <li>LOVED IT BY</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>Alot of people say these arent good</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t just read the good reviews.</li>
            <li>All the reviews said that this wasn&#x27;t a good product because they came used.</li>
            <li>The designs look good on your nails.</li>
            <li>You can not get a good stamp out of the scratched images.</li>
            <li>But still a good product</li>
            <li>I use Konad special polish n comes out perfect stamps.</li>
            <li>very pleased :) thank you!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Every nail artist should love this!</li>
            <li>I love the images on the plates!</li>
            <li>They were each in their own plastic bag and each plate has a plastic film on it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 100% sure they will be just as good as Konad....</li>
            <li>I really liked this product..</li>
            <li>so glad i bought this a great price for so many designs.</li>
            <li>They work with any kind of polish you may have in your collection.</li>
            <li>I purchased these for a gift since I already have a set of my own.</li>
            <li>T^he plates function was good some better then others.  </li>
            <li>There are some nice plates with this set.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li>I really love my plates, there are so many designs that I love!!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!!</li>
            <li>but they are great fun!</li>
            <li>It was of great quality and it is the original Konad nail stamping kit.</li>
            <li>SO VERY EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li>the etching quality is pretty good!</li>
            <li>Thank you for a great fun product.</li>
            <li>These plates have great designs, work really well, and have so many options!</li>
            <li>Its a great deal for anyone who wants a nice variety of images for stamping.</li>
            <li>and she is loving the many many options for designs and sizes.</li>
            <li>I think if you have someone that likes their nails done, but isn&#x27;t super creative on their own, this may be a good gift choice for them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The plates I got are MASH they are not sharp at all and are etched perfectly.</li>
            <li>&quot;  If you go to this site [...] you&#x27;ll find that your m64 will match the Born Pretty plate, which apparently isn&#x27;t so great to use with stamping when you look at the pictures.  </li>
            <li>THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE VERY PRECISE</li>
            <li>They are a very cheap knock off of the konad brand plates.</li>
            <li>Over all great price and even a novice like me can have beautiful nails that look like I spent a fourtune at the salon.</li>
            <li>Really large designs, which is great -</li>
            <li>I do love Konad too tho.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>i love the plates.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure they were safe for my niece before I gave them to her.</li>
            <li>It works much better and doesnt scratch the plates at all.</li>
            <li>all in all this is the set to buy if you want more for your money.</li>
            <li>the best one I found was by DandyNails called \\&quot;Using Regular Polish for Konad/Bundle Monster Stamping\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Love it and since i have them in my hands have not stop changing my nail color and design.</li>
            <li>I was amazed by the process, but just couldn&#x27;t fathom paying the hefty price tag when I was sure there would be alternates.  </li>
            <li>Save your sanity and get a better product.</li>
            <li>I just got these, and they are okay.</li>
            <li>so when you scrape off the excess, you remove most of the nail polish in the design.</li>
            <li>Most discs I found are $5 each.</li>
            <li>omg i love my image plates.</li>
            <li>It has a lot of designs from the boundle monster plates they are soooo cute</li>
            <li>Its like konad but better and cheaper.</li>
            <li>they arrived scratched and most of then did not have the plastic protecting film</li>
            <li>OK SO I BOUGHT THIS</li>
            <li>Great to have came as described and fast shipping</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>could of had better images.</li>
            <li>but considering the price and how may are good prints it was worth the investment</li>
            <li>WEll, it is okay â€¦</li>
            <li>if I had more time to do my nails I may use it.</li>
            <li>I love what she received.</li>
            <li>I love how there is holiday stamps too.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and a great product with seals on each to protect each engraving.</li>
            <li>These are great - so many plates for the money, and the Konad system works really well.  </li>
            <li>They are all perfect and if anything some of the tip images are too big!</li>
            <li>I love all the designs and</li>
            <li>Overall great product for the price!!</li>
            <li>This has way more designs than I could use.  </li>
            <li>So they are workable, but I am not in love with them.  </li>
            <li>I love bows.</li>
            <li>surely recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I played with them at home and love it.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s there :)</li>
            <li>She love it.</li>
            <li>I love it on her.</li>
            <li>maybe KONAD are better for me.</li>
            <li>They are so detailed and fancy!</li>
            <li>These plates are so cute.</li>
            <li>Hoping to get more patterns for my budget</li>
            <li>Next we tried some patterns off the two Konad brand plates which worked flawlessly</li>
            <li>The plates have a lot of cute usable pics on them.</li>
            <li>These stamp plates are so cool, they have a TON of designs and I absolutely love them!</li>
            <li>A great new start to my collection of plates!</li>
            <li>but besides that the sheets look nice and clean.</li>
            <li>I would have liked some Holiday stamps  designs and a pen to clean the plates.</li>
            <li>both came very fast and in good condition.</li>
            <li>The Plates Work Pretty Good.</li>
            <li>bottom line if your willing to work on it and spend a good amount of time on it this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m EXCITED !</li>
            <li>Worth It!!</li>
            <li>Shipping wasnt bad,i love how they make decorating nails so easy.</li>
            <li>It was just like it was described, more than i tought it would be and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I bought these thinking that it was such a great deal, so many templates so many choices.</li>
            <li>Either way... best 10 bucks ever spent.</li>
            <li>They are cute but wish it had more full nail designs.  </li>
            <li>These stamping plates are too cute; the designs are fun!</li>
            <li>With a bit of practice, you can have some really cool designs!</li>
            <li>I love all the different designs and they were a great deal for all the plates you get.</li>
            <li>They are not as easy to use as she thought they would be.  </li>
            <li>It was okay, all the prints are great, but these are bigger then the rest of the plates that come with the stamping kit</li>
            <li>Anyway they&#x27;re perfectly fine and came about 3 days after I ordered them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a huge variety of stamps on these and although I&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used them all yet.</li>
            <li>They r really cute n worth buying.   </li>
            <li>It took a while and a lot of different types of nail polish to get the results that I&#x27;m proud to show off.  </li>
            <li>It was a huge waist of money and the designs arnt even that detailed.</li>
            <li>Great inexpensive present.</li>
            <li>I so love this product, its taking me some time to get the hang of it, but its so much fun to use,</li>
            <li>This product is a cheap knock off of Konad, you may get a lot of plates</li>
            <li>Stamp design on nail smoothly</li>
            <li>These are definitely not Konad, but the majority of them worked great for me.</li>
            <li>Ok there are so many things I can say about these plates, let&#x27;s see how much I can get in without getting too frustrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mom loved these, she is a nail tech and we ordered this for her use on her clientele, wow.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super easy.</li>
            <li>quick n easy.</li>
            <li>I can use the stamp and get perfect images, the edges aren&#x27;t sharp, they came fast!</li>
            <li>My daughter and I were so excited when the plates arrived.</li>
            <li>Lots of fun doing nail art!</li>
            <li>They are worth the investment!</li>
            <li>They kind of looked scratched but there was a film that peeled off leaving a brand new product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad to have purchased this set first because it really forces you to master the technique.  </li>
            <li>it seems fun and easy to use..  </li>
            <li>TO CLEAN</li>
            <li>as many french tips image are a nice size to.</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s way more useful ones than none useful ones.</li>
            <li>But u still need special nail polish for stamping.   </li>
            <li>The only major drawback is that u don&#x27;t get to pick your own plates out, but that was ok with me because I still loved my plates;) brand of plates: MASH</li>
            <li>I held some of the full nail designs to my thumb and they seem alright, though I haven&#x27;t tried any yet.  </li>
            <li>But this is where I learned to overlap the full nail images</li>
            <li>PProduct was good with the plates i will definitely recommended to everyone for their purpose use on nails has too imagines</li>
            <li>I am so glad I didn&#x27;t spend much on these.  </li>
            <li>i choose this rating because i love this item, seller delivery fast.</li>
            <li>Works great with the Konad polish but also works well with other brands like Sally Hansen Insta</li>
            <li>the plates came fairly quick in the mail.</li>
            <li>ok ok ONE plate worked and its the only one i use.</li>
            <li>I use \\&quot;Wet N Wild\\&quot; \\&quot;Pure Ice\\&quot; and even those cheap \\&quot;LA Nail Art\\&quot; polishes and have great designs.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten many compliments and have started a new trend at work.</li>
            <li>The you tube promos are very deceiving!!</li>
            <li>Copyright infringement, stolen intellectual property.  </li>
            <li>even my bf said it was pretty cool after I showed him my nails.</li>
            <li>I have had so much fun with these plates</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>This took a while for the product to arrive but it was worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>but it was still fun to play with.</li>
            <li>What fun we ladies had.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>So much fun.</li>
            <li>Worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li>I received the plates within 2 days, so super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Some plates may have some prints that are not shallow enough to get a good print</li>
            <li>so they dont sit into the frame right, and when you scrap it moves.</li>
            <li>and yes shes right</li>
            <li>She always seem to pick the right design for her nails.</li>
            <li>The full images will not even fit on my adult thumb all the way.  </li>
            <li>In terms of generics--I recommend BUNDLE MONSTER&#x27;s 25PC set which have large, full images.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not sure why the seller would cut the brand name off the packaging unless she stole them, lol.  </li>
            <li>Definitely recommend to anyone who has a nail art stamper and wants more plates!</li>
            <li>I think we (costumers) should be completely honest about our purchases so we can select the companies which provide a good service avoiding us of having trouble in the future.</li>
            <li>I say drop a little more money for better quality.  </li>
            <li>bonus was the super fast shipping, i literally ordered yesterday morning</li>
            <li>You most definitely get your monies worth.</li>
            <li>Just kind of bummed out that I already have these plates and no new nail art for me.</li>
            <li>This is obviously the better deal being $10 cheaper.</li>
            <li>You will have to peal that off first before using.</li>
            <li>The plates were individually wrapped and there are so many designs.</li>
            <li>I checked the cardigan design first and it looks nothing like the \\&quot;non-Konad\\&quot; picture.  </li>
            <li>Of course they arent going to be perfectly an exact match for this price.</li>
            <li>And I eventually got the hang of stamping after a few hours and was able to use REGULAR nail polish to get good results for my first time.</li>
            <li>the whole process takes some practice but the outcome is well worth it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m actually having more problems with that set than this one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my 24 plates, but I do think that was quite rude to dismiss me like that.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>You can do so many different designs with this</li>
            <li>my daughter didn&#x27;t realize that at first and thought they didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>thanks alot tho!</li>
            <li>He shipping for this item is incredibly fast!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try stamping on a budget!</li>
            <li>Other than that the designs were pretty and nice.</li>
            <li>some of the patterns are too large but overall pleased with the purchase</li>
            <li>But either way i am only 12 and the large prints didnt fit on my thumbs!</li>
            <li>Super simple to use and clean</li>
            <li>I then received a set of replacement plates and not only did they arrive within 2 days, they were in perfect condition and also came with a little more variety of patterns than the previous plates.</li>
            <li>I first used them with the clear plastic sticker on the face and wondered why it wasn&#x27;t working and getting scratched!!!</li>
            <li>Like some other people I did only get 24 plates (unless there are two stuck together that I haven&#x27;t discovered yet), but overall I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>SURE you peel the clear plastic off the disc (that you can barely see/feel).</li>
            <li>The images that are supposed to fit over your whole nail fit about half of it.</li>
            <li>I have a very high suspicion that the brand name is \\&quot;Born Pretty.\\</li>
            <li>Also, I have learned that applying your first coat, then using Seche Vite top coat, which is fast-drying, will allow you to not only be able to stamp a freshly painted nail, but will allow you to mess up on the stamping a couple of times before you actually damage your first coat.  </li>
            <li>My \\&quot;Not likely to use\\&quot; pile was huge.</li>
            <li>The images transfer really well</li>
            <li>I have contacted \\&quot;xxkara17xx\\&quot; about the plate, but she hasn&#x27;t really responded and basically cut off communication when I asked about it again.  </li>
            <li>i bought these as a gift and was very embarrassed that they don&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li>I was very agervated.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to any woman that wants to save money on designs for the nails.</li>
            <li>oh and fast shipping</li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars because I received them fast.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery, product as described.  </li>
            <li>She really does not use them much.</li>
            <li>The plates themselves are also much thinner that the Konad plates and all of these plates had surface scratches on them when they arrived.  </li>
            <li>Hahaha.</li>
            <li>My nails look professionally done!!!</li>
            <li>Sure, some of the designs are a bit hard to make out, and not all of the full nail images cover the nail.  </li>
            <li>The key with all stamping is to use the special Konad polish.</li>
            <li>These came packaged and brand new!  </li>
            <li>Overall, great for a beginner, or at least from a beginner&#x27;s point of view.  </li>
            <li>Most of the designs are not cute or pretty, and some of them don&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li>what i didnt like from this specific seller was that i orderd both the  sheets and the stamp set at the same time and stamp set took 4 more days to be delivered.</li>
            <li>Worked for hours and got one decent stamp.</li>
            <li>Before use, peel off the tight protective plastic film on top of each plate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Little girls and woman of all ages will love this item.forget</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say run out and buy all the Konad ones but pay a little more for Bundle Monster or Winstonia.</li>
            <li>No hitches in the process, order, smile at the door shortly after, and then play away!!!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s used them more than a few times.  </li>
            <li>There were a few designs that had some deep scratches in them (looked like a machining error) but honestly the patterns weren&#x27;t something I would really miss anyway.</li>
            <li>However, they were brand new.</li>
            <li>At first I was very skeptical about buying these, as some of the reviews were not that great.</li>
            <li>That is, the image is very clearly defined on my plate.  </li>
            <li>this is the same exact set you get from bundle monster.</li>
            <li>These plates are basically the same as Konad&#x27;s but SHRUNKEN in size, most noticeable on the \\&quot;full\\&quot; nail designs and french tips--they do not cover the entire nail.  </li>
            <li>, it sliced my index finger and pretty deep at that.  </li>
            <li>I bought these nearly 2 years ago and I still use them to this day!</li>
            <li>only difficulty is putting the images on my nails straight (user problem, not the product!</li>
            <li>The prints are bigger than most of the other brands I&#x27;ve bought before.</li>
            <li>They are okay plates sometimes they seem like they arent deep enough to hold enough polish to transfer to the stamper.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try these templates but the designs are not deep enough to show up on your nail.</li>
            <li>hold the card at a 30 degree angle or less and apply light pressure as you glide across the plate.</li>
            <li>I did not have to use Konad polish, I used Wet &amp; Wild on a fairly intricate french tip design and it came out clear and was big enough for all of my nails.  </li>
            <li>but I sort of just want a large lone simple one.</li>
            <li>I was in love with the designs, but wish it were a little bit bigger.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get my new plates and ripped into a few of them to try them out.  </li>
            <li>When I received them, they were in clear packages that had the brand name cut off each one.  </li>
            <li>But just remember to take the CLEAR plastic off before you try them.</li>
            <li>After getting the plates I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this set to anyone...except maybe an overly proficient 9 year old.  </li>
            <li>I recommend using an old gift card or credit card or something like that as a scraper instead of the metal ones you can buy.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my 12 year old niece</li>
            <li>or if she may just have been to young for them.</li>
            <li>I did not like that item, they sent the old set and reused don&#x27;t have the plastic cover ,all of them scratch can use.</li>
            <li>I have seriously spent an hour trying to get an image to stamp right</li>
            <li>We repeatedly tried several patterns on different plates from this set first none of which worked.  </li>
            <li>I went back and opened more of them and figured out that not all of them are shallow and used a different polish and they seemed to work a little better.  </li>
            <li>I ain&#x27;t useful for me, but it is on my little 22 years old sister.</li>
            <li>Needless to say they absolutely made me a satisfied customer</li>
            <li>Closer inspection revealed the grooves are much too shallow to hold adequate polish after scraping the excess off these plates.  </li>
            <li>I emailed the seller, xxkara17xx, but decided not to ship them back because I would lose the $10 bucks I paid for the product due to the fact that I would not recuperate the original shipping costs and also I would have to pay to ship them back, even though they are defective.    </li>
            <li>First when i got them i accually cut myself on the sharp edges.</li>
            <li>For the price it is definitely worth a little sanding</li>
            <li>Most if not all of the designs are so shallow that they do not transfer properly to your nail if they do at all.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, both me and my friend bought this and don&#x27;t have to go to the salon no more!!!!</li>
            <li>She has a big dance coming up and can&#x27;t afford a professional manicure.</li>
            <li>When we saw these, we thought we&#x27;d struck gold, but the truth is, they are shipped directly from China (timely, though) and they must be rejects from a different source.</li>
            <li>Naturally you want some designs to flip both ways for the proper direction on both hands.</li>
            <li>kind of weird</li>
            <li>There are a few images I&#x27;m not sure what they are, but the sheer number of designs kind of makes up for that.  </li>
            <li>The images do not come out as clean and sharp consistently with each plate, the etchings aren&#x27;t as deep with each plate compared to Konad, so it can be frustrating to repeatedly try, try, and try again to make a decent image come out, even if you have experience and practice using such products.    </li>
            <li>and if you are having trouble stamping I just searched \\&quot;how to stamp nails\\&quot; on youtube and watched a few videos to help me get a better understanding on how to do it.</li>
            <li>they are now very smooth and highly unlikely to cut anyone.</li>
            <li>the key is to not remove too much or too little of the polish.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> Alot of people say these arent good</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t just read the good reviews.</li>
            <li> All the reviews said that this wasn&#x27;t a good product because they came used.</li>
            <li> The designs look good on your nails.</li>
            <li> You can not get a good stamp out of the scratched images.</li>
            <li> But still a good product</li>
            <li> I use Konad special polish n comes out perfect stamps.</li>
            <li> very pleased :) thank you!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Every nail artist should love this!</li>
            <li> I love the images on the plates!</li>
            <li> They were each in their own plastic bag and each plate has a plastic film on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% sure they will be just as good as Konad....</li>
            <li> I really liked this product..</li>
            <li> so glad i bought this a great price for so many designs.</li>
            <li> They work with any kind of polish you may have in your collection.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for a gift since I already have a set of my own.</li>
            <li> T^he plates function was good some better then others.  </li>
            <li> There are some nice plates with this set.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> I really love my plates, there are so many designs that I love!!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!</li>
            <li> but they are great fun!</li>
            <li> It was of great quality and it is the original Konad nail stamping kit.</li>
            <li> SO VERY EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li> the etching quality is pretty good!</li>
            <li> Thank you for a great fun product.</li>
            <li> These plates have great designs, work really well, and have so many options!</li>
            <li> Its a great deal for anyone who wants a nice variety of images for stamping.</li>
            <li> and she is loving the many many options for designs and sizes.</li>
            <li> I think if you have someone that likes their nails done, but isn&#x27;t super creative on their own, this may be a good gift choice for them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The plates I got are MASH they are not sharp at all and are etched perfectly.</li>
            <li> &quot;  If you go to this site [...] you&#x27;ll find that your m64 will match the Born Pretty plate, which apparently isn&#x27;t so great to use with stamping when you look at the pictures.  </li>
            <li> THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE VERY PRECISE</li>
            <li> They are a very cheap knock off of the konad brand plates.</li>
            <li> Over all great price and even a novice like me can have beautiful nails that look like I spent a fourtune at the salon.</li>
            <li> Really large designs, which is great -</li>
            <li> I do love Konad too tho.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> i love the plates.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure they were safe for my niece before I gave them to her.</li>
            <li> It works much better and doesnt scratch the plates at all.</li>
            <li> all in all this is the set to buy if you want more for your money.</li>
            <li> the best one I found was by DandyNails called \\&quot;Using Regular Polish for Konad/Bundle Monster Stamping\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Love it and since i have them in my hands have not stop changing my nail color and design.</li>
            <li> I was amazed by the process, but just couldn&#x27;t fathom paying the hefty price tag when I was sure there would be alternates.  </li>
            <li> Save your sanity and get a better product.</li>
            <li> I just got these, and they are okay.</li>
            <li> so when you scrape off the excess, you remove most of the nail polish in the design.</li>
            <li> Most discs I found are $5 each.</li>
            <li> omg i love my image plates.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of designs from the boundle monster plates they are soooo cute</li>
            <li> Its like konad but better and cheaper.</li>
            <li> they arrived scratched and most of then did not have the plastic protecting film</li>
            <li> OK SO I BOUGHT THIS</li>
            <li> Great to have came as described and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> could of had better images.</li>
            <li> but considering the price and how may are good prints it was worth the investment</li>
            <li> WEll, it is okay â€¦</li>
            <li> if I had more time to do my nails I may use it.</li>
            <li> I love what she received.</li>
            <li> I love how there is holiday stamps too.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and a great product with seals on each to protect each engraving.</li>
            <li> These are great - so many plates for the money, and the Konad system works really well.  </li>
            <li> They are all perfect and if anything some of the tip images are too big!</li>
            <li> I love all the designs and</li>
            <li> Overall great product for the price!!</li>
            <li> This has way more designs than I could use.  </li>
            <li> So they are workable, but I am not in love with them.  </li>
            <li> I love bows.</li>
            <li> surely recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I played with them at home and love it.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s there :)</li>
            <li> She love it.</li>
            <li> I love it on her.</li>
            <li> maybe KONAD are better for me.</li>
            <li> They are so detailed and fancy!</li>
            <li> These plates are so cute.</li>
            <li> Hoping to get more patterns for my budget</li>
            <li> Next we tried some patterns off the two Konad brand plates which worked flawlessly</li>
            <li> The plates have a lot of cute usable pics on them.</li>
            <li> These stamp plates are so cool, they have a TON of designs and I absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> A great new start to my collection of plates!</li>
            <li> but besides that the sheets look nice and clean.</li>
            <li> I would have liked some Holiday stamps  designs and a pen to clean the plates.</li>
            <li> both came very fast and in good condition.</li>
            <li> The Plates Work Pretty Good.</li>
            <li> bottom line if your willing to work on it and spend a good amount of time on it this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m EXCITED !</li>
            <li> Worth It!!</li>
            <li> Shipping wasnt bad,i love how they make decorating nails so easy.</li>
            <li> It was just like it was described, more than i tought it would be and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking that it was such a great deal, so many templates so many choices.</li>
            <li> Either way... best 10 bucks ever spent.</li>
            <li> They are cute but wish it had more full nail designs.  </li>
            <li> These stamping plates are too cute; the designs are fun!</li>
            <li> With a bit of practice, you can have some really cool designs!</li>
            <li> I love all the different designs and they were a great deal for all the plates you get.</li>
            <li> They are not as easy to use as she thought they would be.  </li>
            <li> It was okay, all the prints are great, but these are bigger then the rest of the plates that come with the stamping kit</li>
            <li> Anyway they&#x27;re perfectly fine and came about 3 days after I ordered them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a huge variety of stamps on these and although I&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used them all yet.</li>
            <li> They r really cute n worth buying.   </li>
            <li> It took a while and a lot of different types of nail polish to get the results that I&#x27;m proud to show off.  </li>
            <li> It was a huge waist of money and the designs arnt even that detailed.</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive present.</li>
            <li> I so love this product, its taking me some time to get the hang of it, but its so much fun to use,</li>
            <li> This product is a cheap knock off of Konad, you may get a lot of plates</li>
            <li> Stamp design on nail smoothly</li>
            <li> These are definitely not Konad, but the majority of them worked great for me.</li>
            <li> Ok there are so many things I can say about these plates, let&#x27;s see how much I can get in without getting too frustrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mom loved these, she is a nail tech and we ordered this for her use on her clientele, wow.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super easy.</li>
            <li> quick n easy.</li>
            <li> I can use the stamp and get perfect images, the edges aren&#x27;t sharp, they came fast!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I were so excited when the plates arrived.</li>
            <li> Lots of fun doing nail art!</li>
            <li> They are worth the investment!</li>
            <li> They kind of looked scratched but there was a film that peeled off leaving a brand new product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad to have purchased this set first because it really forces you to master the technique.  </li>
            <li> it seems fun and easy to use..  </li>
            <li> TO CLEAN</li>
            <li> as many french tips image are a nice size to.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s way more useful ones than none useful ones.</li>
            <li> But u still need special nail polish for stamping.   </li>
            <li> The only major drawback is that u don&#x27;t get to pick your own plates out, but that was ok with me because I still loved my plates;) brand of plates: MASH</li>
            <li> I held some of the full nail designs to my thumb and they seem alright, though I haven&#x27;t tried any yet.  </li>
            <li> But this is where I learned to overlap the full nail images</li>
            <li> PProduct was good with the plates i will definitely recommended to everyone for their purpose use on nails has too imagines</li>
            <li> I am so glad I didn&#x27;t spend much on these.  </li>
            <li> i choose this rating because i love this item, seller delivery fast.</li>
            <li> Works great with the Konad polish but also works well with other brands like Sally Hansen Insta</li>
            <li> the plates came fairly quick in the mail.</li>
            <li> ok ok ONE plate worked and its the only one i use.</li>
            <li> I use \\&quot;Wet N Wild\\&quot; \\&quot;Pure Ice\\&quot; and even those cheap \\&quot;LA Nail Art\\&quot; polishes and have great designs.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten many compliments and have started a new trend at work.</li>
            <li> The you tube promos are very deceiving!!</li>
            <li> Copyright infringement, stolen intellectual property.  </li>
            <li> even my bf said it was pretty cool after I showed him my nails.</li>
            <li> I have had so much fun with these plates</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> This took a while for the product to arrive but it was worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> but it was still fun to play with.</li>
            <li> What fun we ladies had.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> So much fun.</li>
            <li> Worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I received the plates within 2 days, so super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Some plates may have some prints that are not shallow enough to get a good print</li>
            <li> so they dont sit into the frame right, and when you scrap it moves.</li>
            <li> and yes shes right</li>
            <li> She always seem to pick the right design for her nails.</li>
            <li> The full images will not even fit on my adult thumb all the way.  </li>
            <li> In terms of generics--I recommend BUNDLE MONSTER&#x27;s 25PC set which have large, full images.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure why the seller would cut the brand name off the packaging unless she stole them, lol.  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommend to anyone who has a nail art stamper and wants more plates!</li>
            <li> I think we (costumers) should be completely honest about our purchases so we can select the companies which provide a good service avoiding us of having trouble in the future.</li>
            <li> I say drop a little more money for better quality.  </li>
            <li> bonus was the super fast shipping, i literally ordered yesterday morning</li>
            <li> You most definitely get your monies worth.</li>
            <li> Just kind of bummed out that I already have these plates and no new nail art for me.</li>
            <li> This is obviously the better deal being $10 cheaper.</li>
            <li> You will have to peal that off first before using.</li>
            <li> The plates were individually wrapped and there are so many designs.</li>
            <li> I checked the cardigan design first and it looks nothing like the \\&quot;non-Konad\\&quot; picture.  </li>
            <li> Of course they arent going to be perfectly an exact match for this price.</li>
            <li> And I eventually got the hang of stamping after a few hours and was able to use REGULAR nail polish to get good results for my first time.</li>
            <li> the whole process takes some practice but the outcome is well worth it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m actually having more problems with that set than this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my 24 plates, but I do think that was quite rude to dismiss me like that.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> You can do so many different designs with this</li>
            <li> my daughter didn&#x27;t realize that at first and thought they didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> thanks alot tho!</li>
            <li> He shipping for this item is incredibly fast!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try stamping on a budget!</li>
            <li> Other than that the designs were pretty and nice.</li>
            <li> some of the patterns are too large but overall pleased with the purchase</li>
            <li> But either way i am only 12 and the large prints didnt fit on my thumbs!</li>
            <li> Super simple to use and clean</li>
            <li> I then received a set of replacement plates and not only did they arrive within 2 days, they were in perfect condition and also came with a little more variety of patterns than the previous plates.</li>
            <li> I first used them with the clear plastic sticker on the face and wondered why it wasn&#x27;t working and getting scratched!!!</li>
            <li> Like some other people I did only get 24 plates (unless there are two stuck together that I haven&#x27;t discovered yet), but overall I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> SURE you peel the clear plastic off the disc (that you can barely see/feel).</li>
            <li> The images that are supposed to fit over your whole nail fit about half of it.</li>
            <li> I have a very high suspicion that the brand name is \\&quot;Born Pretty.\\</li>
            <li> Also, I have learned that applying your first coat, then using Seche Vite top coat, which is fast-drying, will allow you to not only be able to stamp a freshly painted nail, but will allow you to mess up on the stamping a couple of times before you actually damage your first coat.  </li>
            <li> My \\&quot;Not likely to use\\&quot; pile was huge.</li>
            <li> The images transfer really well</li>
            <li> I have contacted \\&quot;xxkara17xx\\&quot; about the plate, but she hasn&#x27;t really responded and basically cut off communication when I asked about it again.  </li>
            <li> i bought these as a gift and was very embarrassed that they don&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li> I was very agervated.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any woman that wants to save money on designs for the nails.</li>
            <li> oh and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars because I received them fast.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery, product as described.  </li>
            <li> She really does not use them much.</li>
            <li> The plates themselves are also much thinner that the Konad plates and all of these plates had surface scratches on them when they arrived.  </li>
            <li> Hahaha.</li>
            <li> My nails look professionally done!!!</li>
            <li> Sure, some of the designs are a bit hard to make out, and not all of the full nail images cover the nail.  </li>
            <li> The key with all stamping is to use the special Konad polish.</li>
            <li> These came packaged and brand new!  </li>
            <li> Overall, great for a beginner, or at least from a beginner&#x27;s point of view.  </li>
            <li> Most of the designs are not cute or pretty, and some of them don&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li> what i didnt like from this specific seller was that i orderd both the  sheets and the stamp set at the same time and stamp set took 4 more days to be delivered.</li>
            <li> Worked for hours and got one decent stamp.</li>
            <li> Before use, peel off the tight protective plastic film on top of each plate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Little girls and woman of all ages will love this item.forget</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say run out and buy all the Konad ones but pay a little more for Bundle Monster or Winstonia.</li>
            <li> No hitches in the process, order, smile at the door shortly after, and then play away!!!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s used them more than a few times.  </li>
            <li> There were a few designs that had some deep scratches in them (looked like a machining error) but honestly the patterns weren&#x27;t something I would really miss anyway.</li>
            <li> However, they were brand new.</li>
            <li> At first I was very skeptical about buying these, as some of the reviews were not that great.</li>
            <li> That is, the image is very clearly defined on my plate.  </li>
            <li> this is the same exact set you get from bundle monster.</li>
            <li> These plates are basically the same as Konad&#x27;s but SHRUNKEN in size, most noticeable on the \\&quot;full\\&quot; nail designs and french tips--they do not cover the entire nail.  </li>
            <li> , it sliced my index finger and pretty deep at that.  </li>
            <li> I bought these nearly 2 years ago and I still use them to this day!</li>
            <li> only difficulty is putting the images on my nails straight (user problem, not the product!</li>
            <li> The prints are bigger than most of the other brands I&#x27;ve bought before.</li>
            <li> They are okay plates sometimes they seem like they arent deep enough to hold enough polish to transfer to the stamper.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try these templates but the designs are not deep enough to show up on your nail.</li>
            <li> hold the card at a 30 degree angle or less and apply light pressure as you glide across the plate.</li>
            <li> I did not have to use Konad polish, I used Wet &amp; Wild on a fairly intricate french tip design and it came out clear and was big enough for all of my nails.  </li>
            <li> but I sort of just want a large lone simple one.</li>
            <li> I was in love with the designs, but wish it were a little bit bigger.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my new plates and ripped into a few of them to try them out.  </li>
            <li> When I received them, they were in clear packages that had the brand name cut off each one.  </li>
            <li> But just remember to take the CLEAR plastic off before you try them.</li>
            <li> After getting the plates I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this set to anyone...except maybe an overly proficient 9 year old.  </li>
            <li> I recommend using an old gift card or credit card or something like that as a scraper instead of the metal ones you can buy.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 12 year old niece</li>
            <li> or if she may just have been to young for them.</li>
            <li> I did not like that item, they sent the old set and reused don&#x27;t have the plastic cover ,all of them scratch can use.</li>
            <li> I have seriously spent an hour trying to get an image to stamp right</li>
            <li> We repeatedly tried several patterns on different plates from this set first none of which worked.  </li>
            <li> I went back and opened more of them and figured out that not all of them are shallow and used a different polish and they seemed to work a little better.  </li>
            <li> I ain&#x27;t useful for me, but it is on my little 22 years old sister.</li>
            <li> Needless to say they absolutely made me a satisfied customer</li>
            <li> Closer inspection revealed the grooves are much too shallow to hold adequate polish after scraping the excess off these plates.  </li>
            <li> I emailed the seller, xxkara17xx, but decided not to ship them back because I would lose the $10 bucks I paid for the product due to the fact that I would not recuperate the original shipping costs and also I would have to pay to ship them back, even though they are defective.    </li>
            <li> First when i got them i accually cut myself on the sharp edges.</li>
            <li> For the price it is definitely worth a little sanding</li>
            <li> Most if not all of the designs are so shallow that they do not transfer properly to your nail if they do at all.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, both me and my friend bought this and don&#x27;t have to go to the salon no more!!!!</li>
            <li> She has a big dance coming up and can&#x27;t afford a professional manicure.</li>
            <li> When we saw these, we thought we&#x27;d struck gold, but the truth is, they are shipped directly from China (timely, though) and they must be rejects from a different source.</li>
            <li> Naturally you want some designs to flip both ways for the proper direction on both hands.</li>
            <li> kind of weird</li>
            <li> There are a few images I&#x27;m not sure what they are, but the sheer number of designs kind of makes up for that.  </li>
            <li> The images do not come out as clean and sharp consistently with each plate, the etchings aren&#x27;t as deep with each plate compared to Konad, so it can be frustrating to repeatedly try, try, and try again to make a decent image come out, even if you have experience and practice using such products.    </li>
            <li> and if you are having trouble stamping I just searched \\&quot;how to stamp nails\\&quot; on youtube and watched a few videos to help me get a better understanding on how to do it.</li>
            <li> they are now very smooth and highly unlikely to cut anyone.</li>
            <li> the key is to not remove too much or too little of the polish.</li>
            <li> (I know 13 year old girls with bigger hands than me), so they DO cover my other nails EXCEPT my thumbs.    </li>
            <li> After reading reading some of the more negative reviews for this product, I was a bit anxious about what I&#x27;d be receiving.</li>
            <li> So I watched a few tutorials on new plate trials and went back and tried them again.  </li>
            <li> Then, as I was looking thru each one carefully, I set them in two piles: \\&quot;likely to use\\&quot; and \\&quot;not likely to use\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I solved the sharp edges by taking some sanding paper and sanding the very outer edge a little.</li>
            <li> Also, I do not own one bottle of the \\&quot;special\\&quot; Konad polish and I won&#x27;t because a nice thick nail polish will do the trick for a lot less.  </li>
            <li> About 8 or 9 plates were definitely too too small for adult nails or even tweens for that matter--and I have XS hands</li>
            <li> Dry - basically, thick and gloppy polish works well, and ones that are really saturated with color.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s a difference in manufacturing, but my outside edges are not all that sharp.  </li>
            <li> Its not blue like other ones which is why she maynot have noticed it was plastic on it</li>
            <li> It sounds like it is tedious and takes a long time, but it goes fairly quick.  </li>
            <li> I also am not sure which set of plates I have because it seems like everyone pretty much got random sets.  </li>
            <li> These are MASH plates 1-25, they all come individually wrapped and they have the paper backing so they are not that sharp!</li>
            <li> I should have counted them when I first bought them, but silly me, I actually put trust into my purchase.  </li>
            <li> , the plates are really small, especially with the \\&quot;full\\&quot; nail designs, they only cover my pinky, it didn&#x27;t cover the rest of my nails.  </li>
            <li> The designs are not etched in deep enough and the images are all hard to make out.</li>
            <li> But, with only two hands, I hardly see why its necessary for one design to show up three times.</li>
            <li> The seller was great but the product is horrible.  </li>
            <li> What  i expected i get it.</li>
            <li> Iimages wont transfer over to the pink stamper.</li>
            <li> These are DANGEROUS plates and if young girls are going to use them, they can really get hurt and cut from the sharp edges.  </li>
            <li> I had already expected the sharp edges from the research i had done looking for cheaper sets.</li>
            <li> Also, I have not cut myself with these so-called \\&quot;razor sharp\\&quot; edges because they are not that sharp unless you&#x27;re trying to juggle with them.  </li>
            <li> The biggest disappointment for me was the full nail argyle design.  </li>
            <li> The metal plates themselves seem thinner compared to Konad plates and the edges are surprisingly sharp.  </li>
            <li> Metal was sharp on the edges</li>
            <li> They are seriously sharp.</li>
            <li> will want to try other ones</li>
            <li> which is why i only gave three stars because im not completely sure of how &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; they are.</li>
            <li> I bought the basic starter package of Konad Nail Art at the mall that came with two plates, but the additional plates at the mall seemed excessively overpriced.  </li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE if the seller does not show actual, clear images of the plates or fails to describe them at all...   </li>
            <li> When i received the plates they not only were late</li>
            <li> have only used a few times in the past 2 years</li>
            <li> The designs are fairly small whilch is a problem for me because i have long nails</li>
            <li> but it is not worth it to buy these at all.</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH IT</li>
            <li> its really hard finding a set that isn&#x27;t super expensive too, so i lucked out finding these.</li>
            <li> but it takes a while to get the technique down.  </li>
            <li> The possibilities are endless!</li>
            <li> These are SO SHARP!</li>
            <li> did not work well and the edges are really sharp!</li>
            <li> and you seriously cannot tell if you practice enough.  </li>
            <li> If I could find out the brand name of these plates, maybe I could figure out which one is missing, or at least try to buy some different designs.  </li>
            <li> The etching in the plates is not deep enough to transfer an image they are completely useless.</li>
            <li> The designs seem a tad bit shallow and some are not etched properly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve quite long nails, a few small designs, a balance of floral, geometric, and abstract designs.</li>
            <li> Not some of them, because that would slightly be excusable, but all of them had scratches on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And there are no full nail designs in the packages I received...</li>
            <li> The designs are too shallow to do anything with, 60% of the alaphabet is missing from the set, and some of the designs are on here several times.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lacey pattern that has teeny little bows through it</li>
            <li> The thin lines of the pattern just aren&#x27;t there on half the design so you end up with a big blob at the bottom of the nail.  </li>
            <li> not very many choice images</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very satisfied with the images and will buying another set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this set for a few months now</li>
            <li> I should have posted all of my nail designs, but I change them everyday with all of the plates I&#x27;m buying.  </li>
            <li> I bought these trying to save a few bucks in replace of the Konad or Monster Bundle plates</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> There are a few that I have no idea what they are.</li>
            <li> I received these plates and was missing M63.</li>
            <li> Its been 2 weeks now and still have not received the missing plates.</li>
            <li> However, I no longer feel like I wasted my money on them.</li>
            <li> When you look at the customer photos theres a few by a girl named sarah</li>
            <li> After trying many designs over and over again I became very frustrated and regret buying these plates.</li>
            <li> Just a couple of the designs are unidentifiable while a handful of others are just plain etched incorrectly.  </li>
            <li> I took a look at all of them and all the images are so shallow and blurred due to the small size of them.  </li>
            <li> Now, the issue could be that the stamp plates are sub par, could be that the nailpolish is sub par, but either way the images are far too shallow to use, thus rendering the set useless.</li>
            <li> Actually, I am not sure I would.</li>
            <li> Using the scraper, scrape off the excessive nail polish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t cover my expectations :/</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Just buy a few of the Konad plates that you like instead, all these plates are very similar and I can guarantee that you will be unhappy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> IT WAS REALLY HARD</li>
            <li> and she found them hard to use</li>
            <li> The designs don&#x27;t seem to be as delicate as they are on Konad plates.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what all these negative reviews are talking about.</li>
            <li> We ordered these after seeing them at an event at the Reno Convention Center where they were really expensive.</li>
            <li> They usually are!</li>
            <li> The existing designs are very small</li>
            <li> They are too shallow.</li>
            <li> My daughters tried to use them and found the templates were way too shallow.</li>
            <li> The engravings are way too shallow.</li>
            <li> The die cuts are too shallow, so no nail polish stays in them - we&#x27;ve tried all kinds and nothing works.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way!</li>
            <li> I was checking all the designs and got disappointed because I really expected something different, I mean 90% of the designs are FLOWERS!!!</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed in this generic product from xxkara17xx.</li>
            <li> Some of the designs are dumb though.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried, both by the side-by-side image of the cardigan design and some of the very negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> I had read the reviews about customer service issues before I bought the set, so I was a bit afraid to ask the seller about the 1 missing plate from my set.  </li>
            <li> Lots of thick-lined designs and the ones that are SUPPOSED to have thin lines are messed up.  </li>
            <li> I was not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> it is ridiculous!  </li>
            <li> They are so shallow that any polish that I tried was useless.</li>
            <li> Take this review seriously!</li>
            <li> The images are etched very shallow and do not allow any polish to remain on the design.</li>
            <li> who did NOT describe this set accurately, or actually failed to do so.  </li>
            <li> These are a crappier version, somewhat useless dupe</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit too expensive for me.  </li>
            <li> After e-mailing the seller that I did not receive any of the images that were depicted on the set of plates I bought, I was told that the packaging is done at their factory and is completely random.</li>
            <li> False advertising!</li>
            <li> You will NOT be sorry you bought these !</li>
            <li> and Im mad that I did.  </li>
            <li> Well You Cant Complain And Give Bad Reviews</li>
            <li> but i say its not that bad.</li>
            <li> I payed 10.99+5.48 shipping .so bad and disapointed</li>
            <li> I wanted to like these so bad because I paid $10 for 25 instead of $5-6 each for the Konad ones.</li>
            <li> I get really frustrated trying to use the plates.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend buying this product! :(</li>

            <li> /&gt;Bummer :(.</li>

            <li> Very good value for what you pay for. I took away a star bc this is the same exact set you get from bundle monster. This is obviously the better deal being $10 cheaper. I ordered it Saturday night and received the stamping plates Wednesday afternoon, earlier than what I was told so that&#x27;s always a plus. Just kind of bummed out that I already have these plates and no new nail art for me. Do yourself a favor and get this set if you don&#x27;t have the bundle monster 25 piece set already.   Here is a list of plates that I received:  m28, m20, m27, m55, m47, m52, m48, m62, m57, m60, m80, m64, m73, m61, m78, m72, m25, m45, m22, m50, m26, m46, m44, m21, m63</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why people are having issues with these, they work great for me! I can use the stamp and get perfect images, the edges aren&#x27;t sharp, they came fast! I love it!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST deal for plates EVER ! A great new start to my collection of plates! You will NOT be sorry you bought these ! Very nice designs too ! I&#x27;m EXCITED ! They were each in their own plastic bag and each plate has a plastic film on it.You will have to peal that off first before using.I have not used these yet....I just got them today. I&#x27;m 100% sure they will be just as good as Konad....I do love Konad too tho.Go a head and buy them !</li>
            <li> This buy was a steal! The plates were individually wrapped and there are so many designs. I love it bonus was the super fast shipping, i literally ordered yesterday morning and they came today! Over night shipping omg..... very pleased :) thank you!</li>
            <li> i love the plates. they take some time getting used to using them but they are great fun! its really hard finding a set that isn&#x27;t super expensive too, so i lucked out finding these.</li>
            <li> They r really cute n worth buying.   But u still need special nail polish for stamping.   I use Konad special polish n comes out perfect stamps.</li>
            <li> These plates have great designs, work really well, and have so many options! The images transfer really well and it&#x27;s super easy. I would definitely recomend this.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried, both by the side-by-side image of the cardigan design and some of the very negative reviews.  After getting the plates I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.  I checked the cardigan design first and it looks nothing like the \\&quot;non-Konad\\&quot; picture.  That is, the image is very clearly defined on my plate.  There are a few images I&#x27;m not sure what they are, but the sheer number of designs kind of makes up for that.  I did not have to use Konad polish, I used Wet &amp; Wild on a fairly intricate french tip design and it came out clear and was big enough for all of my nails.  I used Sally Hansen on a fairly detailed scorpion and that came out perfectly as well.  I held some of the full nail designs to my thumb and they seem alright, though I haven&#x27;t tried any yet.  Perhaps it&#x27;s a difference in manufacturing, but my outside edges are not all that sharp.  Like some other people I did only get 24 plates (unless there are two stuck together that I haven&#x27;t discovered yet), but overall I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set from xxkara17xx, who did NOT describe this set accurately, or actually failed to do so.  BUYER BEWARE if the seller does not show actual, clear images of the plates or fails to describe them at all...   About 8 or 9 plates were definitely too too small for adult nails or even tweens for that matter--and I have XS hands (I know 13 year old girls with bigger hands than me), so they DO cover my other nails EXCEPT my thumbs.    These plates are basically the same as Konad&#x27;s but SHRUNKEN in size, most noticeable on the \\&quot;full\\&quot; nail designs and french tips--they do not cover the entire nail.  Copyright infringement, stolen intellectual property.  You can see the difference between in the photos posted by a customer who compares Konad to xxkara17xx.    These are a crappier version, somewhat useless dupe and I guess for the price, you get what you paid for.  I emailed the seller, xxkara17xx, but decided not to ship them back because I would lose the $10 bucks I paid for the product due to the fact that I would not recuperate the original shipping costs and also I would have to pay to ship them back, even though they are defective.    Compared to Konad, the quality is inferior.  The images do not come out as clean and sharp consistently with each plate, the etchings aren&#x27;t as deep with each plate compared to Konad, so it can be frustrating to repeatedly try, try, and try again to make a decent image come out, even if you have experience and practice using such products.    I was highly disappointed in this generic product from xxkara17xx. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this set to anyone...except maybe an overly proficient 9 year old.  In terms of generics--I recommend BUNDLE MONSTER&#x27;s 25PC set which have large, full images. (BM&#x27;s 21 pc set has smaller ones).</li>
            <li> I bought 2 sets from this seller from ebay one for my niece and one for myself. both came very fast and in good condition. I had already expected the sharp edges from the research i had done looking for cheaper sets. I solved the sharp edges by taking some sanding paper and sanding the very outer edge a little. they are now very smooth and highly unlikely to cut anyone. I wanted to make sure they were safe for my niece before I gave them to her. For the price it is definitely worth a little sanding I didn&#x27;t mind it at all. And also the people that are comparing these to konad brand are rediculous. Of course they arent going to be perfectly an exact match for this price. Paying 5 bucks for one plate is rediculous and I would never do it.These images are great for the price. And I eventually got the hang of stamping after a few hours and was able to use REGULAR nail polish to get good results for my first time. there is one image I have no clue what it is but no big deal. I recommend using an old gift card or credit card or something like that as a scraper instead of the metal ones you can buy. It works much better and doesnt scratch the plates at all. hold the card at a 30 degree angle or less and apply light pressure as you glide across the plate. the key is to not remove too much or too little of the polish. the whole process takes some practice but the outcome is well worth it even my bf said it was pretty cool after I showed him my nails. all in all this is the set to buy if you want more for your money. and if you are having trouble stamping I just searched \\&quot;how to stamp nails\\&quot; on youtube and watched a few videos to help me get a better understanding on how to do it. the best one I found was by DandyNails called \\&quot;Using Regular Polish for Konad/Bundle Monster Stamping\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I ordered these plates thinking they wouldn&#x27;t get here till a week or so after I ordered them, but they came within 3 days! These stamp plates are so cool, they have a TON of designs and I absolutely love them! Definitely recommend to anyone who has a nail art stamper and wants more plates!</li>
            <li> like the quantity of the pieces alot of the patterns are alike not the same but alike ..some of the patterns are too large but overall pleased with the purchase</li>
            <li> What  i expected i get it. Love it and since i have them in my hands have not stop changing my nail color and design.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set just for the price after discovering Konad in my shopping mall.  I was amazed by the process, but just couldn&#x27;t fathom paying the hefty price tag when I was sure there would be alternates.  I&#x27;ve had this set for a few months now and I have to say that as a beginner, I loved it.  It took a while and a lot of different types of nail polish to get the results that I&#x27;m proud to show off.  I just bought a Bundle Monster set and I&#x27;m actually having more problems with that set than this one.  I have seriously spent an hour trying to get an image to stamp right and it just won&#x27;t.  But I&#x27;ll save that review for Bundle Monster.  This set is very nice.  Sure, some of the designs are a bit hard to make out, and not all of the full nail images cover the nail.  But this is where I learned to overlap the full nail images and you seriously cannot tell if you practice enough.  I&#x27;m very glad to have purchased this set first because it really forces you to master the technique.  Also, I have not cut myself with these so-called \\&quot;razor sharp\\&quot; edges because they are not that sharp unless you&#x27;re trying to juggle with them.  Also, I do not own one bottle of the \\&quot;special\\&quot; Konad polish and I won&#x27;t because a nice thick nail polish will do the trick for a lot less.  I use \\&quot;Wet N Wild\\&quot; \\&quot;Pure Ice\\&quot; and even those cheap \\&quot;LA Nail Art\\&quot; polishes and have great designs.  And the youtube videos also show a brand called \\&quot;China Glaze\\&quot; a lot, but it&#x27;s a bit too expensive for me.  Also, I have learned that applying your first coat, then using Seche Vite top coat, which is fast-drying, will allow you to not only be able to stamp a freshly painted nail, but will allow you to mess up on the stamping a couple of times before you actually damage your first coat.  You can also paint over the design with the Seche Vite afterward and I have not had a design smudge with this brand yet.  I had read the reviews about customer service issues before I bought the set, so I was a bit afraid to ask the seller about the 1 missing plate from my set.  I should have counted them when I first bought them, but silly me, I actually put trust into my purchase.  I have contacted \\&quot;xxkara17xx\\&quot; about the plate, but she hasn&#x27;t really responded and basically cut off communication when I asked about it again.  I&#x27;m happy with my 24 plates, but I do think that was quite rude to dismiss me like that.  I would have given 4-5 stars if not for that experience.  I also am not sure which set of plates I have because it seems like everyone pretty much got random sets.  If I could find out the brand name of these plates, maybe I could figure out which one is missing, or at least try to buy some different designs.  I have a very high suspicion that the brand name is \\&quot;Born Pretty.\\&quot;  If you go to this site [...] you&#x27;ll find that your m64 will match the Born Pretty plate, which apparently isn&#x27;t so great to use with stamping when you look at the pictures.  I&#x27;m just not sure why the seller would cut the brand name off the packaging unless she stole them, lol.  Overall, great for a beginner, or at least from a beginner&#x27;s point of view.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price.  I should have posted all of my nail designs, but I change them everyday with all of the plates I&#x27;m buying.  Maybe in the future.</li>
            <li> I really love my plates, there are so many designs that I love!! I can&#x27;t wait to try them out!!</li>
            <li> I bought these trying to save a few bucks in replace of the Konad or Monster Bundle plates and Im mad that I did.  When I received them, they were in clear packages that had the brand name cut off each one.  I took one out to look at it and the metal disk was so razor shape, it sliced my index finger and pretty deep at that.  I took a look at all of them and all the images are so shallow and blurred due to the small size of them.  The full images will not even fit on my adult thumb all the way.  I tried to do a return and the seller canceled my return.  I also emailed them asking for THE MANUFACTURES name.  These are DANGEROUS plates and if young girls are going to use them, they can really get hurt and cut from the sharp edges.  They will soon have a lawsuit on their hands.  DO NOT BUY THESE!  Spend the money and get the good ones!</li>
            <li> Era justo lo que esperaba, muy cumplidos, es un placer hacer negocios con ustedes.&lt;br /&gt;Was just that I need, so good, It&#x27;s a pleasure to do business whith them.</li>
            <li> Great product would buy from again.Shipping wasnt bad,i love how they make decorating nails so easy.Little girls and woman of all ages will love this item.forget the salon do it yourself.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read some reviews before purchasing these plates. Most if not all of the designs are so shallow that they do not transfer properly to your nail if they do at all. I get really frustrated trying to use the plates. Save your sanity and get a better product.</li>
            <li> I just got these, and they are okay. Most of the designs are not cute or pretty, and some of them don&#x27;t come out. I rate these 2/5.</li>
            <li> The product was just as described. It contains a variety of nail art for any ocassion. My daughter and I were so excited when the plates arrived. We just couldn&#x27;t wait to get our \\&quot;groove on\\&quot; with a nail party. It was of great quality and it is the original Konad nail stamping kit. Great product!</li>
            <li> i bought these as a gift and was very embarrassed that they don&#x27;t work at all.  The etching in the plates is not deep enough to transfer an image they are completely useless.</li>
            <li> This product works as well as Konad plates. They are a bit thinner but with care this should not be a problem. Its a great deal for anyone who wants a nice variety of images for stamping. The key with all stamping is to use the special Konad polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product! As I was trying them out, I noticed that the designs are not deep enough so when you scrape off the excess, you remove most of the nail polish in the design. So once you try to pick it up with the stamper, there is nothing to get picked up. After trying many designs over and over again I became very frustrated and regret buying these plates. I do not recommend buying this product! :(</li>
            <li> not very many choice images</li>
            <li> When This Product Came I Loved How It Was Packed! Very Nice and Neat! The Plates Work Pretty Good. The Only Thing I Had a Problem With  Was The French Tip Designs. They did Not Stamp Well. It Could Just Be Me Though.If Some Designs don&#x27;t Work Well You Cant Complain And Give Bad Reviews Because You Get 25 Plates for Just $9.00!! So Considering What you Get And For The Price This Is A Great Deal!!! Worth It!!</li>
            <li> These are awesome and a great deal. Most discs I found are $5 each. Super simple to use and clean - I use a q-tip and some good polish remover. Mine was lost in the mail and when I notified the seller I had a replacement sent and to my house within several days.</li>
            <li> i hate this product do not buy. First when i got them i accually cut myself on the sharp edges. Then when i went to tryed them i put the nail polish on. When i scraped it not only the excess  nail polish but the polish on the design came off too! Even if i tried going lighter on the scraping it still wouldnt work. I was very agervated. But either way i am only 12 and the large prints didnt fit on my thumbs! It was a huge waist of money and the designs arnt even that detailed. DO NOT BUY THESE PLATES...THEY ARE JUST A WAIST OF MONEY AND TIME.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.. it seems fun and easy to use..  what i didnt like from this specific seller was that i orderd both the  sheets and the stamp set at the same time and stamp set took 4 more days to be delivered. but besides that the sheets look nice and clean. all the stamps are are well done. and i didn recieve all 25 of them.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping!!! It was just like it was described, more than i tought it would be and so easy to use. I would recommend this to any woman that wants to save money on designs for the nails.</li>
            <li> omg i love my image plates. So mny designs and the ones i reserched and wanted i got with this great deal. im so glad i bought this a great price for so many designs. now i believe i will be set for a while and stamping til my heats content. thank you. oh and fast shipping</li>
            <li> It takes some practice but don&#x27;t give up.  I have had so much fun with these plates it is ridiculous!  It sounds like it is tedious and takes a long time, but it goes fairly quick.  My nails look professionally done!!!</li>
            <li> It works great, its the best price I have found. It has a lot of designs from the boundle monster plates they are soooo cute</li>
            <li> My niece loves it! Great birthday gift.She has a big dance coming up and can&#x27;t afford a professional manicure. her friends will benefit also. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> Do not buy this.  Rip off!</li>
            <li> Waste of money. They are too shallow. Worked for hours and got one decent stamp. The you tube promos are very deceiving!!</li>
            <li> would so recomend this. everything is immaculate, molds are great. Its like konad but better and cheaper. The molds are all different and they have french tip ones too</li>
            <li> This is a great value considering the number of designs/plates you get.  There are some drawbacks.  The designs seem a tad bit shallow and some are not etched properly.  Just a couple of the designs are unidentifiable while a handful of others are just plain etched incorrectly.  The designs don&#x27;t seem to be as delicate as they are on Konad plates.  Lots of thick-lined designs and the ones that are SUPPOSED to have thin lines are messed up.  The biggest disappointment for me was the full nail argyle design.  The thin lines of the pattern just aren&#x27;t there on half the design so you end up with a big blob at the bottom of the nail.  I&#x27;ll have to rebuy some of my favorites that aren&#x27;t done well on these plates. The metal plates themselves seem thinner compared to Konad plates and the edges are surprisingly sharp.  The value is great, the quality is just so-so.  Usable, but would I buy again?  Probably not.  I say drop a little more money for better quality.  Edit:  I got different plates than hiimria so I thought I&#x27;d post the plates I got as well:  m20, m21, m22, m25, m26, m27, m28, m44, m45, m46, m47, m48, m50, m52, m56, m57, m60, m61, m62, m63, m64, m72, m73, m78, m80   Also I just got my replacement Konad plates today so I posted a picture with side-by-side comparison of m60.  Please see customer pictures for this product to see the comparison.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t perfected the art of Konad......yet. These disks are at an INCREDIBLE price!!! Well worth it. No hitches in the process, order, smile at the door shortly after, and then play away!!! The possibilities are endless! Am very happy with the purchase. Thank you!</li>
            <li> When i received the plates they not only were late (i don&#x27;t blame seller i blame usps) they arrived scratched and most of then did not have the plastic protecting film so looked to have nail polish on them. I then left feedback and the seller contacted me. I then received a set of replacement plates and not only did they arrive within 2 days, they were in perfect condition and also came with a little more variety of patterns than the previous plates. Needless to say they absolutely made me a satisfied customer and I will definitely buy from them again!</li>
            <li> These nail plates do not work. The designs are not etched in deep enough and the nail polish doesn&#x27;t even scrape off the plate properly. Plus, all of the designs suck. About ten of my plates have floral designs, no variety. And there are no full nail designs in the packages I received...</li>
            <li> OK SO I BOUGHT THIS LOVED IT BY THE WAAY WHAT WAS WHAT I DIDNT WANT TO HAPPEN IS THAT WHERE I WAS USEING THIS AND I TRIEND TO CLEAN IT WAS REALLY HARD SO NOW ALL OF MY PLATES HAVE NAIL POLISH ON IT.......BUT ALL AN ALL YOU SHOULD BYE THIS NAIL THINGY SAVES MONEY TOO......</li>
            <li> Great to have came as described and fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;There is a huge variety of stamps on these and although I&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used them all yet. I plan too</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. SO VERY EASY TO USE. THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE VERY PRECISE AND YOU CAN USE REGULAR NAIL ENAMEL OR POLISH TO CREATE YOUR DESIGNS.</li>
            <li> Had some double images.  Metal was sharp on the edges and I feel could of had better images. Was not to impressed.</li>
            <li> This took a while for the product to arrive but it was worth the wait.  I purchased these for my granddaughter and find that grandma is using them too.  It was an excellent assortment of designs.  Some plates may have some prints that are not shallow enough to get a good print but considering the price and how may are good prints it was worth the investment</li>
            <li> These stamping plates are too cute; the designs are fun! You most definitely get your monies worth. They work with any kind of polish you may have in your collection.</li>
            <li> Very good item. Use it each time I do a manicure at school. Works great and arrived on time and yes it did come with the 25 image stamp plates.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking that it was such a great deal, so many templates so many choices. But, was disappointed. My daughters tried to use them and found the templates were way too shallow. The templates do not hold nail polish to allow the stamps to pick up polish. The engravings are way too shallow. We bought this and cannot use them. Some templates are almost flush with the metal plate.</li>
            <li> You can do so many different designs with this it is one of the best sets I have ever seen</li>
            <li> what my daughter needed</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!! Thank you. Exactly as described!!</li>
            <li> WEll, it is okay â€¦ if I had more time to do my nails I may use it. Actually, I am not sure I would. I don&#x27;t know. I think if you have someone that likes their nails done, but isn&#x27;t super creative on their own, this may be a good gift choice for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE BE ADVISED â€¦ there is actually a base for these, you need it. These are SO SHARP! They will slice your hand open. They are seriously sharp. OUCH! I learned the hard way!</li>
            <li> wish  it wasnt as many french tips image are a nice size to. use it often. will want to try other ones</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff</li>
            <li> These stamping plates are terrible quality. They are a very cheap knock off of the konad brand plates. The designs are not etched in deep enough and the images are all hard to make out.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 12 year old niece and she found them hard to use and I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s used them more than a few times.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a product issue or if she may just have been to young for them.</li>
            <li> Great product, and works well for a novice nail artist. I have gotten many compliments and have started a new trend at work. The amount of plates tht you get is great for the price. Some of the designs are dumb though. There are a few that I have no idea what they are. Over all great price and even a novice like me can have beautiful nails that look like I spent a fourtune at the salon.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for a gift since I already have a set of my own. I love what she received. I love how there is holiday stamps too. I ordered the stamp plates with other items from other sellers and this was the first to arrive. Fast shipping and a great product with seals on each to protect each engraving.</li>
            <li> These are great - so many plates for the money, and the Konad system works really well.  There is a blue film cover on each plate that you have to remove before using - my daughter didn&#x27;t realize that at first and thought they didn&#x27;t work but once we figured it out and took it off all was well.  Works great with the Konad polish but also works well with other brands like Sally Hansen Insta Dry - basically, thick and gloppy polish works well, and ones that are really saturated with color.  Lots of fun doing nail art!</li>
            <li> great purchase great price.</li>
            <li> Pictures show Konad. Plates i got were Mash. What misleading selling. Why have pictures of Konad and send MASH plates.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what all these negative reviews are talking about. The plates I got are MASH they are not sharp at all and are etched perfectly. There&#x27;s only one picture I can&#x27;t tell what it is. Kinda looks like a chili pepper but Idk. They are all perfect and if anything some of the tip images are too big! I wouldn&#x27;t mind smaller ones. Anyway they&#x27;re perfectly fine and came about 3 days after I ordered them.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a different set going by one of the reviewer&#x27;s review on what was in this set which was the 2011 set but this is the newer set from M.A.S.H., the plates are really small, especially with the \\&quot;full\\&quot; nail designs, they only cover my pinky, it didn&#x27;t cover the rest of my nails.  Plus the design goes on fuzzy-looking.  I gave it 2 stars because I received them fast.  I&#x27;m not too happy about the plates but it was still fun to play with.</li>
            <li> PProduct was good with the plates i will definitely recommended to everyone for their purpose use on nails has too imagines</li>
            <li> My neice had one of these kits and brought it to a family get together. What fun we ladies had.  As soon as I got home I went on line and ordered the set for myself . Love it! Will be getting sets for the grandgirls. Great inexpensive present. Thank you for a great fun product.</li>
            <li> I received these plates and was missing M63. Contacted seller and was told I would have it sent out to me on the next tuesday. Its been 2 weeks now and still have not received the missing plates. Also the plates shown in the picture are not the ones you will receive.</li>
            <li> I so love this product, its taking me some time to get the hang of it, but its so much fun to use,</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, product as described.  These came packaged and brand new!  I love all the different designs and they were a great deal for all the plates you get.</li>
            <li> At first I was very skeptical about buying these, as some of the reviews were not that great. I am so happy that I decided to buy them!!! I received the plates within 2 days, so super fast shipping! These are MASH plates 1-25, they all come individually wrapped and they have the paper backing so they are not that sharp! I love all the designs and the etching quality is pretty good! Out of all the samples I have tried there are only like two that you cannot tell what the designs are. I did receive all 25 plates! Overall great product for the price!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, both me and my friend bought this and don&#x27;t have to go to the salon no more!!!! lol saves time and money!!!!! i recommend getting this with  the MASH Double Sided Nail Art Plate Stamp and Scraper.</li>
            <li> This has way more designs than I could use.  Good thing it was for my daughter and she is loving the many many options for designs and sizes.</li>
            <li> My daughter requested these.  They are not as easy to use as she thought they would be.  She really does not use them much.</li>
            <li> The seller was great but the product is horrible.  I am so glad I didn&#x27;t spend much on these.  They are the most useless stamps I have used.</li>
            <li> We ordered these after seeing them at an event at the Reno Convention Center where they were really expensive. When we saw these, we thought we&#x27;d struck gold, but the truth is, they are shipped directly from China (timely, though) and they must be rejects from a different source. They don&#x27;t work at all! The die cuts are too shallow, so no nail polish stays in them - we&#x27;ve tried all kinds and nothing works. As soon as you scrape over the design, the entire glob goes away. Nothing like they are supposed to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bummer :(. We are very disappointed.</li>
            <li> T^he plates function was good some better then others.  but it takes a while to get the technique down.  bottom line if your willing to work on it and spend a good amount of time on it this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used a few times in the past 2 years</li>
            <li> this product is amazing! i went and watched a couple of videos on youtube to see how it was done and when i recieved my 25 plates i started doing my nails and from the 1st design it came out perfect! the plates came fairly quick in the mail. i would highly recommend this product cause i dont ever have to go to another nail shop again!</li>
            <li> It was okay, all the prints are great, but these are bigger then the rest of the plates that come with the stamping kit so they dont sit into the frame right, and when you scrap it moves.</li>
            <li> Iimages wont transfer over to the pink stamper. Wish it worked.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my new plates and ripped into a few of them to try them out.  They are so shallow that any polish that I tried was useless. I was not a happy camper. So after I wrote a crappy review I thought maybe it is me. So I watched a few tutorials on new plate trials and went back and tried them again.  So user error was the problem.  I went back and opened more of them and figured out that not all of them are shallow and used a different polish and they seemed to work a little better.  So they are workable, but I am not in love with them.  However, I no longer feel like I wasted my money on them. So I am a happier camper.  I hope this was helpful</li>
            <li> The disks did not work - had to return.</li>
            <li> I bought these nearly 2 years ago and I still use them to this day! They&#x27;re great! With a bit of practice, you can have some really cool designs!</li>
            <li> Alot of people say these arent good but i say its not that bad. I havent tryied them yet which is why i only gave three stars because im not completely sure of how &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; they are. When you look at the customer photos theres a few by a girl named sarah and yes shes right they do come scratched but what she didnt do is pull off the plastic. Its not blue like other ones which is why she maynot have noticed it was plastic on it and it may also be why hers didnt work as well. The designs are fairly small whilch is a problem for me because i have long nails but i can make it work. I will try them tomorrow or the next day because i just painted my nail this morning, i can post back if anyone would like me too. But just remember to take the CLEAR plastic off before you try them.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it. Some of these discs have some totally crap designs on them but there&#x27;s way more useful ones than none useful ones. I never run out of ideas and combinations. I do, however, wish out of these bazillions of designs that one disc had a bow on it. I love bows. No such luck. There&#x27;s a lacey pattern that has teeny little bows through it but I sort of just want a large lone simple one. Either way... best 10 bucks ever spent. Perfect gift for a girl of any age and awesome sleepover/party activity for ANY age. 7... 17... 37 whatever. So much fun.</li>
            <li> After reading reading some of the more negative reviews for this product, I was a bit anxious about what I&#x27;d be receiving. I was thrilled! Really large designs, which is great - I&#x27;ve quite long nails, a few small designs, a balance of floral, geometric, and abstract designs. I received series GA, plates 1-25 from Gals, the box says it&#x27;s the Princess Set. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> They were very nice, there were three plates that were duplicated.  Other than that the designs were pretty and nice.</li>
            <li> They are cute but wish it had more full nail designs.  The existing designs are very small and I did not see the WOW that I expected.</li>
            <li> Different photos are displayed implying specific sets of plates . After e-mailing the seller that I did not receive any of the images that were depicted on the set of plates I bought, I was told that the packaging is done at their factory and is completely random. They need to call it a grab-bag!</li>
            <li> I&#x3D; My wife&lt;br /&gt;I surely recommend buying this product. I had a prompt and courteous service, the item arrived on time and in perfect conditions. I think we (costumers) should be completely honest about our purchases so we can select the companies which provide a good service avoiding us of having trouble in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I discovered it in Vegas at one of those kiosks with a friend. She paid $60 for 3 polishes, a stamper/scraper, and 5 plates. I got 25 plates and a stamper/scraper for $9.99/free shipping! I played with them at home and love it. Some of the discs are Asian themed characters I don&#x27;t recognize, but they&#x27;re still good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difficulty is putting the images on my nails straight (user problem, not the product! lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make SURE you peel the clear plastic off the disc (that you can barely see/feel). But it&#x27;s there :)</li>
            <li> did not work well and the edges are really sharp! no Joke</li>
            <li> Every nail artist should love this! The prints are bigger than most of the other brands I&#x27;ve bought before. Order it, and it came within 2 days!</li>
            <li> It is a great kit. I would have liked some Holiday stamps  designs and a pen to clean the plates.</li>
            <li> i choose this rating because i love this item, seller delivery fast. i like this item make me do my nail quick n easy. i will like to recommend this to friend/family.</li>
            <li> I did not like that item, they sent the old set and reused don&#x27;t have the plastic cover ,all of them scratch can use.I payed 10.99+5.48 shipping .so bad and disapointed</li>
            <li> The designs are too shallow to do anything with, 60% of the alaphabet is missing from the set, and some of the designs are on here several times. Naturally you want some designs to flip both ways for the proper direction on both hands. But, with only two hands, I hardly see why its necessary for one design to show up three times. I used the set with a nailpolish set I also purchase online: [[ASIN:B005X2F7KI SHANY Nail Art Set (24 Famouse Colors Nail Art Polish, Nail Art Decoration)]] Now, the issue could be that the stamp plates are sub par, could be that the nailpolish is sub par, but either way the images are far too shallow to use, thus rendering the set useless.</li>
            <li> I was in love with the designs, but wish it were a little bit bigger. I ain&#x27;t useful for me, but it is on my little 22 years old sister. She love it. She always seem to pick the right design for her nails. I love it on her. I&#x27;m looking forward to different stamp plates design out for me to tho. maybe KONAD are better for me. thanks alot tho!</li>
            <li> He shipping for this item is incredibly fast! I love the images on the plates! They are so detailed and fancy! The only major drawback is that u don&#x27;t get to pick your own plates out, but that was ok with me because I still loved my plates;) brand of plates: MASH</li>
            <li> This product is a cheap knock off of Konad, you may get a lot of plates but it is not worth it to buy these at all. The images that are supposed to fit over your whole nail fit about half of it. Just buy a few of the Konad plates that you like instead, all these plates are very similar and I can guarantee that you will be unhappy with the purchase. Take this review seriously! Don&#x27;t just read the good reviews. Also don&#x27;t buy ANYTHING AT ALL from this seller. She has a 30 day money back guarantee and I returned my items within a week of getting them in October and she has not refunded my money and it is now DECEMBER. She doesn&#x27;t answer emails you send. Just pass up this seller and find what you&#x27;re looking for somewhere else!!! NOT WORTH IT AT ALL!!!!</li>
            <li> KONAD brand quality! love these dupes!!</li>
            <li> All the reviews said that this wasn&#x27;t a good product because they came used. However, they were brand new. They kind of looked scratched but there was a film that peeled off leaving a brand new product.</li>
            <li> These plates are so cute. The designs look good on your nails. The price for these plates is a very good deal.</li>
            <li> Ok there are so many things I can say about these plates, let&#x27;s see how much I can get in without getting too frustrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- The seller image provided shows various plates with various designs (e.g. leopard, lace, animal, etc.), but you won&#x27;t get any of these ... you will get 90% flowers!!!! I got the following plates: B01, B07, B08, B09, B14, B26, B27, B28, B29, B33, B37, B42, B43, B45, B72, B75, B76, B78, B79, B80, B86, B99, B100, B112. The instructions provided on the Amazon screen are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Before use, peel off the tight protective plastic film on top of each plate.&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply polish on image plate design&lt;br /&gt;3. Using the scraper, scrape off the excessive nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;4. Stamp the image in rolling motion.&lt;br /&gt;5. Stamp design on nail smoothly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- There was NO protective plastic film on ANY of the plates I received. Once the polish was applied and the scraper used to remove the excess polish, away went ALL of the polish. The images are etched very shallow and do not allow any polish to remain on the design. I tried multiple plates to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- The plates also had scratches all over them. Not some of them, because that would slightly be excusable, but all of them had scratches on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- So, in addition to these &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; plates arriving all scratched up inside of plastic sleeves with no protective coating, they aren&#x27;t etched deep enough to hold any polish for the designs to be transferred to the stamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself some time and return postage and just get the KONAD plates. They are worth the investment!</li>
            <li> This was part of a Christmas gift for my daughter. I bought the basic starter package of Konad Nail Art at the mall that came with two plates, but the additional plates at the mall seemed excessively overpriced.  Hoping to get more patterns for my budget I bought this set.  We repeatedly tried several patterns on different plates from this set first none of which worked.  Next we tried some patterns off the two Konad brand plates which worked flawlessly so it is not a user error issue.  Closer inspection revealed the grooves are much too shallow to hold adequate polish after scraping the excess off these plates.  The plates themselves are also much thinner that the Konad plates and all of these plates had surface scratches on them when they arrived.  The Konad plates show no sign of scratching before or after use.</li>
            <li> My mom loved these, she is a nail tech and we ordered this for her use on her clientele, wow.</li>
            <li> I bought this awhile back and no longer use it. None of the plates worked.....ok ok ONE plate worked and its the only one i use. I would never use it again or recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> False advertising! The product description states \\&quot;new\\&quot; but they sent me used junk.  They are used scratched even the images are scratched. You can not get a good stamp out of the scratched images. Look at the images uploaded for proof. YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY TO RETURN THEM.</li>
            <li> great for decors on your nails.</li>
            <li> These are definitely not Konad, but the majority of them worked great for me. There were a few designs that had some deep scratches in them (looked like a machining error) but honestly the patterns weren&#x27;t something I would really miss anyway. I have my favorites, and I&#x27;ve been using them for 11 months on a weekly basis. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try stamping on a budget!</li>
            <li> They usually are! I wanted to like these so bad because I paid $10 for 25 instead of $5-6 each for the Konad ones. I tried using these and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I am a beginner or what but I couldn&#x27;t get the images to transfer. I have one from Konad and it works beautifully. I wouldn&#x27;t say run out and buy all the Konad ones but pay a little more for Bundle Monster or Winstonia.</li>
            <li> I first used them with the clear plastic sticker on the face and wondered why it wasn&#x27;t working and getting scratched!!! Hahaha. Pero, then I took off the plastic and they worked well. No problems. Then, as I was looking thru each one carefully, I set them in two piles: \\&quot;likely to use\\&quot; and \\&quot;not likely to use\\&quot;. My \\&quot;Not likely to use\\&quot; pile was huge. I&#x27;m not very satisfied with the images and will buying another set.</li>
            <li> They are okay plates sometimes they seem like they arent deep enough to hold enough polish to transfer to the stamper. But not each one...kind of weird i know. But still a good product</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 sets for family presents, but only received 1scrape and stamp set. I did get 3 sets of stencels.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try these templates but the designs are not deep enough to show up on your nail. Very dissatisfied and a big waste of $30.</li>
            <li> I was eager for the arrival of the plates, when they got home I was checking all the designs and got disappointed because I really expected something different, I mean 90% of the designs are FLOWERS!!! I have nothing against flowers but come on, I wanted maybe some animal print, I don&#x27;t know.. different shapes, letters maybe, not just flowers. I&#x27;m still gonna use it but it doesn&#x27;t cover my expectations :/</li>
            <li> The plates have a lot of cute usable pics on them. I only wish I could have picked some designs.</li>
            <li> i ordered these but for some reason the polish just does not want to come off on the stamper :/ so i have all these plates with no way to use them :(</li>
            <li> There are some nice plates with this set. Worth the money I paid for it. Would reccommend to others to buy.</li>
