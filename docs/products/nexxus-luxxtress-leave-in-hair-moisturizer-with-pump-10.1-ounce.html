            <li>I am happy I found you.</li>
            <li>It was great.</li>
            <li>But all in all this product is great it just needs oil.</li>
            <li>Easy ordering; excellent packaging; prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use, smells good and leaves my hair looking and feeling it best.</li>
            <li>I dont know if with continued use it would be good or</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t smell good</li>
            <li>If you want a good product that smells good</li>
            <li>Luscious hair, smelling good, all the time.</li>
            <li>I love Phyto organics shampoo &amp; conditioner, and they smell great.</li>
            <li>guess I won&#x27;t be ordering this product any more!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to moisturize my hair and scalp without it feeling greasy!</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t feel amazing or anything either.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>To be honest, the smell reminds me a bit of \\&quot;afro-sheen.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Pump is easy to handle and fragrance is good</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but a fair amount of it.  </li>
            <li>I use this with Phyto-Organic shampoo by Nexus as well and love both products.  </li>
            <li>Love the Nexus products.</li>
            <li>My favorite product is Diametress Headdress leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have been used it for many years.</li>
            <li>many days post relaxer, this product softens the roots of my hair</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I wash and condition in the shower every day, but need more moisturizing before blow drying.  </li>
            <li>but my hair does behave much better.  </li>
            <li>Such a great product!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a detangler that would comb out easily after a shower</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone wanting a good light weight leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel full and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>Seller was excellent but product not appropriate for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve decided to change my original review of this.</li>
            <li>This product works very well, better than some drugstore brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It is fast and easy to use if you are in a rush.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product, and becoming harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and shine, my friends thought i was using some sort of  shinny jell, it sprays fine mist out cover my hair good without wasting, one bottle last for months</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about as useful as spraying water in my hair.</li>
            <li>Ok I&#x27;ll start by saying that I&#x27;m a NATURAL haired girl (short/medium length bush).</li>
            <li>This spray-in, leave-in moisturizer helps a LOT, and as of now, I like it better than perhaps 6 or 7 other similar products I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s the best of the lot so far.  </li>
            <li>When I read the other reviews about this not smelling good</li>
            <li>Who would want to stink up their hair right after you wash it?</li>
            <li>It might be good for someone who wears their hair long and straight, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>After some research I came upon Pure Sweet Almond oil.</li>
            <li>This product has a funny odor and doesn&#x27;t work well on me.  </li>
            <li>But I definitely can tell a difference if I don&#x27;t use the Luxxtress (I see the difference on the top part of my hair), and I&#x27;ve just ordered my 5th or 6th bottle of the stuff.  </li>
            <li>It gives just the right amount of moisture without leaving too much residue</li>
            <li>This product is lightweight and leave little to no residue in my hair, so my hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down, and the fragrance is simply wonderful in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is a leave in which I really prefer to use.  </li>
            <li>It makes a real difference to the manageability of my unruly hair.</li>
            <li>This did absolutely zero for my hair.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I spray</li>
            <li>When I purchased this product I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>It detangled really well.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is cheaper by at least 5 bucks than the local beauty supply store or my hairdresser, so good deal here!  </li>
            <li>I love the other nexxus leave in conditioner &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Unlike other reviewers, I don&#x27;t find the scent objectionable or strong, and it disappears almost immediately anyway.  </li>
            <li>When I used it for the first time instantly my hair became very soft &amp; manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair is always so soft when I use this!</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and Luxxtress made it feel limp.  </li>
            <li>It does moisturize, and it leaves my hair feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>My last order was in early December, so although I use it daily, at the rate I use it, my previous bottle has lasted a good 6 months and probably won&#x27;t be entirely empty until mid July.  </li>
            <li>Also, while it is very moisturizing, I think it is TOO moisturizing for my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it would work better on someone with very thick, dry hair, but I certainly will not buy it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going right back to Redken Extreme anti snap treatment</li>
            <li>So now when I use this product 6hrs later my hair is still soft, manageable, and moisturised.</li>
            <li>I apply a light spray from a few inches below the roots to the ends, and I&#x27;m always careful to not over apply it.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I apply a light spray from a few inches below the roots to the ends, and I&#x27;m always careful to not over apply it.  </li>
            <li> I use an additional product (a moisturizing oil from Olay) on the last 3 or 4 inches of my hair because the ends need it…Luxxtress isn&#x27;t quite enough to deal with my dry ends.  </li>
            <li> so it has a tendency to be dry and coarse and</li>
            <li> I tried this because the shampoo I use for color treated hair left my hair feeling very dry.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a weird, sticky film that doesn&#x27;t smooth out with blow drying.</li>
            <li> Does not really moisturize...provides some temp sheen only.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair, a slight tendency to be wavy and unruly (especially in humid weather), plus I highlight it so my hair is quite fragile.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed it in my hair twice, 2nd time just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t overreacting to the bad smell the 1st time.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long , thick and naturally curly</li>
            <li> sometimes I&#x27;ll add hair lotion or moisturiser with this product  for a little extra moisture.</li>
            <li> It smells mixed between green tea, which is in it, and tea tree...</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and it craves leave in conditioners and this is by far not the one.</li>
            <li> The amount I use does not weigh down my hair or make it sticky or anything, and when my hair is dry</li>
            <li> Absolutely not the case!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never oily like some other leave in items.</li>
            <li> Well after about 6hrs my hair became dry &amp; had little to no moisture.</li>
            <li> so my hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down</li>
            <li> To heavy &amp; smells....</li>
            <li> it was on sale, and even then it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> My hair is usually in a cornrow type of hairstyle for weeks, and this product does what is written.</li>
            <li> I usually like Nexxus products, but I was not pleased with this one.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really pointless.</li>
            <li> It is not a good product for the person who is looking for volume and manageability.  </li>
            <li> it stinks far too bad for me to try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this spray in product and find it a must for moisturizing my hair.  </li>
            <li> But it is so limp that it is impossible to style.  </li>
            <li> However, I am unable to find it any longer, so I am looking for something to take its place.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels really dirty (and stinks) at the end of the day, after using this product.</li>
            <li> After using it for a week, I realized that it makes my hair smell really bad after it&#x27;s been in my hair for a day.</li>
            <li> However... I hate it because of the smell.  </li>
            <li> It stinks!!!!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Easy ordering; excellent packaging; prompt delivery. The price was the best I&#x27;ve found. This is an excellent product, and becoming harder and harder to find. Moisturizes your hair and scalp, without added weight that prevents a style from holding.</li>
            <li> This product has a funny odor and doesn&#x27;t work well on me.  I was looking for a detangler that would comb out easily after a shower but this wasn&#x27;t it.  It leaves a weird, sticky film that doesn&#x27;t smooth out with blow drying.</li>
            <li> My hair is usually in a cornrow type of hairstyle for weeks, and this product does what is written. It is fast and easy to use if you are in a rush. Since it comes in a spray bottle, you don&#x27;t have to get your hands involved in the chemical. This product is lightweight and leave little to no residue in my hair, so my hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down, and the fragrance is simply wonderful in my opinion.</li>
            <li> too pricey for something that doesnt work, I tried this twice and still didnt make a change in my hair</li>
            <li> I usually like Nexxus products, but I was not pleased with this one.  I found that it did not moisturize my hair nor detangle it.  I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I use this with Phyto-Organic shampoo by Nexus as well and love both products.  The moisturizer is a leave in which I really prefer to use.  At my last hair appointment, my stylist told me \\&quot;whatever you&#x27;re using on your hair, keep it up.  It looks great.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;And so I will.  Love the Nexus products.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use, smells good and leaves my hair looking and feeling it best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this spray in product and find it a must for moisturizing my hair.  It makes a real difference to the manageability of my unruly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and Luxxtress made it feel limp.  It is not a good product for the person who is looking for volume and manageability.  My favorite product is Diametress Headdress leave-in conditioner.  It makes my hair feel full and easy to manage.  However, I am unable to find it any longer, so I am looking for something to take its place.  This is definitely not it!</li>
            <li> Seller was excellent but product not appropriate for me.  To heavy &amp; smells....</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and shine, my friends thought i was using some sort of  shinny jell, it sprays fine mist out cover my hair good without wasting, one bottle last for months</li>
            <li> This product is great! I have been used it for many years. The salon does not sale it anymore. I am happy I found you.</li>
            <li> When I read the other reviews about this not smelling good I didn&#x27;t believe it bc/ I love Phyto organics shampoo &amp; conditioner, and they smell great. I figured it smelled the same, and some ppl just didn&#x27;t like it. Absolutely not the case! I sprayed it in my hair twice, 2nd time just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t overreacting to the bad smell the 1st time. My hair didn&#x27;t feel amazing or anything either. I dont know if with continued use it would be good or not bc it stinks far too bad for me to try it. I only bought this bc it was on sale, and even then it was a waste of money. It smells mixed between green tea, which is in it, and tea tree... I don&#x27;t know what else but it&#x27;s just an overpowering, obnoxious smell. If it doesn&#x27;t smell good it&#x27;s not going in my hair. I&#x27;m going right back to Redken Extreme anti snap treatment my hair stylist recommended. It&#x27;s a lightweight conditioning anti breakage treatment, and it works and smells great! If you want a good product that smells good I suggest you try that.</li>
            <li> My hair is always so soft when I use this!</li>
            <li> I love the other nexxus leave in conditioner &amp;#34; Nexxus Leave-In Spray, Humectress Luxe Ultimate Moisturizing 5.1 oz&amp;#34;.  I thought I would give this product a try because you get twice the quantity for the same price.  However... I hate it because of the smell.  It stinks!!!!  I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.  Who would want to stink up their hair right after you wash it?</li>
            <li> Does not really moisturize...provides some temp sheen only.  Pump is easy to handle and fragrance is good but there is a sting if it gets on face.</li>
            <li> This did absolutely zero for my hair. It&#x27;s about as useful as spraying water in my hair. No matter how much I spray it&#x27;s really pointless. I have thick curly hair and it craves leave in conditioners and this is by far not the one.</li>
            <li> This product is greasy and sticky. You have to cut it with some water so it doesn&#x27;t make your hair look unwashed.</li>
            <li> Excellent product... After my relaxer and I&#x27;m many days post relaxer, this product softens the roots of my hair</li>
            <li> Even w/in-shower conditioner my hair tends to get coarse after air- or blow-drying; a leave-in remedies that. This product works very well, better than some drugstore brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Ok I&#x27;ll start by saying that I&#x27;m a NATURAL haired girl (short/medium length bush). I think I&#x27;m ttype 4b or c. I have tried all sorts of products and some have worked &amp; some haven&#x27;t. When I purchased this product I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I was just trying it out as a hair detangler. When I used it for the first time instantly my hair became very soft &amp; manageable. It was great. It detangled really well. I was very impressed. Well after about 6hrs my hair became dry &amp; had little to no moisture. So I did some research and decided to add oil  to the product. After some research I came upon Pure Sweet Almond oil. I added the oil to the NEXXUS product and noticed the difference!  So now when I use this product 6hrs later my hair is still soft, manageable, and moisturised. FYI I do not use this product by itself. sometimes I&#x27;ll add hair lotion or moisturiser with this product  for a little extra moisture. But all in all this product is great it just needs oil.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001967V8S Nexxus Phyto Organics Luxxtress Leave in Hair Moisturizer (pump) 10.1 oz]]I have been using this product for years and I absolutely love it. My hair is very long , thick and naturally curly so it has a tendency to be dry and coarse and this is the only product that works for me. It gives just the right amount of moisture without leaving too much residue so my hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down and the fragrance is wonderful. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone wanting a good light weight leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is one of a very short list of products I seem to buy over and over.  I have long hair, a slight tendency to be wavy and unruly (especially in humid weather), plus I highlight it so my hair is quite fragile.  I have fine hair, but a fair amount of it.  I wash and condition in the shower every day, but need more moisturizing before blow drying.  This spray-in, leave-in moisturizer helps a LOT, and as of now, I like it better than perhaps 6 or 7 other similar products I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s the best of the lot so far.  Unlike other reviewers, I don&#x27;t find the scent objectionable or strong, and it disappears almost immediately anyway.  I apply a light spray from a few inches below the roots to the ends, and I&#x27;m always careful to not over apply it.  The amount I use does not weigh down my hair or make it sticky or anything, and when my hair is dry I can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s on my hair but my hair does behave much better.  I do think it helps overall, and that&#x27;s why I keep using it.  I use an additional product (a moisturizing oil from Olay) on the last 3 or 4 inches of my hair because the ends need it…Luxxtress isn&#x27;t quite enough to deal with my dry ends.  But I definitely can tell a difference if I don&#x27;t use the Luxxtress (I see the difference on the top part of my hair), and I&#x27;ve just ordered my 5th or 6th bottle of the stuff.  My last order was in early December, so although I use it daily, at the rate I use it, my previous bottle has lasted a good 6 months and probably won&#x27;t be entirely empty until mid July.  Amazon&#x27;s price is cheaper by at least 5 bucks than the local beauty supply store or my hairdresser, so good deal here!  UPDATE:  I last ordered this in December 2015 for about $11.00.  Today it is $29, so guess I won&#x27;t be ordering this product any more!  I wonder what happened.  Have to find a replacement.</li>
            <li> Such a great product! I&#x27;m able to moisturize my hair and scalp without it feeling greasy!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. And paired with hair oil.. unbeatable. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and my hair is grateful. It&#x27;s never oily like some other leave in items. Luscious hair, smelling good, all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided to change my original review of this. After using it for a week, I realized that it makes my hair smell really bad after it&#x27;s been in my hair for a day. To be honest, the smell reminds me a bit of \\&quot;afro-sheen.\\&quot; Also, while it is very moisturizing, I think it is TOO moisturizing for my fine, thin hair. My hair feels really dirty (and stinks) at the end of the day, after using this product. Perhaps it would work better on someone with very thick, dry hair, but I certainly will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I tried this because the shampoo I use for color treated hair left my hair feeling very dry.  It does moisturize, and it leaves my hair feeling soft.  But it is so limp that it is impossible to style.  It might be good for someone who wears their hair long and straight, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
