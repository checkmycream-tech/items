            <li>Smells like baby powder without a very strong smell and still does the job beautifully.</li>
            <li>It has good smells too.  </li>
            <li>It smells good too.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent dry shampoo and am very happy that I purchased it!  </li>
            <li>just make sure to check the shipping costs, often a good deal is not so good</li>
            <li>I love this!  </li>
            <li>This is a great dry shampoo, probably the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>once you realize that the seller is charging $6 or more for shipping.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything else I found.</li>

            <li>and it was light when I picked it up!  </li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>Meh, didn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>The Umbra brand from Target is better.</li>
            <li>I love that it sprays on like powder.</li>
            <li>I think I need more practice with the spraying of the product.</li>
            <li>You could probably shop around to get a better price.</li>
            <li>My hair looked better.  </li>
            <li>it for my costume as well, goes on perfectly, I have long hair though</li>
            <li>Just as easy to just shampoo, with better results, for me anyway.</li>
            <li>best dry shampoo on the market</li>
            <li>I tried this Klorane dry shampoo and it was awesome.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it smells nicer than the others available</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really tell how good it is or not as of yet.</li>
            <li>Skip the other brands, and get the best.</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair looking super clean and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>and this is fine</li>
            <li>Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;ve been using this happily for the last 5 years to space my washing and styling out 2, even once 3 days...</li>
            <li>It keeps my roots oil free and adds a ton of body to my hair.</li>
            <li>This did the trick and will be great for those times when there is simply no time to take wash hair!</li>
            <li>Klorane makes my hair look even better than when it&#x27;s freshly washed and it increases my volume as well.</li>
            <li>I even use it on freshly washed hair for volume!</li>
            <li>My hair looks freshly washed with this!</li>
            <li>But it does the trick and my hair feels clean and fresh and saves me loads of time in the morning!</li>
            <li>perfect,ks like clean....</li>
            <li>I love love love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>(One product recently was such an awesome price, but the fine print below showed the seller planned to charge $22 to ship...</li>
            <li>It just runs out too fast and it costs more than I want to pay for as often as I use it.</li>
            <li>and it is really clean and quick.</li>
            <li>I had a good 1/4 of a can left, picked it up this morning</li>
            <li>Absolutely hands down the best dry shampoo &amp; it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Too hard to control how much I use, Giovanni brand is the best!</li>
            <li>and the whole can felt oddly light.</li>
            <li>I love this product as I do not wash my hair everyday because I dye it and this product comes in handy.</li>
            <li>, it did not bother my allergies and has just a fresh scent.</li>
            <li>easy to use, leaves no white residue, feels nice and soft, i spray the brush a bit then brush my hair</li>
            <li>Sure Klorane is on the pricier side, but I figure that the money I save in time, hair styling (electricity), shampoo, and the damage daily shampooing and styling does to my hair is SO worth the cost.</li>
            <li>The actual product was good, but the leakage is completely unacceptable.  </li>
            <li>Hands down the best dry shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li>I read the reviews of this product before buying it, and saw that many people said they only got a three or four uses from each can.  </li>
            <li>I used up the whole can in a week!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried many dry shampoos but this one really does make my hair feel clean.</li>
            <li>This being my first time using it</li>
            <li>I noticed it was sailing through the liquid pretty fast, but never thought that it would outright disappear and evaporate overnight!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s first two ingredients are butane and propane.</li>
            <li>It is light, natural and works.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that the bottle isn&#x27;t as large as some others, but you really don&#x27;t need much since you&#x27;re just putting it on your roots.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that I really didn&#x27;t get many uses out of it.</li>
            <li>For the $$$ its a good product as long as you use it properly and shake the can well.</li>
            <li>LOVE this dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s nice to use if my roots are darker than desired for lightening them and adding a little volume.</li>
            <li>Love this product, a little pricey but worth it.  </li>
            <li>works really well with no sticky residue</li>
            <li>Thanks Klorane.</li>
            <li>Klorane really does work as well as the reviews say.</li>
            <li>Just gets me through a day or two if I&#x27;m really pinched for time.</li>
            <li>You dont need much, &amp; you have to hold it 18 in.</li>
            <li>I received this product with much anticipation since this was the most highly recommended dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo was easy to use on them and kept my hair looking a little more fresh.</li>
            <li>Recently I use this one, I don&#x27;t need to clean the powder at all</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo has a good smell but the powder would still be in hair and hard to clean.   </li>
            <li>It smells good, and it works good if you don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair, but the hair gets a little dry and dull, but I would still recommend it to those who are always thight on time</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>No matter how bad my hair looks when I get up, spray this on and it looks great!</li>
            <li>not a lot in this can, but handy for camping or a day you have slept in late.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if thats normal</li>
            <li>My hair looks fresh even on the 2nd day.</li>
            <li>I live alone</li>
            <li>I used it on at a time in the week when my hair was fairly oily and highly weighted down and it works just as advertised, with a fresh sent, little to no residue left over and left my hair as oil free and lifted as possible.</li>
            <li>I used it twice more for a total of 4 times and the can was completely empty.  </li>
            <li>I thought maybe the other reviewers were just using waaay more product each time than necessary.    </li>
            <li>I felt like I had to spray a lot to accomplish anything; my hair felt clean, but definitely not like it does when you actually shampoo.</li>
            <li>thanks to Amazon, as there seem to be very few available over the counter here in the US.</li>
            <li>I grew up with baby fine hair that ends up limp and lifeless after slept on, or in humidity, so for the first 30+ years of my life I had to wash my hair every day if I wanted it to have any body (not to mention the damage I did with perms, etc.) and suffer flat hair when the humidity hit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many others that smell funky, leave flakes, and hardly work.</li>
            <li>Fast forward to two days later</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>Just bought Klorane Dry Shampoo 3.2 oz, surprised to read that the first three ingredients are butane, propane, and isobutane.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised (held out no hope, actually)</li>
            <li>when this Klorane Gentle Dry Shampoo seemed to really make a difference when I had absolutely NO TIME to wash my oily hair!  </li>
            <li>I have not really used this product much.  </li>
            <li>This is the only dry shampoo that smells decent.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have not really used this product much.  </li>
            <li> This is the only dry shampoo that smells decent.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time (which is not the case for some of the more expensive brands).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle, but really fresh smelling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Tresseme&#x27;s dry shampoo, the only one I&#x27;ve found in local stores but found it way to sticky.</li>
            <li> For the price I hoped this bottle would last me a long time but that was not the case.</li>
            <li> It does come out white but as long as you comb it through  and are using it as intended it fades away.</li>
            <li> I used another dry shampoo from the drug store that I didn&#x27;t like and left my hair looking just as oily.  </li>
            <li> as the dry shampoo that made Kirsten Dunst&#x27;s hair white in Marie Antoinette.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a dry shampoo before, so I was nervous about spraying it (over-spraying, actually).</li>
            <li> Dry Shampoo   </li>
            <li> I recommend this dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> no need to style daily, and no greasy, limp hair.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected....</li>
            <li> As in empty.</li>
            <li> Because in fact it was empty.</li>
            <li> I took this to a music festival where there is not much showering.</li>
            <li> It also seems like it&#x27;s probably meant for a few uses based on what&#x27;s left in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have an extremely oily scalp and very dry ends.</li>
            <li> and it was empty!</li>
            <li> know how it would work on dark hair</li>
            <li> I have short hair, so I get several weeks, even a month&#x27;s use out of each can, so not too expensive, considering what I&#x27;ve been known to spend on products for my hair...</li>
            <li> The product evaporates and has less than 10 uses.</li>
            <li> just sometimes it made my scalp a little itchy.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product as I do not wash my hair everyday because I dye it and this product comes in handy.</li>
            <li> This is a great dry shampoo, probably the best I&#x27;ve tried. It just runs out too fast and it costs more than I want to pay for as often as I use it. Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> I used another dry shampoo from the drug store that I didn&#x27;t like and left my hair looking just as oily.  This made my hair look fuller and like it was just washed.  Excellent product.  Heard about it from a womans&#x27; magazine.</li>
            <li> It smells good, and it works good if you don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair, but the hair gets a little dry and dull, but I would still recommend it to those who are always thight on time</li>
            <li> I grew up with baby fine hair that ends up limp and lifeless after slept on, or in humidity, so for the first 30+ years of my life I had to wash my hair every day if I wanted it to have any body (not to mention the damage I did with perms, etc.) and suffer flat hair when the humidity hit. I&#x27;ve tried Tresseme&#x27;s dry shampoo, the only one I&#x27;ve found in local stores but found it way to sticky. I love this stuff, it smells nicer than the others available (I&#x27;ve tried them all and came back to Klorane) thanks to Amazon, as there seem to be very few available over the counter here in the US. Sure Klorane is on the pricier side, but I figure that the money I save in time, hair styling (electricity), shampoo, and the damage daily shampooing and styling does to my hair is SO worth the cost. Plus, if you watch on Amazon.com, sellers often have deals...just make sure to check the shipping costs, often a good deal is not so good once you realize that the seller is charging $6 or more for shipping. (One product recently was such an awesome price, but the fine print below showed the seller planned to charge $22 to ship...not sure where they were shipping from, but I don&#x27;t need any kitchen item THAT bad!)    All in all, I&#x27;ve been using this happily for the last 5 years to space my washing and styling out 2, even once 3 days...I have short hair, so I get several weeks, even a month&#x27;s use out of each can, so not too expensive, considering what I&#x27;ve been known to spend on products for my hair...no need to style daily, and no greasy, limp hair. I don&#x27;g know how it would work on dark hair, I&#x27;m blonde and can see the powder in my hair if I don&#x27;t brush it out well, but I imagine brushing it well would eradicate that.</li>
            <li> Instant noticeable difference in eliminating some oil at the roots.</li>
            <li> LOVE this dry shampoo! I have an extremely oily scalp and very dry ends. When I use this shampoo I can go 3 days without washing. It keeps my roots oil free and adds a ton of body to my hair. I even use it on freshly washed hair for volume!</li>
            <li> not a lot in this can, but handy for camping or a day you have slept in late. U cant tell i didnt wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works better than anything else I found. Smells like baby powder without a very strong smell and still does the job beautifully.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo has a good smell but the powder would still be in hair and hard to clean.   Recently I use this one, I don&#x27;t need to clean the powder at all and it is really clean and quick.It has good smells too.  Faciano Dry Shampoo   [...]</li>
            <li> Just bought Klorane Dry Shampoo 3.2 oz, surprised to read that the first three ingredients are butane, propane, and isobutane.  Wish I had seen this instead of relying on the manufacturer&#x27;s misleading ingredient description.  If I wanted to douse my head in cigarette lighter fluid and liquid gas, I could just use what I have at home.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work miracles but I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  I even used it after a greasy massage and it made my hair look a lot less horrible!</li>
            <li> perfect,ks like clean....</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of this product before buying it, and saw that many people said they only got a three or four uses from each can.  After ordering the Klorane and using it once, I thought to myself \\&quot;what are those reviewers talking about? the can is still practically full!\\&quot;  I used it again two days later and still had plenty of product left in the can.  I thought maybe the other reviewers were just using waaay more product each time than necessary.    Fast forward to two days later, I went to use the can and it was light when I picked it up!  The product had somehow escaped from the can!  I used it twice more for a total of 4 times and the can was completely empty.  I&#x27;m not sure what causes it, but the design of this spray can allows product leakage.    The actual product was good, but the leakage is completely unacceptable.  I used up the whole can in a week!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried many dry shampoos but this one really does make my hair feel clean. It works well and gives me some volume too. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that I really didn&#x27;t get many uses out of it. For the price I hoped this bottle would last me a long time but that was not the case. But it does the trick and my hair feels clean and fresh and saves me loads of time in the morning!</li>
            <li> I received this product with much anticipation since this was the most highly recommended dry shampoo. I have red colored hair and was advised to wash it as infrequently as possible to sustain the color. I used it on at a time in the week when my hair was fairly oily and highly weighted down and it works just as advertised, with a fresh sent, little to no residue left over and left my hair as oil free and lifted as possible. The only, and in my opinion, biggest issue is that it only lasted for TWO uses. This being my first time using it I don&#x27;t know if thats normal but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again for this reason. If I did I would have to order at least 6 to last the month, which is pricey and unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best dry shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used as the dry shampoo that made Kirsten Dunst&#x27;s hair white in Marie Antoinette.&lt;br /&gt;Used it for my costume as well, goes on perfectly, I have long hair though so I had&lt;br /&gt;to use 2-3 bottles.</li>
            <li> I have not really used this product much.  Can&#x27;t really tell how good it is or not as of yet.</li>
            <li> works really well with no sticky residue</li>
            <li> I love this!  My hair looks freshly washed with this! No matter how bad my hair looks when I get up, spray this on and it looks great!</li>
            <li> Too hard to control how much I use, Giovanni brand is the best!</li>
            <li> I needed a product I could use while in the hospital and unable to wash my hair. This did the trick and will be great for those times when there is simply no time to take wash hair!</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;ve used many others that smell funky, leave flakes, and hardly work. This leaves my hair looking super clean and it smells nice. I hate that it&#x27;s so expensive but its worth it.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is me but looked like it dulled my hair. Just as easy to just shampoo, with better results, for me anyway.</li>
            <li> I got maybe 4 uses out of this product. I noticed it was sailing through the liquid pretty fast, but never thought that it would outright disappear and evaporate overnight! I had a good 1/4 of a can left, picked it up this morning and it was empty!</li>
            <li> best dry shampoo on the market</li>
            <li> Absolutely hands down the best dry shampoo &amp; it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected....</li>
            <li> For the $$$ its a good product as long as you use it properly and shake the can well. Lasts a long time (which is not the case for some of the more expensive brands). It does come out white but as long as you comb it through  and are using it as intended it fades away. I will buy this product again (and I have used MANY brands that I will not buy again--cheap and expensive)</li>
            <li> easy to use, leaves no white residue, feels nice and soft, i spray the brush a bit then brush my hair</li>
            <li> I used it 2 days after I bought it at the local beauty supply store. I pushed the spray can button about 3-4 times for one second max each. In total about 3-4 seconds of usage. It worked well that day. A week later I was about to use it again and the whole can felt oddly light. As in empty. Because in fact it was empty. The can must have been leaking, although there was no residue in the in my bathroom cabinet or the spray button cover. I live alone so it&#x27;s not like anyone but my cat could have used it. In short: $18 up the butt. Thanks Klorane.</li>
            <li> Klorane really does work as well as the reviews say. It&#x27;s true that the bottle isn&#x27;t as large as some others, but you really don&#x27;t need much since you&#x27;re just putting it on your roots. I used Pssst before and it did work well, just sometimes it made my scalp a little itchy. Klorane makes my hair look even better than when it&#x27;s freshly washed and it increases my volume as well. The smell is also wonderful. It&#x27;s subtle, but really fresh smelling. I love this product and I&#x27;ve been converted.</li>
            <li> I tried this Klorane dry shampoo and it was awesome.  Just gets me through a day or two if I&#x27;m really pinched for time.</li>
            <li> I took this to a music festival where there is not much showering. My bangs occasionally develop that &amp;#34;oh so sexy&amp;#34; greasy look. This dry shampoo was easy to use on them and kept my hair looking a little more fresh. Of course, after 5 days, there&#x27;s nothing that works quite as well as a shower.</li>
            <li> Meh, didn&#x27;t love it. The Umbra brand from Target is better.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent dry shampoo and am very happy that I purchased it!  It works great in a pinch!</li>
            <li> I love love love this dry shampoo. My hair gets greasy by the end of the day and I put this in and does wonders! It is the best one out there!</li>
            <li> It works great! But it&#x27;s first two ingredients are butane and propane.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully and arrived quickly! I love that it sprays on like powder. My hair looks fresh even on the 2nd day. Sometimes it&#x27;s nice to use if my roots are darker than desired for lightening them and adding a little volume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a dry shampoo before, so I was nervous about spraying it (over-spraying, actually). But after 2 trials... I got the gist of it. You dont need much, &amp; you have to hold it 18 in. away from your scalp, at least. After you comb it through thoroughly-- you can tell the difference. It smells good too. Its great to use after a workout! It doesn&#x27;t leave that powdery residue if used correctly! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I used the product once.  I think I need more practice with the spraying of the product. I&#x27;m sensitive to smells and this is fine, it did not bother my allergies and has just a fresh scent. I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ll stop looking for another product just yet. It also seems like it&#x27;s probably meant for a few uses based on what&#x27;s left in the bottle.  I felt like I had to spray a lot to accomplish anything; my hair felt clean, but definitely not like it does when you actually shampoo.</li>
            <li> The product evaporates and has less than 10 uses.</li>
            <li> This is the only dry shampoo that smells decent.  It is light, natural and works.  The ingredients are not harmful Skip the other brands, and get the best.</li>
            <li> Love this product, a little pricey but worth it.  Works well.  You could probably shop around to get a better price.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised (held out no hope, actually) when this Klorane Gentle Dry Shampoo seemed to really make a difference when I had absolutely NO TIME to wash my oily hair!  Now, it doesn&#x27;t make it look like I just washed it, but when I am that desperate, ANY improvement is greatly appreciated.  My hair looked better.  I recommend this dry shampoo!</li>
