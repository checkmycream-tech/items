            <li>I love it when my husband tells me my hair smells good.</li>
            <li>Smells good, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the very strong, rather musky smell -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many times with varying amounts, from pea to nickel size) and D)</li>
            <li>I have used this for years and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky, crunchy, or oily.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, there are better products out there.</li>
            <li>I love this gel and my husband does too.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>(I find it to be a bit lighter than many foams)</li>
            <li>Pleased.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and light weight of this product...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite because it is light but crunchy.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong but seemed to lessen after I applied it to my hair.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong, so I don&#x27;t use alot of it.  </li>
            <li>However, kind of a funny scent.</li>
            <li>but it was fine.</li>
            <li>I love all the Aveda products for the same reason, and all their products smell nice!</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair, and without product, it&#x27;s wispy and all over the place, even without wind.</li>
            <li>It holds nicely, and makes my hair really shiny.</li>
            <li>Great product for BIG hair!</li>
            <li>Nice texture and my hair wasn&#x27;t real sticky.</li>
            <li>Great for short hair.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair for the most part, but the reason I love this product is that is non-sticky and does not add bulk to the hair....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried other Aveda styling products, Phytomollient and Brilliant Pomade to name two, and didn&#x27;t like them either.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell and great hold without being stiff!  </li>
            <li>Though to be fair, I don&#x27;t really use much products on my hair.</li>
            <li>Ants will probably attack it in my garbage, the smell is so sickly sweet.  </li>
            <li>Has a wonderful hold for my bob style hair, I have thick hair and my husband has thin-ing hair and this product</li>
            <li>It has a fresh clean spa like fragrance which people at the gym notice.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I do like the fragrance, although it dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li>sticky, felt like plastic, and still super frizzy.</li>
            <li>Ok, so normally I don&#x27;t review, but I have to here.</li>
            <li>Although I get good results from this product when the weather is fine, it&#x27;s almost silly to have to restrict its use to perfectly sunny, low humidity days.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for a blow dry</li>
            <li>Basically, I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>The smell of confixor is intoxicating to me and the product works well with my fine hair even now that it&#x27;s much thinner than when I first used confixor.  </li>
            <li>also covers my grey hair - a nice</li>
            <li>The vendor, Lush Essence, shipped very quickly which I appreciate.  </li>
            <li>I love Aveda products--this is very nice smelling and lasts a long time since you have to use so little of it.  </li>
            <li>I like this product very much</li>
            <li>I love the way Aveda Confixor Gel gives my hair extra body and control.  </li>
            <li>Confixor has a heady herby-flowery smell that may overwhelm you at first, but then you become comforted by it.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>I used the Madder Root shampoo and conditioner for years, mainly because I liked the fragrance, although they didn&#x27;t really add red tones to my color treated hair like they&#x27;re supposed to.  </li>
            <li>it does seems to dry ones hair out a bit but smells wonderful and truthfully I have used it with a couple other products now for several years - so drying my hair out or not I keep coming back to it.</li>
            <li>The ONLY thing that makes my fine hair</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 15 years on my fine, short, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t found a product that I like as much.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use too much</li>
            <li>Whether I want to wear my hair curly or straight, confixor makes it happen and always makes my hair look thicker.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had much luck with Aveda products.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper on Amazon than in salons.</li>
            <li>Makes hair very manageable</li>
            <li>/&gt;Start with sopping wet, combed hair, then liberally massage in the leave-in conditioner then comb 1 more time to get it all in there.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mean in a good way, this stuff smells like rancid chamomile tea.  </li>
            <li>Confixor is more liquid than a typical hair gel, as the term liquigel suggests.  </li>
            <li>Just enough control for short permed hair and the fragrance is lovely.</li>
            <li>and I feel I need to wash every night with that particular product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have used Aveda Confixor for quite a few years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I tried product after product and would have to goop up my hair to a stiff consistency just to keep the top from frizzing.</li>
            <li>Cant live without it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down at all.  </li>
            <li>I try to wash my hair only every other day to keep it healthy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had anyone not love the way it smells, and these days, many people are fragrance haters, scolding people for wearing cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I WOULD recommend for use on my type of hair - Redken 08 liquid, Versastyler (the old formula, not the new stuff), Aquage uplifting mousse, and Thermafuse eSculpt.  </li>
            <li>Have short grey hair and it spikes it fabulously</li>
            <li>I have curly hair that is not very thick.  </li>
            <li>I also have fine curly hair and this is a god-sent, using it for a few months now.</li>
            <li>Then this gel goes in, with a little extra for the top of the head.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair so soft</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, this gel gives me those defined ringlets: springy curls that still feel soft and touchable.</li>
            <li>Used with the Aveda Be Curly style prep, or without, this will do wonders for natural curl.</li>
            <li>The problem with fine and thin hair is that most products weigh it down, and flatten it.</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t control frizz at all and on some high humidity days, my hair will swell up and look like a giant poofball.  </li>
            <li>I was a little upset about having to pay postage since we are prime carriers but it was still worth it.</li>
            <li>I have long fine curly hair (2b) that goes limp in the winter and frizzed in the summer.  </li>
            <li>certainly not if you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrance, even if it&#x27;s from natural sources.  </li>
            <li>Now I wash my hair in the morning and apply the Confixor (generous amount) to my above-the-shoulder-length hair and let it dry naturally into ringlets.</li>
            <li>This gel is a liquid, so it is not thick like other gels.</li>
            <li>It does give some light hold and it isn&#x27;t sticky or stiff and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>

            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t control frizz at all and on some high humidity days, my hair will swell up and look like a giant poofball.  </li>
            <li> I was a little upset about having to pay postage since we are prime carriers but it was still worth it.</li>
            <li> I have long fine curly hair (2b) that goes limp in the winter and frizzed in the summer.  </li>
            <li> certainly not if you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrance, even if it&#x27;s from natural sources.  </li>
            <li> Now I wash my hair in the morning and apply the Confixor (generous amount) to my above-the-shoulder-length hair and let it dry naturally into ringlets.</li>
            <li> This gel is a liquid, so it is not thick like other gels.</li>
            <li> It does give some light hold and it isn&#x27;t sticky or stiff and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> It gives my curls shine and definition and a little really does go a long way; I&#x27;ve had my bottle forever.</li>
            <li> I do a beach wave in my long locks and this is the only stuff that keeps the wave, without being sticky!</li>
            <li> This product really helps my thin straight hair to achieve volume and hold style, with out weighting my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I expect to pay around $20 a bottle, but it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It keeps my naturally curly hair under control without feeling sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> , I am a product junkie but am lazy about blowdrying and other styling tools, too much work.  </li>
            <li> but I also like it in damp hair that I will let &#x27;air dry&#x27;</li>
            <li> it works only for a day, then my hair turn very dry and crunchy, so I have to look for other products.</li>
            <li> It is convenient to find and order on Amazon since I live in a small town and there are only a few department stores that sell this.</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive but it just takes a little bit and the fragrance is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I use a Jessicurl curl lotion (CC or RR) after conditioning and put lots of Confixor in while my hair is still soaking wet and then scrunch with a microfiber towel to get ringlets/spirals.  </li>
            <li> I may try that as my current root spray is a bit heavy</li>
            <li> I got this about 2 days after I placed my order, which was quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li> I also can&#x27;t speak for how well it works on other types of hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want other people to wonder what that smell is.  </li>
            <li> Feel like there is an opaque film of gunk on your hair that makes it look worse than if you had just air dried it straight out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> people who hate scent on other people love Confixor&#x27;s smell.</li>
            <li> However, one of the bottles was substantially less than the other bottles.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Confixer for 15 years,occasionally try other brands and have always returned to Confixer!</li>
            <li> Want a very loose hold with excessive greasiness and</li>
            <li> I tried the Confixor Gel because after a few days of using the Aveda Retexturing Gel felt like it was weighing my hair down</li>
            <li> use a little at a time.  </li>
            <li> Use it daily to give my thin hair that little lift.</li>
            <li> Eventually, I&#x27;ll use it up, but I consider this purchase a waste.  </li>
            <li> With this product not weighing my hair down it is possible, as long as I don&#x27;t go crazy with hair spray and root volumizer.  </li>
            <li> heavy or stiff.</li>
            <li> I halve my hair, twist each half into a bun, and squeeze out the excess water, Do Not use a towel!</li>
            <li> Seriously, aside from the fragrance, it provides my hair with control, shine, and helps it to look twice as thick as it actually is.</li>
            <li> It does not get stiff and can be reactivated with a water spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> and it is not easy to find here.</li>
            <li> so I was afraid the product would be old</li>
            <li> big expensive</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> The vendor I purchased this from was a little less expensive</li>
            <li> and it was hard to wash out.</li>
            <li> This product has been hard to find in shops.</li>
            <li> Then I scrunch it with gelled hands to activate the curls again, and let the curls air-dry, or using cold air blow dryer if your rushed (but it&#x27;s not the same).</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this and will have to look at other suppliers before ordering again.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for at least 15 years &amp; nothing can compare!  </li>
            <li> It is expensive though</li>
            <li> Thank goodness it wasn&#x27;t too terribly expensive</li>
            <li> I wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive these days.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not really impressed with this product and will not repurchase it.  </li>
            <li> I use this product because I have very thin hair; it helps with the styling.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is just how this product smells or something happened to it, but it smells like a bad cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> I hate sprays.</li>
            <li> Horrible stuff.  </li>
            <li> For my hair this was the worst product to buy it did not do anything it said it would do.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Received item in a timely fashion.  However, one of the bottles was substantially less than the other bottles.  The contents was below the Aveda label. Not impressed with this and will have to look at other suppliers before ordering again.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing.  Keeps my hair so soft</li>
            <li> a good standby for holding a style nice aroma</li>
            <li> I use this product because I have very thin hair; it helps with the styling.  It is expensive though but I haven&#x27;t found a product that I like as much.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for at least 15 years &amp; nothing can compare!  It has a fresh clean spa like fragrance which people at the gym notice.</li>
            <li> I tried the Confixor Gel because after a few days of using the Aveda Retexturing Gel felt like it was weighing my hair down and it was hard to wash out. The Confixor Gel is really a nice gel. The smell is strong but seemed to lessen after I applied it to my hair. This gel is a liquid, so it is not thick like other gels. It holds nicely, and makes my hair really shiny. I am going to pick up a bottle of this today from Aveda. I am using this one from now on.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair for the most part, but the reason I love this product is that is non-sticky and does not add bulk to the hair....actually, I don&#x27;t know that it is in my hair.  I can&#x27;t imagine going to another product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Aveda products, love this one</li>
            <li> I love the way Aveda Confixor Gel gives my hair extra body and control.  The product has a great scent, too!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is just how this product smells or something happened to it, but it smells like a bad cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> Cant live without it.</li>
            <li> I have used Aveda Confixor for quite a few years and love it.  Just enough control for short permed hair and the fragrance is lovely.</li>
            <li> My life pre-Confixor was one battle with my white girl afro after another. Life in my moist midwestern city was a frizz-fest. I tried product after product and would have to goop up my hair to a stiff consistency just to keep the top from frizzing. Then came Confixor. Now I wash my hair in the morning and apply the Confixor (generous amount) to my above-the-shoulder-length hair and let it dry naturally into ringlets. My hair is shiny, not fuzzy.</li>
            <li> Wow.  This gel is great if you want your hair to:  A) Have NO shine whatsoever.  B) Smell like an herbal field, and I don&#x27;t mean in a good way, this stuff smells like rancid chamomile tea.  C) Want a very loose hold with excessive greasiness and NO I didn&#x27;t use too much I&#x27;ve tried many times with varying amounts, from pea to nickel size) and D) Feel like there is an opaque film of gunk on your hair that makes it look worse than if you had just air dried it straight out of the shower.  Horrible stuff.  Thank goodness it wasn&#x27;t too terribly expensive, I am tossing the bottle out.  Ants will probably attack it in my garbage, the smell is so sickly sweet.  For reference, I have 3A type curly hair.  What I WOULD recommend for use on my type of hair - Redken 08 liquid, Versastyler (the old formula, not the new stuff), Aquage uplifting mousse, and Thermafuse eSculpt.  These aren&#x27;t as gunky and filmy, and won&#x27;t leave you smelling like rancid chamomile tea.</li>
            <li> The smell of confixor is intoxicating to me and the product works well with my fine hair even now that it&#x27;s much thinner than when I first used confixor.  Confixor gives hold and smells great. I wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive these days.  The vendor I purchased this from was a little less expensive so I was afraid the product would be old but it was fine.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and love it. It is a bit expensive but it just takes a little bit and the fragrance is fantastic. I love it when my husband tells me my hair smells good.</li>
            <li> I love Aveda products--this is very nice smelling and lasts a long time since you have to use so little of it.  It keeps my naturally curly hair under control without feeling sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> The ONLY thing that makes my fine hair&lt;br /&gt; behave !</li>
            <li> It works well, it styles my hair amazingly and I do like its smell, but .. it works only for a day, then my hair turn very dry and crunchy, so I have to look for other products.</li>
            <li> This product helps style without adding alot of weight on your hair!  I love all the Aveda products for the same reason, and all their products smell nice!</li>
            <li> Nice smell and great hold without being stiff!  Love this product and would recommend it to others for flexible hold!</li>
            <li> Oh how I hope Aveda doesn&#x27;t stop making this.  I have long fine curly hair (2b) that goes limp in the winter and frizzed in the summer.  I use a Jessicurl curl lotion (CC or RR) after conditioning and put lots of Confixor in while my hair is still soaking wet and then scrunch with a microfiber towel to get ringlets/spirals.  It does not get stiff and can be reactivated with a water spray bottle.  Confixor is more liquid than a typical hair gel, as the term liquigel suggests.  This does a superior job at bringing out the curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I am a product junkie but am lazy about blowdrying and other styling tools, too much work.  I expect to find a good product and then it do the work, and this does.  Confixor has a heady herby-flowery smell that may overwhelm you at first, but then you become comforted by it.  It is the smell of Aveda quality and similar to their lotions and bottled fragrances. I expect to pay around $20 a bottle, but it lasts a long time. It&#x27;s your hair; don&#x27;t skimp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Aveda is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> Has a wonderful hold for my bob style hair, I have thick hair and my husband has thin-ing hair and this product works great for the both of us.&lt;br /&gt;Not heavy or stiff.</li>
            <li> This product really helps my thin straight hair to achieve volume and hold style, with out weighting my hair down.  I try to wash my hair only every other day to keep it healthy.  With this product not weighing my hair down it is possible, as long as I don&#x27;t go crazy with hair spray and root volumizer.  Plus you don&#x27;t need to add anymore on the second day, it still works.&lt;br /&gt;  Aveda also makes a root spray, that the stylist who introduced the product to me also applied.  I may try that as my current root spray is a bit heavy and I feel I need to wash every night with that particular product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have curly hair that is not very thick.  Whether I want to wear my hair curly or straight, confixor makes it happen and always makes my hair look thicker.  It&#x27;s not sticky, and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot so it lasts a while.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have been using Confixer for 15 years,occasionally try other brands and have always returned to Confixer! Great product for BIG hair!</li>
            <li> For my hair this was the worst product to buy it did not do anything it said it would do.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and light weight of this product... it also doesn&#x27;t flake!</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair, and without product, it&#x27;s wispy and all over the place, even without wind. The problem with fine and thin hair is that most products weigh it down, and flatten it. The after shampoo &#x27;&#x27;fixer&#x27;&#x27; is divine. The fragrance, alone,  is intoxicating. I&#x27;ve never had anyone not love the way it smells, and these days, many people are fragrance haters, scolding people for wearing cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even people who hate scent on other people love Confixor&#x27;s smell. The only way to describe it is like the rain forest, or how the Garden of Eden smells. Seriously, aside from the fragrance, it provides my hair with control, shine, and helps it to look twice as thick as it actually is.</li>
            <li> Best stuff around for having &#x27;non crunchy&#x27; curly hair.  The curls come out perfectly with this gel, and I loooove the scent of it.  I got this about 2 days after I placed my order, which was quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I used to have to drive 15 miles to get this product. I was a little upset about having to pay postage since we are prime carriers but it was still worth it. It was just delivered to my door. WONDERFUL</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Smells good, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 15 years on my fine, short, curly hair.  I love the way it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky, crunchy, or oily.  It gives my curls shine and definition and a little really does go a long way; I&#x27;ve had my bottle forever. It&#x27;s one of the only products I have that I would definitely re-purchase unless they change the formula.</li>
            <li> it does seems to dry ones hair out a bit but smells wonderful and truthfully I have used it with a couple other products now for several years - so drying my hair out or not I keep coming back to it.</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair. I hate sprays. I use a tiny bit every day and the bottle will last you forever.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for 15 years.  Great product</li>
            <li> Nice texture and my hair wasn&#x27;t real sticky. However, kind of a funny scent. Not too manly.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and a very good price.</li>
            <li> The vendor, Lush Essence, shipped very quickly which I appreciate.  I like this product very much and it is not easy to find here.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products around</li>
            <li> I use this gel when I use a diffuser on my wavy hair.  It does give some light hold and it isn&#x27;t sticky or stiff and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  However, it doesn&#x27;t control frizz at all and on some high humidity days, my hair will swell up and look like a giant poofball.  So I have to use it on days when the weather cooperates.  I do like the fragrance, although it dissipates quickly.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not really impressed with this product and will not repurchase it.  I haven&#x27;t had much luck with Aveda products.  I used the Madder Root shampoo and conditioner for years, mainly because I liked the fragrance, although they didn&#x27;t really add red tones to my color treated hair like they&#x27;re supposed to.  I&#x27;ve also tried other Aveda styling products, Phytomollient and Brilliant Pomade to name two, and didn&#x27;t like them either.  I&#x27;ve had the bottle of Confixor gel for some time and only use it every once in a while when I know the humidity outside is going to be low.  Eventually, I&#x27;ll use it up, but I consider this purchase a waste.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product if frizz is a concern and certainly not if you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrance, even if it&#x27;s from natural sources.  Although I get good results from this product when the weather is fine, it&#x27;s almost silly to have to restrict its use to perfectly sunny, low humidity days.  Who knows when the weather will turn?  In my opinion, there are better products out there.</li>
            <li> I have used this before and then could not find it...It is good for all type of hair but it is especially good on fine hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Use it daily to give my thin hair that little lift. Much cheaper on Amazon than in salons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using confixor for YEARS and it&#x27;s still the best product I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work for my hair and I did read all the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;A big expensive disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;Can I return it?</li>
            <li> Makes hair very manageable</li>
            <li> Pros:  smells good  works well in hair for a curly look  not greasy    cons  sticky if you put a lot in.  use a little at a time.  price</li>
            <li> This liquid gel smells earthy and wonderful.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down at all.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this gel and my husband does too. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> Ok, so normally I don&#x27;t review, but I have to here. I also have fine curly hair and this is a god-sent, using it for a few months now. I ran out and had to switch back to another gel for a trip and I immediately noticed the difference: sticky, felt like plastic, and still super frizzy. Meanwhile, this gel gives me those defined ringlets: springy curls that still feel soft and touchable. I use it with It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In conditioner. Here&#x27;s how:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start with sopping wet, combed hair, then liberally massage in the leave-in conditioner then comb 1 more time to get it all in there. Then this gel goes in, with a little extra for the top of the head. I halve my hair, twist each half into a bun, and squeeze out the excess water, Do Not use a towel! Then I scrunch it with gelled hands to activate the curls again, and let the curls air-dry, or using cold air blow dryer if your rushed (but it&#x27;s not the same).</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 15 years. It is convenient to find and order on Amazon since I live in a small town and there are only a few department stores that sell this. The price is good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the very strong, rather musky smell - my husband thought I had put on man&#x27;s cologne. It does not work well with coarse, frizzy, wavy hair. That said, my evaluation of the smell is subjective. Some might like it. I also can&#x27;t speak for how well it works on other types of hair.</li>
            <li> been using for over 20 yrs.&lt;br /&gt;it also covers my grey hair - a nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;I do not want to evert run out of this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s good for a blow dry (I find it to be a bit lighter than many foams) but I also like it in damp hair that I will let &#x27;air dry&#x27; - gives a bit of body and a touch of that &#x27;seaside&#x27; look</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE the Aveda Confixor! Be so blessed this afternoon!</li>
            <li> Used with the Aveda Be Curly style prep, or without, this will do wonders for natural curl. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered. Pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this. Have short grey hair and it spikes it fabulously</li>
            <li> Good stuff, been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I use this along with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Foaming Pomade, and it makes my curls look great and controls frizz. Item came as described.</li>
            <li> This product has been hard to find in shops. It&#x27;s my favorite because it is light but crunchy. Great for short hair.</li>
            <li> My husbands favorite hair product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this product makes any difference in the way that I can style my hair.  The scent is strong, so I don&#x27;t use alot of it.  I don&#x27;t want other people to wonder what that smell is.  Basically, I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Let us just say, it is sitting under my sink not being used.  Though to be fair, I don&#x27;t really use much products on my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best for curls! I do a beach wave in my long locks and this is the only stuff that keeps the wave, without being sticky!</li>
