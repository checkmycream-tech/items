    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I will say that the Clarisonic Skin Care brush is the greatest thing since sliced bread.</li>
            <li>great device!!</li>
            <li>With the algae serum it is excellent.  </li>
            <li>I will never have perfect skin, but I know that I have the best skin I can!</li>
            <li>Very good customer service from Clarisonic as well.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s best to buy your products at Sephora because they have a great return policy.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hook the consumer with a great product like the Clarisonic skin cleansing system and then put out a piece of junk like the Opal.  </li>
            <li>If you follow the directions it works great.</li>
            <li>Very nice tool.</li>
            <li>I used the Opal for a month and loved it.</li>
            <li>The service it good.</li>
            <li>It has been a good investment.  </li>
            <li>this awesome helps my makeup look more natural and beautiful!  </li>
            <li>I just received the clarisonic opal sonic infusion system and I love it!  </li>
            <li>I personally love this product!</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>I was happy with it -easy to use, soothing and seemed to reduce the puffiness that comes with hay fever season.  </li>
            <li>The device is actually nice</li>
            <li>but I need some visible improvement to spend this kind of money.</li>
            <li>They were incredibly nice</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t bother with their serum, as I have my own I prefer, and I do feel the difference.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own?).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving my Opal system.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with both products.</li>
            <li>What I need:)</li>
            <li>I knew I would probably return this when I bought it, since I had already tried it once at a Sephora but decided I needed some more time.  </li>
            <li>I was really upset because I was so happy with the results I saw</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t ask for better than that.</li>
            <li>My eyes feel a lot more hydrated than from when I just tap my product on.</li>
            <li>I decided that it probably wouldn&#x27;t happen to me and that perhaps people weren&#x27;t being exactly truthful in their reviews.  </li>
            <li>I love my Clarisonic Opal.</li>
            <li>The effect needs more time to show up.</li>
            <li>The vibrating rubber cup infuses the serum into the skin and not just on top.  </li>
            <li>I also use it on my top lip.  </li>
            <li>I use it for 60 seconds on each eye and 30 seconds on my top lip.  </li>
            <li>I just want to be able to go without makeup and not be ashamed of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have bought it soem year ago, works pretty fine, just the serum that comes with it, gets old, very easily, so I had to use my own serum!!</li>
            <li>The Clarisonic Infusion System is easy to use and it appears to me that some of my wrinkles have disappeared.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the opal for one month, and have seen some improvement in my fine lines.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve been using it now twice a day for 5 days and the device is working fine.</li>
            <li>the device is amazing, it really makes the area around the eyes smoother.</li>
            <li>Significant improvement in crows feet and appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li>I believe treatments from plastic surgeons would probably be more effective, not necessarily eye surgery.</li>
            <li>So far, I really love it!</li>
            <li>I recently purchased the Opal because I loved the results I got when my aesthetician used it for an eye treatment.</li>
            <li>There is some instant hydration that can be achieved with a good eye cream.  </li>
            <li>It was charged the full 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>I love this product it has made a big difference in the fine lines around my eyes!</li>
            <li>It charges quickly and keeps a charge for about 24 applications.  </li>
            <li>The charging unit became very hot and the Opal device never could be recharged.  </li>
            <li>LOVE, love Clarisonic Products and am incredibly happy with the fact that they stand behind their products!</li>
            <li>Great product, however the only downer was that I wished I&#x27;d realised I&#x27;d need one of those universal plugs to be able to recharge it in Australia.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great since I am not a spa/salon type in a few min at home</li>
            <li>my smile lines disappear and I use it around my eyes every so often.</li>
            <li>I own the clarisonic face brush, and I love it so much, with such visible results (especially just touching my face) after I use it, I decided to give the Opal a try.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fun to use.  </li>
            <li>Good for puffy morning eyes, but does not really do anything for wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;During the time I had it, the tips stayed pretty intact, and I rarely had to replace them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe I can return it now, but I will right to the company &amp; complain.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before I purchased the Opal I read tons of reviews and chose to ignore those that stated their unit broke almost right away.  </li>
            <li>and if you are just looking for improvements and not dramatic results, then pay the price and GET ONE!</li>
            <li>However, the first time I needed to charge it -that was the end.  </li>
            <li>I am willing to give it another try.</li>
            <li>For someone with deep crow&#x27;s feet it might be more helpful.  </li>
            <li>and it really does work!</li>
            <li>This is my first review.</li>
            <li>The cost of this item is high &amp; it should not have fallen apart so quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have used the device with the serum on one eye for more than a week and see absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li>When I set the opal back onto the magnetic charger there was no charge light.  </li>
            <li>much money did I spend on this?  </li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>It is like your ring finger gently patting it in, times 100.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It really has made a difference to my skin</li>
            <li>I also have not been able to reach the seller that I purchased it from due to lack of information sent with my Opal when it arrived.  </li>
            <li>oh, I still have my crow&#x27;s feet (because I like to laugh and smile) but the smaller wrinkles are definitely less prominent.  </li>
            <li>I try to be realistic....</li>
            <li>so I had high hopes for this</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t claim that this will work for everyone, because we&#x27;re all different, but it has worked for me and was worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the Opal long enougjh to give it a true rating.</li>
            <li>My other thought was that I use a sonic tooth brush, which cleans my teeth far more adequately than a regular one, so I am hooked on the idea for sonic in general!</li>
            <li>and I had a new Opal in one week.</li>
            <li>I think this time I will just return it and not get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW</li>
            <li>The blue light that was supposed to flash while charging went on briefly and then stopped.  </li>
            <li>The first I charged for 24 hours- blinking blue light, then solid blue when I removed it.</li>
            <li>I was sooooo excited to use it, I pressed the button and it made a slight hum (the \\&quot;head\\&quot; did not move/vibrate- nothing).</li>
            <li>I would steer clear.</li>
            <li>I would like to get another, but I am not sure if it would be worth it since it seems to have almost doubled in price since I bought my first one.</li>
            <li>I have nothing else to ad except would buy it again good purchase but expensive</li>
            <li>SAME THING HAPPENED TO MY NEW ONE!</li>
            <li>two areas, for me, that feel less than adequately hydrated.</li>
            <li>So, I took it back to Sephora and exchanged it for a new one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and my reason for getting this item was not only preventative, but to also treat puffiness, dark circles and fine lines underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li>My dark circles have also improved pretty dramatically which was a surprise since I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different things.</li>
            <li>it seems to be a major problem, possibly a factory defect.  </li>
            <li>If I could have bought the device without the serum for less, I certainly would have preferred that, but</li>

            <li> If I could have bought the device without the serum for less, I certainly would have preferred that, but</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure who is responsible to keep the product advertisement up to date and current, but this product does not come with a pouch as featured in the photo.</li>
            <li> Now  I am super annoyed.</li>
            <li> I was really concerned about some of the negative feedback regarding the Opal unit.</li>
            <li> On my 3rd warranty exchange due to charging issues.  </li>
            <li> I have seen very little difference in the dark circles under my eyes, which is the main reason I spent $200 on this machine.</li>
            <li> I had to return 2 Black OPALS in the last 5 days.  </li>
            <li> But, with any facial product you have to be willing to invest the time in using it everyday or it will not give you dramatic results.</li>
            <li> When I get out of the shower I use my clarisonic opal before I put on any other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> well maybe I didn&#x27;t charge it properly, maybe it is the wall socket I used, maybe the charging cord came loose (ridiculous, I know...</li>
            <li> I thought it might help my dark under eye circles, but it hasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> The only negative issue is that it was advertised with a travel pouch, which it did not come with .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had dark circles.  </li>
            <li> The Opal has reduced the bags under my eyes as well as lightened the dark circles.  </li>
            <li> &amp; the tip is half off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and noticed reduced puffiness and a slight diminishing of the lines and wrinkles underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> and I was unable to use it until later in the next day.  </li>
            <li> After using it for about 4 weeks there was no significant change to puffiness or dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Clarisonic for a little over a year.  </li>
            <li> My eyes instantly looks less tired.</li>
            <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s with very dark puffy eyes.  </li>
            <li> The Opal was heavily promoted by the staff and aesthetician at my dermatologist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> They included a post paid label for UPS to send back my broken one.</li>
            <li> I am super disappointed in this product and will not get another one...why bother.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I recently purchased the Opal because I loved the results I got when my aesthetician used it for an eye treatment.I would recommend this to anyone trying to preserve thier youth or even turn back the clock.</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic Infusion System is easy to use and it appears to me that some of my wrinkles have disappeared.  I thought it might help my dark under eye circles, but it hasn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve used it for about a month now &amp; the tip is half off.  It says to replace those after 3 months &amp; mine didn&#x27;t last a month.  The cost of this item is high &amp; it should not have fallen apart so quickly.  I don&#x27;t believe I can return it now, but I will right to the company &amp; complain.</li>
            <li> The Opal was heavily promoted by the staff and aesthetician at my dermatologist&#x27;s office.  I was happy with it -easy to use, soothing and seemed to reduce the puffiness that comes with hay fever season.  Also made area around my eyes firmer.  However, the first time I needed to charge it -that was the end.  Either the charger or the unit was faulty.  The blue light that was supposed to flash while charging went on briefly and then stopped.  The charging unit became very hot and the Opal device never could be recharged.  It just beeped and did nothing.  It only lasted a month!!  This is very disappointing quality for a small appliance that is so pricey.    I am hoping that the company will send me a replacement -I will call their customer service line.  I am willing to give it another try.</li>
            <li> Good for puffy morning eyes, but does not really do anything for wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;During the time I had it, the tips stayed pretty intact, and I rarely had to replace them. I bought mine about two years ago, but it stopped working for some reason. I would like to get another, but I am not sure if it would be worth it since it seems to have almost doubled in price since I bought my first one. And probably only because now it is offered in different colours.</li>
            <li> I bought the Clarisonic Opal system about 3 months ago and I&#x27;ve used it religiously. I have seen very little difference in the dark circles under my eyes, which is the main reason I spent $200 on this machine. I believe treatments from plastic surgeons would probably be more effective, not necessarily eye surgery.</li>
            <li> This product has worked well for me. I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and my reason for getting this item was not only preventative, but to also treat puffiness, dark circles and fine lines underneath my eyes. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and noticed reduced puffiness and a slight diminishing of the lines and wrinkles underneath my eyes. My dark circles have also improved pretty dramatically which was a surprise since I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different things. I can&#x27;t claim that this will work for everyone, because we&#x27;re all different, but it has worked for me and was worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> my smile lines disappear and I use it around my eyes every so often. I feel like I am taking care of myself. I also use the mia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great since I am not a spa/salon type in a few min at home and I&#x27;ve got a treatment. Saves me the hassle and expensive salon bills! What I need:)</li>
            <li> I knew I would probably return this when I bought it, since I had already tried it once at a Sephora but decided I needed some more time.  After using it for about 4 weeks there was no significant change to puffiness or dark circles.  There is some instant hydration that can be achieved with a good eye cream.  For someone with deep crow&#x27;s feet it might be more helpful.  (I am 42 and don&#x27;t have any).</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a Christmas gift for my mom. She has used it every day and loves it.</li>
            <li> I just received the clarisonic opal sonic infusion system and I love it!  It is easy to use and it really does work!</li>
            <li> This is my first review. I am an avid Amazon shopper and always read the reviews before purchasing items (especially expensive ones). There were mixed reviews on this, so I knew it was risky. I have used the device with the serum on one eye for more than a week and see absolutely no difference. I am sending it back for a refund. Save your money.     I will say that the Clarisonic Skin Care brush is the greatest thing since sliced bread. However the Opal is a dud. The device is actually nice but I need some visible improvement to spend this kind of money. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the opal for one month, and have seen some improvement in my fine lines.  Will continue to use in conjunction with cliniques&#x27; all about eyes.</li>
            <li> I used the Opal for a month and loved it. Then, it just stopped working. I was really upset because I was so happy with the results I saw AND the device is pricey. I called Customer Service. They were incredibly nice and I had a new Opal in one week. You can&#x27;t ask for better than that. They included a post paid label for UPS to send back my broken one. LOVE, love Clarisonic Products and am incredibly happy with the fact that they stand behind their products!</li>
            <li> I own the clarisonic face brush, and I love it so much, with such visible results (especially just touching my face) after I use it, I decided to give the Opal a try. I didn&#x27;t bother with their serum, as I have my own I prefer, and I do feel the difference. My eyes feel a lot more hydrated than from when I just tap my product on. So, I figured why stop there? I&#x27;ve been using it the area above and between my eyebrows and on my chin...two areas, for me, that feel less than adequately hydrated. So far, I really love it! My other thought was that I use a sonic tooth brush, which cleans my teeth far more adequately than a regular one, so I am hooked on the idea for sonic in general! If I could have bought the device without the serum for less, I certainly would have preferred that, but ce la vie! I&#x27;m putting this little gadget to work!</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic Opal that I received BROKE WITHIN 1 WEEK !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I purchased the Opal I read tons of reviews and chose to ignore those that stated their unit broke almost right away.  I decided that it probably wouldn&#x27;t happen to me and that perhaps people weren&#x27;t being exactly truthful in their reviews.  Well, I should have listened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what happened to mine:&lt;br /&gt;I used the Opal twice a day for one week with no problems.  I placed the Opal back on the charger after this time thinking it was probably about time to get a recharge.  The Opal sat on the charger overnight and I was unable to use it until later in the next day.  I removed the Opal from the charger, attempted to turn it on and ..... nothing.  Then I thought, well maybe I didn&#x27;t charge it properly, maybe it is the wall socket I used, maybe the charging cord came loose (ridiculous, I know...how would that happen all on it&#x27;s own?).  I plugged it in to a different socket double checking the cord, double checking everything.  When I set the opal back onto the magnetic charger there was no charge light.  The unit beeped continuously.  It never turned on again; that was it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How much money did I spend on this?  It broke within 1 week?  Really?  Clarisonic is sending out multiple units that break almost immediately?  They truly need to get control of this and stop selling the unit until this problem is rectified.  Don&#x27;t hook the consumer with a great product like the Clarisonic skin cleansing system and then put out a piece of junk like the Opal.  I am super disappointed in this product and will not get another one...why bother.</li>
            <li> I am as skeptical as anyone I know.  But I bought and tried the Opal and it is doing wonders for my tired, wrinkled eyes.  It doesn&#x27;t take the wrinkles away all together but at my age (39) I don&#x27;t expect it to.  I bought it to see if it would at least improve the skin under my eyes and IT HAS.  Of course you need to USE IT daily.  It only takes two minutes (one for each eye) and the time is pre-programed into the unit so it shuts off at 1 minutes.  No one is going to get dramatic results without surgery and if you are just looking for improvements and not dramatic results, then pay the price and GET ONE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving my Opal system. I was really concerned about some of the negative feedback regarding the Opal unit. I mean this is a pricey little device and returning anything is a hassle. But I&#x27;ve been using it now twice a day for 5 days and the device is working fine. I&#x27;ll update as time goes by with regards to it helping to reduce the lines and puffiness around my eyes. The only negative issue is that it was advertised with a travel pouch, which it did not come with . I called Clarsonic (which was a lengthy process) and found out that they haven&#x27;t sold these with a pouch in years. So I&#x27;m not sure who is responsible to keep the product advertisement up to date and current, but this product does not come with a pouch as featured in the photo.</li>
            <li> I love my Clarisonic Opal. I work third shift and my eyes look very tired and puffy the days I attempt to sleep during the day. When I get out of the shower I use my clarisonic opal before I put on any other moisturizer. I do not use the eye cream that came with it, instead I use a Neutrogena  eye cream. My eyes instantly looks less tired. I have been using this product for over a year and I have seen a dramatic difference in my under eye lines. I use it twice a day and replace the tip about every six months. If you follow the directions it works great. But, with any facial product you have to be willing to invest the time in using it everyday or it will not give you dramatic results. I personally love this product!

            <li> The effect needs more time to show up. But I like the feeling of using it. I am looking forword to the effect.&lt;br /&gt;PS: I bought it from java beauty. The service it good.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the Opal long enougjh to give it a true rating. I think I will like it, but I haven&#x27;t noticed alot of changes yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dissatisfaction is that I didn&#x27;t get what I ordered.  I didn&#x27;t get the storage bag that is shown in the picture above and in the photo that I placed my order with.  I also have not been able to reach the seller that I purchased it from due to lack of information sent with my Opal when it arrived.  I hope maybe this review might get the rest of my order to me!</li>
            <li> I used this product for only a short time. I am a Clarisonic owner so I had high hopes for this but it left my skin looking stressed and reacting to the allergens in the seaweed serum. If you have plant allergies (I do!) I would steer clear.</li>
            <li> On my 3rd warranty exchange due to charging issues.  Read the reviews out there it seems to be a major problem, possibly a factory defect.  Save your money it is not worth it!!  Now I am told they will only offer a 90 day warranty this time!!</li>
            <li> great device!! I have bought it soem year ago, works pretty fine, just the serum that comes with it, gets old, very easily, so I had to use my own serum!! the device is amazing, it really makes the area around the eyes smoother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for just over two years and the motor stoped working. It worked well before then but as soon as the warranty was up, it broke,</li>
            <li> With the algae serum it is excellent.  The vibrating rubber cup infuses the serum into the skin and not just on top.  It is like your ring finger gently patting it in, times 100.  It charges quickly and keeps a charge for about 24 applications.  I also use it on my top lip.  The timer lasts 30 seconds.  I use it for 60 seconds on each eye and 30 seconds on my top lip.  I don&#x27;t skimp on serum.  Very nice tool.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Softens lines around eyes and lines above mouth. Use twice a day and you will begin to see results within a week</li>
            <li> I had to return 2 Black OPALS in the last 5 days.  The first I charged for 24 hours- blinking blue light, then solid blue when I removed it. It was charged the full 24 hours.  I was sooooo excited to use it, I pressed the button and it made a slight hum (the \\&quot;head\\&quot; did not move/vibrate- nothing). I had to hold it in to even get it to hum.  My sister has one so I know what it should so.  I immediately returned it to Sephora and I was so upset but just figured I got  a lemon and exchanged it.  Second one home- again charged for 24 hours.  This one worked 3 times.  3 TIMES.  Actually 2.5, stopped halfway through my third session. WTF???????  Now  I am super annoyed. $200 and my THIRD  trip to the mall in 5 days (buy, exchange, return) to AGAIN return the Opal.  Although Sephora offered to exchange againI said there is no way I wanted another one.</li>
            <li> I love this product it has made a big difference in the fine lines around my eyes! Very good customer service from Clarisonic as well.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Significant improvement in crows feet and appearance of fine lines. I have nothing else to ad except would buy it again good purchase but expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Opal for about a month.  It has been a good investment.  I am in my 50&#x27;s with very dark puffy eyes.  I&#x27;ve always had dark circles.  The Opal has reduced the bags under my eyes as well as lightened the dark circles.  The reduction is noticable to me and to others.  I&#x27;ve been using the Clarisonic for a little over a year.  I&#x27;m thrilled with both products.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased my Opal at Sephora. I charged it for 24 hours before I used it, then I used it once. Then at night when I tried to use it, it was beeping at me, so I put it on the charger. The next morning it didn&#x27;t even turn on anymore. So, I took it back to Sephora and exchanged it for a new one. SAME THING HAPPENED TO MY NEW ONE! Charged it, used it once, charged it (because it was beeping), and it broke. I think this time I will just return it and not get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, it&#x27;s best to buy your products at Sephora because they have a great return policy. Basically return whenever you want and even return without a receipt. I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Saw this on Dr Oz and thought - why not give it a go.  It really has made a difference to my skin and it&#x27;s fun to use.  Great product, however the only downer was that I wished I&#x27;d realised I&#x27;d need one of those universal plugs to be able to recharge it in Australia.</li>
            <li> I have had this for about a month and I love it!  I have noticed a decrease in the crepe-like wrinkles around my eyes....oh, I still have my crow&#x27;s feet (because I like to laugh and smile) but the smaller wrinkles are definitely less prominent.  I have the Clarisonic Mia facial scrubber as well....at first, I was disappointed because I seemed to have more breakouts.  However, after about a month or so, my skin stopped breaking out and now I feel as though it glows.  I try to be realistic....I&#x27;m 51 and I have some wrinkles....I just want to be able to go without makeup and not be ashamed of my skin.  Having my skin look this awesome helps my makeup look more natural and beautiful!  I will never have perfect skin, but I know that I have the best skin I can!</li>
