            <li>The Sock Aid is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to put on socks without bending.  </li>
            <li>It was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>The probem was the one in rehb could easily be squeezed and made putting the compression stockings easy to put on.  </li>
            <li>I am now able to put my socks on easily and quickly</li>
            <li>Rather than hassling with returning it he adapted and is getting along fine with it.</li>
            <li>This product works well except I have huge feet</li>
            <li>works great, bought for a friend with severe back problems</li>
            <li>The one I have is wider, made of some kind of metal and has much stronger cords.</li>
            <li>Break very easily when attempt to use even with knee high support stockings.  </li>
            <li>Works great for men with wide toe boxes.</li>
            <li>I know he is feeling confident and accomplished.</li>
            <li>Love the device, very helpful.</li>
            <li>This is a good choice for people with edema in their feet and legs, who need a little more room to get their foot through the sock aid.  </li>
            <li>It is a tremendous help for my mother</li>
            <li>Works perfectly, exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>and I still assist with prepping the sock on the Sock Aid, he is able to use the rope to complete the task.</li>
            <li>The standard size of the same design has worked great.</li>
            <li>However some types of socks tend to slip off the knot and must be placed on the device exactly so.</li>
            <li>works better than the regular size</li>
            <li>This product was my first try at finding a sock aid and I can see already it can work for some people but not me.  </li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t get an exact measurement in the width I needed when I ordered this one...</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and it arrived on time, thanks....</li>
            <li>It was too big to easily use for compression socks and split within 2 weeks,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy enough to buy a longer rope at Lowe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This sock aid has certainly made putting on my compression stockings and I recommend it...........</li>
            <li>He wears an 11.5 medium shoe and this is large for him, but works well.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been a real chore to get socks on each day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working out very well.</li>
            <li>I bought one but will donate it to anyone who wants it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Was not too sure about what they ment by wide, as I had never ordered this type of product before.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly, a real time saver.</li>
            <li>I really wish I would have found this a year or two ago.</li>
            <li>Does what it is supposed to do--get socks on more easily for those folks who have a hard time bending over or otherwise putting socks on the old fashioned way.  </li>
            <li>Too long to fit my shorter stature.  </li>
            <li>Too wide for hand with arthritis to easily pull the sock over.  </li>
            <li>Clever design, shoulda thought of it myself.</li>
            <li>Being wider than my previous sock aid, it&#x27;s more comfortable slipping the socks</li>
            <li>Great help for anyone who is unable to bend over .</li>
            <li>cracks to easy, only last about 2 months</li>
            <li>good except very wide and more difficult to use than narrower sock aids</li>
            <li>It was too large 5&amp;#34; The one in physical therapy is 4 1/2&amp;#34; and works very well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even use the round bottom ones that use the same material as they close in too much at the top.</li>
            <li>This replaced the last of many similar standard width devices which were always a problem with my man&#x27;s EE foot.  </li>
            <li>They were a little cheap with the pull rope.</li>
            <li>It took 3-4 months before I could put on socks the old fashion way.  </li>
            <li>The easiest to use, so far..</li>
            <li>This is one of those items that is very simple yet makes your life so much easier.  </li>
            <li>My first one was from Physical Therapy and lasted 3 years and finally split in 3&#x27;s</li>
            <li>If anyone has trouble grasping and tugging with their hands, such as arthtitis, better stick with a standard width device.</li>
            <li>Would be better for larger feet or very tight socks on a smaller foot.</li>
            <li>I have large wide feet.</li>
            <li>works great hard to get sock on little to wide,</li>
            <li>This wide style is much easier to get over my foot and the sock slides off with ease.  </li>
            <li>I sprinkle a little baby powder inside the sock aid and my big feet slip right through with NO hassle.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s still not wide enough.</li>
            <li>but I doubt that it will last as long as my old one.</li>
            <li>The little foam pad that you put on the bottom really holds the sock well.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The little foam pad that you put on the bottom really holds the sock well.  </li>
            <li> I felt smart ordering the wide one first, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> My son has limited finger dexterity on his left hand.</li>
            <li> Recommend the wide style over the regular.</li>
            <li> Like the extra wide width which I need.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so wide and such rigid plastic</li>
            <li> I have ordered 2 and both split down the middle after a short time.</li>
            <li> The item if fully curved and DOES NOT have a flat bottom as pictured!!!!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to get it as some reports that it isn&#x27;t for support hose use, which other than athletic socks are the only socks I use.</li>
            <li> i tried other medical supply places</li>
            <li> I have a wide foot and noticed you can get this one in either a wide or a regular width.  </li>
            <li> would work if I had real, and I mean real wide feet.</li>
            <li> The only slight drawback is that some socks are harder to pull over it than over the narrower one.</li>
            <li> it is a little too short for my liking.</li>
            <li> Hubby can actually use this little unit.</li>
            <li> He has size 13 xxxx wide feet.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I have wide feet</li>
            <li> I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered the wide one.  </li>
            <li> I have wide feet, so thought it would work.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for really wide feet.  </li>
            <li> The wide sock aid makes it easier to get my feet into it.  </li>
            <li> As I have wide feet</li>
            <li> It is the little things that go a long way.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Also have used it in the past for application of compression stockings - it doesn&#x27;t collapse like the regular sock aid does.</li>
            <li> I kept it because I needed it immediately, but it&#x27;s slightly too wide.</li>
            <li> With my arthritic knees I can not put socks on the conventional way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wider than his last sock aid, so he was having a hard time feeding his sock onto the the aid because of its width at the bottom.</li>
            <li> at least it gets it over my toes where I can reach down enough to pull up the sock.</li>
            <li> and i cant bend down to my feet to put my socks on</li>
            <li> Any of them take a little bit of practice but we went through quite a few before he got to this one.</li>
            <li> It is really wide, that makes it hard to get socks on the device.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad it doesn&#x27;t hold up because it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not able to find material for another patch that works.</li>
            <li> I am a little bit disappointed with the finishing, very rough on the edges, chipped and a little sharp.</li>
            <li> Too hard at this time.</li>
            <li> The one purchased fro Amazon was so stiff it was impossible to use.  </li>
            <li> Without it, he was unable to put on the compression hose.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this was not learned until after the authorized return time period had expired and as a result the item was unable to be returned for credit.</li>
            <li> trying to stretch the socks &amp; squeeze them onto the device is very difficult &amp; leads to broken finger nails.</li>
            <li> Dishonest and NO RETURN POLICY!!!</li>
            <li> BAD SELLER...</li>
            <li> This is TOTALLY useless!!!  </li>

            <li> It was too big to easily use for compression socks and split within 2 weeks,</li>
            <li> My husband had no difficulty putting on compression hose using this device.  Without it, he was unable to put on the compression hose.</li>
            <li> it turned out to be somewhat flimsy and split. but it worked well until that time</li>
            <li> It is too big.  I didn&#x27;t realize how big it was .  I should ave sent it back.</li>
            <li> Works good, shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly for someone that has had hip surgery and cannot bend to put on socks.  What a godsend.</li>
            <li> I have severely arthritic knees and it&#x27;s been a real chore to get socks on each day.  A rehab therapist recommended this and one use make me a big fan -- it&#x27;s simple as can be now to get my socks on each day!</li>

            <li> This is a great product. My son has limited finger dexterity on his left hand. While it is a work in progress and I still assist with prepping the sock on the Sock Aid, he is able to use the rope to complete the task. The smile when he finishes is wonderful. I know he is feeling confident and accomplished. It is the little things that go a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great.  The sock aid helps my mom alot by not only making it easier to put on her socks but also she doesn&#x27;t get pain in her back from bending over to put on her socks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working out very well.</li>
            <li> good except very wide and more difficult to use than narrower sock aids</li>
            <li> Just had surgery and needed help putting socks on. I have wide feet and this product makes my life easier.</li>
            <li> I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered the wide one.  I have wide feet, so thought it would work.  It&#x27;s for really wide feet.  Other than that, I like how it works.</li>
            <li> The Sock Aid is easy to use. However some types of socks tend to slip off the knot and must be placed on the device exactly so.</li>
            <li> It is really wide, that makes it hard to get socks on the device. It is built well but just not what it thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Great sock aid.  Makes it easy to put on socks without bending.  Works on compression hose also.  Recommend the wide style over the regular.</li>
            <li> works better than the regular size</li>
            <li> Like the extra wide width which I need.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> Too long to fit my shorter stature.  Too wide for hand with arthritis to easily pull the sock over.  I bought one but will donate it to anyone who wants it.</li>
            <li> Love it. I am now able to put my socks on easily and quickly</li>
            <li> Just 2 star on this product. I am a little bit disappointed with the finishing, very rough on the edges, chipped and a little sharp. i am not going to return it, but definitely i am not gonna buy it again or recommend to anybody.</li>
            <li> It is the only sock aid I can use. I can&#x27;t get my foot into the more flexible ones after I put my sock on it. I can&#x27;t even use the round bottom ones that use the same material as they close in too much at the top.</li>
            <li> cracks to easy, only last about 2 months</li>
            <li> This tool really works great. I had surgery and i cant bend down to my feet to put my socks on but with this its really simple. I am so happy not  to rely on somebody else for this. I am very pleased  with this product would recommend this for any body with limitations. Thanks</li>
            <li> This replaced the last of many similar standard width devices which were always a problem with my man&#x27;s EE foot.  This wide style is much easier to get over my foot and the sock slides off with ease.  The trade-off is that it is more difficult to slide the sock over the sock-aid.  If anyone has trouble grasping and tugging with their hands, such as arthtitis, better stick with a standard width device.</li>
            <li> The patch disintegrated.  It doesn&#x27;t work without it, although the instructions calls it optional.  I&#x27;m not able to find material for another patch that works.</li>
            <li> Awesome ......!!! Works Great</li>
            <li> Hamstring rupture and compartment syndrome lead to my requiring the use of this device.  I was hesitant to get it as some reports that it isn&#x27;t for support hose use, which other than athletic socks are the only socks I use. It took 3-4 months before I could put on socks the old fashion way.  This was handy, durable and light weight.  It does take patience w/ support hose to use this thought.  I got it for my gym bag for going to physical therapy.  The  metal frame designed for support hose is too bulky for travel.</li>
            <li> Break very easily when attempt to use even with knee high support stockings.  Vendor never replied to question(s).</li>
            <li> Being wider than my previous sock aid, it&#x27;s more comfortable slipping the socks on,&lt;br /&gt;but trying to stretch the socks &amp; squeeze them onto the device is very difficult &amp; leads to broken finger nails.</li>
            <li> A great aid when putting on compression stockings.........This sock aid has certainly made putting on my compression stockings and I recommend it...........</li>
            <li> When I put my foot into the sock aid my skin sticks to the plastic.  Therefore I cannot slide my foot out while sliding into the sock.</li>
            <li> works great hard to get sock on little to wide,</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and it arrived on time, thanks....</li>
            <li> The wide sock aid makes it easier to get my feet into it.  The only slight drawback is that some socks are harder to pull over it than over the narrower one.</li>
            <li> Wish the were narrower for we withAAAA&#x27;s and arthritic hands</li>
            <li> Use this terrific item every day.</li>
            <li> This product was my first try at finding a sock aid and I can see already it can work for some people but not me.  I have a wide foot and noticed you can get this one in either a wide or a regular width.  I felt smart ordering the wide one first, but I was wrong.  It&#x27;s so wide and such rigid plastic I can&#x27;t get my compression stockings over it.  Maybe the regular size would work.  This one does work for me in a regular sock that stretches quite a bit - at least it gets it over my toes where I can reach down enough to pull up the sock.</li>
            <li> my dad is in assisted living and he needs these i tried other medical supply places and they didnt have what i&lt;br /&gt;needed i was so happy to find the exact item with amazon</li>
            <li> Great for putting on compression socks.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my dad. It&#x27;s wider than his last sock aid, so he was having a hard time feeding his sock onto the the aid because of its width at the bottom. Rather than hassling with returning it he adapted and is getting along fine with it.</li>
            <li> Love the device, very helpful.</li>
            <li> The easiest to use, so far..</li>
            <li> I have big feet and a big gut this saves strain on my hip !</li>
            <li> It is a tremendous help for my mother&lt;br /&gt;with support hosiery.</li>
            <li> It was too large 5&amp;#34; The one in physical therapy is 4 1/2&amp;#34; and works very well.</li>
            <li> Good size for my size 14 EEEE feet. It was delivered very quickly. They were a little cheap with the pull rope. No foam handles and it is a little too short for my liking. It&#x27;s easy enough to buy a longer rope at Lowe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I saw this product while in rehab.  As I have wide feet I knew this would be a great help.  I wish they sold these things in rehab.  They told me to iorder from Amazon.  The probem was the one in rehb could easily be squeezed and made putting the compression stockings easy to put on.  The one purchased fro Amazon was so stiff it was impossible to use.  I am still recovering and can&#x27;t get out to return and may not bother.  Too hard at this time.</li>
            <li> Works great for men with wide toe boxes.</li>
            <li> Great help for anyone who is unable to bend over .</li>
            <li> With my arthritic knees I can not put socks on the conventional way.  My feet are size 13 EEE and I could use those cloth sock aids just so many times before they&#x27;d rip.  After going through 3 of the cloth sock aids I took the time to look for something better.  I found it with this Sock Aid.  I sprinkle a little baby powder inside the sock aid and my big feet slip right through with NO hassle.  Note- you can find a couple of videos on YouTube that demonstrate how to use it.</li>
            <li> Hubby can actually use this little unit. Any of them take a little bit of practice but we went through quite a few before he got to this one. This is the winner!!</li>
            <li> would work if I had real, and I mean real wide feet. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t. Was not too sure about what they ment by wide, as I had never ordered this type of product before. The standard size of the same design has worked great.</li>
            <li> works great, bought for a friend with severe back problems</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> Tell everyone about this product!!! My father has renewed dignity!</li>
            <li> This product works well except I have huge feet so it&#x27;s still not wide enough. It takes time to load the sock and use but after my knee surgery it has been a great asset! Revised.... The plastic used for this product is not flexible enough. I have ordered 2 and both split down the middle after a short time. If you need one that lasts I suggest a different item. It&#x27;s too bad it doesn&#x27;t hold up because it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I kept it because I needed it immediately, but it&#x27;s slightly too wide. My first one was from Physical Therapy and lasted 3 years and finally split in 3&#x27;s so I couldn&#x27;t get an exact measurement in the width I needed when I ordered this one...but it works. Thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, a real time saver.</li>
            <li> This item IS NOT as pictured!!!!  The item if fully curved and DOES NOT have a flat bottom as pictured!!!! Makes a HUGE difference!!!  This is TOTALLY useless!!!  BAD SELLER... Dishonest and NO RETURN POLICY!!!</li>
            <li> Use it daily. Works great.</li>
            <li> Surprising, was excellent for wide feet!</li>
            <li> Ordered for a patient with severe edema in both legs and feet. This worked well for him. Arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Item did not perform as described.  For post surgery hip replacement compression socks containing such reduced diametrical size, this tube will not work as described without causing permanent tearing damage to the sock.  Unfortunately this was not learned until after the authorized return time period had expired and as a result the item was unable to be returned for credit.</li>
            <li> When this arrived I thought it would be too big for my 9 1/2W foot size.  But it works perfectly.  The little foam pad that you put on the bottom really holds the sock well.  This is one of those items that is very simple yet makes your life so much easier.  I really wish I would have found this a year or two ago.</li>
            <li> This works great.  My husband had his hip replaced and couldn&#x27;t bend to put on socks.  He wears an 11.5 medium shoe and this is large for him, but works well.  Would be better for larger feet or very tight socks on a smaller foot.</li>
            <li> I am an OT, and purchased this for demonstration.  This is a good choice for people with edema in their feet and legs, who need a little more room to get their foot through the sock aid.  Also have used it in the past for application of compression stockings - it doesn&#x27;t collapse like the regular sock aid does.</li>
            <li> I thought this was like one I bought years ago, it wasn&#x27;t . The one I have is wider, made of some kind of metal and has much stronger cords. I can make this one work but I doubt that it will last as long as my old one.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do--get socks on more easily for those folks who have a hard time bending over or otherwise putting socks on the old fashioned way.  Clever design, shoulda thought of it myself.</li>
            <li> It was/&#x27;is okay.  My husband used it during his recovery from Knee surgery. We are keeping it for any possible future need.</li>
