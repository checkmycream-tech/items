            <li>good mousse and I always use Redken products.</li>
            <li>It does a good job adding volume to my hair.</li>
            <li>This is THE BEST hair mousse ever ~ and I have tried many, many, many.  </li>

            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Big Sexy Hair is just the best product for my fine fly away no volume hair.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I would have been better off just blow drying with no product.</li>
            <li>A better mousse is Paul Sebastian.</li>
            <li>Better than anything else that I have used.</li>
            <li>This product is listed on ewg.org as a &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; and after receiving this product and seeing all of the warnings, I built a report with the full ingredients list as printed on the can.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product for my fine hair and makes it much easier to style</li>
            <li>Packaged well to prevent damage, arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Please be AWARE!  </li>
            <li>I have found using the blow dry mousse along with hair spray works perfectly for hold that last all day.</li>
            <li>I love Big Sexy hair products in general, and this bodifying mousse is a new favorite for me!</li>
            <li>I thought this would be volumizing, but I honestly feel like it does the opposite.</li>
            <li>The ingredients lists available online for this product are not the true and complete ingredients list.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live, however, without Big Sexy Hairspray!</li>
            <li>I use this mousse on my very short hair and love it.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times and think I&#x27;m going to continue to enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product line and was hoping to be amazed at this mousse, but found it to be very comparable to other salon products.</li>
            <li>It really does give extra body to fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>It gives an extra lift to my thick but fine hair.</li>
            <li>Living in the Pacific North West &#x3D; rain and humidity and throw in fine thin hair..</li>
