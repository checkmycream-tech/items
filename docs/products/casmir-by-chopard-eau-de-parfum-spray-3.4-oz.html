            <li>and most people have never heard of it!  </li>
            <li>I love this Parfume!</li>
            <li>As I replaced the top, I noticed that my fingers were damp--it leaks!</li>

            <li>I was so happy I found it on amazon for such a great price, my grandmother loves it and is so happy she had another bottle to savor for a while</li>
            <li>The real Casmir smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, but</li>
            <li>It is warm and inviting, and lasts on my skin for hours.</li>
            <li>So nice to wear and not invasive like some.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to know I can still find it on-line.</li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to the 1 and 2 star reviews but wanted to give this product a fair shot.</li>

            <li>Yes, the perfume is my favorite.</li>
            <li>If you like stronger scents like CD Poison you wil love this one.</li>
            <li>I was overseas the first time I smelled it, it was so sweet and feminine, I loved it!  </li>
            <li>Chopard fragances are as great as their jewelry and this one is a classic one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved the scent, ever since it first came out.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful smelling for a long time.  </li>

            <li>Fabulous price and very quick service!</li>
            <li>It is NOT the ORIGINAL!</li>
            <li>It is a rich musky blend which stays with you and is enjoyed by many who smell it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a sweet, ffeminine, fragrance, this one fits the bill!</li>
            <li>It is exactly as it says and the price was amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled that I can now find it consistently at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of vanilla, my house is full of vanilla candles.  </li>
            <li>I smell more detergent in this perfume for some reason than the sweet smell casmir produced.</li>
            <li>the smell is fine.</li>
            <li>If you like a bold scent, this one is for you!</li>
            <li>Bought Casmir online, it was delivered in 2 days, and wearing it already makes me feel empowered like the good old days!</li>
            <li>Just awesome and brilliant, highly recommended, actually parfum should only bought on amazon</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of patchouli and find this in like category.</li>
            <li>Also the size i purchased is huge</li>
            <li>I get a lot of perfume online, sometimes it&#x27;s fresh most of the time it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li>Item arrived intact and has the same great scent as always.  </li>
            <li>i was so happy, but it doesn&#x27;t smell the same as i remember.</li>
            <li>It smells cheap,  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic perfume spray with a vanilla scent.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>It is  cheap</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t wear perfume or find them all too sweet or strong, I think you will like this one.</li>
            <li>but overall very nice.</li>
            <li>It does not smell like the original</li>
            <li>Perfume great but delivery  way to long weeks</li>
            <li>Worth every penny, and a bargain at this price, to boot!</li>
            <li>i was so excited when i received it</li>
            <li>This has been one of my favorite fragrances, and I was pretty heart torn when I could no longer find the body cream.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This perfume has always been a favorite since my husband first brought it for my in Germany.</li>
            <li>It was the best in cost I paid for 2 2 what I usually pay for 1</li>
            <li>Not the original anyways.</li>
            <li>Casmir perfume is one of my favorites, but  this didn&#x27;t smell quite like my original.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m positive it&#x27;s not the authentic fragrance, but a copycat or a diluted version...</li>
            <li>I receive so many positive comments about the fragrance.</li>
            <li>It most certainly WAS NOT an oriental vanilla.</li>
            <li>Received the large size of my favorite perfume spray in an inexpensive and timely manner.</li>
            <li>Delivered fast and safe.</li>
            <li>My order arrived so fast too, I love not having to wait 7-10 days for my items.  </li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>Not too sweet or spicy.</li>
            <li>The perfume still smells good but different.</li>
            <li>It smells like I remember (good) but the box was open!!!</li>
            <li>Enjoyed it, but paid too much.</li>
            <li>However, the scent disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite and we haven&#x27;t been able to find it in our local stores.</li>
            <li>I received the product quickly, with no problems  </li>
            <li>I subsequently ordered a sample vial of Casmir from a very reputable perfume dealer online.</li>
            <li>my new favorite.  </li>
            <li>Most perfumes give me a headache, but this is a  subtle warm fragrance with notes of vanilla that don&#x27;t bother me at all; I love it and so does my husband.</li>
            <li>It dries down to something sensual, warm and sexy.</li>
            <li>Casmir&#x27;s scent also lasts remarkably longer than almost any other perfume that I have tried.</li>
            <li>It is an incredibly soft, sexy parfum.</li>
            <li>I enjoy buying from Amazon for this reason and will definitely order more perfume from you all again.  </li>
            <li>Casmir has a more &#x27;youthful&#x27; scent, heavy and warm for winter.</li>
            <li>so it is definitely worth the price</li>
            <li>Have fun.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see my favorite perfume on Amazon because I could not get it locally anymore.  </li>
            <li>I am able to get it here for alot more than other places.</li>
            <li>Not easy to find at this great price.</li>
            <li>Not sure if they changed the ingredients, although this one has  a nice smell just very light.</li>
            <li>this to me is a nice light  scent that has a vanilla top note that dries down to a soft powdery scent.  </li>
            <li>Althought you will want to save this exotic oriental scent for special occasions, you can actually wear it anytime.   </li>
            <li>I bought it at a great price, in a store in my country had not found and would have paid a small fortune.</li>
            <li>Same product, same great fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is a true classic perfume.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I had a precious little left of a bottle of Casmir EDP</li>
            <li>Men &amp; women seem to love it equally.</li>
            <li>I am consistently complimented on the scent whenever I wear it.  </li>
            <li>and it smells exactly like I remembered.</li>
            <li>it can&#x27;t be smelled after the first 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon, I can get it any time I want!</li>
            <li>Not always able to get this product in local stores.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and sweet and fades to a soft scent.</li>
            <li>The order took a little longer than expected, but otherwise everything was great!  </li>
            <li>, I bet you&#x27;ll get a few date offers, lol.</li>
            <li>At first spray its nothing I really like.</li>
            <li>Lovely scent and lasts a long time</li>
            <li>Also, it smelled like some of the perfumes I have let sit on my shelve too long, and have a more alcohol smell than a newer bottle has.</li>
            <li>Ladies, throw away your way too sweet, flowery perfumes, and take a walk on the wild side.</li>
            <li>strong advice is to refuse to accept any open box item or any item that does not smell as it should from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I tried getting in touch with the retailer but nothing was accomplished.</li>
            <li>Well, let me just say it is not the real Casmir by Chopard.</li>
            <li>This was just what I needed at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>It is fabulous ... still get comments almost daily.  </li>
            <li>everyone wants to smell me mmmmm,,love it...</li>
            <li>If you like a vanilla type scent like Shalimar, (another one of my favorites), you&#x27;ll really like this perfume.</li>
            <li>Received it in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wear it anymore, it reminded me too much of the time when I wore it when it came out</li>
            <li>so you do not have to apply it very often.</li>
            <li>gift was much appreciated.</li>
            <li>Its a real turnon for me.&lt;br /&gt;Guys</li>
            <li>I bought this for my Fiance&#x27; and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>but it also fades fast?  </li>
            <li>Price is very competitive.  </li>
            <li>Very sensual scent that lingers after you walk by.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much and never quite selling it...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>They were all new and in a sealed box, but this IS NOT THE REAL THING!</li>
            <li>this goes on strong yet lasts long.</li>
            <li>OMG, this perfume is so lovely to the person wearing it, but be careful wearing it around men!  </li>
            <li>I have normally purchased this product at a retail location, but no one carries it anymore!  </li>
            <li>It is light and spicy and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>The scent was still there as most Casmir users know - if it&#x27;s real, it will last several hours.</li>
            <li>I like my previous cologne scent better.</li>
            <li>I love the Chopard line and am drunk in love with Casmir.  </li>
            <li>This is a classic perfume with vanilla overtones.</li>
            <li>This is a time proven fragrance and yet lesser known than the fads that come and go so quickly.</li>
            <li>Classic fragrance like Chanel No. 5, Obsession by Calvin Klein, etc.</li>
            <li>Have used this scent for years, it&#x27;s a classic that I never tire of.</li>
            <li>It has a strong acrid smell not even remotely associated with Casmir.  </li>
            <li>For me, moving forward any beauty item that I receive is under the microscope, and I will not purchase any high end perfumes from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I always get asked what I&#x27;m wearing with this, I have to admit to wearing it anytime, day or night, though it is probably a little heavier than most daytime perfumes.</li>
            <li>Casmir was always a long lasting scent and the longer you wore it, the better it smelled.  </li>
            <li>It is very difficult to find, so I am thrilled that I am able to purchase here.  </li>
            <li>I had recently run out of my long time favorite Casmir and ordered it at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The Casmir that I received from Amazon was supposed to be new, however I don&#x27;t believe mine was.</li>
            <li>I noticed on Amazon&#x27;s website that it is advertised as a new arrival, so I thought that perhaps Amazon has taken care of this matter.</li>
            <li>I knew that if I had a problem with my order I could rectify the problem with ease and be sent a new perfume if need be.  </li>
            <li>I only rated it as ok, as it did not come in a sealed packaging, which I would of expected when purchasing a new item.</li>
            <li>Casual scent, not too strong, great for everyday where.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only fragrance I&#x27;ve been wearing since it first came out.</li>
            <li>It drives men wild!</li>
            <li>I have worn this fragrance for years, and was excited to find it at such a low cost.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>Both are newly boxed but without clear package wrapping.</li>
            <li>Product came quick, packaged well, and was just what I expected.</li>
            <li>And to top it off, it was less expensive and got here super quick !  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get it in the mail to find out that it is still the same Casmir I used so long ago.</li>
            <li>They almost seem like the perfume is old.  </li>
            <li>It has a soft fragrance that is a compliment to you and not an abrasion to others around you.</li>
            <li>its almost like its old.  </li>
            <li>it may be so old that the fragrance is gone and</li>
            <li>Old time perfume</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one who usually wears nothing heavier than Amarige de Givenchy, and am prone to more floral scents such as Champs Elysees.</li>
            <li>but every single time I do I am asked what am I wearing, always get positive compliments.</li>
            <li>This perfume is not long lasting and it doesn&#x27;t have as much vanilla in it as before.  </li>
            <li>Product is exactly what my wife expected.  </li>
            <li>First spray it smells like spicy amber once it drys down a bit soft fruity vanilla.</li>
            <li>Alas, it is a fairly ordinary but pleasant, long lasting and sweet vanilla-type perfume.</li>
            <li>I have ordered other perfumes from Amazon, and this is the first time I&#x27;ve experience this issue.</li>
            <li>I find Shalimar overbearing and reminiscent of what old women in their 60s would wear (no offense!).</li>
            <li>I usually wear Cartier Parfum (the original) or Chanel No. 5.</li>
            <li>You were all right when many of you said this perfume stinks and that it may be turned.  </li>
            <li>I still have a drop left from my old bottle and compared it to this one.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, and have spent the last few years looking for it, since I had forgotten the name.  </li>
            <li>I would deduct one star for the awkward bottle, its really kind of weird to hold but the smell is so good I will let that slide.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very subtle, and I&#x27;ve received many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li>It certainly cost less than is used to.</li>
            <li>This scent is known for it longevity and sillage, however the product I received seems very watered down to the point</li>
            <li>I have been using Chopard Casmir since it first came out in, I think, either the late 80s or early 90s  </li>
            <li>This perfume has a long lasting soft scent that&#x27;s a welcomed nose grabber.</li>

            <li> As I replaced the top, I noticed that my fingers were damp--it leaks!</li>

            <li> I smell more detergent in this perfume for some reason than the sweet smell casmir produced.</li>
            <li> the smell is fine.</li>
            <li> If you like a bold scent, this one is for you!</li>

            <li> I get a lot of perfume online, sometimes it&#x27;s fresh most of the time it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li> Item arrived intact and has the same great scent as always.  </li>

            <li> This is a fantastic perfume spray with a vanilla scent.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> It is  cheap</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t wear perfume or find them all too sweet or strong, I think you will like this one.</li>
            <li> but overall very nice.</li>
            <li> It does not smell like the original</li>
            <li> Perfume great but delivery  way to long weeks</li>
            <li> Worth every penny, and a bargain at this price, to boot!</li>
            <li> i was so excited when i received it</li>
            <li> This has been one of my favorite fragrances, and I was pretty heart torn when I could no longer find the body cream.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This perfume has always been a favorite since my husband first brought it for my in Germany.</li>
            <li> It was the best in cost I paid for 2 2 what I usually pay for 1</li>
            <li> Not the original anyways.</li>
            <li> Casmir perfume is one of my favorites, but  this didn&#x27;t smell quite like my original.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m positive it&#x27;s not the authentic fragrance, but a copycat or a diluted version...</li>
            <li> I receive so many positive comments about the fragrance.</li>
            <li> It most certainly WAS NOT an oriental vanilla.</li>
            <li> Received the large size of my favorite perfume spray in an inexpensive and timely manner.</li>
            <li> Delivered fast and safe.</li>
            <li> My order arrived so fast too, I love not having to wait 7-10 days for my items.  </li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li> Not too sweet or spicy.</li>
            <li> The perfume still smells good but different.</li>
            <li> It smells like I remember (good) but the box was open!!!</li>
            <li> Enjoyed it, but paid too much.</li>
            <li> However, the scent disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite and we haven&#x27;t been able to find it in our local stores.</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly, with no problems  </li>
            <li> I subsequently ordered a sample vial of Casmir from a very reputable perfume dealer online.</li>
            <li> my new favorite.  </li>
            <li> Most perfumes give me a headache, but this is a  subtle warm fragrance with notes of vanilla that don&#x27;t bother me at all; I love it and so does my husband.</li>
            <li> It dries down to something sensual, warm and sexy.</li>
            <li> Casmir&#x27;s scent also lasts remarkably longer than almost any other perfume that I have tried.</li>
            <li> It is an incredibly soft, sexy parfum.</li>
            <li> I enjoy buying from Amazon for this reason and will definitely order more perfume from you all again.  </li>
            <li> Casmir has a more &#x27;youthful&#x27; scent, heavy and warm for winter.</li>
            <li> so it is definitely worth the price</li>
            <li> Have fun.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see my favorite perfume on Amazon because I could not get it locally anymore.  </li>
            <li> I am able to get it here for alot more than other places.</li>
            <li> Not easy to find at this great price.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they changed the ingredients, although this one has  a nice smell just very light.</li>
            <li> this to me is a nice light  scent that has a vanilla top note that dries down to a soft powdery scent.  </li>
            <li> Althought you will want to save this exotic oriental scent for special occasions, you can actually wear it anytime.   </li>
            <li> I bought it at a great price, in a store in my country had not found and would have paid a small fortune.</li>
            <li> Same product, same great fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a true classic perfume.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I had a precious little left of a bottle of Casmir EDP</li>
            <li> Men &amp; women seem to love it equally.</li>
            <li> I am consistently complimented on the scent whenever I wear it.  </li>
            <li> and it smells exactly like I remembered.</li>
            <li> it can&#x27;t be smelled after the first 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon, I can get it any time I want!</li>
            <li> Not always able to get this product in local stores.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> The scent is fresh and sweet and fades to a soft scent.</li>
            <li> The order took a little longer than expected, but otherwise everything was great!  </li>
            <li> , I bet you&#x27;ll get a few date offers, lol.</li>
            <li> At first spray its nothing I really like.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Also, it smelled like some of the perfumes I have let sit on my shelve too long, and have a more alcohol smell than a newer bottle has.</li>
            <li> Ladies, throw away your way too sweet, flowery perfumes, and take a walk on the wild side.</li>
            <li> strong advice is to refuse to accept any open box item or any item that does not smell as it should from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I tried getting in touch with the retailer but nothing was accomplished.</li>
            <li> Well, let me just say it is not the real Casmir by Chopard.</li>
            <li> This was just what I needed at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> It is fabulous ... still get comments almost daily.  </li>
            <li> everyone wants to smell me mmmmm,,love it...</li>
            <li> If you like a vanilla type scent like Shalimar, (another one of my favorites), you&#x27;ll really like this perfume.</li>
            <li> Received it in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wear it anymore, it reminded me too much of the time when I wore it when it came out</li>
            <li> so you do not have to apply it very often.</li>
            <li> gift was much appreciated.</li>
            <li> Its a real turnon for me.&lt;br /&gt;Guys</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Fiance&#x27; and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> but it also fades fast?  </li>
            <li> Price is very competitive.  </li>
            <li> Very sensual scent that lingers after you walk by.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much and never quite selling it...</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> They were all new and in a sealed box, but this IS NOT THE REAL THING!</li>
            <li> this goes on strong yet lasts long.</li>
            <li> OMG, this perfume is so lovely to the person wearing it, but be careful wearing it around men!  </li>
            <li> I have normally purchased this product at a retail location, but no one carries it anymore!  </li>
            <li> It is light and spicy and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> The scent was still there as most Casmir users know - if it&#x27;s real, it will last several hours.</li>
            <li> I like my previous cologne scent better.</li>
            <li> I love the Chopard line and am drunk in love with Casmir.  </li>
            <li> This is a classic perfume with vanilla overtones.</li>
            <li> This is a time proven fragrance and yet lesser known than the fads that come and go so quickly.</li>
            <li> Classic fragrance like Chanel No. 5, Obsession by Calvin Klein, etc.</li>
            <li> Have used this scent for years, it&#x27;s a classic that I never tire of.</li>
            <li> It has a strong acrid smell not even remotely associated with Casmir.  </li>
            <li> For me, moving forward any beauty item that I receive is under the microscope, and I will not purchase any high end perfumes from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I always get asked what I&#x27;m wearing with this, I have to admit to wearing it anytime, day or night, though it is probably a little heavier than most daytime perfumes.</li>
            <li> Casmir was always a long lasting scent and the longer you wore it, the better it smelled.  </li>
            <li> It is very difficult to find, so I am thrilled that I am able to purchase here.  </li>
            <li> I had recently run out of my long time favorite Casmir and ordered it at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The Casmir that I received from Amazon was supposed to be new, however I don&#x27;t believe mine was.</li>
            <li> I noticed on Amazon&#x27;s website that it is advertised as a new arrival, so I thought that perhaps Amazon has taken care of this matter.</li>
            <li> I knew that if I had a problem with my order I could rectify the problem with ease and be sent a new perfume if need be.  </li>
            <li> I only rated it as ok, as it did not come in a sealed packaging, which I would of expected when purchasing a new item.</li>
            <li> Casual scent, not too strong, great for everyday where.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only fragrance I&#x27;ve been wearing since it first came out.</li>
            <li> It drives men wild!</li>
            <li> I have worn this fragrance for years, and was excited to find it at such a low cost.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> Both are newly boxed but without clear package wrapping.</li>
            <li> Product came quick, packaged well, and was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> And to top it off, it was less expensive and got here super quick !  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get it in the mail to find out that it is still the same Casmir I used so long ago.</li>
            <li> They almost seem like the perfume is old.  </li>
            <li> It has a soft fragrance that is a compliment to you and not an abrasion to others around you.</li>
            <li> its almost like its old.  </li>
            <li> it may be so old that the fragrance is gone and</li>
            <li> Old time perfume</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one who usually wears nothing heavier than Amarige de Givenchy, and am prone to more floral scents such as Champs Elysees.</li>
            <li> but every single time I do I am asked what am I wearing, always get positive compliments.</li>
            <li> This perfume is not long lasting and it doesn&#x27;t have as much vanilla in it as before.  </li>
            <li> Product is exactly what my wife expected.  </li>
            <li> First spray it smells like spicy amber once it drys down a bit soft fruity vanilla.</li>
            <li> Alas, it is a fairly ordinary but pleasant, long lasting and sweet vanilla-type perfume.</li>
            <li> I have ordered other perfumes from Amazon, and this is the first time I&#x27;ve experience this issue.</li>
            <li> I find Shalimar overbearing and reminiscent of what old women in their 60s would wear (no offense!).</li>
            <li> I usually wear Cartier Parfum (the original) or Chanel No. 5.</li>
            <li> You were all right when many of you said this perfume stinks and that it may be turned.  </li>
            <li> I still have a drop left from my old bottle and compared it to this one.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, and have spent the last few years looking for it, since I had forgotten the name.  </li>
            <li> I would deduct one star for the awkward bottle, its really kind of weird to hold but the smell is so good I will let that slide.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very subtle, and I&#x27;ve received many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li> It certainly cost less than is used to.</li>
            <li> This scent is known for it longevity and sillage, however the product I received seems very watered down to the point</li>
            <li> I have been using Chopard Casmir since it first came out in, I think, either the late 80s or early 90s  </li>
            <li> This perfume has a long lasting soft scent that&#x27;s a welcomed nose grabber.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with Casmir and Amazon because I can get this perfume at a less expensive price than I can get it in a store.  </li>
            <li> I wore it years ago when I was rich, then became divorced and poor, and now I&#x27;m trying to dig myself out of poverty and gain some self-esteem.</li>
            <li> Long lasting ,and just so luscious.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve always loved this perfume and was disappointed when they stopped selling it in dept stores.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered my bottle directly from amazon, hope it&#x27;s not a watered down version of it, am worried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say this product does not smell nearly as rich or deep.</li>
            <li> Some of the notes are similar but the overall, this scent is sharp, like cat pee.</li>
            <li> so i won&#x27;t need to replace it for a long time</li>
            <li> Casmir has been discontinued a long time ago.</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I believe this is a reproduction of the old Casmir and not authentic.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume and very difficult to find anymore, even in the department stores.</li>
            <li> I had some cologne left from a previous purchase.  </li>
            <li> and I spritzed a little in the bend of my left elbow for comparison.</li>
            <li> It was everything that we expected it to be</li>
            <li> I ordered this taking the risk that maybe it was not real.  </li>
            <li> I am curious to hear what others think about it.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this fragrance for me years ago and it keeps getting harder to find.  </li>
            <li> Came faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is watered down a bit or not, but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I remember it did.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it four stars is because it did not qualify for free shipping. :(</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way&amp;a</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, every time I wear it I get asked what I am wearing.</li>
            <li> Have not used any other perfume since.</li>
            <li> The fragrance arrived in a box, but was not sealed in the usual outside plastic wrap.</li>
            <li> Its sharp and may seem offensive.....</li>
            <li> I get a heavy single drip</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in regular stores now.  </li>
            <li> It gave me an immediate headache, is very strong, smells horrible, turned dark yellow or orange</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the spray part seems damaged it leaks perfume.</li>
            <li> I was not able to wear perfume for a long time due to getting sick while wearing a perfume while pregnant.  </li>
            <li> I have received at least 3 bad items, perhaps more.</li>
            <li> and my return on a previous item was painless.  </li>
            <li> I got it on Amazon for less than half that amount!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for a little over 2 years now and i always get compliments.  </li>
            <li> Definitely NOT worth the money!</li>
            <li> Clearly, something is wrong with the suppliers that they use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I use few time</li>
            <li> It is not a scent i wear everyday since I am a perfume lover</li>
            <li> However, I can assure you that these claims, which are numerous, are true: Amazon is selling either fake perfumes or bad perfumes.</li>
            <li> but I am very disappointed since this was always my favorite scent</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read numerous product reviews on Amazon with claims that the perfumes were fake.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what is going on with this perfume</li>
            <li> It is all I usually use.  </li>
            <li> Not pleased.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was not the same Casmir.</li>
            <li> OMG what a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Not sweet, but spicy and subtle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle (perhaps a little too subtle?)</li>
            <li> When I had run out, I had a hard time finding it because I didn&#x27;t use the internet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to know how a fragrance is going to mix with our body chemistry and</li>
            <li> it has been my signature sent for at least 10 years.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is not the first time that I received a bad item from Amazon.</li>
            <li> it is to me a subtle and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and u still hav a subtle fragrance on you by evening</li>
            <li> Not real impressed with this item.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews about customers who received a bad product of Casmir - I can&#x27;t say what happened?</li>
            <li> Always but definitely not as good.</li>
            <li> A very hard to find fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for years, and never grow tired of it.</li>
            <li> Within a few years, it was no longer sold in the US, and I was desperate.  </li>
            <li> I bought several bottles, and all of them were bad!</li>
            <li> Hard to find amymore...........will buy again!!</li>
            <li> I had read negative reviews on Amazon about this perfume being fake or bad.</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to obtain in stores</li>
            <li> and I can tell it is bad.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again :(</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the way it comes out.</li>
            <li> It smelled terrible, just terrible.</li>
            <li> It smelled terrible, nothing like the scent</li>
            <li> It was not covered in plastic wrap, and it looked like some of the perfume was used, besides the point of it smelling horrible.    </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My signature cologne.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume and one you cannot often find.  Love the spicyness</li>
            <li> An exotic type scent for women who prefer a richer perfume. It has an oriental, spicy, woodsy smell.  I am a huge fan of patchouli and find this in like category.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product before just not through amazon. It is exactly as it says and the price was amazing. Normally a smaller bottle would cost what I paid for the larger size. So pleased.</li>
            <li> It does not smell like the original</li>
            <li> Delivered fast and safe. Just as described. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Amazing fast delivery! Lovely fragrance. My very favorite!</li>
            <li> I got charged for the perfume but never received it. It just never arrived! I tried getting in touch with the retailer but nothing was accomplished.</li>
            <li> OMG, this perfume is so lovely to the person wearing it, but be careful wearing it around men!  I am constantly complimented and flirted with relentlessly when I wear this perfume.  This will be my 3rd bottle.  IDK why but it must have pheromones in it or something because men like hover around men like bees to honey when I go out.  If you want to attract the opposite sex then put this on, I bet you&#x27;ll get a few date offers, lol.</li>
            <li> This parfum is incredible. I used it years ago and then couldn&#x27;t find it and finally checked amazon around Christmas. I was so excited to get it in the mail to find out that it is still the same Casmir I used so long ago. It is an incredibly soft, sexy parfum.</li>
            <li> I received a box of Casmir from Amazon. It smelled terrible, just terrible. It most certainly WAS NOT an oriental vanilla. I subsequently ordered a sample vial of Casmir from a very reputable perfume dealer online. Guess what? That one WAS an oriental vanilla, and it smelled nothing like the Casmir that I received from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read numerous product reviews on Amazon with claims that the perfumes were fake. I always dismissed these, assuming that people did not know what they were talking about. However, I can assure you that these claims, which are numerous, are true: Amazon is selling either fake perfumes or bad perfumes. Unfortunately, this is not the first time that I received a bad item from Amazon. I have received at least 3 bad items, perhaps more. Clearly, something is wrong with the suppliers that they use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My strong advice is to refuse to accept any open box item or any item that does not smell as it should from Amazon. If necessary, order a $1-$3 sample from one of the perfume vendors to compare. For me, moving forward any beauty item that I receive is under the microscope, and I will not purchase any high end perfumes from Amazon. Never, ever, never.</li>
            <li> Perfume great but delivery  way to long weeks</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this scent since mid 90&#x27;s.  I love it. Use it sparingly.  The body creme is the best but its no longer being manufactured....I like it as a winter scent as Im a Dolce Garbana Lite blue fan come spring.summer</li>
            <li> I ordered Casmir by Chopard from Amazon. It smelled terrible, nothing like the scent I know it to be, which is an oriental vanilla. This smells like I&#x27;m wearing an ashtray.    The Casmir that I received from Amazon was supposed to be new, however I don&#x27;t believe mine was. It was not covered in plastic wrap, and it looked like some of the perfume was used, besides the point of it smelling horrible.    I had read negative reviews on Amazon about this perfume being fake or bad. I noticed on Amazon&#x27;s website that it is advertised as a new arrival, so I thought that perhaps Amazon has taken care of this matter. Well, let me just say it is not the real Casmir by Chopard. The real Casmir smells wonderful. My advice if you would like to purchase this perfume, is to get it elsewhere. I have ordered other perfumes from Amazon, and this is the first time I&#x27;ve experience this issue. So hopefully this will not become a continual problem.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of perfume online, sometimes it&#x27;s fresh most of the time it&#x27;s not.  I don&#x27;t like it when I buy perfume and the scent has already dissipated from the bottle.  I have a strategy for when I buy perfume, I won&#x27;t bother to bore you with the details, but I did feel better about buying my perfume from Amazon because I dealt with Amazon before and my return on a previous item was painless.  I knew that if I had a problem with my order I could rectify the problem with ease and be sent a new perfume if need be.  I enjoy buying from Amazon for this reason and will definitely order more perfume from you all again.  I love the Chopard line and am drunk in love with Casmir.  My order arrived so fast too, I love not having to wait 7-10 days for my items.  Thank you and have a great day!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume and very difficult to find anymore, even in the department stores.</li>
            <li> This was a gift, recipient very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This was just what I needed at a very affordable price. Delivery was prompt and all expectations were met or exceeded. Recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for years, and never grow tired of it. Like other reviewers, every time I wear it I get asked what I am wearing. I don&#x27;t know where the \\&quot;undertones of melon\\&quot; comes from in the description - never caught a whiff of a cantaloupe when I put it on. It is just an all-out delightful fragrance. Worth every penny, and a bargain at this price, to boot!</li>
            <li> I have been using Chopard Casmir since it first came out in, I think, either the late 80s or early 90s  ... I found it on an insert in \\&quot;Vanity Fair\\&quot; Magazine and had to call an 800 number to get it.  It is fabulous ... still get comments almost daily.  Have not used any other perfume since.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, but something in it makes me sneeze and my nose to get stuffed.</li>
            <li> My favorite!  Be prepared to continually see my order for this product in the future.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this perfume but hasn&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere.  The last time she bought it, she paid over $70.  I got it on Amazon for less than half that amount!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a woodsy mix of vanilla and spice.  It wears well for day and evening.  It lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It was everything that we expected it to be</li>
            <li> Great product and shipped quickly, thank you!</li>
            <li> I ordered this taking the risk that maybe it was not real.  Department stores have stopped&lt;br /&gt;offering this fragrance for many years....so I was glad to find it and when it arrived it was authentic...and I ordered one for a frind who loved it too...</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance and I can no longer find it in stores. People consistenly ask my wife what it is and where they can get it.</li>
            <li> I love this scent since 1993 I wouldnt wear anything else ......sexy... everyone wants to smell me mmmmm,,love it...my granddaughter says u smell so good grandma</li>
            <li> I had tried to replace a perfume that had received as a gift, I was happy to buy but when I received I just did not feel it was the same so I use few time and then I stopped to wear. The original one I had received as a gift,  I would smelled a pleasant odor when I put on, this one i did not.</li>
            <li> Beautiful warm undertones of vanilla- one of my favorite scents to wear in the Winter.</li>
            <li> I have normally purchased this product at a retail location, but no one carries it anymore!  I was pleased to find it on Amazon!  However, the scent disappears quickly.  I am not sure if it is watered down a bit or not, but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I remember it did.  It is a beautiful fragrance, very warm and sensual.  It has notes of vanilla, which I just love.  I would recommend buying the Casmir body lotion along with this EDP so that it will last a bit longer.</li>
            <li> I have been using Casmir for years but the last two bottles I purchased have had a different scent than I am used to.  They almost seem like the perfume is old.  Casmir was always a long lasting scent and the longer you wore it, the better it smelled.  This perfume is not long lasting and it doesn&#x27;t have as much vanilla in it as before.  I am not sure what is going on with this perfume but I am very disappointed since this was always my favorite scent and I wore it all the time.  I will not purchase this perfume again.</li>
            <li> Casmir produces a beautiful vanilla-based scent. I disagree with an earlier review that compares Casmir to Shalimar. I find Shalimar overbearing and reminiscent of what old women in their 60s would wear (no offense!). Casmir has a more &#x27;youthful&#x27; scent, heavy and warm for winter. I&#x27;m one who usually wears nothing heavier than Amarige de Givenchy, and am prone to more floral scents such as Champs Elysees. However, I make an exception for the beautiful warmth of Casmir.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite and we haven&#x27;t been able to find it in our local stores. She loves the present. I don&#x27;t need to say anymore.</li>
            <li> Awesome price for perfume I can&#x27;t find at stores</li>
            <li> I am constantly receiving compliments on how \\&quot;good\\&quot; I smell whenever I wear Casmir. I have had friends, as well as many strangers inquire into the name of the perfume that I was wearing. Men &amp; women seem to love it equally. I usually have about 10 different perfumes that I choose from at any given time depending on my mood, but Chopard Casmir &amp; Chopard Wish are my absolute favorites! Althought you will want to save this exotic oriental scent for special occasions, you can actually wear it anytime.   Casmir&#x27;s scent also lasts remarkably longer than almost any other perfume that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Item arrived intact and has the same great scent as always.  Wonderful to wear anytime of the year for any occasion.</li>
            <li> I ordered Casmir because you just can&#x27;t find it in department stores anymore.  I&#x27;ve always loved the scent, ever since it first came out.  If you like a vanilla type scent like Shalimar, (another one of my favorites), you&#x27;ll really like this perfume.</li>
            <li> One of my all time favorite fragrances! I was happy to find I again since it appeared to be discontinued.</li>
            <li> I was given this cologne as a Christmas gift years ago and fell in love with it. It has a soft fragrance that is a compliment to you and not an abrasion to others around you. I just wish I could find the body lotion and bath soap that the company once produced. Anyone have any info? &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve always loved this perfume and was disappointed when they stopped selling it in dept stores.  when i found it online i was so happy, but it doesn&#x27;t smell the same as i remember. i was so excited when i received it but i only used it a couple of times.  its almost like its old.  it smells like cigarette ashes.  it may be so old that the fragrance is gone and all is left is alcohol.  or maybe it&#x27;s a knockoff.</li>
            <li> My most favorite scent.  It is all I usually use.  I get complement every time I wear it.  It is light and spicy and lasts a long time.  Try spraying in on your hair brush and it makes your hair smell good also.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this perfume.  I am consistently complimented on the scent whenever I wear it.  It is very difficult to find, so I am thrilled that I am able to purchase here.  If you like a bold scent, this one is for you!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for a little over 2 years now and i always get compliments.  i can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore but it&#x27;s a great price online.  got it for my birthday this year, my husband loves it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful smelling for a long time.  Many comments about how great it smells on me.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Casmir by Chopard for over 15 years. I found it difficult to obtain in stores so I ordered it online.It certainly cost less than is used to. The drawback is that it just does not smell the same as it used to, to me. There is a slim chance that this is me, but I also think that maybe the ingredients and or the process in making it has been changed. I am considering returning it. I am curious to hear what others think about it.</li>
            <li> Got this for a friend who bought this same perfume in Europe and paid a hefty price for it.  Same stuff here only cheaper!</li>
            <li> Everything worked out perfectly and quickly. Received the large size of my favorite perfume spray in an inexpensive and timely manner. Very happy.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite perfume.  It is hard to find in regular stores now.  Plus it is cheaper than what the stores used to carry it for.  Definately a good value.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite.  I have been looking for a source for this for years.  I am glad I found it through Amazon. Great price and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> This is a classic perfume with vanilla overtones. Not too sweet or spicy. It dries to a lovely powdery finish.&lt;br /&gt; I was not able to wear perfume for a long time due to getting sick while wearing a perfume while pregnant.  I don&#x27;t know why but I just couldn&#x27;t find one that didn&#x27;t give me a headache.  I finally found Casmir and then the department store I bought it from quit carrying it.  Thank goodness for online sites!  If you can&#x27;t wear perfume or find them all too sweet or strong, I think you will like this one.</li>
            <li> I WAS SHOPPING IN FORTUNOFFS&#x27; YEARS AGO ,AND A WOMAN SHOPPING HAD ON \\&quot;CASMIR\\&quot;.I  ASKED HER THE NAME OF HER PERFUME. I HAD NEVER HEARD OF IT BEFORE. NOW IT IS MY FAVORITE.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume...it has been my signature sent for at least 10 years.</li>
            <li> This is a time proven fragrance and yet lesser known than the fads that come and go so quickly. It is a rich musky blend which stays with you and is enjoyed by many who smell it. I have been complimented more on this fragrance than any I have ever worn. I have enjoyed it for years.</li>
            <li> Love  the fragrance but it does not spray I get a heavy single drip I was very disappointed with the way it comes out.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Casmir and was delighted to find another bottle. Received it in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> the smell is fine. I couldn&#x27;t wear it anymore, it reminded me too much of the time when I wore it when it came out</li>
            <li> I remembered smelling this fragrance on my best friend and said &amp;#34;WHAT IS THAT fragrance you are wearing it smells so good? I have to have it! I got this and it smells exactly like I remembered.</li>
            <li> Love the scent.  Product came quick, packaged well, and was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> This has been one of my favorite fragrances, and I was pretty heart torn when I could no longer find the body cream.&lt;br /&gt;My son found the EDP on Amazon and purchased it for me!&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful fragrance and I love the bottle too!</li>
            <li> This soft vanilla fragrance is absolutely beautiful. It lasts all day and men love it! If you&#x27;re looking for a sweet, ffeminine, fragrance, this one fits the bill!</li>
            <li> This has always been my favorite fragrance! I was so VERY happy to find it because of Amazon &amp; will continue to buy this product as long as I can find it</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loved her first motther&#x27;s day gift.</li>
            <li> this to me is a nice light  scent that has a vanilla top note that dries down to a soft powdery scent.  it is to me a subtle and not overpowering. a little goes a long way&amp;a great price would order again</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume from years ago! Very clean not over powering scent! You will love it I did.</li>
            <li> This is the easiest review in the world to write. This is my favorite perfume. It lasts all day and u still hav a subtle fragrance on you by evening so you do not have to apply it very often. It is a great daytime and evening fragrance. I always get compliments.  Also the size i purchased is huge so i won&#x27;t need to replace it for a long time so it is definitely worth the price</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend of mine because she likes it a  lot.  I&lt;br /&gt;The gift was much appreciated.</li>
            <li> After years of searching for a \\&quot;signature\\&quot; fragrance, I came upon Casmir by Chopard, and loved it.  Within a few years, it was no longer sold in the US, and I was desperate.  I&#x27;m thrilled that I can now find it consistently at Amazon.  I will never be without Casmir.</li>
            <li> The order took a little longer than expected, but otherwise everything was great!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> NOPE and it&#x27;s unreturnable. I still have a drop left from my old bottle and compared it to this one. I&#x27;m sorry to say this product does not smell nearly as rich or deep. Some of the notes are similar but the overall, this scent is sharp, like cat pee.</li>
            <li> Since Casmir is no longer being produced, I was glad to find it on your site and to purchase yet another bottle to enjoy!</li>
            <li> my favorite, and best price, prompt delivery</li>
            <li> My signature perfume.  Love it!</li>
            <li> one of my very favorite colognes ......get lots of complements when I wear it. Which is just about every day I work.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Been wearing the same smell for over 15 years. Wouldn&#x27;t switch for the world. My all time favorite.</li>
            <li> This is not the same Casmir I ordered years ago.  It smells cheap,  could be the fact that it says Coty on the bottle.  Not pleased.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and I like the way she smells. Its a real turnon for me.&lt;br /&gt;Guys it would make a great Valentine gift. :-)</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance for my grandmother because I used to be her favorite sent but then it was discontinued! I was so happy I found it on amazon for such a great price, my grandmother loves it and is so happy she had another bottle to savor for a while</li>
            <li> This is my very favorite. Hope it never goes out of stock.</li>
            <li> Totally love the smell</li>
            <li> My husband bought this fragrance for me years ago and it keeps getting harder to find.  Found it here for a good price and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> My favorite of all time !</li>
            <li> The fragrance arrived in a box, but was not sealed in the usual outside plastic wrap. This scent is known for it longevity and sillage, however the product I received seems very watered down to the point it can&#x27;t be smelled after the first 15 minutes.  I&#x27;m positive it&#x27;s not the authentic fragrance, but a copycat or a diluted version...I would not recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> This is a keeper! At first spray its nothing I really like. Its sharp and may seem offensive.....give it a minute! It dries down to something sensual, warm and sexy. Definitely your go to winter scent (for summer try Chopard Wish!) This scent gets everyone&#x27;s attention but its not overpowering. Men will follow you trying to get a closer whiff!  Its vanilla musky deliciousness!  I would deduct one star for the awkward bottle, its really kind of weird to hold but the smell is so good I will let that slide.  Love gourmands? Love sexy vanillas? 3.4 ounces for under 30 bucks? You cant beat this ladies and the men LOVE it.....get some!</li>
            <li> I find this fragrance addictive !  It is awesome.</li>
            <li> This perfume has always been a favorite since my husband first brought it for my in Germany. When I had run out, I had a hard time finding it because I didn&#x27;t use the internet. Now that I&#x27;ve found it, I&#x27;ll never run out again. This perfume has a long lasting soft scent that&#x27;s a welcomed nose grabber.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Casmir for years and still love it!  It is a great every day scent and I am still getting compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I have had many compliments on this perfume and I have not run into anyone else who uses it.  The smell seems to last awhile and smells different on my clothes than on my wrist.  Have fun.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Fiance&#x27; and she absolutely loves it.  Smells Amazing too!  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves Sandalwood.</li>
            <li> I usually wear Cartier Parfum (the original) or Chanel No. 5. My sister recommended this to me and I gave it a try. I like it fairly well. It&#x27;s hard to know how a fragrance is going to mix with our body chemistry and this goes on strong yet lasts long. In the end, a great value for the buck!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see my favorite perfume on Amazon because I could not get it locally anymore.  And to top it off, it was less expensive and got here super quick !  I know where I&#x27;ll go for my next bottle....</li>
            <li> It met my expectations and more---cost was exceptional  It was the best in cost I paid for 2 2 what I usually pay for 1</li>
            <li> I love the smell of vanilla, my house is full of vanilla candles.  I have used the perfume for over 20 years.  I just ordered my bottle directly from amazon, hope it&#x27;s not a watered down version of it, am worried.  Last time I purchased it at a flea market where they sell perfumes over a year ago.  It is not a scent i wear everyday since I am a perfume lover but every single time I do I am asked what am I wearing, always get positive compliments.</li>
            <li> I had recently run out of my long time favorite Casmir and ordered it at Amazon.  The perfume had turned.  It has a strong acrid smell not even remotely associated with Casmir.  Then, I found out that Amazon does not honor returns on liquids.  Never thought I would have this problem, but I do.  And I will accept responsibility.  Must have been stored somewhere where the heat got to it.  Beware before ordering.</li>
            <li> Looked everywhere so glad I found it, bought two.</li>
            <li> Casmir by Chopard for Women - 3.4 Ounce EDP Spray.  This is one of my favorite scents, it does not give me allergies.</li>
            <li> Old time perfume and I love the smell, get lots and lots of comments on it and most people have never heard of it!  I m asked quite often about what I&#x27;m wearing.  Lovely scent and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> absolutely love this fragrance!!!!  one of best ive ever used.  my new favorite.  fast shipping.  great seller!!!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for years and can no longer find it in the stores. Always reliable Amazon has it and at a great price.</li>
            <li> My perfume arrived timely and safely.  I love the smell of this product.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and just can&#x27;t find anything to match it.  Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> Great perfume...not too spicy, not too sweet. Classic fragrance like Chanel No. 5, Obsession by Calvin Klein, etc. I wore it years ago when I was rich, then became divorced and poor, and now I&#x27;m trying to dig myself out of poverty and gain some self-esteem. When I started looking for it again, couldn&#x27;t find it in stores. Finally found it here. Bought Casmir online, it was delivered in 2 days, and wearing it already makes me feel empowered like the good old days! I&#x27;ve received many, many compliments from the enchanting fragrance. Ladies, throw away your way too sweet, flowery perfumes, and take a walk on the wild side. You&#x27;ll have to swat the men away like flies at a dumpster!</li>
            <li> Excellent seller and excellent product</li>
            <li> Casmir has been discontinued a long time ago. I bought this for my mother as a gift. She has been a fan of Casmir and was looking forward to it. Unfortunately it was not the same Casmir. Not the original anyways. The perfume still smells good but different. I believe this is a reproduction of the old Casmir and not authentic. I smell more detergent in this perfume for some reason than the sweet smell casmir produced. Casmir is greatly missed.</li>
            <li> Just awesome and brilliant, highly recommended, actually parfum should only bought on amazon</li>
            <li> Smells of vanilla, but better.  I love this perfume, and have spent the last few years looking for it, since I had forgotten the name.  It is warm and inviting, and lasts on my skin for hours.</li>
            <li> I ordered Casmir and I received my order within the time advertised.  This is a fantastic perfume spray with a vanilla scent.  It is exotic and it makes me feel great when I wear it!  My order got here in the time alotted.  I am very pleased with Casmir and Amazon because I can get this perfume at a less expensive price than I can get it in a store.  Thanks to Amazon, I can get it any time I want!</li>
            <li> I was overseas the first time I smelled it, it was so sweet and feminine, I loved it!  This one didn&#x27;t smell the same, it seemed stronger and I have to spray it and walk into it....but it also fades fast?  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again :(</li>
            <li> It smells like I remember (good) but the box was open!!! There was no protective paper that covers the box!</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite perfumes. I am able to get it here for alot more than other places.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife last Christmas and this is one of her favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li> Most perfumes give me a headache, but this is a  subtle warm fragrance with notes of vanilla that don&#x27;t bother me at all; I love it and so does my husband. It&#x27;s the only fragrance I&#x27;ve been wearing since it first came out.</li>
            <li> A beautiful perfume packaging, have not had access, acquire lasividade by the name, the color of the packaging and the product was recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Casual scent, not too strong, great for everyday where.  Have used this scent for years, it&#x27;s a classic that I never tire of.</li>
            <li> My favorite for 17 years.</li>
            <li> I had some cologne left from a previous purchase.  This cologne has a different scent.  I like my previous cologne scent better.</li>
            <li> I love,love,love this perfume.Not easy to find at this great price.It drives men wild! Long lasting ,and just so luscious.</li>
            <li> I can no longer find this in stores-I am grateful I can still buy online. Same product, same great fragrance. Fabulous price and very quick service!</li>
            <li> This perfume gives me a headache. It smells a bit like Avon&#x27;s Today Tomorrow Always but definitely not as good.</li>
            <li> I only rated it as ok, as it did not come in a sealed packaging, which I would of expected when purchasing a new item. Also, it smelled like some of the perfumes I have let sit on my shelve too long, and have a more alcohol smell than a newer bottle has. Not real impressed with this item. Didn&#x27;t return the item, just will not purchase any online perfume ever again.</li>
            <li> I scrimped and scraped some 20 years ago to purchase this. Alas, it is a fairly ordinary but pleasant, long lasting and sweet vanilla-type perfume. Think drugstore vanilla fragrances. I would categorize it as mostly a winter/evening/romantic scent. Enjoyed it, but paid too much. I see the price is more in line with reality these days. Enjoy.</li>
            <li> This is a true classic perfume. The fragrance is absolutely unique and unforgettable. beautifully packaged and a steal at this price.</li>
            <li> Exquisite fragance and silage. Came faster than expected. Original scent and great packaging. Chopard fragances are as great as their jewelry and this one is a classic one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from Europe and I used to buy this perfume ! It is NOT the ORIGINAL! Don&#x27;t buy it! You will regretted it ! It is  cheap so you get what you pay!</li>
            <li> I love a vanilla based scent and this one is, along with something else I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on. It&#x27;s subtle (perhaps a little too subtle?) but overall very nice.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my Mother.  Its her favorite.</li>
            <li> I have worn this fragrance for years, and was excited to find it at such a low cost. I bought several bottles, and all of them were bad! No smell whatsoever! Just colored water. They were all new and in a sealed box, but this IS NOT THE REAL THING! Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> Product is exactly what my wife expected.  Price is very competitive.  Not always able to get this product in local stores.</li>
            <li> Item well packaged.  Very pleased, order was as described.</li>
            <li> So nice to wear and not invasive like some.  The scent is fresh and sweet and fades to a soft scent.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews about customers who received a bad product of Casmir - I can&#x27;t say what happened? I received the quantity 2 of which I purchased. Both are newly boxed but without clear package wrapping. Each of the them smell great just as Casmir does. I love this Parfume! I did check to see if I could smell it the next morning after using it after bath the night before. The scent was still there as most Casmir users know - if it&#x27;s real, it will last several hours. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The has a beautiful fruity almost hypnotic odor.  I love it every time my wife uses it</li>
            <li> I always get asked what I&#x27;m wearing with this, I have to admit to wearing it anytime, day or night, though it is probably a little heavier than most daytime perfumes. Very sensual scent that lingers after you walk by. Along the lines of obsession and poison.</li>
            <li> I receive so many positive comments about the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Was so glad to find this as is not sold in stores anymore in USA.  Packaged great! Very pleased &amp; thank you.</li>
            <li> This is now my personal scent... I had been looking for that unique smell that fit me perfect to be the one I ware most all the time and I finally found it... This is so soft and fits me perfect. Thanks so much and never quite selling it...</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  Good price and smells great.</li>
            <li> I have so missed the smell of Casmir.  This did not disappoint and was just how I remembered it.  It&#x27;s so nice to know I can still find it on-line.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and I can&#x27;t find it in stores! I am so glad I found it here.  Thanks</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff and I love it on her. Hard to find amymore...........will buy again!!</li>
            <li> This perfume is very good my wife and I like the fragrance.  It is very nice and not overpowering. Good.</li>
            <li> The items had almost no smell at all. It was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> One of my very favorite scents at a very good price.</li>
            <li> Delicious aroma, fine, exquisite and unique. It smells different, not like those fragrances fashion that everyone uses. I bought it at a great price, in a store in my country had not found and would have paid a small fortune. I plead forever AMAZON admirer.</li>
            <li> Casmir perfume is one of my favorites, but  this didn&#x27;t smell quite like my original.  Not sure if they changed the ingredients, although this one has  a nice smell just very light.</li>
            <li> Used this years ago and even love it more now. Not sweet, but spicy and subtle.  I&#x27;d stick with the EDP , though</li>
            <li> The package arrived today as promised. That&#x27;s the only aspect of this purchase I&#x27;m happy about. When I opened the packaging the box containing the product purported to be EDP was not overwrapped in plastic. That should have been a warning that this package probably had been open before. I sprayed the supposed EDP on my skin and literally within 2 to 3 minutes the scent had evaporated! As I replaced the top, I noticed that my fingers were damp--it leaks! To be fair, I had a precious little left of a bottle of Casmir EDP I bought a couple of years ago and I spritzed a little in the bend of my left elbow for comparison. This was about 6:00 p.m. It is now after 4:00 a.m. and the scent is still there! The product advertised as EDP is more like EDT--toilet water! I don&#x27;t know if Amazon will refund my money but I know one thing: I won&#x27;t buy any fragrance products from them again! I&#x27;ve bought many products from Amazon and have been very satisfied until now. I should have paid more attention to the 1 and 2 star reviews but wanted to give this product a fair shot. Definitely NOT worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this perfume twice from Amazon and it was received on time and well packaged.  This has a wonderful spice scent with vanilla.  I&#x27;m not a floral person so this is perfect for me.  Always get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> I used this product over ten years ago and could no longer find it at the local department stores.  Was very happy find it online.</li>
            <li> Awesome scent! Brings me back to the 90&#x27;s all over again!  ;)</li>
            <li> Yes, the perfume is my favorite.</li>
            <li> You were all right when many of you said this perfume stinks and that it may be turned.  It gave me an immediate headache, is very strong, smells horrible, turned dark yellow or orange and I can tell it is bad.  How anyone can think this is a good quality perfume is beyond me.  Some of you here said they loved it so I took a chance. And I can&#x27;t return it b/c its flammable?  OMG what a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly, with no problems  This is my favorite perfume!  It&#x27;s very subtle, and I&#x27;ve received many compliments on it.  The only reason I gave it four stars is because it did not qualify for free shipping. :(</li>
            <li> A very hard to find fragrance. First spray it smells like spicy amber once it drys down a bit soft fruity vanilla. Great staying power. If you like stronger scents like CD Poison you wil love this one. Great price fast deliverie by Amazon plus free shipping equals a very happy shopper :). My only complaint is the spray part seems damaged it leaks perfume.</li>
            <li> smooth product in perfect condition</li>
