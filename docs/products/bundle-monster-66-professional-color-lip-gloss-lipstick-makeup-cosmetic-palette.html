            <li>Good value for the price.</li>
            <li>good item.</li>
            <li>all the colors looked absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Quality: Even better than we expect it to be, the colors are bright and lasting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ready about product arriving melted, but mine was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice lip gloss.</li>
            <li>It came right on time and was packed great so that nothing was damaged.</li>
            <li>And has nice warm and cool tones for fall.</li>
            <li>They are pretty pigmented, I have light pinisk lips, so the colors show up nicely on mine, the bright pinks and hot bright colors look verrrrry nice.</li>
            <li>It should have been stored better.</li>
            <li>Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li>I love this lip gloss palette.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>it is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Overall an amazing product that is great for anyone</li>
            <li>This is great for young inspiring artist like myself ,but its also great for little girls who are wanting to play dress up.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product 3rd one I have purchased 1 went to my daughter one my mother took and this one is finally mine under lock and key lol</li>
            <li>I was wanting to try a bunch of different colors on me to see what looked good and what didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>good enough to play with when her friends come over for girly make overs.</li>
            <li>should have researched further into ingredients which are not so good.</li>
            <li>If you want your kids to play with the colors - I would say not a bad product.</li>
            <li>It is very good quality makeup instead of the cheap toy makeup that doesn&#x27;t go on and is super hard to get off once you make it stick.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t going for a super liquidy gloss anyways.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and in tacked.</li>
            <li>but so far I love it.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s the point in having so many color options if they all come out basically clear?  </li>
            <li>This also works for just women in general who want to be able to play with their lip gloss color without buying sticks and sticks of the stuff.</li>
            <li>Got this for my girlfriend, she was looking for a set like this for a long time, here are the reasons why she liked it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:) Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>Many colors for different looks.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t have very high hopes for this product in the first place.</li>
            <li>The colors are very vibrant and glossy.</li>
            <li>This helped to narrow it down and a great price!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d get much from this product</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very pigmented and very convenient when doing makeup for my friends and family.</li>
            <li>colors are bright, and pretty, the feel of them is definitely glossy, but not like a liquid gloss, more of a sticky like gloss which isnt so bad.</li>
            <li>Plenty of colors including fun colors of blue and purple.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re a guy, give it as a gift and you&#x27;ll surprise your girlfriend/wife for giving her something unexpected and always wanted!</li>
            <li>but i was pleseantly surprised to find out</li>

            <li> SO I was afraid this was going to come to me melted, like some of the other reviewers said, but it DIDN&#x27;T!!! yay! lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Amazon wont let me upload a product photo, but I have a link to it on Flickr here: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are bright, and pretty, the feel of them is definitely glossy, but not like a liquid gloss, more of a sticky like gloss which isnt so bad. I wasn&#x27;t going for a super liquidy gloss anyways.

And has nice warm and cool tones for fall. Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a week ago. It came right on time and was packed great so that nothing was damaged. The colors are very vibrant and glossy. I have never ordered lip gloss palettes before but I have quite a few eye shadow palettes. I thought it would be the same size but i was pleseantly surprised to find out it is quite smaller and slimmer then eye shadow palettes. I don&#x27;t know if it being slim will effect how long the lip gloss last but so far I love it. This is great for young inspiring artist like myself ,but its also great for little girls who are wanting to play dress up. It is very good quality makeup instead of the cheap toy makeup that doesn&#x27;t go on and is super hard to get off once you make it stick. This also works for just women in general who want to be able to play with their lip gloss color without buying sticks and sticks of the stuff. Overall an amazing product that is great for anyone</li>
            <li> I was actually pleased with the color selections, I was very disappointed with individual pots for the lipstick being close to empty.</li>
            <li> I love this lip gloss palette. Many colors for different looks. Definitely would reorder. Seems as if though that after five use its done.</li>
            <li> i love it. it is wonderfull. it is my favorite. i use it every day. it is excelllent. i recommend it</li>
            <li> Very little pigment at all. What&#x27;s the point in having so many color options if they all come out basically clear?  Disappointing,  but I didn&#x27;t have very high hopes for this product in the first place. Now I know...</li>
            <li> I was wanting to try a bunch of different colors on me to see what looked good and what didn&#x27;t. This helped to narrow it down and a great price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice lip gloss. Plenty of colors including fun colors of blue and purple.</li>
            <li> I order this as a gift for my sister-in-law. It came quickly and in tacked. There were no signs of tampering and all the colors looked absolutely amazing. There is a lot to work with and my SIL was happy.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and bought the product. It was a sheer wastage of money. If you want your kids to play with the colors - I would say not a bad product.</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend, she was looking for a set like this for a long time, here are the reasons why she liked it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Variety: A lot of colors, she can use a different one every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Price; Great price for a great product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Quality: Even better than we expect it to be, the colors are bright and lasting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a guy, give it as a gift and you&#x27;ll surprise your girlfriend/wife for giving her something unexpected and always wanted!</li>
            <li> I got this because I was sick of buying lipstick without knowing what it was gonna look like on me when i got home.  I was able to get this and find the perfect shades for me and my mood. Love it</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughters birthday.  She is just getting into makeup and loves all the colors this set has.  They are small samples but good enough to play with when her friends come over for girly make overs.</li>
            <li> This palette camed to me as international shipping and all melted.&lt;br /&gt;40% of the colors does not worth for anything and the glosses are too sticky is not a good thing to buy</li>
            <li> good item. some glosses came melted when i received them. should have researched further into ingredients which are not so good.</li>
            <li> Very good for the price. The space for the lip color is a tiny circle.but is useable. I apply it with a lip brush.</li>
