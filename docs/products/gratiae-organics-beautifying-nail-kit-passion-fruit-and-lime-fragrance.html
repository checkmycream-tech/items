            <li>The hand cream is wonderful</li>
            <li>The very best hand cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Excellent.</li>
            <li>This price was arrived at after she struggled to find ways to add in her points and find me the best deal because she wanted me not to leave the store without the product.</li>
            <li>Really good!!</li>
            <li>Its great, I give myself a manicure every week now.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for over a year and the PRODUCT is great.  </li>
            <li>The nail buffer is great, but the rest of the products are so-so.</li>
            <li>I also used the cream on my feet and am getting great results.</li>
            <li>Greatiae buffing blocks give a really GREAT shine to nails.</li>
            <li>Love all the items in the kit and perfect results for both of us.  </li>
            <li>They are by far the BEST nail buffer I have ever used and the best nail file.</li>
            <li>Love Gratiae!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good product !!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The cuticle oil was magical!</li>
            <li>But these sellers are amazing</li>
            <li>Smelled nice if a bit perfumey not fruity but will be returned</li>
            <li>I already liked the hand lotion.</li>
            <li>Really nice DIY manicure.</li>
            <li>nice gift too.</li>
            <li>But I was lucky - she almost sold me the eye serum and cream for the really great deal of $240.</li>
            <li>My nails shine and cuticles look healthy once again.</li>
            <li>I love this product, my husband purchased one for me in the mall</li>
            <li>love this product</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>and I love this product :))</li>
            <li>I was lured into the beautiful new high-end Gratiae store in Toronto&#x27;s Manulife Centre to get a free sample of soap.</li>
            <li>Overall a very good product.</li>
            <li>So far I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Scent is a bit strong.</li>
            <li>The buffing block leaves my nails super shiny!  </li>
            <li>I am also glad they changed the formula  of their cuticle oil where the first ingredient is NOT Mineral oil!</li>
            <li>The hand cream is nice but you need to use a lot to really moisturize.</li>
            <li>and my hands are incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li>Love the nail kit, especially the amazing buffer that leaves nails shiny, and use it weekly.</li>
            <li>I would buy some good quality cuticle cream in the future.</li>
            <li>Tried this at a kiosk at an airport, loved it, so ordered a second one at 1/3 the price to give away as a birthday gift.</li>
            <li>First two times the product was fine, but I won&#x27;t pay for used or damaged product which it appears this was.</li>
            <li>Only was able to buff my nails one time!</li>
            <li>First of all, this kit cost more than double in Gratiae mall karts.</li>
            <li>The product is not new and results from using it were okay.</li>
            <li>Really helped heal my hands and grow my nails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve have short nail and and don&#x27;t like nail polish and this kit give me the buffing block which is fabulous for getting a polished look without the chemicals.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECCOMMEND!</li>
            <li>so my guess is that someone returned the product and Amazon is trying to pass it off as new.  </li>
            <li>This store&#x27;s regular prices were double the suggested retail on the company&#x27;s website and several times more the prices you will find on Amazon.</li>
            <li>maybe it was old.</li>
            <li>I like Gratiae nail buffing products and love them when they are so inexpensive, only $9-12 usually.</li>
            <li>Beware though that when you first use the oil from the tube, a lot will come out (likely due to pressure/shipping).</li>
            <li>Sent me an open USED half full container of shea butter without other items.</li>

            <li> and this stuff keeps them looking soft and supple and even a little younger looking!</li>
            <li> The buffer didn&#x27;t last very long and started to peel at the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ~ i have extremely dry hands</li>
            <li> bought as a gift and package arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> This is as I expected.</li>
            <li> well that&#x27;s like any other and</li>
            <li> I have tried other products, but they don&#x27;t shine as well as Gratiae.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way and does not rinse off as soon as you wash your hands.</li>
            <li> The sales manager buffed my nails and managed to sell me three kits for $120 - apparently less than half price.</li>
            <li> Once opened, the oil does not close tight again</li>
            <li> But.... After a few uses, the shining part of the buffing block gets a little scratched and dull.</li>
            <li> The box from Amazon was fine but the Gratiae box inside was in very bad shape.  </li>
            <li> The portion of the products are small.  </li>
            <li> Winter is hard on my nails and hands...</li>
            <li> If you go to the mall they are selling for over $70, I know it;s a serious ripoff.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit disappointed when I opened the package but instead of sending it back I used it for a party game gift.</li>
            <li> Totally worthless and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The lotion is also smelly and I didn&#x27;t ill it at all.</li>
            <li> I TRULY am obsessed with this kit!</li>
            <li> That would also explain the bad smell.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this purchase.  </li>
            <li> That said, this order was horrible!  </li>

            <li> My wife loves that stuff.</li>
            <li> Winter is hard on my nails and hands...I got this in place of getting manicures. So far I am happy with the product. My nails shine and cuticles look healthy once again.</li>
            <li> First of all, this kit cost more than double in Gratiae mall karts. Its great, I give myself a manicure every week now. The buffing block leaves my nails super shiny!  But.... After a few uses, the shining part of the buffing block gets a little scratched and dull. Overall a very good product.</li>
            <li> Love Gratiae!  The hand cream is wonderful ~ i have extremely dry hands and this stuff keeps them looking soft and supple and even a little younger looking!</li>
            <li> The oil for cuticles has a rancid smell maybe it was old. Had to wash my hands several times to rid the smell.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for over a year and the PRODUCT is great.  That said, this order was horrible!  The box from Amazon was fine but the Gratiae box inside was in very bad shape.  The cuticle oil is NOT supposed to smell but this did and the hand care treatment tube was sticky. Once opened, the oil does not close tight again so my guess is that someone returned the product and Amazon is trying to pass it off as new.  That would also explain the bad smell.  I am very disappointed in this purchase.  I&#x27;ll continue to use the product but will NOT purchase it from Amazon again.  First two times the product was fine, but I won&#x27;t pay for used or damaged product which it appears this was.</li>
            <li> Scent is a bit strong.</li>
            <li> I love this product, my husband purchased one for me in the mall and I had been looking for it for a year or so. When I saw them on amazon I had to order them! They are by far the BEST nail buffer I have ever used and the best nail file. I am also glad they changed the formula  of their cuticle oil where the first ingredient is NOT Mineral oil!</li>
            <li> Sent me an open USED half full container of shea butter without other items. Smelled nice if a bit perfumey not fruity but will be returned</li>
            <li> Really helped heal my hands and grow my nails.  The very best hand cream I have ever used. A small amount goes a long way and does not rinse off as soon as you wash your hands.</li>
            <li> The portion of the products are small.  I was a little bit disappointed when I opened the package but instead of sending it back I used it for a party game gift.</li>
            <li> The buffer didn&#x27;t last very long and started to peel at the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness we bought it here instead of at the mall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good product !!</li>
            <li> bought for my daughter she loves it</li>
            <li> Use it for at home manicures for my husband and myself.  Love all the items in the kit and perfect results for both of us.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product currently sells at the mall at those kiosks whose personnel assault you as you walk by. I paid $50.00 plus tax for this and you can bet I am going back to ask for my money back! The nail buffer is great, but the rest of the products are so-so.</li>
            <li> Totally worthless and a waste of money. Only was able to buff my nails one time! The lotion is also smelly and I didn&#x27;t ill it at all.</li>
            <li> This product is so simple yet works wonders. I&#x27;ve have short nail and and don&#x27;t like nail polish and this kit give me the buffing block which is fabulous for getting a polished look without the chemicals. The hand cream is nice but you need to use a lot to really moisturize. The nail file well that&#x27;s like any other and the cuticle oil is the same. Haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference. However I will recommend this any day.</li>
            <li> Love it! bought it for a friend but I decided to keep it!</li>
            <li> love this product this is the secion one i bought</li>
            <li> I love this. If you go to the mall they are selling for over $70, I know it;s a serious ripoff. But these sellers are amazing and I love this product :))</li>
            <li> The product is not new and results from using it were okay. I would buy some good quality cuticle cream in the future.</li>
            <li> I already liked the hand lotion. The cuticle oil was magical! Really nice DIY manicure. Excellent. Will buy again soon. nice gift too.</li>
            <li> I was lured into the beautiful new high-end Gratiae store in Toronto&#x27;s Manulife Centre to get a free sample of soap. The sales manager buffed my nails and managed to sell me three kits for $120 - apparently less than half price. But I was lucky - she almost sold me the eye serum and cream for the really great deal of $240. This price was arrived at after she struggled to find ways to add in her points and find me the best deal because she wanted me not to leave the store without the product. This store&#x27;s regular prices were double the suggested retail on the company&#x27;s website and several times more the prices you will find on Amazon. Love the nail kit, especially the amazing buffer that leaves nails shiny, and use it weekly.</li>
            <li> I TRULY am obsessed with this kit! The cream and cuticle oil work instantly, This is only my second day using both and my hands are incredibly smooth. I also used the cream on my feet and am getting great results. The scent of this stuff is TO DIE for. I will definitely buy again! HIGHLY RECCOMMEND!</li>
            <li> bought as a gift and package arrived as expected. Beware though that when you first use the oil from the tube, a lot will come out (likely due to pressure/shipping).</li>
            <li> I like Gratiae nail buffing products and love them when they are so inexpensive, only $9-12 usually. Greatiae buffing blocks give a really GREAT shine to nails. I have tried other products, but they don&#x27;t shine as well as Gratiae. You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> This is as I expected. Really good!!</li>
            <li> Tried this at a kiosk at an airport, loved it, so ordered a second one at 1/3 the price to give away as a birthday gift.</li>
