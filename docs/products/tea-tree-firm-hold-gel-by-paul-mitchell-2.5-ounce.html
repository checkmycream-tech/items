    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>that is the best for hold in the market.</li>
            <li>This is the best gel hold ever.  </li>
            <li>The smell is awesome and the hold lasts about 14 hours without being too shiny.</li>
            <li>this is great.</li>
            <li>The price and convenience of the size are great and can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li>This is is great on guy&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Smells great and doesn&#x27;t give your hair that shiny look.</li>
            <li>Good,</li>
            <li>Good hold and smells nice and doesn&#x27;t seem to flake.</li>
            <li>I will be sure to recommend my friends to this seller!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while and its amazing.</li>
            <li>my hair feels very clean!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>I love the Paul Mitchel Tea Tree shampoo, so</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I received the package 5 stars for great shipping</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>so if you need something light....</li>
            <li>the hair gel left me with no frizz and smelled really good</li>
            <li>But I am sure this would be great for someone with thick hair.</li>
            <li>This is more for light styling, nothing more nothing less.</li>
            <li>Buy the American Crew Super Glue instead, and if you need more hold use the Spiker Gel....</li>
            <li>Not much else to say - a nice product</li>
            <li>It holds your hair in place with the &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34; at first.</li>
            <li>It was not for him because he has kind of thinner, softer hair, and this stuff is just too much, so it would dry out and make him feel like he had to wash his hair twice a day.</li>
            <li>Hair gel, I use a very small amount and it works great.</li>
            <li>This Tea Tree gel is very watery and does not hold up well for those who like to spike their hair.</li>
            <li>So I figured I&#x27;d find something much cheaper at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I really like this hair gel.</li>
            <li>This is NOT the same as the AC Super Glue.</li>
            <li>On another note, this is a high quality gel</li>
            <li>This gel is nowhere near the level of hold as the American Crew Super Glue.</li>
            <li>it was suppose to be new</li>
            <li>Provides a nice hold and only requires a small amount of gel to hold hair in place.</li>
            <li>This is NOT a Firm Hold.</li>
            <li>so trust me when I say, this gel is NOT firm hold like they claim.</li>
            <li>Works just as well as Crew, but I find I don&#x27;t need as much of the Tea Tree gel to get the same hold.</li>
            <li>I normally use Crew for daily use but like the Tea Tree for travel since it&#x27;s in a TSA approved carry-on size.</li>
            <li>It barely washes off.</li>
            <li>Not sure how much Tea Tree is really there, it smells &amp; feels just like any other gel.</li>

            <li> The jel is too heavy and makes curly hair straight and flat.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to replace my tea tree firm hold gel by American Crew because American Crew stopped making it.  </li>
            <li> And then my hair looks straight and thin and lifeless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have any overpowering smells like some other brands, and it holds just firm enough for my needs.</li>
            <li> but i received it almost half empty</li>
            <li> But if you touch your hair at all throughout the day after it&#x27;s dry it loses the hold.</li>
            <li> at 30 bucks a little tube.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t flake, but I don&#x27;t see how this is a firm hold.  </li>
            <li> Meh; Not really strong hold.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for years and did not realize Amazon had this, which is hard to find.</li>
            <li> They are terribly wrong.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing product as Paul Mitchell is very expensive and hard to find.</li>
            <li> If not, this is horrible.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S TERRIBLE.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product is as advertised.  Provides a nice hold and only requires a small amount of gel to hold hair in place.</li>
            <li> Meh; Not really strong hold.  I was hoping to replace my tea tree firm hold gel by American Crew because American Crew stopped making it.  It just didn&#x27;t hold well at all.  It didn&#x27;t flake, but I don&#x27;t see how this is a firm hold.  But I have thicker hair.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a Firm Hold. Don&#x27;t be fooled. This gel is nowhere near the level of hold as the American Crew Super Glue. I see that some people said that it was the same hold. They are terribly wrong. This is NOT the same as the AC Super Glue. Don&#x27;t be fooled. This Tea Tree gel is very watery and does not hold up well for those who like to spike their hair. This is more for light styling, nothing more nothing less. My husband has used gel products for ions so trust me when I say, this gel is NOT firm hold like they claim. We&#x27;ve tried almost everything out on the market. - On another note, this is a high quality gel so if you need something light....this is great. If not, this is horrible. Buy the American Crew Super Glue instead, and if you need more hold use the Spiker Gel....that is the best for hold in the market. Period.</li>
            <li> Bought this gel to keep my hair from looking like a q-tip.  Guess what?  It works!  Not much else to say - a nice product</li>
            <li> This is the best gel hold ever.  I have used this for years and did not realize Amazon had this, which is hard to find.</li>
            <li> I like this gel. Good hold and smells nice and doesn&#x27;t seem to flake. I recommend all of the Tea Tree products from Paul Mitchell.</li>
            <li> Good, although over priced</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend. It was not for him because he has kind of thinner, softer hair, and this stuff is just too much, so it would dry out and make him feel like he had to wash his hair twice a day. But I am sure this would be great for someone with thick hair. Not sure how much Tea Tree is really there, it smells &amp; feels just like any other gel.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product. The price and convenience of the size are great and can&#x27;t be beat.  Try it.</li>
            <li> I got a styling cream from the salon... at 30 bucks a little tube. So I figured I&#x27;d find something much cheaper at Amazon. I love the Paul Mitchel Tea Tree shampoo, so figured this would do the trick. IT&#x27;S TERRIBLE. When you put it on it&#x27;s sticky and gooey. I have to apply it and then wash my hands before picking up the hair dryer. It barely washes off. I suppose that&#x27;s the properties of hair GEL, but I don&#x27;t know why anybody would want to use this stuff. It holds your hair in place with the &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34; at first. But if you touch your hair at all throughout the day after it&#x27;s dry it loses the hold. And then my hair looks straight and thin and lifeless. No body whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Hair gel, I use a very small amount and it works great.</li>
            <li> This is is great on guy&#x27;s hair. The smell is awesome and the hold lasts about 14 hours without being too shiny. This will be one gel I will be sticking with.</li>
            <li> I normally use Crew for daily use but like the Tea Tree for travel since it&#x27;s in a TSA approved carry-on size. Works just as well as Crew, but I find I don&#x27;t need as much of the Tea Tree gel to get the same hold.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair gel. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have any overpowering smells like some other brands, and it holds just firm enough for my needs.</li>
            <li> The jel is too heavy and makes curly hair straight and flat.  Very disappointing product as Paul Mitchell is very expensive and hard to find.</li>

            <li> it was suppose to be new but i received it almost half empty , this would not be the person i would purchase again from !</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I received the package 5 stars for great shipping and I love the hair gel left me with no frizz and smelled really good my hair feels very clean! I will be sure to recommend my friends to this seller! Thank you!</li>
