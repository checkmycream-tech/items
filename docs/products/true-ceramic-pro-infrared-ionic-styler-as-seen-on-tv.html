            <li>I loved it so much that I decided to order it again.  </li>
            <li>The True Ceramic Pro is the best flat iron I have owned.  </li>
            <li>If I return I will have to pay for return shipping and not get refunded for the full amount I paid for this piece of cr@p!  </li>
            <li>usually my natural curls look really frizzy as well, so i go over and re-curl my hair with this straightener and the curls come out perfect every time!!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still going strong in July 2014...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it now for five years and its still going strong.</li>
            <li>I ordered it and all was fine, i even recommended it to people, which they also bought on amazon.</li>
            <li>In terms of function- not as good as original ( TV version), but still better than many others  Flat Iron that I used  </li>
            <li>the light turned on.</li>
            <li>It made my hair so smooth</li>
            <li>She was using it, and the light turned off, indicating it was not working</li>
            <li>for the price is a very nice piece, i will recomned any one to purches as a gift...or for daily use</li>
            <li>You are able to set the iron to hotter settings depending on how hot you want the iron.</li>
            <li>The first lasted 7 years and was paid alot more for.  </li>
            <li>these are not the original</li>
            <li>I bought the original True Ceramic Pro from</li>
            <li>I originally purchased the True Ceramic Pro Infrared Ionic Styler from an infomercial years ago, and they lasted a longtime, then I needed to get another</li>
            <li>true ceramic pro&lt;br /&gt;very</li>
            <li>My girlfriend saw on television that he kept asking me to buy it finally did, and is delighted with this product.</li>
            <li>When I googled True ceramic pro</li>
            <li>B000KNGFCO True Ceramic Pro Infrared Ionic Styler</li>
            <li>I truely feel that there should not be any time limit when an item is defective...</li>
            <li>, meanwhile I was looking  for true ceramic online-</li>
            <li>; However, product did not have such a good quality.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome price for something that is going to last ten years.</li>
            <li>Did not get hot!</li>
            <li>By far the best straighter I&#x27;ve owned, and it took buying quite a few before finding this one.  </li>
            <li>useful for hair style, recommended for women.</li>
            <li>When I bought mine it was $125, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>buy this product 4 months ago , and the truth is delighted was worked very well until suddenly the part of the ceramic has started to take off that worries me because it can damage my hair</li>
            <li>I was finally able to locate where the red light should be, but it never came on.</li>
            <li>I know why not buy a different kind.</li>
            <li>Love this one better than any other hair straightener I have used.</li>
            <li>For my hair type which is curly and has no rhyme or reason to its curl pattern...this iron has been the right temperature and even heat</li>
            <li>so i emailed the company, which wasn&#x27;t the one listed now, they right away sent me another one.</li>
            <li>I hope it works, loved the original &amp; used it almost everyday!</li>
            <li>I have thick wavy hair &amp; this has been by far the best straightener I have ever used.</li>
            <li>the first one i got was off of the tv advertisement.  </li>
            <li>the first one ordered...</li>
            <li>Gets really hot and doesn&#x27;t pull on your hair like some do.</li>
            <li>First time I plugged it in, started smoking and flames.  </li>
            <li>I first bought it from seeing it on tv and it came with a lifetime warranty</li>
            <li>The first one I got lasted three years from there official site than it died from water damage.</li>
            <li>I will be making my first amazon return</li>
            <li>I had first bought this item several years ago when it first appeared on TV ...LOVED IT!!!  </li>
            <li>in general appearance, - not so smooth, feels rough, in general- good copy of original -</li>
            <li>Although still willing to pay $150 for old original version.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair super soft and shiny!!!&lt;br /&gt;i have had this straitner before</li>
            <li>At that time I purchased a different brand and that one is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>right when i was done, the plate completely fell off!</li>
            <li>I just bought another True Ceramic Pro Straightener after my old one stopped working, however, I my old one lasted 9 years!!  </li>
            <li>, i wouldn&#x27;t spend the money on something cheap that won&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>I was always recommending it so much that I kept the company phone number on my phone...</li>
            <li>I told her she had to wait for the red flashing light (as per directions).</li>
            <li>i want straight hair.</li>
            <li>and I was very upset</li>
            <li>fast delviery</li>
            <li>fast forward 5 months...</li>
            <li>The flat iron clasps side ways and doesn&#x27;t get as hot as the original.</li>
            <li>I purchased the True Cermaic the first time back in 2009</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft and straight, but this iron doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li>so i bought 2 more off of ebay because i wanted to have a spare in case the other one suckered out as well.  </li>
            <li>The True Ceramic Pro is the only flatiron I know, that will straighten my hair pin straight.</li>
            <li>I have owned other flat irons and they are not as good</li>
            <li>the true ceramic pro is the only straightener i will use.  </li>
            <li>I bought the True Ceramic Pro Infrared Ionic Styler over ten years ago for $170.00.</li>
            <li>I had my 1st True ceramic for about 6-7 yr( the one I bought from TV commercial for about $150)and</li>
            <li>The only straightener that ever worked for me was True Ceramic Pro.</li>
            <li>I thought she had the temp up too high, so I turned it off, reset the temp to a lower setting.</li>
            <li>other straighteners would allow my hair to frizz up and start to curl about 3 hours into my day, but this straightener will keep my hair straight, even after a whole day after straightening, plus a full night of sleeping on it.  </li>
            <li>This is the second iron I have purchased;  the first one lasted 8 years!  </li>
            <li>And  now really can  compare to old one-</li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t write feedbacks, but I felt that I had to do it this time.</li>
            <li>so I went on a search to find a new one.</li>
            <li>It was now time for new one so placed order though AMAZON...</li>
            <li>i bought my first one about six years ago and three years later is suckered out</li>
            <li>i had this same straightener about yrs ago when it first came out...</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd one, it does exactly what I want it to do.  </li>
            <li>Directions say in seconds, it&#x27;s been plugged in for 20 minutes now, and it&#x27;s not getting hot again., and no red</li>
            <li>If you really liked the original one ( and for my hair type it is seems the only one that works), this should work also, although not perfect.</li>
            <li>This last one that i recently bought, the first thing i did was connect it, alright!</li>
            <li>i am now a 20 year old woman</li>
            <li>Upon using mine it so far still works after a week...</li>
            <li>I smelled it burning up, couldn&#x27;t get there fast enough.</li>
            <li>I have an extremely busy schedule and often travel for business...</li>
            <li>maybe i can get it fixed, so</li>
            <li>I purchased my second  TCP since my first one finally died after 8 years.  </li>
            <li>this straightener is the only one that would keep my hair straight thru the whole day long!!  </li>
            <li>people reviewed the old one( TV commercial ) or new one.  </li>
            <li>First day, she plugged it in, and complained that the outside of the iron is hot, and it is not supposed to be (and her old one did not get hot on the outside).</li>
            <li>my second one is going on it&#x27;s fourth year and still working like new!!  </li>
            <li>and I have used this straightener pretty much every day for the past 9 years.  </li>
            <li>Like the other reviewer, I kept my first machine after it stopped working thinking</li>
            <li>Keeps hair straight for a long time!!</li>
            <li>Does not dry your hair!.</li>
            <li>it also curls hair really easily, you can have wavy hair with this flat iron, tight curly ringlets, and also loose curls.  </li>
            <li>you see on tv other thing, you use it and it leave your hair with so much frizz, and for curls in did not work.  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I am more confused is this the same product or a cheaper version?</li>
            <li>; ) However...the red on the plates started coming off after a few uses...I wouldn&#x27;t think &amp;#34;True Ceramic&amp;#34; would do that, but never the less still gets the job done ; )</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t as great as you may expect it to be. :(</li>
            <li>The manufacturer must have sold their company or something because I have ordered this flat iron twice from two different sellers and it is completely trash.</li>
            <li>It looks smaller, is not as heavy , looks cheaper made, and it gets real hot, I mean hot.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do what it suppose to do , it burned my hair pretty bad, instead of making it better</li>

            <li> I have thick wavy hair &amp; this has been by far the best straightener I have ever used.</li>
            <li> the first one i got was off of the tv advertisement.  </li>
            <li> the first one ordered...</li>
            <li> Gets really hot and doesn&#x27;t pull on your hair like some do.</li>
            <li> First time I plugged it in, started smoking and flames.  </li>
            <li> I first bought it from seeing it on tv and it came with a lifetime warranty</li>
            <li> The first one I got lasted three years from there official site than it died from water damage.</li>
            <li> I will be making my first amazon return</li>
            <li> I had first bought this item several years ago when it first appeared on TV ...LOVED IT!!!  </li>
            <li> in general appearance, - not so smooth, feels rough, in general- good copy of original -</li>
            <li> Although still willing to pay $150 for old original version.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair super soft and shiny!!!&lt;br /&gt;i have had this straitner before</li>
            <li> At that time I purchased a different brand and that one is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> right when i was done, the plate completely fell off!</li>
            <li> I just bought another True Ceramic Pro Straightener after my old one stopped working, however, I my old one lasted 9 years!!  </li>
            <li> , i wouldn&#x27;t spend the money on something cheap that won&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> I was always recommending it so much that I kept the company phone number on my phone...</li>
            <li> I told her she had to wait for the red flashing light (as per directions).</li>
            <li> i want straight hair.</li>
            <li> and I was very upset</li>
            <li> fast delviery</li>
            <li> fast forward 5 months...</li>
            <li> The flat iron clasps side ways and doesn&#x27;t get as hot as the original.</li>
            <li> I purchased the True Cermaic the first time back in 2009</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft and straight, but this iron doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> so i bought 2 more off of ebay because i wanted to have a spare in case the other one suckered out as well.  </li>
            <li> The True Ceramic Pro is the only flatiron I know, that will straighten my hair pin straight.</li>
            <li> I have owned other flat irons and they are not as good</li>
            <li> the true ceramic pro is the only straightener i will use.  </li>
            <li> I bought the True Ceramic Pro Infrared Ionic Styler over ten years ago for $170.00.</li>
            <li> I had my 1st True ceramic for about 6-7 yr( the one I bought from TV commercial for about $150)and</li>
            <li> The only straightener that ever worked for me was True Ceramic Pro.</li>
            <li> I thought she had the temp up too high, so I turned it off, reset the temp to a lower setting.</li>
            <li> other straighteners would allow my hair to frizz up and start to curl about 3 hours into my day, but this straightener will keep my hair straight, even after a whole day after straightening, plus a full night of sleeping on it.  </li>
            <li> This is the second iron I have purchased;  the first one lasted 8 years!  </li>
            <li> And  now really can  compare to old one-</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t write feedbacks, but I felt that I had to do it this time.</li>
            <li> so I went on a search to find a new one.</li>
            <li> It was now time for new one so placed order though AMAZON...</li>
            <li> i bought my first one about six years ago and three years later is suckered out</li>
            <li> i had this same straightener about yrs ago when it first came out...</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd one, it does exactly what I want it to do.  </li>
            <li> Directions say in seconds, it&#x27;s been plugged in for 20 minutes now, and it&#x27;s not getting hot again., and no red</li>
            <li> If you really liked the original one ( and for my hair type it is seems the only one that works), this should work also, although not perfect.</li>
            <li> This last one that i recently bought, the first thing i did was connect it, alright!</li>
            <li> i am now a 20 year old woman</li>
            <li> Upon using mine it so far still works after a week...</li>
            <li> I smelled it burning up, couldn&#x27;t get there fast enough.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely busy schedule and often travel for business...</li>
            <li> maybe i can get it fixed, so</li>
            <li> I purchased my second  TCP since my first one finally died after 8 years.  </li>
            <li> this straightener is the only one that would keep my hair straight thru the whole day long!!  </li>
            <li> people reviewed the old one( TV commercial ) or new one.  </li>
            <li> First day, she plugged it in, and complained that the outside of the iron is hot, and it is not supposed to be (and her old one did not get hot on the outside).</li>
            <li> my second one is going on it&#x27;s fourth year and still working like new!!  </li>
            <li> and I have used this straightener pretty much every day for the past 9 years.  </li>
            <li> Like the other reviewer, I kept my first machine after it stopped working thinking</li>
            <li> Keeps hair straight for a long time!!</li>
            <li> Does not dry your hair!.</li>
            <li> it also curls hair really easily, you can have wavy hair with this flat iron, tight curly ringlets, and also loose curls.  </li>
            <li> you see on tv other thing, you use it and it leave your hair with so much frizz, and for curls in did not work.  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I am more confused is this the same product or a cheaper version?</li>
            <li> ; ) However...the red on the plates started coming off after a few uses...I wouldn&#x27;t think &amp;#34;True Ceramic&amp;#34; would do that, but never the less still gets the job done ; )</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t as great as you may expect it to be. :(</li>
            <li> The manufacturer must have sold their company or something because I have ordered this flat iron twice from two different sellers and it is completely trash.</li>
            <li> It looks smaller, is not as heavy , looks cheaper made, and it gets real hot, I mean hot.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do what it suppose to do , it burned my hair pretty bad, instead of making it better</li>
            <li> I purchased a true ceramic pro when it first came out (VERY expensive).</li>
            <li> I placed a second order through the same seller and same issue, started to smoke and smelled burning plastic, this time both plates became loose....</li>
            <li> I eventually just settled for another brand as I needed a flat iron to take with me on a business trip...</li>
            <li> I am a black woman and my natural hair after washing and air drying can be course.  </li>
            <li> that cause it lasted for so long.</li>
            <li> The plates on the flat iron do not lay down properly.</li>
            <li> each one lasting me over a year or so) and I&#x27;ve been getting replacement due to the warranty, however I assume the company selling it on tv is no longer in business?</li>
            <li> i am a single mom</li>
            <li> in fact, the plastic was burning and one of the iron plates got loose</li>
            <li> Needless to say the first one is in process of being returned and time will tell for the second.</li>
            <li> I purchase this flat iron 10 some odd years ago and the cord got some sort of shortage</li>
            <li> I think the manufactor changed or something cause this second one is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pick any other iron.</li>
            <li> I have taken this product on vacation and other family members</li>
            <li> i was in the other room.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t recommend this item, is useless, I think I lost my money.</li>
            <li> i have really thin, frizzy, curly hair naturally.  </li>
            <li> Slight difference  </li>
            <li> One week later the original one ordered plate broke off while in use DANGEROUS!!</li>
            <li> My mother and little sister loves this flatiron also, they are always asking to borrow mine, I am buying one for them.</li>
            <li> I then ordered my second one, when it came in the mail, it came broken (typical mailing problems)</li>
            <li> and I waste my time and also my money</li>
            <li> My straightner just broke a few weeks ago because my daughter dropped it on our kitchen floor.</li>
            <li> The iron does not heat as it should do and I was missing in the box the tail comb.</li>
            <li> and I hated how my hair was never as soft and straight as I would like it to be, so I went browsing online to buy another TCP</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for the past 5+ years</li>
            <li> I felt it, and agreed it was not safe.</li>
            <li> I just tried to submit a return but too late...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine for thick hair types.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair, lots of it, I&#x27;d use it twice a week.</li>
            <li> A little sad about that</li>
            <li> but NOT ORIGINAl  ( like Coach bag and fake one).</li>
            <li> not the same anymore :(</li>
            <li> I wasted about 140.00 on this product... STAY AWAY!!!</li>
            <li> This one seems like a bootleg iron.  </li>
            <li> I have the same and very disappointed because the temperature level doesn&#x27;t heat correctly.</li>
            <li> Unfortunate this one does not work.  </li>
            <li> Was Not happy!!!</li>
            <li> Not happy at all!</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because it hardly heated up, I have always used this brand but for some reason this one was horrible.</li>
            <li> It impossible to staighten your hair.  </li>
            <li> I ask a thousand pardons for my rating so bad that I gave before my order arrived.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Unfortunate this one does not work.  I have already had one and it was great until the power supply got busted.  I understand that this is the issue with this product but a $38 I thought what the heck it’s the same as going to a beauty salon to get the hair done.  But I will have to send this one back because it did not heat up at all.</li>
            <li> you see on tv other thing, you use it and it leave your hair with so much frizz, and for curls in did not work.  I watched the dvd to learn how to use it and I waste my time and also my money</li>
            <li> the true ceramic pro is the only straightener i will use.  the straighten lasts forever!! it also curls hair really easily, you can have wavy hair with this flat iron, tight curly ringlets, and also loose curls.  this is the most amazing straightener in the world.  i bought my first one about six years ago and three years later is suckered out so i bought 2 more off of ebay because i wanted to have a spare in case the other one suckered out as well.  the first one i got was off of the tv advertisement.  i have really thin, frizzy, curly hair naturally.  this straightener takes all the frizz out of my hair.  usually my natural curls look really frizzy as well, so i go over and re-curl my hair with this straightener and the curls come out perfect every time!!  i am now a 20 year old woman and i have been using this straightener since i was 14!!  this straightener is the only one that would keep my hair straight thru the whole day long!!  other straighteners would allow my hair to frizz up and start to curl about 3 hours into my day, but this straightener will keep my hair straight, even after a whole day after straightening, plus a full night of sleeping on it.  i will never use another straightener!!  i am a single mom so money is very important, i wouldn&#x27;t spend the money on something cheap that won&#x27;t last.  i have not had to touch my third one yet (my spare) my second one is going on it&#x27;s fourth year and still working like new!!  definitely recommend this straightener!!</li>
            <li> true ceramic pro&lt;br /&gt;very useful for hair style, recommended for women.</li>
            <li> Originally I ordered this for a friend of mine whom swore by this straightener, she bought this originally off Tv and loved it! Years later she no longer had it so I found it here and ordered it for her. The straightener worked great in the beginning, so great in fact that I ordered one for myself... One week later the original one ordered plate broke off while in use DANGEROUS!! Upon using mine it so far still works after a week... However doesn&#x27;t seem to heat up as well as the first one ordered... Needless to say the first one is in process of being returned and time will tell for the second. BUYER BEWARE!! This product isn&#x27;t as great as you may expect it to be. :(</li>
            <li> My girlfriend saw on television that he kept asking me to buy it finally did, and is delighted with this product. I asked if the recommendations and their response was OFCOURSE.  Mi novia desde que la vio en television no paraba de pedirme que se la compre, por fin lo hice y esta encantada con este producto.   Le pregunte si la recomendaba y su respuesta fue PORSUPUESTO.</li>
            <li> COMPRE ESTE PRODUCTO, Y HABIA TRABAJADO BIEN, LUEGO DE 2 O 3 USOS LA PINTURA QUE RECUBRE LAS PLACAS DE CERAMICA SE EMPEZO A CAER Y DA MUY MAL ASPECTO, LA CALIDAD ES REALMENTE MUY MALA</li>
            <li> I bought an iron for hair and I rated 5 stars. good salesman, my order arrived on time. I recommend it 100%   I ask a thousand pardons for my rating so bad that I gave before my order arrived. I know I made a big mistake</li>
            <li> I bought the original True Ceramic Pro from the As seen On TV ad 8 years ago for around $150. It has been AMAZING!!! I have thick wavy hair &amp; this has been by far the best straightener I have ever used. Now 8 years later I&#x27;m having problems with it. When I googled True ceramic pro I was so happy to see Amazon carried it &amp; was so pleasantly surprised with the $49 price tag. After reading the reviews I am more confused is this the same product or a cheaper version? I feel like I have no choice but to order one since mine is about to die. I will follow up with a review on the \\&quot;new\\&quot; one later. I hope it works, loved the original &amp; used it almost everyday!</li>
            <li> I returned it! Was Not happy!!! Did not get hot! Didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair! Not happy at all!</li>
            <li> I bought mine on the infomercial.... 7 years ago!!! and it still works great! You won&#x27;t regret buying this! Keeps hair straight for a long time!!</li>
            <li> for the price is a very nice piece, i will recomned any one to purches as a gift...or for daily use</li>
            <li> I purchase this flat iron 10 some odd years ago and the cord got some sort of shortage so I went on a search to find a new one. The manufacturer must have sold their company or something because I have ordered this flat iron twice from two different sellers and it is completely trash. The plates on the flat iron do not lay down properly. The flat iron clasps side ways and doesn&#x27;t get as hot as the original. I guess they just don&#x27;t make them like they use to.</li>
            <li> el producto llego en buenas condiciones, solo que con un poco de retrazo, la truceramicpro, le ha servido de mucho a mi esposa</li>
            <li> I originally purchased the True Ceramic Pro Infrared Ionic Styler from an infomercial years ago, and they lasted a longtime, then I needed to get another therefore I looked it up on Amazon and I ordered it and I love them, I have since ordered two more for family members. The best styler!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought the True Ceramic Pro Infrared Ionic Styler over ten years ago for $170.00. My straightner just broke a few weeks ago because my daughter dropped it on our kitchen floor. My mother went out and purchased a $10.00 straightner to replace it and my daughter and I have frizzy hair. Nothing works better than this iron. You won&#x27;t hear your hair being pulled out of your head, or see hair in the iron. You are able to set the iron to hotter settings depending on how hot you want the iron. I&#x27;m ordering my second iron today and I&#x27;m super happy I found this iron again. This is an awesome price for something that is going to last ten years. This iron will also curl your hair. Don&#x27;t pick any other iron. Best ever!</li>
            <li> i really love this product it got delivered in great condition! it works really good i love this straitner it makes my hair super soft and shiny!!!&lt;br /&gt;i have had this straitner before &amp; i loved it so much i had to buy it again!! i recomend it to every body in this WORLD!!!!!!!!:)[[ASIN:B000KNGFCO True Ceramic Pro Infrared Ionic Styler AS SEEN ON TV]]</li>
            <li> I bought this flatiron from the infomercial as well, about 6 years ago, since then  I have not gone to a salon. The one time that I did go to a salon the flatiron they use did not compare.  I am a black woman and my natural hair after washing and air drying can be course.  The True Ceramic Pro is the only flatiron I know, that will straighten my hair pin straight. It looks like I have a relaxer.  I have never had any issues with this product.  My mother and little sister loves this flatiron also, they are always asking to borrow mine, I am buying one for them. I&#x27;m thinking of buying myself an extra one.  I have taken this product on vacation and other family members has asked where can they buy it.  I was always recommending it so much that I kept the company phone number on my phone...lol.  When I bought mine it was $125, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t recommend this item, is useless, I think I lost my money. Normally I don&#x27;t write feedbacks, but I felt that I had to do it this time. My hair is very soft and straight, but this iron doesn&#x27;t work! I can&#x27;t imagine for thick hair types. I don&#x27;t know how do they make the effect in tv like a miracle iron.&lt;br /&gt;waste of money, Don&#x27;t recommend it at all!</li>
            <li> The paint on the blades started to burn off when we were using it, and it fell on the carpet and the ceramic blade fell out.  I had a tru ceramic pro from tv years ago and it lasted 10 years.  This one seems like a bootleg iron.  It looks smaller, is not as heavy , looks cheaper made, and it gets real hot, I mean hot.  I don&#x27;t think it is a safe product, that is why i&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> Love this one better than any other hair straightener I have used. Gets really hot and doesn&#x27;t pull on your hair like some do.</li>
            <li> I have the same and very disappointed because the temperature level doesn&#x27;t heat correctly. It impossible to staighten your hair.  Later I bought FHI and it works perfectly. Using this one on 400*F is like 200*F on FHI.  But this one is a piece of junk. Don&#x27;t waist your money. I don&#x27;t know, may be I got a defective one.</li>
            <li> This item was defective, so I returned. I have the experience with another that I bought before and was good.</li>
            <li> I just bought another True Ceramic Pro Straightener after my old one stopped working, however, I my old one lasted 9 years!!  I have thick curly hair and I have used this straightener pretty much every day for the past 9 years.  Would recommend this brand to everyone!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been years since I ordered this...it&#x27;s still going strong in July 2014...I&#x27;m talking like 5+ years (I think) ; ) However...the red on the plates started coming off after a few uses...I wouldn&#x27;t think &amp;#34;True Ceramic&amp;#34; would do that, but never the less still gets the job done ; )</li>
            <li> This is the best iron.  This is the 4rth bought, since 2007.  All girls in my family have one.  Recommend it!</li>
            <li> I purchased a true ceramic pro when it first came out (VERY expensive). It lasted for 8-9 years, so I thought it was a worthwhile product and was more than happy to pay this price for it. The one I received didn&#x27;t last 6 months. I&amp;#34;m kicking myself for not saving the warranty. My mother bought one around the same time I did, and hers is still working. If you buy this keep the warranty!!!.</li>
            <li> i had this same straightener about yrs ago when it first came out...and i loved it! they are not made the same anymore. 10 to 15 min to heat up .. then as your straightening...its gets cooler. nope...not the same anymore :(</li>
            <li> The True Ceramic Pro is the best flat iron I have owned.  This is my 2nd one, it does exactly what I want it to do.  I have owned other flat irons and they are not as good</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because it hardly heated up, I have always used this brand but for some reason this one was horrible. Will never buy this brand again!</li>
            <li> First time I plugged it in, started smoking and flames.  i was in the other room. I smelled it burning up, couldn&#x27;t get there fast enough. Returned it for my money back.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do what it suppose to do , it burned my hair pretty bad, instead of making it better it just damages it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for the past 5+ years and I absolutely loved it the first time I used it. I first bought it from seeing it on tv and it came with a lifetime warranty and I&#x27;ve gotten it replaced twice already (each one lasting me over a year or so) and I&#x27;ve been getting replacement due to the warranty, however I assume the company selling it on tv is no longer in business? because I can&#x27;t seem to get a hold of them anymore. I went out and buy a generic straightener from the local drug store and I hated how my hair was never as soft and straight as I would like it to be, so I went browsing online to buy another TCP and I came across this one on Amazon. I see an amazing difference the first day I used it, I will NEVER use anything else ever again!</li>
            <li> I bought this product 8 years ago and it was great but it burnt out.  I was okay that cause it lasted for so long. I loved it so much that I decided to order it again.  I think the manufactor changed or something cause this second one is a waste of money.  It&#x27;s terrible! I&#x27;m so disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is my second Ceramic Pro.  The first lasted 7 years and was paid alot more for.  I am extremely happy with the product and the price.</li>
            <li> The first one I got lasted three years from there official site than it died from water damage. Then the second one I ordered from there site works perfect. I&#x27;ve had it now for five years and its still going strong.</li>
            <li> I had first bought this item several years ago when it first appeared on TV ...LOVED IT!!!  It worked great! It was now time for new one so placed order though AMAZON... I received and as soon as I turned it on, it started to smoke and smelled like burning plasitc...in fact, the plastic was burning and one of the iron plates got loose so I returned with no problem...I placed a second order through the same seller and same issue, started to smoke and smelled burning plastic, this time both plates became loose....I eventually just settled for another brand as I needed a flat iron to take with me on a business trip...I have an extremely busy schedule and often travel for business... I just tried to submit a return but too late...If I return I will have to pay for return shipping and not get refunded for the full amount I paid for this piece of cr@p!  I truely feel that there should not be any time limit when an item is defective...please help me AMAZON!</li>
            <li> The iron does not heat as it should do and I was missing in the box the tail comb. A little sad about that</li>
            <li> buy this product 4 months ago , and the truth is delighted was worked very well until suddenly the part of the ceramic has started to take off that worries me because it can damage my hair</li>
            <li> this product is of very quality is very very good my friend is happy for this product, thanks for the atention</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend who used to have one. First day, she plugged it in, and complained that the outside of the iron is hot, and it is not supposed to be (and her old one did not get hot on the outside). I felt it, and agreed it was not safe. I thought she had the temp up too high, so I turned it off, reset the temp to a lower setting. I told her she had to wait for the red flashing light (as per directions). I was finally able to locate where the red light should be, but it never came on. Directions say in seconds, it&#x27;s been plugged in for 20 minutes now, and it&#x27;s not getting hot again., and no red light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is either a knock off, as someone else suggested, or the product manufacturer has gone downhill. I will be making my first amazon return</li>
            <li> I had my 1st True ceramic for about 6-7 yr( the one I bought from TV commercial for about $150)and I really liked that-perfect, nothing could compare to that, and one day - it stopped working.  I kept it- thinking I would able to fix it  someday, meanwhile I was looking  for true ceramic online- it was off market for a while. . So finally I saw the same here on Amazon, read a lot of reviews- but could not understand- people reviewed the old one( TV commercial ) or new one.  So I got the one ( from Amazon- 8/2012).  And  now really can  compare to old one- Slight difference  in general appearance, - not so smooth, feels rough, in general- good copy of original - but NOT ORIGINAl  ( like Coach bag and fake one). In terms of function- not as good as original ( TV version), but still better than many others  Flat Iron that I used  ( different brands/companies). . If you really liked the original one ( and for my hair type it is seems the only one that works), this should work also, although not perfect. I would recommend to buy this one. Although still willing to pay $150 for old original version.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these shoes. They are the most comfortable and stylish around. I must have every color! It&#x27;s like walking on a cloud, I have never found anything like them.</li>
            <li> This is the second iron I have purchased;  the first one lasted 8 years!  For my hair type which is curly and has no rhyme or reason to its curl pattern...this iron has been the right temperature and even heat I need.  I will keep buying them until they are no longer the same quality...or stop making them.</li>
            <li> I want the original! This is my 3rd time buying this product. I know I know why not buy a different kind. I did! That straightening iron cost 100.00 dollars at the mall and it would do nothing to my roots. The only straightener that ever worked for me was True Ceramic Pro. Like the other reviewer, I kept my first machine after it stopped working thinking maybe i can get it fixed, so when I finally came online I ordered it and all was fine, i even recommended it to people, which they also bought on amazon. after about 2 years it stopped working. I then ordered my second one, when it came in the mail, it came broken (typical mailing problems) so i emailed the company, which wasn&#x27;t the one listed now, they right away sent me another one. that one lasted about 3 years. Mind you I have thick wavy hair, lots of it, I&#x27;d use it twice a week. oh i bought one more, when i connected the machine did nothing. I returned it and then went to the mall to get one. This last one that i recently bought, the first thing i did was connect it, alright! the light turned on. now to do my hair... dammit why does it smell like plastic burning? yup my straightener was melting from the inside, i said screw it i want straight hair. right when i was done, the plate completely fell off! these are not the original, my husbands theory... maybe the company sold it to someone else and they decided to make them again with cheaper parts! Bummer!</li>
            <li> I love it! Does not dry your hair!. Makes it so shiny ^_^</li>
            <li> I purchased the True Cermaic the first time back in 2009 and I loved it for about 2 months and then it died on me.  It made my hair so smooth and I was very upset that is just stopped working.  I was very happy to see it listed in 2012 on amazon, so I decided to order it.... and guess what??  It lasted about 2 months and then just stopped working.  At that time I purchased a different brand and that one is still going strong.  The company that makes this item is &amp;#34;out of business&amp;#34; and I guess people are still trying to unload theirs....  I wasted about 140.00 on this product... STAY AWAY!!!</li>
            <li> fast delviery; However, product did not have such a good quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a christmas present for my daughter....she loved it, it worked perfectly and her hair looked amazaing...fast forward 5 months...it stopped working, just stopped working.  Thinking it was maybe because it had fallen once or twice, I ordered another one.  It stopped working after one month!!! She was using it, and the light turned off, indicating it was not working and it never worked again.</li>
            <li> I purchased my second  TCP since my first one finally died after 8 years.  By far the best straighter I&#x27;ve owned, and it took buying quite a few before finding this one.  Very happy to have my replacement.</li>
            <li> i love it i will order some more</li>
