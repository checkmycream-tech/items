            <li>Hope this really does kill the germs, great smell.</li>
            <li>I love this spray.</li>
            <li>Fell in love with this product when Bath and Body used to carry it.</li>
            <li>tip is to make sure the part where the spray comes out is pointed where you want it.  </li>
            <li>I like the foaming one better</li>
            <li>I love this hand sanitizer for my kids.</li>
            <li>The scent is okay.</li>
            <li>My hands feel nice and clean after using this product.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice consistency that feels clean and never sticky.</li>
            <li>I feel much more comfortable using this for my kids than any of the alcohol-based sanitizers out there.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that its alcohol/toxin free.  </li>
            <li>great smell, works very well, no bad chemical or chemical taste when eating after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>The smell is SOOOOOOOO much better then the original.  </li>
            <li>I love the orange vanilla scent (my husband hates the smell of the original).</li>
            <li>I think I prefer the original scent more.</li>
            <li>(I am fine with either)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Either way, the smell goes away very quickly (which is good for me since I have a sensitive sniffer).</li>
            <li>Nice scent and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>When soap and water aren&#x27;t available...</li>
            <li>Have the wipes but wanted these more for myself for a quick spray after filling gas or something and for a quick one with the kids.</li>
            <li>The small bottle fits perfectly in a purse (or even a pocket) and lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>The small size is perfect for keeping them wherever I may need it - my purse, the diaper bag, and in the car.</li>
            <li>Just a light liquid, not a paste, and evaporates quickly.</li>
            <li>Light fragrance that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>works well and doesn&#x27;t dry my hands, great to have around grandkids  </li>
            <li>Pleasant smell which I prefer to the original scent, non toxic, alcohol free and won&#x27;t dry out your hands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They came right on time (thank you Prime!)</li>
            <li>Plus the Subscribe &amp; Save discount makes it more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Might smell good, but its technically not a hand sanitizer because FDA asked them to remove &amp;#34;kills 99% of germs&amp;#34; from the labeling bc it doesn&#x27;t kill a lot of germs...</li>
            <li>They are safe and they must work because they keep us healthy and don&#x27;t dry out our hands or smell super strong.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me</li>
            <li>I bought these after reading about the harmful affects of hand sanitizers on children&#x27;s development (particularly boys) and didn&#x27;t want to expose my kids to that any more.  </li>
            <li>its a steal, also very safe on skin deep website.  </li>
            <li>In particular, we are not aware of evidence that this product is safe and effective in preventing individuals from becoming infected by E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus aureus.\\&quot;[...</li>
            <li>This is a great little hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li>Only the bacteria kind with an envelope...</li>
            <li>The smell is very pleasant (or at least I really like it).</li>
            <li>My kids say this orange vanilla smells &amp;#34;way better than the other one!&amp;#34; (original scent).</li>
            <li>I like the Binky Spritz a tiny bit better, but this is easier to find.</li>
            <li>and my daughter willingly holds out her hands when I whip it out.  </li>
            <li>FDA&#x27;s letter:\\&quot;However, we are not aware of sufficient evidence that shows CleanWell All-Natural Hand Sanitizer is generally recognized as safe and effective for the uses noted above.</li>
            <li>I carry it in my purse and my whole family uses it when we go out to eat to sanitize our hands.</li>
            <li>thanks sooo much</li>
            <li>I also really like the spray instead of a foam,</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It is very handy/portable.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really stinks....horrible smell</li>
            <li>Sometimes I wonder though if they are really working-</li>
            <li>I love that it is natural and doesn&#x27;t dry my hands like alcohol</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>tiny bottle lasts far longer than a gel of the same size, does the job, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t sting little hands when owies are around!</li>
            <li>people may prefer its Orange Vanilla scent much less objectionable than the original scent.</li>
            <li>In addition, alcohol sanitizers have been tested on human skin, so we know they work in real life, not just the lab.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>/&gt;- so far I have not found any.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Any claims that only those toxic brands are proven to kill 99.9% of germs is a lie, there is way too much science out there proving that natural essential oils kill the same amount of germs without the toxicity.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I have used almost every other product this company makes with equally positive results.</li>
            <li>This is more proof that \\&quot;Alcohol hand sanitizers are even effective against the non-enveloped viruses, so unlike thyme oil, alcohol will kill the virus that causes the common cold.</li>
            <li>(naturally disappears only in a minute or so)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the spray doesn&#x27;t saturate your hands like a typical gel sanitizer does and it rubs in very fast.</li>

            <li> : spray nozzle can move and spray where you aren&#x27;t expecting (be careful letting her kids do this themselves without being shown that),</li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals like other</li>
            <li> Other review can be found here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HZITG1TC8ZI7</li>
            <li> They are not worth it.</li>
            <li> very watery frankly its a useless sanitizer</li>
            <li> There is no strong alcohol smell either.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Fits nicely in small purse.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to stress about (alcohol based) with my small kids.</li>
            <li> I feel much better about sanitizing my hands and my family&#x27;s hands with it as opposed to the sanitizers with nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> I always have this on hand for my children (and myself) to use instead of the commonly offered alcohol based sanitizer.</li>
            <li> But seriously misleading.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to the scent</li>
            <li> (source: [...]</li>
            <li> smell is awful, didn&#x27;t have any effect on my hand,</li>
            <li> It can turn and twist which is very annoying.</li>

            <li> My kids say this orange vanilla smells &amp;#34;way better than the other one!&amp;#34; (original scent). I love that it is natural and doesn&#x27;t dry my hands like alcohol gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They came right on time (thank you Prime!) and don&#x27;t expire til March of 2015. I&#x27;m happy. :)</li>
            <li> Fits nicely in small purse. Just a light liquid, not a paste, and evaporates quickly. Light fragrance that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a great little hand sanitizer. The small bottle fits perfectly in a purse (or even a pocket) and lasts quite a while. It&#x27;s not gooey like regular sanitizer gels and it doesn&#x27;t sting when applied. The smell is ok. I hated the original scent at first, but got used to it. Now I can&#x27;t decide if I like this better or not. Either way, the smell goes away very quickly (which is good for me since I have a sensitive sniffer). I feel much more comfortable using this for my kids than any of the alcohol-based sanitizers out there. This and Binky Spritz are the only options I use anymore. I like the Binky Spritz a tiny bit better, but this is easier to find. Plus the Subscribe &amp; Save discount makes it more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Might smell good, but its technically not a hand sanitizer because FDA asked them to remove &amp;#34;kills 99% of germs&amp;#34; from the labeling bc it doesn&#x27;t kill a lot of germs... Only the bacteria kind with an envelope... I read some article. But seriously misleading. A lot of germs are not being disinfected.</li>
            <li> Has a nice mellow fragrance that is not too over bearing.  I carry it in my purse and my whole family uses it when we go out to eat to sanitize our hands.</li>
            <li> SO NICE TO HAVE COMPACT HAND SANTIZER IN A SPRAY AND NO NOSE MELTING SMELL. HAVE PURCHASED MULTIPE TIMES AND END UP GIVING THEM AWAY BECAUSE OTHERS SEEM TO LIKE SO WELL.</li>
            <li> The product works well. However, the scent is stronger than I expected. My hands feel nice and clean after using this product.  But, I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again because of the smell.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell which I prefer to the original scent, non toxic, alcohol free and won&#x27;t dry out your hands. I like the flip top and handy size of container.</li>
            <li> love their products. this hand sanitizer is so delicious smelling and convenient to store</li>
            <li> Love the fact that its alcohol/toxin free.  Love the smell.  Love the travel size.  This brand is a favorite of mine and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m poisoning my child when I spray her hands with this.  I&#x27;m addicted to the scent and my daughter willingly holds out her hands when I whip it out.  A great product and the multi pack is a great deal!</li>
            <li> Smell is divine. Doesn&#x27;t leave your hands dry like other alcohol based sanitizers. Also doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals like other sanitizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE STOP USING the big, not natural brands (like Lysol) that use harmful ingredients. They are not worth it. They also smell chemically/not pleasant. Any claims that only those toxic brands are proven to kill 99.9% of germs is a lie, there is way too much science out there proving that natural essential oils kill the same amount of germs without the toxicity. AND they smell hella better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I have used almost every other product this company makes with equally positive results.

            <li> Finally a hand cleaner I don&#x27;t have to stress about (alcohol based) with my small kids. Smells great and seems to do the trick! I will keep buying.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It can be used with toddlers as well as adults.  I&#x27;m giving them as stocking stuffers!</li>
            <li> This product is great for quick clean-ups. However, if you&#x27;re counting on this hand sanitizer to protect you, don&#x27;t. \\&quot;The manufacturers of Staphaseptic, Safe4Hours, Dr. Tichenor&#x27;s and CleanWell products had suggested that various gels, protectants and what-not could protect against infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. The FDA takes issue with that.\\&quot; (source: [...] The FDA made the company remove a claim that the hand sanitizer is \\&quot;Proven to kill 99.99% of germs\\&quot; ... FDA&#x27;s letter:\\&quot;However, we are not aware of sufficient evidence that shows CleanWell All-Natural Hand Sanitizer is generally recognized as safe and effective for the uses noted above. In particular, we are not aware of evidence that this product is safe and effective in preventing individuals from becoming infected by E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus aureus.\\&quot;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO SEE: \\&quot;Thyme oil vs. alcohol hand sanitizer: which is better?\\&quot; [...] This is more proof that \\&quot;Alcohol hand sanitizers are even effective against the non-enveloped viruses, so unlike thyme oil, alcohol will kill the virus that causes the common cold. In addition, alcohol sanitizers have been tested on human skin, so we know they work in real life, not just the lab.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to the alcohol based products. It has a nice consistency that feels clean and never sticky.</li>
            <li> Great for kid&#x27;s lunch boxes and has no chemicals - this product is a big win for anyone looking for non-alcohol hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> Bought this for diaper bags and for family who would be around our newborn often. Nice scent and reasonable price. Will buy more when we start to run out</li>
            <li> works well and doesn&#x27;t dry my hands, great to have around grandkids  thanks sooo much</li>
            <li> Got these sprays for the price pack its a steal, also very safe on skin deep website.  Have the wipes but wanted these more for myself for a quick spray after filling gas or something and for a quick one with the kids. Hope this really does kill the germs, great smell.</li>
            <li> This is the best product!!!! Does not sting your hands.  Perfect for children with tender skin and adults like it too.  I won&#x27;t buy another brand.</li>
            <li> When soap and water aren&#x27;t available...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tiny bottle lasts far longer than a gel of the same size, does the job, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t sting little hands when owies are around!</li>
            <li> i bought this product according to the good reviews :/&lt;br /&gt;if you are looking for a good scent so do for your self a favor and don&#x27;t buy this item!&lt;br /&gt;the smell is awful, didn&#x27;t have any effect on my hand, very watery frankly its a useless sanitizer i don&#x27;t know where is the vanilla or the orange scent they are talking about??!!!</li>
            <li> I love this spray. The Orange-Vanilla scent is great, and goes away quickly. Leaves NO residue. I always have this on hand for my children (and myself) to use instead of the commonly offered alcohol based sanitizer. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this and the wipes!!! They are safe and they must work because they keep us healthy and don&#x27;t dry out our hands or smell super strong.</li>
            <li> I prefer all-natural products. Fell in love with this product when Bath and Body used to carry it. Bought what I had through Bath and Body until it no longer carried the product. So happy that Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> We use this all the time and it works great.  The smell is SOOOOOOOO much better then the original.  The price on Amazon was a good value for 6 of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: great smell, works very well, no bad chemical or chemical taste when eating after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: spray nozzle can move and spray where you aren&#x27;t expecting (be careful letting her kids do this themselves without being shown that), takes 2 squirts for an adults hands,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only tip is to make sure the part where the spray comes out is pointed where you want it.  It can turn and twist which is very annoying. I sprayed myself in the face thinking it would spray my hand 180 degrees away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all a good product.  I like the foaming one better but it doesn&#x27;t come in a travel size or this flavor.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I feel much better about sanitizing my hands and my family&#x27;s hands with it as opposed to the sanitizers with nasty chemicals. The smell is very pleasant (or at least I really like it). I also really like the spray instead of a foam, as it&#x27;s not sticky like a lot of foams tend to be. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I love this hand sanitizer for my kids. The small size is perfect for keeping them wherever I may need it - my purse, the diaper bag, and in the car. Lucky for me Amazon sells it in this 6 pack. I love the orange vanilla scent (my husband hates the smell of the original). This is a great product that I feel safe using for my family&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li> PRO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It is very handy/portable.  You put in a pocket of your jacket and use it anywhere you want&lt;br /&gt;-Some people may prefer its Orange Vanilla scent much less objectionable than the original scent. (I am fine with either)&lt;br /&gt;-it does not leave any residue on your hands. (naturally disappears only in a minute or so)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- so far I have not found any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Summery)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it.  I also gave 2 of those to my friends.  They like it, too.</li>
            <li> The product itself seems just great. I&#x27;ve been using it for months and months. It&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.  The scent is okay. It smells like an orange creamsicle. I think I prefer the original scent more.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Work in Hospitals and need to use it often. Has a great smell and is alcohol free.</li>
            <li> This stuff really stinks....horrible smell</li>
            <li> Some people say it smells like mosquito spray. I like the size and the convenience. There is no strong alcohol smell either.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought these after reading about the harmful affects of hand sanitizers on children&#x27;s development (particularly boys) and didn&#x27;t want to expose my kids to that any more.  These smell great and the kids don&#x27;t mind spraying them on.  Sometimes I wonder though if they are really working- the spray doesn&#x27;t saturate your hands like a typical gel sanitizer does and it rubs in very fast. I just hope its actually doing what they say it does!</li>
