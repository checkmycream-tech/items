            <li>That&#x27;s one thing this product definitely has going for itself -- great for moisturizing your skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To read original review:&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The jar is still full, so I&#x27;m going to keep using it on my arms until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using excel skin care premium stretch mark cream for 2 weeks now and it really improves my skin, all my stretchmarks in my tummy are almost gone now. :)</li>
            <li>Product arrived fast and customer service was great answering further questions that I had.</li>
            <li>My stretch marks are light in color and size, but pretty noticeable against my sort-of-because-of-winter-light-tan skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my first jar, in the sixth day I saw some fading already!  </li>
            <li>The cream goes on smooth and dissolves fast.</li>
            <li>Along with the help of my Derma Roller, I saw some great results in a few months.</li>
            <li>I just restarted the process of rolling and applying the product right after and for a week after so.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel good and marks less noticeable by touch.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now about to finish my second jar and will order a third when I get paid lol</li>
            <li>I finally feel comfortable to let my own husband see me naked again.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference after the first four days of use.</li>
            <li>and it would show prominently whenever I would wear a short sleeve shirt and people took notice.</li>
            <li>Be consistent, don&#x27;t skip when applying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m beach body ready!</li>
            <li>Most creams seem to have some sort of flowery or herbal scent to them, so I appreciate the fact that this cream goes off in a different direction in that department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Saw improvement in the first week.</li>
            <li>It definitely does  work  a lot better for me and saw results after I used it along with a derma roller.</li>
            <li>I also plan to exercise, moisturize, and eat healthy as part of the daily regime too.</li>
            <li>im still on my first jar halfway</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pretty sure this works.</li>
            <li>Thanks Excel-Skincare!</li>
            <li>I went to a high end salon when I was about 7-1/2 months pregnant, and the lady there suggested I try this cream, to help prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li>fading (the main focus, which is right in it&#x27;s product description).  </li>
            <li>I am very satisified.</li>
            <li>Already from rubbing it on my skin feels much softer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m real, just got see my review page.</li>
            <li>It helps that it spreads and absorbs very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not much else to say.  </li>
            <li>I just really hope that this cream starts to deliver on the stretch mark</li>
            <li>My stretch marks definitely faded and filled it</li>
            <li>it now because it really works.</li>
            <li>The deeper stretch marks on my legs have not changed as much.  </li>
            <li>I put some on twice a day, when I woke up and when I was getting ready for bed.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have a zebra butt from my growth spurt about 7 years ago during puberty, and haven&#x27;t attempted to really do anything about it until now.</li>
            <li>think the purple/dark color on my elbow seems to have faded a bit from the lotion, but I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell at the moment.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not seeing much on the stretch-mark healing</li>
            <li>you name it) and MUCH cheaper.</li>
            <li>Although my stretch mark doesn&#x27;t really go away, I can see some improvement.</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t work for me, it at least works as a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>While not all of my stretch marks are completely gone - they all have faded a lot!!!  </li>
            <li>I would so recomend this to any pregnant mother or a mother with any new or old stretch marks .</li>
            <li>It seems to do well in most other areas, so I&#x27;m crossing my fingers.  </li>
            <li>this cream tightens your skin making the stretch marks less noticeable and feeling better.</li>
            <li>The marks used to be highly visible on both biceps</li>
            <li>The stretch marks that I used the cream on were from high school and college</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend that anyone try this cream out for purpose alone -- recovering from sunburn, that is.  </li>
            <li>I had my first baby last year who was 9lbs 3oz.</li>
            <li>It actually does a better job than all other products I tried (Stri-Vectin, Mio Mio, Mama Earth, etc...</li>
            <li>and this definitely has reduced the depth, width, and length by half or more.</li>
            <li>After 2 months of use, my scars are hardly visible, and I feel comfortable wearing a bikini again!</li>
            <li>Before this I tried Bio Oil, Revitol, microneedling, and Coca Butter and while they showed some improvement, this excel cream completely blows them out of the water.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I have see much improvement in the appearance of those stretch marks, but I have only used a couple jars.  </li>
            <li>, however I don&#x27;t know that it is a complete miracle cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve 10+ year old marks</li>
            <li>/&gt;But so far, this is what I think about the cream:&lt;br /&gt;-It seems like it would help with darker skin discolorations.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, my butt cheeks have never felt this soft in my life.</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable wearing shorts and know that with continued use, ill be comfortable enough to wear a swimsuit without a cover up at the beach this summer!!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for less than a week and already my stretch marks above my belly button are gone and the rest are significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>Seemed to work pretty well, saw minor changes, but requires multiple purchases I feel.</li>
            <li>I used everyday while pregnant and didn&#x27;t end up with any stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Sure, there was a little, but nothing like I have experienced in the past -- even after using expensive lotions daily.  </li>
            <li>Due to my post-pregnancy stretch marks on my belly and breast, I felt really self conscious</li>
            <li>Being a 22 year old male, my stretch marks are from working out.</li>
            <li>and I am no longer self conscious about wearing short sleeve shirts anymore.</li>
            <li>i have old white (silver) stretch marks on my stomach and sides.</li>
            <li>, my butt cheeks have never felt this soft in my life.rks are different.  </li>
            <li>I recently spent some time in Phoenix and spent a little more time in the sun than I should have.  </li>
            <li>When my arms and just straight down you can&#x27;t even see them.</li>
            <li>I had stretch marks from my high school years due to growth spurts.</li>

            <li> The marks used to be highly visible on both biceps</li>
            <li> The stretch marks that I used the cream on were from high school and college</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend that anyone try this cream out for purpose alone -- recovering from sunburn, that is.  </li>
            <li> I had my first baby last year who was 9lbs 3oz.</li>
            <li> It actually does a better job than all other products I tried (Stri-Vectin, Mio Mio, Mama Earth, etc...</li>
            <li> and this definitely has reduced the depth, width, and length by half or more.</li>
            <li> After 2 months of use, my scars are hardly visible, and I feel comfortable wearing a bikini again!</li>
            <li> Before this I tried Bio Oil, Revitol, microneedling, and Coca Butter and while they showed some improvement, this excel cream completely blows them out of the water.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I have see much improvement in the appearance of those stretch marks, but I have only used a couple jars.  </li>
            <li> , however I don&#x27;t know that it is a complete miracle cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve 10+ year old marks</li>
            <li> /&gt;But so far, this is what I think about the cream:&lt;br /&gt;-It seems like it would help with darker skin discolorations.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , my butt cheeks have never felt this soft in my life.</li>
            <li> I feel comfortable wearing shorts and know that with continued use, ill be comfortable enough to wear a swimsuit without a cover up at the beach this summer!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for less than a week and already my stretch marks above my belly button are gone and the rest are significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work pretty well, saw minor changes, but requires multiple purchases I feel.</li>
            <li> I used everyday while pregnant and didn&#x27;t end up with any stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Sure, there was a little, but nothing like I have experienced in the past -- even after using expensive lotions daily.  </li>
            <li> Due to my post-pregnancy stretch marks on my belly and breast, I felt really self conscious</li>
            <li> Being a 22 year old male, my stretch marks are from working out.</li>
            <li> and I am no longer self conscious about wearing short sleeve shirts anymore.</li>
            <li> i have old white (silver) stretch marks on my stomach and sides.</li>
            <li> , my butt cheeks have never felt this soft in my life.rks are different.  </li>
            <li> I recently spent some time in Phoenix and spent a little more time in the sun than I should have.  </li>
            <li> When my arms and just straight down you can&#x27;t even see them.</li>
            <li> I had stretch marks from my high school years due to growth spurts.</li>
            <li> I hardly got any stretch marks for my third baby after using this after my second (the whole jar over several months).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly not sure how much effect the cream had over just loosing weight, but I am going to purchase another can of this stuff anyways.</li>
            <li> an buttocks would recommend last very long also</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also massaged a bit into the raised scars on my elbow from a bike accident, which are half as old as my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> so by now they were white and even still this cream managed to diminish the appearance to the point where it is minimally visible.</li>
            <li> Within days to a few short weeks, my scars are fading some even barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I found this product while researching for some different kinds of treatments, as other “scar reducing” brands I have tried didn’t do anything.</li>
            <li> Even my stretch marks from my previous pregnancy are super faded now, and you can hardly see them!</li>
            <li> Not really noticing anything different than any other lotion.</li>
            <li> I do see results dark brwn have turned red or</li>
            <li> pleasant-smelling (there&#x27;s no perfume or obvious scents added), and the consistency is fairly heavy, which I like about a lotion.</li>
            <li> I have used about half of the cream up over the last 4 months, and the lighter stretch marks on my stomach are definitely less noticible.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for roughly 27 days as directed, and am slightly less than halfway through the jar.</li>
            <li> I had previous stretch marks from my second pregancy and little by little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping with continued use (I try to do at least one application daily)</li>
            <li> Thumbs down</li>
            <li> I am not the typical user of stretch mark creams.</li>
            <li> Typically, when I get burned like I had, my skin will eventually tan, but then it will peel/rub off to some degree.  </li>
            <li> Maybe a slightly improved appearance.  </li>
            <li> ( About half in a months time).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t help my pale, older stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more and telling friends and family about this bad boy!</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a little over three weeks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little buttery</li>
            <li> Also the stretch marks on my thighs are going away a little bit.</li>
            <li> I have also missed a few days applying it</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> My stretchmark got brighter and shinier if anything, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I had weird marks around my breasts that are completely gone.</li>
            <li> I think with continued use of this cream I will see a dramatic difference in the next month or so,</li>
            <li> I have some scars from a couple of laparoscopic surgeries I have had done – my poor tummy looked like a war zone, and because of that, I really felt uncomfortable wearing speedos at the beach.</li>
            <li> Not sure this product,I tried using it for days</li>
            <li> i had deep purple stretch marks after having my son and was afraid that I would be stuck with a gnarly looking belly.</li>
            <li> I mean they are still there</li>
            <li> and it was so subtle but undeniable.</li>
            <li> Im tired massage all the way in my strech mark,as what the instruction says.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I burned...especially on my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> (Although I did accidentally spill it on the tiled floor, which was sad.</li>
            <li> The burn wasn&#x27;t horrible, but my skin was a little tender.  </li>
            <li> I hate it and it makes me feel self-conscious.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell and couldn&#x27;t tell an difference.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do nothing for my skin, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but the smell is horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This worked great. I used everyday while pregnant and didn&#x27;t end up with any stretch marks.</li>
            <li> The cream goes on smooth and dissolves fast. I do honestly see an improvement. I think with continued use of this cream I will see a dramatic difference in the next month or so, Gonna order my second jar. I am very satisified.</li>
            <li> I have stretch marks. And cellulite, and scars. Ive tried everything to help prevent or repair all of them, and nothing worked. Until I found Excel Skincare!  After three months of use, the appearance of my C section scars and cellulite are dramatically reduced. I finally feel comfortable to let my own husband see me naked again. I feel comfortable wearing shorts and know that with continued use, ill be comfortable enough to wear a swimsuit without a cover up at the beach this summer!!</li>
            <li> Just got this stuff today. First off the shipping was amazing, my original delivery date was for Wednesday but it came on Monday! (: I have gotten a shower and rubbed it on. The smell is okay, I think. It&#x27;s not \\&quot;oh I love the smell\\&quot; but then it&#x27;s not \\&quot;ewe\\&quot;. I think it smells like nuts.  Already from rubbing it on my skin feels much softer. I&#x27;m using it on the stretch marks on my upper arms. Will update my review in 3 weeks. Hopefully it works!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a little over three weeks and it&#x27;s amazing. They are actually fading. I mean they are still there but they look soooo much better! When my arms and just straight down you can&#x27;t even see them. The jar is still full, so I&#x27;m going to keep using it on my arms until it&#x27;s gone. Thank you Excel! Will be ordering more and telling friends and family about this bad boy! (:&lt;br /&gt;P.s. I&#x27;m real, just got see my review page. (:</li>
            <li> I saw a difference after the first four days of use. Good stuff! i had deep purple stretch marks after having my son and was afraid that I would be stuck with a gnarly looking belly.</li>
            <li> I am not the typical user of stretch mark creams. Being a 22 year old male, my stretch marks are from working out. The marks used to be highly visible on both biceps and it would show prominently whenever I would wear a short sleeve shirt and people took notice. Before this I tried Bio Oil, Revitol, microneedling, and Coca Butter and while they showed some improvement, this excel cream completely blows them out of the water. The stretch marks that I used the cream on were from high school and college so by now they were white and even still this cream managed to diminish the appearance to the point where it is minimally visible. I have been told by people that they can no longer see the marks from before and I am no longer self conscious about wearing short sleeve shirts anymore. Amazing product!!</li>
            <li> This is my second time to use this stretch mark cream for my 3rd baby--it works! I hardly got any stretch marks for my third baby after using this after my second (the whole jar over several months). And I had 3 babies in under 3 years!</li>
            <li> I had stretch marks from my high school years due to growth spurts. Product arrived fast and customer service was great answering further questions that I had. Texture and feel is good. Be consistent, don&#x27;t skip when applying. Good product, happy customer as I continue buying. Good also for fading scars and burns.</li>
            <li> Not sure this product,I tried using it for days but I don&#x27;t see any result.Im tired massage all the way in my strech mark,as what the instruction says.Hmmm.... Maybe it works,maybe not.....</li>
            <li> I started using this products months after noticing marks from exercise. Within days to a few short weeks, my scars are fading some even barely noticeable. I only use the product once a day but have tried increasing my use since I gains results with just one application a day. Please try ladies and gents.</li>
            <li> I think this is an excellent cream that does what it says...reduces stretch truly to a great percentage. I noticed they were just not as deep and it was so subtle but undeniable.It works so well i just hope it will continue because the results make you hungry for more and makes you hope they will all go away. It does what it says for sure.</li>
            <li> I went to a high end salon when I was about 7-1/2 months pregnant, and the lady there suggested I try this cream, to help prevent stretch marks. I’m so glad that I tried this!! I’m now 15 weeks post partum, and have NO visible stretch marks! Even my stretch marks from my previous pregnancy are super faded now, and you can hardly see them!</li>
            <li> Awesome products! This is my second purchase. Due to my post-pregnancy stretch marks on my belly and breast, I felt really self conscious ( they weren&#x27;t awfully huge or purple). Along with the help of my Derma Roller, I saw some great results in a few months. Although, I did stop doing the Derma Roller ( do to life events, not the derma roller). I just restarted the process of rolling and applying the product right after and for a week after so. I love the results!! I&#x27;m beach body ready!</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping it would help reduce the stretch marks on my tush.  I can&#x27;t say I have see much improvement in the appearance of those stretch marks, but I have only used a couple jars.  I&#x27;m hoping with continued use (I try to do at least one application daily), I will see the stretch marks fade out some.  If it doesn&#x27;t work for me, it at least works as a good moisturizer.  That&#x27;s one thing this product definitely has going for itself -- great for moisturizing your skin.  It helps that it spreads and absorbs very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I have seen any reviews concerning use of this product on burns, so here&#x27;s mine.  I recently spent some time in Phoenix and spent a little more time in the sun than I should have.  Needless to say, I burned...especially on my shoulders.  The burn wasn&#x27;t horrible, but my skin was a little tender.  Since this cream moisturizes well (for me), I decided to apply it to those burned areas.  Typically, when I get burned like I had, my skin will eventually tan, but then it will peel/rub off to some degree.  This cream definitely lessened that problem almost to the point where it didn&#x27;t happen at all.  Sure, there was a little, but nothing like I have experienced in the past -- even after using expensive lotions daily.  I would highly recommend that anyone try this cream out for purpose alone -- recovering from sunburn, that is.  Worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing...I love the smell of this cream!  To me, it smells like dark chocolate, and that&#x27;s awesome.  Most creams seem to have some sort of flowery or herbal scent to them, so I appreciate the fact that this cream goes off in a different direction in that department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much else to say.  I just really hope that this cream starts to deliver on the stretch mark fading (the main focus, which is right in it&#x27;s product description).  It seems to do well in most other areas, so I&#x27;m crossing my fingers.  Some more time using this cream will reveal the truth.ruth.</li>
            <li> I have been using it twice a day and I am seeing results my stretch marks are lightening up I think this is a great product I haven&#x27;t finished it yet but I&#x27;m eager to see my results when it&#x27;s all gone it&#x27;s been abt 3weeks I have also missed a few days applying it but it&#x27;s workin for me</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son&#x27;s weightlifting stretch marks that were very deep and red. Saw improvement in the first week. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I would so recomend this to any pregnant mother or a mother with any new or old stretch marks . I had previous stretch marks from my second pregancy and little by little I started seeing results I am amazed to say this stuff really works . :) !</li>
            <li> Waste of my money. It&#x27;s stink and does not do the job. I shouldve believed the reviews. I wanted to try it for myself. Boy did I learn my lesson. Thumbs down</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about a week.  Makes my skin feel good and marks less noticeable by touch.  Maybe a slightly improved appearance.  Not my favorite smell, however not overpowering.  I&#x27;m optimistic that it will improve marks, however I don&#x27;t know that it is a complete miracle cream.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks definitely faded and filled it so I don&#x27;t feel them anymore. Great product</li>
            <li> Great product! I started seeing my marks fade in one week &amp; I will definitely be ordering again! 👍</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and haven&#x27;t seen to big of results.. so I can&#x27;t talk about the product simply not working or not.. but the smell is horrible. I hate it and it makes me feel self-conscious. I only use it before bed and I use Palmer&#x27;s stretch mark lotion throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen more results with Palmer&#x27;s and its a lot cheaper!</li>
            <li> I really liked this cream and was able to notice some results. They arent com ppl leteky gone but im hoping they will with a second bottle. It&#x27;s a little buttery but I guess that&#x27;s why it works.</li>
            <li> This product is great I have noticed may stretch marks of over 20 years fading out.  Going on my 3rd once.  I love the product, working for me.</li>
            <li> I had my first baby last year who was 9lbs 3oz. All of my weight was in my belly and that&#x27;s where the stretch marks went. I have used this product for less than a week and already my stretch marks above my belly button are gone and the rest are significantly reduced. I will be buying more when I run out, I love it!</li>
            <li> Seemed to work pretty well, saw minor changes, but requires multiple purchases I feel. I tried another brand, but this seemed to work better for me.</li>
            <li> Not really noticing anything different than any other lotion. It does absorb well and has a nice light smell to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve 10+ year old marks and this definitely has reduced the depth, width, and length by half or more. ( About half in a months time). It definitely does  work  a lot better for me and saw results after I used it along with a derma roller. I feel so much more confident and know with continued use that I&#x27;ll be even more comfortable in my own skin. It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, non-greasy ( doesn&#x27;t ruin clothes), smells nice, feels great! I&#x27;d literally recommend for either sex and any age.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do nothing for my skin, very disappointed. My stretchmark got brighter and shinier if anything, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Product was great, My wife was surprised with the result, results are visible very quickly during using. I planned to order more and it now because it really works.</li>
            <li> I have used about half of the cream up over the last 4 months, and the lighter stretch marks on my stomach are definitely less noticible.  The deeper stretch marks on my legs have not changed as much.  I&#x27;m honestly not sure how much effect the cream had over just loosing weight, but I am going to purchase another can of this stuff anyways.</li>
            <li> I love love LLOOVVVEEE this stuff! my first jar, in the sixth day I saw some fading already!  I put some on twice a day, when I woke up and when I was getting ready for bed. I&#x27;m now about to finish my second jar and will order a third when I get paid lol</li>
            <li> Has an interesting smell</li>
            <li> This is a good rich cr&amp;egrave;me, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin since using this cr&amp;egrave;me , stretch marks are lighter than before using it. I will order again. Thanks</li>
            <li> So i both this cream and have tried a couple before. i only use it at night because i have school and i sweat during weight training. after using it for 2 weeks (i sometimes forgot to put it on), i can see and feel the results. i have old white (silver) stretch marks on my stomach and sides. this cream tightens your skin making the stretch marks less noticeable and feeling better. the marks are turning a bit redder (closer to my skin color) but i don&#x27;t think it will change the color, but it has improved the size and depth of the marks. now this is after 2 weeks and almost applied once daily. because i have so many, i;m going through it kinda quick, i will order more. i even think it&#x27;s making them smaller. give it a try, i can definately feel my skin tighter and it has given me a bit more confidence</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using excel skin care premium stretch mark cream for 2 weeks now and it really improves my skin, all my stretchmarks in my tummy are almost gone now. :)</li>
            <li> Edit:&lt;br /&gt;-Yes, this will make your skin incredibly soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I used it up in two months. Unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t help my pale, older stretch marks. Or my raised scar.&lt;br /&gt;But I suggest trying it for yourself, as different skin types respond differently.&lt;br /&gt;It seems that many people with newer, red stretch marks have had great results. So go for it!&lt;br /&gt;And the company also seems great to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be on the hunt for something else.&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To read original review:&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for roughly 27 days as directed, and am slightly less than halfway through the jar. (Although I did accidentally spill it on the tiled floor, which was sad. My conservative application at the beginning probably made up for that.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pleasant-smelling (there&#x27;s no perfume or obvious scents added), and the consistency is fairly heavy, which I like about a lotion. I have a zebra butt from my growth spurt about 7 years ago during puberty, and haven&#x27;t attempted to really do anything about it until now. My stretch marks are light in color and size, but pretty noticeable against my sort-of-because-of-winter-light-tan skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also massaged a bit into the raised scars on my elbow from a bike accident, which are half as old as my stretch marks. I wanted to see what would happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the purple/dark color on my elbow seems to have faded a bit from the lotion, but I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in my stretch marks. They MIGHT have faded a tiny bit, but that could also be wishful thinking. I can&#x27;t really tell at the moment. I also plan to exercise, moisturize, and eat healthy as part of the daily regime too. Hopefully that will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But so far, this is what I think about the cream:&lt;br /&gt;-It seems like it would help with darker skin discolorations.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s pleasant, but I&#x27;m not seeing much on the stretch-mark healing part.&lt;br /&gt;-It might take some time--everyone&#x27;s skin and stretch marks are different.&lt;br /&gt;-I will wait it out and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;-Also, my butt cheeks have never felt this soft in my life.rks are different.  -I will wait it out and see what happens.  -Also, my butt cheeks have never felt this soft in my life.</li>
            <li> im still on my first jar halfway gone I do see results dark brwn have turned red or my skin color iam a honey beige female  with marks on my lowr torso hip an buttocks would recommend last very long also</li>
            <li> Marks are disappearing even though I forget about it all the time and only use it every couple of months. I had weird marks around my breasts that are completely gone. Also the stretch marks on my thighs are going away a little bit. Overall I&#x27;m pretty sure this works.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product! While not all of my stretch marks are completely gone - they all have faded a lot!!!  I would definitely recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Good quality stretch mark cream. It actually does a better job than all other products I tried (Stri-Vectin, Mio Mio, Mama Earth, etc...you name it) and MUCH cheaper. Although my stretch mark doesn&#x27;t really go away, I can see some improvement.</li>
            <li> I have some scars from a couple of laparoscopic surgeries I have had done – my poor tummy looked like a war zone, and because of that, I really felt uncomfortable wearing speedos at the beach. I found this product while researching for some different kinds of treatments, as other “scar reducing” brands I have tried didn’t do anything. After 2 months of use, my scars are hardly visible, and I feel comfortable wearing a bikini again! Thanks Excel-Skincare!</li>
            <li> I hate the smell and couldn&#x27;t tell an difference.</li>
            <li> Love this product. ...</li>
