    <ol>
            <li>Trim as directed and they work great!</li>
            <li>These do their job and I am happy with this set.</li>
            <li>so I have had a fair amount of experience with molding mouth guards</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit perfectly to your teeth</li>
            <li>I happen to have had a perfect sized box they fit in nicely.</li>
            <li>This item worked great, molded to my teeth easily and work effectively when using my bleaching product for my teeth.</li>
            <li>I rated them three stars just because they did mold to my teeth, but they did not mold as well as I would have liked them to.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and great quality</li>
            <li>To be fair, they are cheap.</li>
            <li>But in this case, I think you&#x27;d be better off paying more for a better product.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>they are as stated u get what you buys but no directions make sure you wash em when u get em and dont boil on highest setting</li>
            <li>These worked OK.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll spend more money for the strips or to just get</li>
            <li>1 melted trying to get it to a more comfortable size</li>
            <li>The molds fit better on my teeth now.</li>
            <li>For a more detailed guide, go google the instructions.</li>
            <li>and they collapse and can&#x27;t be easily formed as you struggle to get them in your mouth and over your teeth.  </li>
            <li>The trays do not mold easily.</li>
            <li>There were three in my package, which was nice, because the first one fell apart in the boiling water.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t fit well at all.</li>
            <li>Based on my own experience, they did not mold very well to my teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>I rub my whitening gel onto my teeth with my fingers first anyway, so this is just protection for my gums and it does a fine job of that.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so cheap that you really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>Smile with a brighter smile.</li>
            <li>and it never tells u when its coming to ur house on the right time</li>
            <li>They were very affordable and it&#x27;s nice to have extra ones.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Formed to quickly,need to order more, also ordered four and only three came.</li>
            <li>it will start to melt if waters to hot by then</li>
            <li>You put them in hot water to mold them to your teeth which they did mold to my teeth</li>
            <li>alittle large for my teeth</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>These mouth trays met my expectations and worked very well.  </li>
            <li>I did not expect perfection for how reasonable they are</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t seem very hygienic and I will be returning them.</li>
            <li>Formed well, better than other mouth guards.</li>
            <li>Basically, in order to use these, get some boiling water, use the tabs to place them in the boiling water, quickly press the tray against your teeth to get them molded properly.</li>
            <li>..stuck with only one couldnt get it to the right size was still</li>
            <li>i like these better than &amp;#34;Thermo-molding &amp;#34;BOIL and BITE&amp;#34; Mouth Trays by Instant White&amp;#34; products (10 in a pack), its gets really soft with not a lot of heat and stays soft for a few minutes so good mold can be made by pressing each and every tooth and polymer gets soft enough to bite into for a really tight and snug caste.</li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t really do the sucking thing that usually makes these things fit, but</li>
            <li>These did not mold very well, even while following the directions.</li>
            <li>mouth guards professionally made for my teeth.</li>
            <li>They also do not fit comfortably in the mouth.</li>
            <li>Worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>they turned out all right except for bottom piece because it closed</li>

            <li> Fast delivery. Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Work as described. Formed well, better than other mouth guards.</li>

            <li> These did not mold very well, even while following the directions. I have played lots of sports so I have had a fair amount of experience with molding mouth guards so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a matter of practice. I think that the material is just not a great quality. To be fair, they are cheap. But in this case, I think you&#x27;d be better off paying more for a better product.</li>
            <li> Formed to quickly,need to order more, also ordered four and only three came.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re...okay. There were three in my package, which was nice, because the first one fell apart in the boiling water. They don&#x27;t fit perfectly to your teeth and you can&#x27;t really do the sucking thing that usually makes these things fit, but it&#x27;s so cheap that you really can&#x27;t complain.

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t mold to your mouth like it says</li>

            <li> Crappy product.  Too small and they collapse and can&#x27;t be easily formed as you struggle to get them in your mouth and over your teeth.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> A little awkward to use but they manage to serve their purpose. Worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> they are as stated u get what you buys but no directions make sure you wash em when u get em and dont boil on highest setting it will start to melt if waters to hot by then i just stuffed them in my mouth they turned out all right except for bottom piece because it closed but it still works go buy them be warned of what i said ohh yea and it never tells u when its coming to ur house on the right time mine came way earlier its says the 6th came the 3rd</li>
            <li> They did not hold up or form as expected.</li>
            <li> these trays are too huge and thick for me and the quality is so bad. when i put them to my mouth, they make me vomit.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do what it said,don&#x27;t believe every thing you read</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big and uncomfortable, but I just cut it. The molds fit better on my teeth now. It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> For the longest time, I had no idea that these were thermo-forming mouth trays since these mouth trays didn&#x27;t come with any instructions. Basically, in order to use these, get some boiling water, use the tabs to place them in the boiling water, quickly press the tray against your teeth to get them molded properly. For a more detailed guide, go google the instructions. After all, this is a review and not a how-to article.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the actual trays: Based on my own experience, they did not mold very well to my teeth. I rated them three stars just because they did mold to my teeth, but they did not mold as well as I would have liked them to. I tried to whiten my teeth by using these trays, but it didn&#x27;t work out well at all given that there was whitening gel constantly leaking from the tray since the tray did not press well to my teeth.</li>
            <li> Purchased these trays, boiled the water, and they shriveled up into the size of a penny the second they touched the water. Highly do not recommend, would give them zero stars if I could.</li>
            <li> These worked OK. You put them in hot water to mold them to your teeth which they did mold to my teeth but there were still a lot of gaps. I did not expect perfection for how reasonable they are but I&#x27;ll spend more money for the strips or to just get mouth guards professionally made for my teeth.</li>
            <li> The trays do not mold easily. They also do not fit comfortably in the mouth. I would look elsewhere if you are looking for teeth whitening trays.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and great quality</li>
            <li> The trays were not packaged or wrapped and were just put in the envelope. That doesn&#x27;t seem very hygienic and I will be returning them.</li>
