            <li>I might buy some more for stocking stuffers around Christmas time.</li>
            <li>But in reality, I like the cuticle pusher that came as an &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; even more than the product itself.</li>
            <li>Mostly it just sits unused.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I am also pleased with the professionalism of the staff.</li>
            <li>I purchased 2 sets and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I have to say my favorite file is the cuticle pusher/file, it takes the cuticles off without any effort or pain.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Hands up for this cute set of nail files.</li>
            <li>These are better, faster, and leave my nail tips smoother than even the finest grit Diamoncel (#1) file.</li>
            <li>I love the silver storage cases that protect the files.</li>
            <li>but if not I will buy more.</li>
            <li>I love the look and feel of this product.</li>
            <li>Nail Files provided for free by Bona Fide Beauty in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li>I love how I can keep my nails groomed so easily without damaging them.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth it, one of my favorite Amazon purchases to date!</li>
            <li>This nail file is very cool.  </li>
            <li>am puzzled that although my grandfather was a Czech, I had never heard of there being a special glass!</li>
            <li>and i strongly recommend bona fide beauty.</li>
            <li>; file with the edged point, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Super cute.</li>
            <li>They file the nail so smoothly and into a fine powder.  </li>
            <li>These little cases are perfect!  </li>
            <li>this bundle is VERY MUCH WORTH  &amp; A BETTER PRICE than the Nail Tech file you can by for $15.00 at store &amp; $10.00 to $12.00 online!!&lt;br /&gt;NOT</li>
            <li>Great cuticle tool to push back and get rid of those &amp;#34;invisible cuticles&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Leave nails blunt and smooth.</li>
            <li>The files work great and rinse or wash under hot water and the file is like brand new.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re thinner than other files, but still incredibly durable.</li>
            <li>well worth it!</li>
            <li>The frosted glass handles are an added special touch.  </li>
            <li>TRUE</li>
            <li>My next purchase is the magenta in color, now that&#x27;s gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I use this as the first step before using some finer sandpaper to smooth everything out</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be able to switch to any other kind of nail</li>
            <li>I purchased my very first crystal (glass) nail file when I was in Vancouver Canada about 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>And the free manicure stick is a great little bonus!</li>
            <li>she says its very high quality and easy to carry in her purse with a sleek carrying case.</li>
            <li>The tempered glass nail files are pretty special too.  </li>
            <li>These are by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Works easily and not hard on one&#x27;s finger nails.</li>
            <li>Awesome, they are thicker than the nail files i usually use, which is the metal ones, but considerably smoother file, as others have said, they file very quickly, much like metal files, so if youve not used a metal file or glass file before, go slow till youre used to it, the cases are awesome, ive been reluctant to buy one because i was worried that they would break, which has been confirmed by reviews of other glass files, but the cases also look lovely.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t describe what &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; means, but it just feels different and seems to do a better job on the nails.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using a glass file ever.  </li>
            <li>I really like this set!</li>
            <li>I use the big one the most.</li>
            <li>They leave your nails feeling really smooth in quick time, unlike traditional nail files.  </li>
            <li>The do not leave any rough edges and they clean up easily.</li>
            <li>they look and feel very high quality.</li>
            <li>They seem to be made of a very high quality and do what I would expect from a nail file.  </li>
            <li>they are also very durable, so you will be using these for a while.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t really figured out what to do with the &amp;#34;manicure&amp;#34</li>
            <li>No sandpaper feel like regular files, just a smooth feel, yet it does the job.</li>
            <li>ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a full collection of Diamoncel files that I barely ever touch now, I&#x27;m always reaching for these.</li>
            <li>I like these files quite a lot, I put ball wraps on sometimes and this file has worked better than any other files I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>in all, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been working really well for me so far.</li>
            <li>They are definitely worth the extra dollars.</li>
            <li>I expect this set will last many years as long as I don&#x27;t drop any of them.</li>
            <li>these are pretty enough to lay out on your vanity!</li>
            <li>I definitely would recommend these nail files even though they have a higher price point,.  </li>
            <li>I love the small cases that come with them, which keep them protected.</li>
            <li>Classy as classy can be!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed far less tip splitting and nail peeling since I started using these as my primary filing tools.</li>
            <li>Allows me to file down all of my nails before needing to clean the glass.&lt;br /&gt;(Note</li>
            <li>I love that it comes in 2 sizes and has a hard case.</li>
            <li>The case is classy and durable.  </li>
            <li>I thought this set was a little prices compared to what I had purchased before, but having the cases quickly makes up for the additional cost because I don&#x27;t have to worry about them breaking unless they are out of their case.  </li>
            <li>I though for sure it would shatter or at the very least, chip.</li>
            <li>i much prefer these over some other files i have had</li>
            <li>etching is deep enough that it gets the job done efficiently, without ripping or damaging my nails (as far as I can tell) to the point where I don&#x27;t even bother clipping my fingernails anymore.</li>
            <li>Additionally I found that the nail files themselves were a higher quality and the filing surface is better than the less expensive files.  </li>

            <li> Have used this type of nail file for more than 10 years.  The moment I began using them my nails stopped splitting.  I refuse nail salon manicures because the files they use ruin my nails.  These are the BEST.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!!&lt;br /&gt;EXACTLY Like the &amp;#34;NailTech&amp;#34; Nail File, but this bundle is VERY MUCH WORTH  &amp; A BETTER PRICE than the Nail Tech file you can by for $15.00 at store &amp; $10.00 to $12.00 online!!&lt;br /&gt;NOT A CHEAP DUPLICATE! TRUE TO WHAT THEY SAY!</li>
            <li> these were a gift for my mom. she says its very high quality and easy to carry in her purse with a sleek carrying case.</li>
            <li> well worth it! this is the best nail set files i have ever owned! they look and feel very high quality. they are also very durable, so you will be using these for a while. i much prefer these over some other files i have had and i strongly recommend bona fide beauty. these are pretty enough to lay out on your vanity! i am happy i had the chance to test and review these for free.</li>
            <li> I was able to test these products in order to provide an honest review and I could not be happier.  These nail files are GREAT!!  They seem to be made of a very high quality and do what I would expect from a nail file.  I love that they are in a case so that I can carry them in my purse without worrying about damaging my bag.</li>
            <li> I have had many glass nail files &amp; these are among the best.  For the price, getting 2 and including carrying cases you can&#x27;t beat this deal.  They file the nail so smoothly and into a fine powder.  I am very pleased!  I might buy some more for stocking stuffers around Christmas time.</li>
            <li> I like these files quite a lot, I put ball wraps on sometimes and this file has worked better than any other files I&#x27;ve used. But in reality, I like the cuticle pusher that came as an &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; even more than the product itself. I use it constantly.</li>
            <li> Mother&#x27;s Day gift for my daughter in law! She loves the set! Very good value!</li>
            <li> Awesome, they are thicker than the nail files i usually use, which is the metal ones, but considerably smoother file, as others have said, they file very quickly, much like metal files, so if youve not used a metal file or glass file before, go slow till youre used to it, the cases are awesome, ive been reluctant to buy one because i was worried that they would break, which has been confirmed by reviews of other glass files, but the cases also look lovely.</li>
            <li> This was my third set of nail files, after the other one&#x27;s broke from being dropped, or some other mishap. I thought this set was a little prices compared to what I had purchased before, but having the cases quickly makes up for the additional cost because I don&#x27;t have to worry about them breaking unless they are out of their case.  Additionally I found that the nail files themselves were a higher quality and the filing surface is better than the less expensive files.  I can&#x27;t describe what &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; means, but it just feels different and seems to do a better job on the nails.  I definitely would recommend these nail files even though they have a higher price point,.  They are definitely worth the extra dollars.</li>
            <li> Just received these files. I love that it comes in 2 sizes and has a hard case. The cuticle pusher works well. I will mention this, I accidentally dropped one of the files on the hard cement floor, and for a second my heart stopped, I though for sure it would shatter or at the very least, chip. It did not. I don&#x27;t recommend dropping them, but it was nice to know it did not break.</li>
            <li> Great files, I love the cases very very happy.  Wish I would have ordered more great gift at a great price.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Awesome glass nail files!  Wash them off and you can reuse them forever!  Great cuticle tool to push back and get rid of those &amp;#34;invisible cuticles&amp;#34; that mess up your manicure - especially for my Jamberry nail wraps!</li>
            <li> Glass nail files are the best! The do not leave any rough edges and they clean up easily. I bought one for my mom and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I play classical guitar and have been looking for something to shape my nails with for a while. I use this as the first step before using some finer sandpaper to smooth everything out and it&#x27;s been working really well for me so far. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be able to switch to any other kind of nail fail again.</li>
            <li> I love these!!  I switched to glass nail files years ago but had to keep replacing them because they would break.  These little cases are perfect!  The files are nice and now I can safely keep them in my purse without worrying about accidentally smashing one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used glass nail files before. These are by far my favorite. They&#x27;re thinner than other files, but still incredibly durable. I love that they&#x27;re double-sided! Allows me to file down all of my nails before needing to clean the glass.&lt;br /&gt;(Note: cleaning just means running water over the file. Definitely not a hassle)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The etching is deep enough that it gets the job done efficiently, without ripping or damaging my nails (as far as I can tell) to the point where I don&#x27;t even bother clipping my fingernails anymore. I just file them to a satisfactory length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t really figured out what to do with the &amp;#34;manicure&amp;#34; file with the edged point, but that&#x27;s fine. Mostly it just sits unused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The carrying cases are plastic, but are sturdy enough to protect the files from damage as long as you don&#x27;t drop anything heavy on them. My boyfriend has claimed the small one and carries it in his pockets without issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a glass file ever.  I absolutely love it.  The case is classy and durable.  I recommended this product to my family &amp; co-workers.  I am also pleased with the professionalism of the staff. My next purchase is the magenta in color, now that&#x27;s gorgeous.</li>
            <li> The files are awesome I purchased 2 sets and I am glad I did.  I have been purchasing glass files looking for one that doesn&#x27;t wear out as soon as I use it and finally after searching for 2 years, I found these.  The files work great and rinse or wash under hot water and the file is like brand new.  Because these files are easier on the nails my nails look great.  I have to say my favorite file is the cuticle pusher/file, it takes the cuticles off without any effort or pain.  I would buy this set again, if I needed to.</li>
            <li> Great products!  I love how I can keep my nails groomed so easily without damaging them.  The files are durable, great looking, and I can keep one at home and one to take with me on the go!  And the free manicure stick is a great little bonus!</li>
            <li> I love the glass files and also it&#x27;s nice it comes with a case</li>
            <li> I love this set!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Love how they have their own case . They work great for me to keep my nails filed . Works easily and not hard on one&#x27;s finger nails. Super cute. I may need to get my mother in law a set . I received this product to test for my honest thoughts and unbiased review. Hands up for this cute set of nail files.</li>
            <li> Per an article on Allure, traditional nail files must be used in one direction to prevent shredding of the keratin layers. However glass files, will seal the keratin layers together at the edge of the nail, preventing peeling and chipping.  Files great, cleans easy and I&#x27;m happy. In the process of healing my nails from damage to gel nails and rotary filing.</li>
            <li> These are the BEST nail files ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a full collection of Diamoncel files that I barely ever touch now, I&#x27;m always reaching for these. These are better, faster, and leave my nail tips smoother than even the finest grit Diamoncel (#1) file. I love the silver storage cases that protect the files. I keep the small one in my pocketbook and the long one in my nail care kit at home, so I&#x27;m never without one. I&#x27;ve noticed far less tip splitting and nail peeling since I started using these as my primary filing tools. BUY THEM THEY&#x27;RE AWESOME! Totally worth it, one of my favorite Amazon purchases to date!</li>
            <li> I really like this set! I gave ine to a friend as a gift for her purse &amp; she loves it. I hope they remain like this but if not I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Very nice - 2 sizes and each in a holder, so they do not break in the bottom of my purse.&lt;br /&gt;I have emery boards everywhere - but these are awesome!&lt;br /&gt;I am puzzled that although my grandfather was a Czech, I had never heard of there being a special glass! Well, now I do!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for allowing me to give these a test drive - they feel good in my hand and do a fine job</li>
            <li> I purchased my very first crystal (glass) nail file when I was in Vancouver Canada about 10 years ago. There was a laser cut Leo horoscope at the end of the handle.  Unfortunately,  it broke in halves when I dropped it by accident. I was very thrilled when I saw this set.&lt;br /&gt;I use the small file on our 9 month old son, and the other 2 on myself.  I use the big one the most. It not only files well on my finger and toe nails, but also the rough skin at the tip of both of my thumbs. I use the round manicure stick to reach the hard to get area.  I love the small cases that come with them, which keep them protected. I expect this set will last many years as long as I don&#x27;t drop any of them.</li>
            <li> This nail file is very cool.  I love the packaging and it files beautifully.  It came with a travel size as well for my purse.</li>
            <li> Leave nails blunt and smooth. Great to carry in your purse.</li>
            <li> Ordered these for my mother. She loved borrowing one I already had and was thrilled when she got her own on Mothers day.  Would recommend the item and the seller.</li>
            <li> Just received these files. I love the look and feel of this product. No sandpaper feel like regular files, just a smooth feel, yet it does the job.</li>
            <li> Classy as classy can be!  These shiny silver lipstick type tubes for keeping your glass nail files can be defined as nothing but a touch of class!  The tempered glass nail files are pretty special too.  They leave your nails feeling really smooth in quick time, unlike traditional nail files.  The frosted glass handles are an added special touch.  The included manicure stick is really nice, also made of tempered glass, it is perfect for pushing back your cuticles and tending to the areas around and under the nails.&lt;br /&gt;  This set is very nice and would be a really nice gift for anyone, for any occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glass Nail Files provided for free by Bona Fide Beauty in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.</li>
