            <li>This really is an amazing product!</li>
            <li>the refining skin polish for the body is good but not that great    </li>
            <li>Ok, I am seeing the best dermatologist in Texas.  </li>
            <li>The item arrived in perfect condition and very quickly.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never looked as good.  </li>
            <li>Take the brush head off after EVERY use and wash the handle and brush good.  </li>

            <li>, if you can afford it, it&#x27;s a good purchase.</li>
            <li>Clarisonic claims that the battery life is good for 30 minutes (or washing twice a day &#x3D; 2 weeks).</li>

            <li>the way, seller provides good after-sales service.</li>
            <li>It is a good value for the money.</li>
            <li>I never even looked into the Clarisonic before because of the price, and thought manual cleansing with my hands would be just as good.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until my unit stop working that I realized just how good my skin was.</li>
            <li>VERY HAPPY with that level of customer service that is rare these days!    </li>
            <li>The best investment I have made  awesome has helped my face feel clean and fresh</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t say this strongly enough...invest in a good cream to apply after each cleansing!</li>
            <li>This is a very reputable retailer and I have never had problems with them before.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the results from this product.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this seller, received product as promised and shipped in a timely fashion.  </li>

            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Also, I have noticed that my products have worked better since using Clarisonic!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sure to post any updates!    </li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>It truly does make a difference; my skin has never looked better!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product, and my skin has never been cleaner or healthier!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li>not use the Clarisonic longer than recommended, especially at first!</li>
            <li>Now with just days of using it again my skin is looking much better!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I did not have any amazing changes in my skin</li>
            <li>Although this product is AMAZING for me-</li>
            <li>Amazing skin care product.</li>
            <li>The Clarisonic makes a good product to have the ability to better penetrate the skin and to raise its power to maximum.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, with the EXCELLENT customer service and GREAT results, I give this product 5 STARS.  </li>
            <li>and I am loving the system.  </li>
            <li>I could&#x27;ve had a nice pair of shoes instead.</li>
            <li>In fact, I got one for my mom the week after I got my own.    </li>
            <li>but there is no reason why you can&#x27;t use your own body polishers / body exfoliators and cleansers.    </li>
            <li>Both of those were junk, honestly.  </li>
            <li>An effective device for efficient and thorough face cleansing.  </li>
            <li>liked it</li>
            <li>Facials just feel good, &amp; I know they can feel even better.  </li>
            <li>A Clarisonic Pro Deluxe was ordered in mid-December and never arrived.</li>
            <li>My husband has his own brush head</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use (or try) the products though, I used my own.</li>
            <li>good luck :)</li>
            <li>To be honest, I wish I had gone that route, as 4 speeds are overkill.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, just get a nice exfoliant like Philosophy&#x27;s Microdelivery.</li>
            <li>I use my own concoction of oils (castor, grape seed, jojoba, lavender), rub it on my face, then run the deep-pore brush over my face on the lowest setting for one minute.</li>
            <li>So if you buy it from an authorized dealer you will pay more but the warranty of 2 to 3 years depending on the type of Clarisonic you buy, will be good</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that I think it was worth every cent!  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and your skin will feel so clean and exfoliated.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin, great at all modes of the machine</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin, great at all modes of the machine</li>
            <li>You know the old saying when the wife is happy we are both happy</li>
            <li>My skin has a nice rosy glow after using and moisturizer seems to go on more nicely as well as make-up.</li>
            <li>So, finding a good face cleanser for your skin type is definitely key to seeing the best results with the Clarisonic.    </li>
            <li>I am so happy with my purchase and would tell all women this  is worth the money for maintaining and improving your face.</li>
            <li>and it is sooo easy!</li>
            <li>Initally experienced misunderstanding with seller wrt product; however, the seller was great at promptly resolving the problem...would definitely use this seller again.</li>
            <li>Impressed with the quality of Clarisonic Pro; have only used it three times, but feel that it will be extremely effective.</li>
            <li>applying make up , and once if im not applying make up , before bed time , it leaves my skin glowing and smooth LOVE IT !</li>
            <li>but I love it.  </li>
            <li>that after cleansing with the Clarisonic your skin care products sink in to your skin SO much better, and you&#x27;ll find them having even better benefits over time.</li>
            <li>I love to use my Clarisonic with Origins Checks &amp; Balances frothy cleanser.</li>
            <li>but it was working to take off that top layer...</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it will work just as well.</li>
            <li>Why am I paying more for a Spot Therapy Kit I don&#x27;t get, Amazon?    </li>
            <li>And, yes, Clarisonic has the same EXCELLENT customer service as Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>The better the face cleanser for your skin type,</li>
            <li>the better the results.  </li>
            <li>GLAD</li>
            <li>but the girl friend&#x27;s elatedand that more than makes up for it.</li>
            <li>I really love it, no problems or complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Revaleskin Night Cream with Coffeeberry 1.7 oz]] makes sure the effect lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>And to top it off.</li>
            <li>You get a better body scrub with the \\&quot;Scrub</li>
            <li>Gloves\\&quot; you can find in most any store.</li>
            <li>My clarisonic is under the cabinet, I wish I had done better homework on my purchase.  </li>
            <li>While I do think it does an excellent job of cleaning my skin, and my skin definitely feels cleaner</li>
            <li>barely touching them would squeeze that oil out..</li>
            <li>That said I think my skin texture and tone look much better.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t afford to buy more of these units.  </li>
            <li>Love the ease of changing the brush heads.</li>
            <li>My skin never looked and felt better.</li>
            <li>and it just FEELS better</li>
            <li>I truly love this product.  </li>
            <li>I am SOOO glad I did.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything it&#x27;s promised to be and more.</li>
            <li>I love the body brush.  </li>
            <li>i have used it for one week and it leaves your skin nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>One REQUEST that I&#x27;d love Clairsonic to consider is to make a wall mount charger...</li>
            <li>I hope that over time, I see more improvements in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Now I use a much lighter formula that works great.  </li>
            <li>In the end, I knew I&#x27;d always want a Clarisonic just based on the reviews, so perhaps it&#x27;s best that I went ahead and bit the bullet instead of spending the extra 100 dollars on something else, just to purchase this</li>
            <li>I love the clarisonic.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best gift I ever gave (above the diamonds</li>
            <li>she&#x27;ll love you for the results and for thinking of her in this way.</li>
            <li>I already have wrinkles and do not need any more.  </li>
            <li>I love that it can be used in the shower</li>
            <li>That having been said, I am sure there are many people who don&#x27;t have a problem with that, it probably just depends on your skin and how prone you are to breaking out.</li>
            <li>In any case, my skin never looks better than after using this brush followed by a good mask and favorite cream, it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>, I make sure to always store it on the charger</li>
            <li>Overall, my face is the best it has been in years!</li>
            <li>:)     </li>
            <li>Why I Love It:  </li>
            <li>Low battery warning would be awesome.</li>
            <li>Mostly in patches.</li>
            <li>this - my aging and acne-prone skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I love my clarisonic.</li>
            <li>WIth the Mia ,it just feels like something is vibrating on your skin but the Pro really scrubs the skin and is a great exfoliator.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and have received compliments about how fresh and bright my skin is.  </li>
            <li>I took the risk and have had no problems and have been enjoying my Clarisonic for five months now.</li>
            <li>My Nu Skin Cleansers work even better with this.</li>
            <li>I have bought one for each of my daughters, and they love it too.  </li>
            <li>and I have used machine more than 1 week.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>As soon as most of the acne ceased to \\&quot;purge\\&quot;, I started using the Aria model.  </li>
            <li>I now use the pro (top of the line) and the Aria when out of town.  </li>
            <li>Also, make sure to replace the brushes every 60 uses.  </li>
            <li>Ebay sells the brushes for about $14-15 each, the best I&#x27;ve found and also sells larger supplies for sometimes cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love my clarisonic.</li>
            <li>LOVE the fact that it can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li>I love the Clarisonic and am glad I decided to invest in it.</li>
            <li>Totally the best thing since sliced bread.</li>
            <li>but I truly get it why people love, love, love Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better than I imagined.</li>
            <li>better.</li>
            <li>Your creams absorb better &amp; your skin has a glow.  </li>
            <li>How much better do you want it????  </li>
            <li>Also my face feels so smooth after using it!</li>
            <li>think most people that have had complaints on this item and the brush heads are not buying from Amazon or a supplier that fulfills Amazon&#x27;s orders.  </li>
            <li>Mostly by cleaning out the pores.  </li>
            <li>Leaves face very clean.  </li>
            <li>I am very blessed with good genes and my skin is in great condition at the tender age of 54, but I can not take all of the credit this machine REALLY MAKES A DIFFERNCE</li>
            <li>I love how it recharges easily and let&#x27;s me know when it is fully charged.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got this product on Amazon and was able to save money and get free shipping as well.</li>
            <li>So far, so good, and it kind of motivates me to stick to a regimen of cleaning, moisturizing, and sun protection.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a super cleaner, and you get a pretty great face massage as well.</li>
            <li>Large brush surface is another superior feature.</li>
            <li>But overall it is very good.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, is fast, and effective.  </li>
            <li>Men out there, PERSONALLY, I think a Clairsonic would make an AWESOME girly gift for that special lady in your life...</li>
            <li>the results have been amazing (and using Fresh&#x27;s Soy Cleanser).</li>
            <li>my serums and makeup go on much more smoothly</li>
            <li>The product works as described and seems to do a pretty good job of making sure the skin looks and feels fresh.    </li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this product because I absolutely love my Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the brush for a couple months now, once a day after I wash my make-up off, the brush always takes off more make-up even though to me my skin already looks clean.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to fuss with anything, but this is as easy to use as shaving.</li>
            <li>Exchanging the face brush and body brush is so easy.</li>
            <li>So easy to use</li>
            <li>Product is easy to work.</li>
            <li>Easy to use,</li>
            <li>Charging it is so easy, just put it in the cradle.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks so much better and just feels clean.</li>
            <li>this would DEFINITELY be included on my top 10 - MAYBE even top 5 list!!</li>
            <li>so I happy the item I got was apparently legit.</li>
            <li>I use a really neat powdered clay product that give the best result of any facials I do with other nice products.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a decolletage that I know of, but this is an easy product for a man to use and see genuine results of a smoother healthier face.</li>
            <li>I even noticed that some of my fine lines seemed to have softened.  </li>
            <li>Supposedly they say that it cleans your face much more effectively and that serums such as vitamin C is absorbed into the skin much more effectively.</li>
            <li>Change the brush head as suggested, even if yours looks fine and feels fine, it&#x27;s going to breed bacteria</li>
            <li>If I had a list of my absolute favorite things, (material that is!</li>
            <li>The unit looks completely brand new and packaging was perfect.  </li>
            <li>To be honest the pro speed was much too strong for me, but it does have that</li>
            <li>Every day use is fine and not overly done, because the feel of the brush is smooth.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know if I saw any huge improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li>I have seen a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge turn around in the quality of my skin.</li>
            <li>The package itself says \\&quot;available exclusively from your skin care</li>
            <li>The brushes feel light against the skin...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the Clarisonic cleaners that it comes with are all that fabulous.</li>
            <li>The design of the handle is ergonomic and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Skin Smooth.</li>
            <li>The design of the handle is ergonomic and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Skin Smooth.</li>
            <li>I am using the Clarisonic with Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant and am having great results.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m free...</li>
            <li>Looking foward to a smooth skintastic journey with it.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve read both descriptions, I can&#x27;t figure out what the real difference is between the Pro Deluxe model and the ______ model.  </li>
            <li>The brush heads are easy to rotate, remove, clean and replace.</li>
            <li>risk free.  </li>
            <li>The spot therapy brush for the body is fantastic.</li>
            <li>After five months, my skin texture is baby smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li>it is only $26 for a great face exfoliation Device</li>
            <li>No problems and enjoy the fresher feeling it provides.</li>
            <li>They confirmed the order, but they never even charged my card.  </li>
            <li>I have reported this to Amazon and they confirmed that the ad should not promise that there are products in stock.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need more than one speed, it would be more compact, cheaper, and I find I&#x27;m not using the body brush anyway.</li>
            <li>Right now, that is the most powerful, most convenient Clarisonc.  </li>
            <li>To really benefit from it, you need to find the right cleanser, and post treatment, good quality products that work for your skin and address your issues.  </li>
            <li>and I always use a cetaphil moisturizer right after, to make sure my skin is hydrated.  </li>
            <li>until I stopped using this awesome little machine!</li>
            <li>Make sure to dry the brushes fairly well, as bacteria does develop.  </li>
            <li>When using, I make sure to wash my face first, then follow with the Clarisonic Brush.</li>
            <li>On top of this, you can tell someone&#x27;s handled the product before - the packaging was pretty sketchy.    </li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>Not that user friendly.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s fun!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually review items but felt compelled to log on to share my great experience!</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and this has significantly helped my complexion.  </li>
            <li>She loves it, and her friends can tell obviously her skin gets fine and fair in just 2 weeks after continuous usage.  </li>
            <li>for the cheeks to give a new brightness; softness and amazing clean to your face.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean, and it&#x27;s the softest its been in ages.</li>
            <li>After use, I also take the time to clean my Clarisonic brush(and</li>
            <li>I am now able to use primers more frequently -</li>
            <li>I usually clean my face for 2-3 cycles of the face cleaning (i.e., I go over my face 2-3 times) because the face cleaning is on a timer and shuts off.  </li>
            <li>If it does, then take the brush off the machine after each use to clean it out - or it will cause build up.</li>
            <li>I use it at night when I remember to clean my face.</li>
            <li>no matter how well you clean</li>
            <li>AND I actually wash my face more often because I can feel how effective it is.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how nice and comfortable it feels on the face.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best product on the market for facial cleaning.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean &amp; I get compliments on my skin all the time.</li>
            <li>The Clarisonic is a great product that leaves your skin feeling soft and very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It keeps pores clean and</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it will clean batter &amp; minimize pores....</li>
            <li>My face is totally clean.</li>
            <li>This is a good product (overpriced in my opinion) for many people and does clean the skin well, if you&#x27;re careful and don&#x27;t overuse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, it feels fresh, it feels clean.</li>
            <li>Dermatologist haven&#x27;t been able to do much for my skin, even after spending money on medicinal creams.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the various Sonicare toothbrushes for years and loved the results, which is what attracted me to the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>I love my Clarisonic so much that I went in on this one for my sister with her husband for her birthday.</li>
            <li>She has been enjoying it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I love the Spot Therapy Kit as well and would highly recommend it to everyone!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Clarisonic PRO Deluxe Professional 4-Speed Skin Care System for about a month now</li>
            <li>Does not come with a travel bag, but there is a Spot Therapy Kit on sale for $50, which includes the Spot body brush head, exfoliating Clarisonic Body Polish (6 oz, full size), and a travel bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really does help products penetrate more efficiently.</li>
            <li>It really helps cleanse and leaves your face feeling smooth!</li>
            <li>and I saved so much I was able to get over the guilt.</li>
            <li>I love the timer and the wand for getting your whole body.</li>
            <li>A GOOD eye creame (Swiss Ultimate Serum,) face creame, neck creame (MD-Direct Serum soon to be sold on Amazon.)</li>
            <li>I was able to register my brush on the Calrisonic website and have read some reviews here that said they could not get service for the battery ect because they did not have a real clarisonic item.  </li>
            <li>a full charge Will not be enough for a good face exfoliation or the body for this matter  </li>
            <li>In maybe the most surprising result my husband, who previously had no interest in his looks whatsoever, sometimes uses it, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As for the product, I was glad to get it in the mail &amp; experienced facial relief at first for the first nice facial.</li>
            <li>I received the brush very quickly and it was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I always used to wash my face regularly with my hands and very nice soap for skin, but this definitely works better not to mention I get compliments on my skin all the time now because of how smooth it looks.</li>
            <li>Within 3 months I will be done with acne altogether, but my clarisonic will keep my skin fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>I bought this unit because this company was the only one that says they are selling the 2009 model, and I wanted to be sure I got the latest technology.  </li>
            <li>every year, I want to make sure I get the most of them by having the cleanest skin possible.     </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t take quick showers</li>
            <li>Oh, but be warned the battery can run out quickly</li>
            <li>But overall, the battery issues aside, I love, love this product.</li>
            <li>however, saw almost immediate improvement in their skin texture and clearing of skin.surprised that worked so quickly and did not traumatize skin</li>
            <li>but from my own perspective the one major drawback I find on the unit is that the power supply unit is not detachable from the charging cradle stand.</li>
            <li>Their customer service rep told me they are very aware of this problem, but can&#x27;t do anythning to help me.  </li>
            <li>I felt my skin before I used the product, pretty darn smooth.</li>
            <li>I just know that the very first time that I used it, my skin felt SMOOTHER, SOFTER and it literally had that &#x27;glow&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with the entire purchase and would recommend this product without reservation.</li>
            <li>Thinking that I could use \\&quot;normal people\\&quot; skin care products, I bought this based on the rave reviews, looking to just boost a healthy glow, exfoliate, etc.  </li>
            <li>I KNOW for sure now that I am effectively using the whole amount of the facial wash that I&#x27;m pouring.</li>
            <li>The charge stays good for quite a long while, so I don&#x27;t have to take the charger</li>
            <li>The charging cradle makes it easy to store and charge, which is very convenient.</li>
            <li>You could actually use your own mild cleanser for the face or mild \\&quot;bead\\&quot; type body cleanser.</li>
            <li>My large pores seemed to disappear and smooth out combined with a moisturizer afterward.</li>
            <li>They were very nice, asked for my name (I was already in the system from the previous replacement) and the serial # on the handle.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, it helps to clean my skin so much better than hand washing and seems to have helped my acne breakouts calm down a bit.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Clarisonic is a bit pricy but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Turns out all that has been said about the product is pretty much true.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The product gives a man&#x27;s face a fresh look and feel after shaving.</li>
            <li>If you have the money to blow, it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, if you have extremely sensitive skin, this product may hurt your skin more than it helps.  </li>
            <li>and so far I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have the Pro Deluxe version which comes with 3 various levels / speeds for the face and 1 for the body.  </li>
            <li>I always used it on freshly cleansed skin-</li>
            <li>I wanted to see what this thing could do, and it&#x27;s definetly powerful.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been pleased with the results so far.  </li>
            <li>I use it twice daily on my face and neck with my own cleanser (noevir).   </li>
            <li>I would have liked to got the one with the various brushes, just to try them -</li>
            <li>The brushes come with caps, which are useful when attaching and detaching from the unit; I suppose they also serve a sanitary purpose.</li>
            <li>I think the reason is that I didn&#x27;t use the facial wash that came with the device; I kept using my own (Paula&#x27;s Choice)</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money -</li>
            <li>This is worth having for me</li>
            <li>This was by far the most extravagant item I have ever purchased for myself</li>
            <li>Another thing I noticed was the laugh lines started to fade.</li>
            <li>Only the bravest of women should dare own a magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li>3 days later she unwrapped it and was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s where the smile stopped.  </li>
            <li>Based on their prompt &amp; very positive response I would purchase product from them again.  </li>
            <li>I suspect that the fine little laugh lines are partly more prominent due to the dry skin from the excellent exfoliation this gadget delivers.</li>
            <li>i have been made fun of my whole life with people telling me to clean my face...</li>
            <li>The brush will get your skin VERY  clean and really clear out your pores.</li>
            <li>There are two buttons, one to turn it on/off, and the other is good for the speeds.</li>
            <li>I just turned 60 and have noticed quite a difference in my skin - a positive difference!</li>
            <li>Also within a week my husband got really close, peered at my face and said, \\&quot;Your skin looks really clean.</li>
            <li>I have tried the 2 main cheap ones neutrogena and Oil of Olay&#x27;s rotating brush</li>
            <li>The place where I bought it from (on Amazon) was nice enough to include a complimentary Skin Polisher (large size) with it.</li>
            <li>I got this before my wedding so that I would have a lovely fresh face without having to go get facials every week in the months leading up to the big day, and it was totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>I recommend you use your own cleansers (as long as it doesn&#x27;t have exfoliants in it.</li>
            <li>I have now been using the new one for well over six months, and it works fabulously.  </li>
            <li>You get mild exfoliation, too, though I still exfoliate 1-2 times per week separately (with Origins Modern Friction).</li>
            <li>easy to handle, not heavy.</li>
            <li>This device is gentle yet effective as a facial and spot treatment cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I used a very gentle cleanser with it, one you can buy at the drug store.  </li>
            <li>I wish there were larger facial brushes sold though, the size given &amp; sold is good, but it&#x27;d be nice to have a facial brush the size of the body brush.  </li>
            <li>After the inital breakouts, I didn&#x27;t really notice that my complexion improved significantly, but my products do work better, which has led to better skin of late.  </li>
            <li>They told me the retailer that sold it to me wasn&#x27;t legitimate, yet it uses their brush heads, it came in their exact packaging, and has a registration number stamped on the bottom.  </li>
            <li>I contacted the retailer and they confirmed that this unit was purchased DIRECTLY from Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>Clarisonic - if you&#x27;re aware of this, why won&#x27;t you fix it???  </li>
            <li>I bought the first Clarisonic Pro</li>
            <li>Gently but thoroughly cleans the face and leaves skin glowing!.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately not the case.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to getting facial treatments at the spa, and this product makes all the difference in giving my skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>&quot; being used on many of the adds on Amazon and such.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it a try over the next week and review more.  </li>
            <li>Sonic brush worth the money it really works.</li>
            <li>This product is really life-changing!  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>My children, hubby and family come first)</li>
            <li>in retrospect, it makes more sense to use nicer products since they&#x27;re actually going to making a difference.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had more facial brushes</li>
            <li>I still get monthly facials, but the Clarisonic is an effective tool for everyday use, like a mini facial in the privacy of my own home.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love my Clarisonic brush and definitely recommend it to friends and family!ation</li>
            <li>I still get monthly facials, but the Clarisonic is an effective tool for everyday use, like a mini facial in the privacy of my own home.  </li>
            <li>I have used my Clarisonic daily for two months now and love the way it makes my face feel.  </li>
            <li>that is a first not receiving an invoice/receipt with an order.</li>
            <li>I have always used a healthy skin care regimen and the Clarisonic only adds to that.</li>
            <li>After I first bought it, though, my charger stopped working after about 3 or 4 months.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty squat.</li>
            <li>Any cleanser works, and I am using the deep pore cleansing brush for my face - Love the body brush in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I dropped the first three times and it broke.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to finally purchase it.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; model does have four speeds, which I love and has a beep/pause for facial cleansing so that you don&#x27;t overdo it.</li>
            <li>now i use Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System   </li>
            <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]  </li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>At first, as with anything, I started to break out.  </li>
            <li>I will never be able to go back to hand cleansing.</li>
            <li>So we plugged it back into the charger and after another 24 hours she was finally able to use it.  </li>
            <li>, The Mister......great item to feed the skin on those hot summer days</li>
            <li>so most likely don&#x27;t need to order one separate.</li>
            <li>Many of her colleagues now have purchased the same device.  </li>
            <li>I loved the unit when it worked, but now it is completely dead and Clarisonic won&#x27;t fix it since it was purchased through Amazon, who is a \\&quot;non-authorized\\&quot; retailer.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard of a few others, and maybe they&#x27;re as good without the hefty price tag- who knows.  </li>
            <li>Also a few coupons good for purchases made from the Clarisonic website.</li>
            <li>so much so that I ordered one right away</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I routinely exfoliated my face, I&#x27;d never used anything like this, and it certainly does pack a punch on a full charge at high speed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning to switch to all natural products soon, though, rich in Vitamin E.    </li>
            <li>I can see that my pores are clean and it feels like my facial products, like moisturizers, can work more effectively now.&lt;br /&gt;+ 3-Minute timer for your body, so I will focus on one part of the body each day, or use it multiple times in one long shower.</li>
            <li>Without sounding like a commercial, ladies, this item is TOTALLY worth treating yourself for!!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not at all drying since you are essentially using your own cleansers and this &#x27;sonic&#x27; cleansing action.    </li>
            <li>I think the motion of the brush (vibrates really fast, doesn&#x27;t spin), has a tendency to push sloughing skin back into the pores, leading to more breakouts and in my case, some cystic acne.  </li>
            <li>I actually have had very oily, acne-prone skin most of my life.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m showing good results after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;Appears to be very durable.</li>
            <li>Used for 6 weeks saw no difference in my skin-did see a few more light wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I wanted this for a long time before I was finally able and willing to spend the cash to get this brush</li>
            <li>I had to scale back my every day use of 10% glycolic acid toner to twice a week, and switch to a much lighter moisturizing cream while getting better results (and saving some money).</li>
            <li>I might add that I am using a good face soap like dermilogica, tea tree green tea, Dr Brandt that I have used with just a face cloth and have seen much improved results.  </li>
            <li>My face was so much softer after the  first use.  </li>
            <li>Skin is much smother even after first use.</li>
            <li>I will say that any downside if there is any is that the Pro Deluxe version is a bit bulky to hold...a really petite woman, young pre-teen or something with arthritic hands would most likely prefer the smaller Mia or Classic versions instead.  </li>
            <li>It really makes my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li>and it has really helped keep my skin clear and clean.</li>
            <li>Pump Bottle]] and the gentle sonic brush help keep my skin clean, clear and flake-free.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had a good complection with very few breakouts.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels fresh and new.  </li>
            <li>so it becomes part of your daily routine quite easily.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to change the brush -which makes it possible for you to share the device with someone.  </li>
            <li>Having the different speeds and the beeps make it v easy.  </li>
            <li>For the past 3 years I have experienced continual breakouts, sores and whitheads that never seemed to clear up.</li>
            <li>It is a good device when it works, but who knows how long anything last anymore.</li>
            <li>The other part of why is, it is a good product, but you get the feeling that even a better level can be obtained in a stronger, durable, lasting, facial machine.  </li>
            <li>It certainly does not hold a charge like a Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>To buy this is to invest in yourself and you certainly deserve it.</li>
            <li>She suggested I buy a new one!!  </li>
            <li>I put it back in the charger, make sure it is making full contact with the charger, and the next day it will work.  </li>
            <li>Not only is this unit great for my skin, but I find I use much less cleanser making it a money saver as well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Sorry this is so long... hope it helped!! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a skin care routine and recently I&#x27;ve noticed fine lines around my eyes and decided to start.</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller, face is cleaner, fine lines are softer.  </li>
            <li>The sonic action is exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>The next morning I woke up with two HUGE pimples on my cheek and one on my chin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely furious with Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try it, when I found out how much it cost...</li>
            <li>My acne scars haven&#x27;t diminished that much, but the Clarisonic can&#x27;t do it all.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I REALLY like it, as well as the results.  </li>
            <li>I am getting the regular brush, I think the one that came with it is not quite enough for me, but overall I have discovered a really wonderful tool for my skin and can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li>No matter how expensive/cheap/raved about cleanser I&#x27;ve used, nothing really cleaned my face.</li>
            <li>VERY</li>
            <li>I was hesitant and kinda scoffed at the idea that a rotating brush could do much for me.</li>
            <li>It really buffed away some spots that had raised bumps before.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think I need this product.</li>
            <li>This is what really hit me.</li>
            <li>This is what really hit me.</li>
            <li>Thanks.          </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t convinced a cleansing system should cost so much</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care much for it.</li>
            <li>My husband looked at me one day and said, \\&quot;Your skin really looks</li>
            <li>The unit is quiet and smooth.  </li>
            <li>no charger to clutter up your counter, can go in the shower and is lighter than the Clarisonic, but not quite as smooth or quiet.  </li>
            <li>I have also noticed my blemishes heal about three times as fast as they did before.</li>
            <li>This has also helped reduce my blackheads, and I don&#x27;t break out as much since I&#x27;ve been using my Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>My face feels so much smoother and cleaner when I use it.  </li>
            <li>Very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Kelly</li>
            <li>actually really like the Clarisonic Pro.  </li>
            <li>But can you really put a price on your skin??</li>
            <li>But can you really put a price on your skin??</li>
            <li>The scrubbing is not abrasive at all - its very therapeutic and relaxing.</li>
            <li>It gently vibrates and massages the face while giving it a very thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li>She indicated it was what she really wanted.  </li>
            <li>No receipt came with the order, although it arrived in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>ZeoForce is one of the neatest internal detoxifying powdered clays, but when used as a facial after wetting the brush of the Clarisonic, there is a very refined noticeable nice affect on your face/neck.</li>
            <li>it won&#x27;t consume the battery fast)....</li>
            <li>The price is a bit high!  </li>
            <li>Very convenient for face.</li>
            <li>I really missed the great&lt;br</li>
            <li>Your&lt;br /&gt;Foundation goes on so much nicer and doesn&#x27;t cake up any where.</li>
            <li>But it cleans really well</li>
            <li>and I really like the Clarisonic cleansers it came with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really noticed improved softness/smoothness on my arms,legs,</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can be used every day since it is so gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>If you do not buy straight from Clarisonic or authorized dealer, you are out of your money if something happens to your unit.</li>
            <li>I have found that I need to be more careful of what I put on my skin now, as using the Clarisonic</li>
            <li>it is much batter in exfoliation   </li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything as described thank you for the fast turnover and delivery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit rough and if you want a softer brush you would have to purchase one for twenty five dollars on the company&#x27;s website (which is more money you have to spend).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care much for the products that come with the unit.</li>
            <li>I use it once to twice per day, depending on my activities and how much make-up I am wearing.</li>
            <li>There is really nothing like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Always use a liquid gentlewash soap (CeraVe works very well.)</li>
            <li>It keeps your skin from going into overdrive to rehydrate itself and producing way too much oil.  </li>
            <li>I really like the &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; feeling you get after using this product.  </li>
            <li>I love what this product does for my skin, however for the price I expected it to be a \\&quot;lifetime\\&quot; (5-10 years) product.  </li>
            <li>At this point I figured well maybe I don&#x27;t really need to buy another one</li>
            <li>I purchased my white Clarisonic PRO Deluxe Professional 4-Speed Skin Care System with Spot Therapy Kit five (5) months ago directly from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush and would not come back to my old way of cleaning my face.  </li>
            <li>I received the Clarisonic Pro Deluxe but missing the Skin Care System w/ Spot Therapy Kit.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the Clarisonic feels like a nice facial massage, but needs to cover a larger facial/neck area.</li>
            <li>With this simple engineering change, it would take 30 minutes to charge, and would run for far more than the 30 minutes you get out of NiMH</li>
            <li>I am 45 years old, have good skin yet getting adult acne due to bio-identical hormones (highly recommend!)  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to order this product for what seemed like such a bargain - and I assumed ordering from Amazon it was reliable.    </li>
            <li>I saw WAY better results using Neutrogena products, than I did using other products.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this latest replacement for almost 2 months with no problems, but the 3-4 month mark is where I had problems on the other 2.</li>
            <li>I tried numerous solutions that never made any significant changes.  </li>
            <li>I use it nightly and you get an entirely differnent level of clean with brush than you do with washing your face with your hands...</li>
            <li>Plus my face didn&#x27;t necessarily feel clean after the Neutrogena brush, so I stopped using it.    </li>
            <li>I do like the way it makes my face extra clean</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean, and it helped with some of the flaking, but I noticed some cystic acne issues that I hadn&#x27;t had prior to using this.  </li>
            <li>You only think your skin is clean now, but once you use Clarisonic your skin changes.</li>
            <li>Nice design, it&#x27;s not hard to hold it or too heavy to carry it.  </li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, they sent me a whole new unit, because the one I bought was out of production.  </li>
            <li>Comes with plastic covers/caps, one for the facial brush head and another one for the spot body brush head, which are handy when traveling or trying to dry the brush heads.</li>
            <li>less breakouts and much smoother, with better appearance of makeup.  </li>
            <li>Gets my face super clean in less time.</li>
            <li>They told me that my brush had a full 3-YEAR warranty (that all brushes purchased in 2010 were protected one-year longer than the standard 2-year warranty).  </li>
            <li>They immediately sent me out a FULL replacement via UPS and a pre-paid UPS label to send my defective one back.  </li>
            <li>It makes any skin surface so smooth that I seriously want my whole body this smooth and soft!!!  </li>
            <li>1 minute on the face twice daily and several minutes in the shower on the full body makes a huge difference to this old ladies skin.</li>
            <li>I only use once a day due to skin sensitivity but overall great</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments, my skin is refreshed, it takes less product (lotion, makeup, ect) on my face</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m in my 20s, my skin has a bit less acne and a bit more dryness.</li>
            <li>But there is a better way to exfoliate your skin for a lot less money.</li>
            <li>I wash my skin twice a day, and never get the squeaky-clean feeling I do, except when using a Clarisonic -- even when following with the handy cotton ball wet with toners or astringents.  </li>
            <li>My delicate skin has cleared up a great deal, but I still have the occasional pimple here and there.</li>
            <li>I noticed that initially it made the acne more obvious.  </li>
            <li>I found that my Elizabeth Arden cleanser worked much better with it however, so now I try to stick with that even though it&#x27;s more expensive.  </li>
            <li>This product is meant to really exfoliate your skin, so your products aren&#x27;t just sitting on top of dead skin cells-</li>
            <li>Overall, I love my Clarisonic brush and definitely recommend it to friends and family!</li>
            <li>Using this device daily on my face, and once or twice a week on my body, has improved my skin tremendously...</li>
            <li>Love the body brush head and the handle to reach the middle of my back where I can never quite reach otherwise!</li>
            <li>(if yours is lucky enough to run at all!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it, although I don&#x27;t care for the washes that came with the kit.</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend both products.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for it to help me stop breaking out, but it has not made a bit of change to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the brush.</li>
            <li>If your thinking about getting it I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>so other family members could have their own individual brushes to use with the one Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the Clarisonic supports enough power to affect a larger area of your face for a purposeful facial massage or not, but that kind of a machine would be nice.</li>
            <li>When it starts, there&#x27;s a cute little \\&quot;beep-beep-beep\\&quot; to know it&#x27;s about to begin.</li>
            <li>Yeh, my skin is silky smooth awesome, but it only lasts for a few days, then I feel a few dry spots here and there.</li>
            <li>Yeh, my skin is silky smooth awesome, but it only lasts for a few days, then I feel a few dry spots here and there.</li>
            <li>What I love about it is that even after using various exfoliants on my face, they sometimes are a bit too harsh or at other times, not as effective as I&#x27;d like them to be</li>
            <li>First of all this system is easy enough to use every single day twice a day.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so much smoother and feels so soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is worth $225, but I haven&#x27;t found anything else that delivers the same results.  </li>
            <li>When I was first debating over this product, I was on the fence about forking out so much money for it, but after hundreds of rave reviews from users on Sephora, here, and my personal friends, I decided to give it a try.      </li>
            <li>I could&#x27;ve bought the Mia and used the normal brush head on my body.  </li>
            <li>Clarisonic themselves even suggest that the normal brush head can be used below the neck on their brush head manual.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t improve scars or discoloration on its own, at least it didn&#x27;t for me, but if you combine its use with a lightening agent, then you&#x27;ll see results quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>exactly the opposite of what you are trying to do by spending this much on a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, at stores like Sephora there&#x27;s a bigger selection of trial cleansers included with the Clarisonic instead of just Clarisonic brand cleansers (I recently saw a Josie Maran set with a super cute pink travel bag!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>mid-30&#x27;s fine wrinkles, combo skin to the extreme, acne, flaking, oily patches, some discoloration...</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m pleased with the results after less than a week.    </li>
            <li>No idea how the brush itself works, I&#x27;m sending it right back.  </li>
            <li>The other huge benefit is</li>
            <li>I returned it and it was replaced with a brand new one.  </li>
            <li>well, lets chalk that up to my new Clairsonic-induced need to peer into a magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li>I am 30 years old, and I am very skin conscious since I live in the desert.</li>
            <li>Within a week, I saw a HUGE reduction in not only outbreaks, but oil production, pore size and overall skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and my pores are almost invisible and I used to have kind of big looking pores.  </li>
            <li>I have been wanting a Clarisonic for soooo long but really didn&#x27;t want to invest this type of money without really knowing if it worked and I have to say YES!  </li>
            <li>I was very busy with two babies at the time,</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive</li>
            <li>A month went by without my handy little tool and let me tell you ladies out there, my skin went from being smooth and actually very radiant to dull and sandpaperish feeling!</li>
            <li>no matter how old or young you are!!</li>
            <li>My acne has cleared up by 85 percent (crosses fingers hoping this stays the same ;).</li>
            <li>My face looks so different since the first use.</li>
            <li>My skin is exactly the same since I started using it.  </li>
            <li>This was really only an issue for the first month</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;ve had that issue with many rechargable items in the past.  </li>
            <li>a quality product.e had that issue with many rechargable items in the past.  </li>
            <li>Many tiny bumps have gone away or grown smaller and the skin on my neck has a younger texture.</li>
            <li>However, do be mindful of what you put on your skin AFTER you use this brush, since as I mentioned your pores will be pretty open</li>
            <li>The body brush is so relaxing and has my skin sooo soft!</li>
            <li>It took forever to resolve itself and I&#x27;m still dealing with the pigmentation from it even though the rest of my face looks marvelous :(.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time &amp; so worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent $ at spas doing a full body scrub.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent $ at spas doing a full body scrub.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother, less oily and the facial products I use are accepted so much better than before.  </li>
            <li>Most of the literature in the box refers to make-up and using the brushes on your decolletage--as though only half the planet is their market.</li>
            <li>It also held a charge for a few days, making it fine for weekends</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in fine lines, and only minimal improvement in elasticity.  </li>
            <li>Great product, infuriating service.</li>
            <li>It always felt like there was a still huge layer of dead skin.</li>
            <li>Again, no miracles, but clearly nicer looking skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so clear &amp; smooth!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>being said, I&#x27;ll now explain that a clean pore is less noticable than a clogged one.</li>
            <li>and this is gentle enough to use frequently and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>So far, I like my Clarisonic Pro.</li>
            <li>Now, as an adult, I&#x27;m dealing with eczema and adult acne.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time calling their service department.  </li>
            <li>On occasion they sell this set on Groupon and Livingsocial at a considerable discount (for about $60).  </li>
            <li>after I used the product - wow, it made my before skin feel like sand paper.</li>
            <li>I was thinking a real mask might be my only option.</li>
            <li>i couldn&#x27;t believe that scrubbing didn&#x27;t work but a simple brush could remove so much.</li>
            <li>This product removes my make up completely.  </li>
            <li>I also moved the wand around a lot, in addition to the pulsating action, so I have no doubt that I was adding to the irritation.  </li>
            <li>professional recommended the Clairisonic Skin Care system</li>
            <li>Please note that Clarisonic sells the \\&quot;Plus\\&quot; version, which is 3-speeds, since the \\&quot;Pro\\&quot; version with 4-speeds is supposed to be used by professional.</li>

            <li>I am 25 years old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just really improved the texture and overall look of my skin.    </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think I needed this product until after I had a facial during vacation.  </li>
            <li>My only regret is that I wish I would have bought it much sooner.</li>
            <li>Within 2 weeks of using the Clarisonic Pro my face has almost totally cleared up and feels so much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>, Skin Care Investments does not have ANY stock of the Clarisonic Pro, so do not waste you Christmas shopping money.  </li>
            <li>My pores are smaller, my skin is smoother and more firm.  </li>
            <li>Ive been using it for a few weeks only so am expecting more longterm results</li>
            <li>As I mentioned, my skin is not sensitive at all, so I was surprised after my first use that the brush felt too abrasive on my skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had no charging issues, and a single overnight charge will last me a full week.  </li>
            <li>(minus one problem right eyebrow</li>
            <li>The brush head does not seem to dry overnight, so make sure to tilt or face it down to drain the water.</li>
            <li>- The brush head does not seem to dry overnight, so make sure to tilt or face it down to drain the water.</li>
            <li>I saw the Youtube video after I had spent hundreds of dollars on the brush when I realized I just as easily could have had the same results and for only $5-$10 dollars.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I purchased it, although I was wary of the price at first glance.  </li>
            <li>The retail price of $225 is pricey, so I bought my first one on eBay which included extra brush heads, but now Amazon is offering it at a competitive price, so I plan on buying a second one to keep at my boyfriend&#x27;s place.</li>

            <li>I discontinued use after 1-2 weeks, and my skin has continued to break out to such an extent that I think I have to go back to the dermatologist for the first time in 10 years.  </li>
            <li>Even an acne scar I had on my nose since high school in the seventies started to get smaller as well.</li>
            <li>The handle is large- but not overly large or heavy for that matter.</li>
            <li>Cleanses pores deeply, removing old sebum, dead skin and bacteria; skin feels invigorated and smooth.</li>
            <li>First impression, the box was partially opened.</li>
            <li>&gt; As far as the heads go, they last a pretty decent amount of time and I am still on the fence if I will buy any on Amazon, I read way too many reviews of the items being fake and if I have a problem after I buy them from Sephora I can take them back no questions asked.  </li>
            <li>but this Clairsonic gives me the effect of a gentle exfoliator - not too much and not too little and unlike some exfoliators</li>
            <li>Now, two months later I couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>this after less than a week&#x27;s worth of use.    </li>
            <li>helped so much with those deep pimples, skin is no longer flakey and it has actually tightened the skin beneath my jaw line....</li>
            <li>I could not believe how much makeup was left on my face after traditional cleaning until I started using the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>, so it&#x27;s not easy to wrap up for traveling.  - Does not come with a travel bag, but there is a Spot Therapy Kit on sale for $50, which includes the Spot body brush head, exfoliating Clarisonic Body Polish (6 oz, full size), and a travel bag.  </li>
            <li>Basically, they are admitting that there is a major problem with the charger.    </li>
            <li>After first use, my pores were smaller, skin smoother, looked 5 years younger instantly.  </li>
            <li>Combined with the tanda red light, it&#x27;s cutting edge, medcially sound skin care.  </li>
            <li>I would steer clear if you have ever had problems with acne, even if you are currently not breaking out.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on other shops, but this one I purchased is a genuine product, we have compared with the other devices we purchase from the official Clarisonic website.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to help clear up the skin on my face and back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only given it three stars so far, but if it continues to perform, my rating will raise.</li>
            <li>My problem red areas (my mouth and nose) have completely healed.</li>
            <li>This Clarisonic Pro is only about 4 months old.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different types of brushes and exfoliants, but my skin just wasn&#x27;t baby soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different types of brushes and exfoliants, but my skin just wasn&#x27;t baby soft.</li>
            <li>Now that my skin is exfoliated by the Clarisonic, my skin is smoother and my makeup goes on much easier without emphasizing a lot of rough areas of skin.  </li>
            <li>After reading on makeupalley about different brush heads, I came to the conclusion that a lot of people switch from the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; brush head that comes with the kit to &amp;#34;delicate,&amp;#34; even people that don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only done this twice with the Clarisonic so far</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than any other skincare brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>but you can use other cleansers and it really will work just as well, may be some trial and error there to find what you like.</li>
            <li>After I clean off my foundation make up, I rinse the brush head, wash it for a few seconds with hand soap, and then leave it out to dry.</li>
            <li>: The body brush is really soft like the facial brush, to me it just seems like it&#x27;s bigger</li>
            <li>Despite treatments with antibiotics and topical medicines, i didn&#x27;t see a major improvement until my aesthetician introduced me to revaleskin products, and the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>Also, the brush head fits tighter and is a little more difficult to taken on/off (nothing out of the ordinary, but definitely not a loose/easy fit like the first 2).</li>
            <li>The best thing u can buy for ur face , no more pimbles no more rough skin , no more oily skin , i use it twice a day</li>
            <li>At first my skin did appear dry and rough for about two weeks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched to the lowest speed possible and use it lightly &amp; avoid pressing it too hard into my skin to avoid wrinkling and breaking down the facial muscles too much.</li>
            <li>my husband and i laugh because i never knew that for the past 16 years i never looked at my face in the mirror anymore</li>
            <li>My pores were less visible, my skin was much softer and my face seemed brighter.</li>
            <li>Acne, adult acne, oily, dry, patchy.</li>
            <li>I use it every other day on the normal speed.</li>
            <li>I use it every other day on the normal speed.</li>
            <li>it is a good purchase  but the Clarisonic purchase was a bad choice</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until my unit stop working that I realized just how good my skin was.</li>

            <li> This is a very reputable retailer and I have never had problems with them before.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the results from this product.</li>

            <li> I LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> not use the Clarisonic longer than recommended, especially at first!</li>
            <li> Now with just days of using it again my skin is looking much better!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I did not have any amazing changes in my skin</li>
            <li> Although this product is AMAZING for me-</li>
            <li> Amazing skin care product.</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic makes a good product to have the ability to better penetrate the skin and to raise its power to maximum.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, with the EXCELLENT customer service and GREAT results, I give this product 5 STARS.  </li>
            <li> and I am loving the system.  </li>
            <li> I could&#x27;ve had a nice pair of shoes instead.</li>
            <li> In fact, I got one for my mom the week after I got my own.    </li>
            <li> but there is no reason why you can&#x27;t use your own body polishers / body exfoliators and cleansers.    </li>
            <li> Both of those were junk, honestly.  </li>
            <li> An effective device for efficient and thorough face cleansing.  </li>
            <li> liked it</li>
            <li> Facials just feel good, &amp; I know they can feel even better.  </li>
            <li> A Clarisonic Pro Deluxe was ordered in mid-December and never arrived.</li>
            <li> My husband has his own brush head</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use (or try) the products though, I used my own.</li>
            <li> good luck :)</li>
            <li> To be honest, I wish I had gone that route, as 4 speeds are overkill.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, just get a nice exfoliant like Philosophy&#x27;s Microdelivery.</li>
            <li> I use my own concoction of oils (castor, grape seed, jojoba, lavender), rub it on my face, then run the deep-pore brush over my face on the lowest setting for one minute.</li>
            <li> So if you buy it from an authorized dealer you will pay more but the warranty of 2 to 3 years depending on the type of Clarisonic you buy, will be good</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that I think it was worth every cent!  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and your skin will feel so clean and exfoliated.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin, great at all modes of the machine</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin, great at all modes of the machine</li>
            <li> You know the old saying when the wife is happy we are both happy</li>
            <li> My skin has a nice rosy glow after using and moisturizer seems to go on more nicely as well as make-up.</li>
            <li> So, finding a good face cleanser for your skin type is definitely key to seeing the best results with the Clarisonic.    </li>
            <li> I am so happy with my purchase and would tell all women this  is worth the money for maintaining and improving your face.</li>
            <li> and it is sooo easy!</li>
            <li> Initally experienced misunderstanding with seller wrt product; however, the seller was great at promptly resolving the problem...would definitely use this seller again.</li>
            <li> Impressed with the quality of Clarisonic Pro; have only used it three times, but feel that it will be extremely effective.</li>
            <li> applying make up , and once if im not applying make up , before bed time , it leaves my skin glowing and smooth LOVE IT !</li>
            <li> but I love it.  </li>
            <li> that after cleansing with the Clarisonic your skin care products sink in to your skin SO much better, and you&#x27;ll find them having even better benefits over time.</li>
            <li> I love to use my Clarisonic with Origins Checks &amp; Balances frothy cleanser.</li>
            <li> but it was working to take off that top layer...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it will work just as well.</li>
            <li> Why am I paying more for a Spot Therapy Kit I don&#x27;t get, Amazon?    </li>
            <li> And, yes, Clarisonic has the same EXCELLENT customer service as Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> The better the face cleanser for your skin type,</li>
            <li> the better the results.  </li>
            <li> GLAD</li>
            <li> but the girl friend&#x27;s elatedand that more than makes up for it.</li>
            <li> I really love it, no problems or complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Revaleskin Night Cream with Coffeeberry 1.7 oz]] makes sure the effect lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> And to top it off.</li>
            <li> You get a better body scrub with the \\&quot;Scrub</li>
            <li> Gloves\\&quot; you can find in most any store.</li>
            <li> My clarisonic is under the cabinet, I wish I had done better homework on my purchase.  </li>
            <li> While I do think it does an excellent job of cleaning my skin, and my skin definitely feels cleaner</li>
            <li> barely touching them would squeeze that oil out..</li>
            <li> That said I think my skin texture and tone look much better.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford to buy more of these units.  </li>
            <li> Love the ease of changing the brush heads.</li>
            <li> My skin never looked and felt better.</li>
            <li> and it just FEELS better</li>
            <li> I truly love this product.  </li>
            <li> I am SOOO glad I did.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything it&#x27;s promised to be and more.</li>
            <li> I love the body brush.  </li>
            <li> i have used it for one week and it leaves your skin nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> One REQUEST that I&#x27;d love Clairsonic to consider is to make a wall mount charger...</li>
            <li> I hope that over time, I see more improvements in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Now I use a much lighter formula that works great.  </li>
            <li> In the end, I knew I&#x27;d always want a Clarisonic just based on the reviews, so perhaps it&#x27;s best that I went ahead and bit the bullet instead of spending the extra 100 dollars on something else, just to purchase this</li>
            <li> I love the clarisonic.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best gift I ever gave (above the diamonds</li>
            <li> she&#x27;ll love you for the results and for thinking of her in this way.</li>
            <li> I already have wrinkles and do not need any more.  </li>
            <li> I love that it can be used in the shower</li>
            <li> That having been said, I am sure there are many people who don&#x27;t have a problem with that, it probably just depends on your skin and how prone you are to breaking out.</li>
            <li> In any case, my skin never looks better than after using this brush followed by a good mask and favorite cream, it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> , I make sure to always store it on the charger</li>
            <li> Overall, my face is the best it has been in years!</li>
            <li> :)     </li>
            <li> Why I Love It:  </li>
            <li> Low battery warning would be awesome.</li>
            <li> Mostly in patches.</li>
            <li> this - my aging and acne-prone skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I love my clarisonic.</li>
            <li> WIth the Mia ,it just feels like something is vibrating on your skin but the Pro really scrubs the skin and is a great exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and have received compliments about how fresh and bright my skin is.  </li>
            <li> I took the risk and have had no problems and have been enjoying my Clarisonic for five months now.</li>
            <li> My Nu Skin Cleansers work even better with this.</li>
            <li> I have bought one for each of my daughters, and they love it too.  </li>
            <li> and I have used machine more than 1 week.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> As soon as most of the acne ceased to \\&quot;purge\\&quot;, I started using the Aria model.  </li>
            <li> I now use the pro (top of the line) and the Aria when out of town.  </li>
            <li> Also, make sure to replace the brushes every 60 uses.  </li>
            <li> Ebay sells the brushes for about $14-15 each, the best I&#x27;ve found and also sells larger supplies for sometimes cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love my clarisonic.</li>
            <li> LOVE the fact that it can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> I love the Clarisonic and am glad I decided to invest in it.</li>
            <li> Totally the best thing since sliced bread.</li>
            <li> but I truly get it why people love, love, love Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even better than I imagined.</li>
            <li> better.</li>
            <li> Your creams absorb better &amp; your skin has a glow.  </li>
            <li> How much better do you want it????  </li>
            <li> Also my face feels so smooth after using it!</li>
            <li> think most people that have had complaints on this item and the brush heads are not buying from Amazon or a supplier that fulfills Amazon&#x27;s orders.  </li>
            <li> Mostly by cleaning out the pores.  </li>
            <li> Leaves face very clean.  </li>
            <li> I am very blessed with good genes and my skin is in great condition at the tender age of 54, but I can not take all of the credit this machine REALLY MAKES A DIFFERNCE</li>
            <li> I love how it recharges easily and let&#x27;s me know when it is fully charged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this product on Amazon and was able to save money and get free shipping as well.</li>
            <li> So far, so good, and it kind of motivates me to stick to a regimen of cleaning, moisturizing, and sun protection.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a super cleaner, and you get a pretty great face massage as well.</li>
            <li> Large brush surface is another superior feature.</li>
            <li> But overall it is very good.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, is fast, and effective.  </li>
            <li> Men out there, PERSONALLY, I think a Clairsonic would make an AWESOME girly gift for that special lady in your life...</li>
            <li> the results have been amazing (and using Fresh&#x27;s Soy Cleanser).</li>
            <li> my serums and makeup go on much more smoothly</li>
            <li> The product works as described and seems to do a pretty good job of making sure the skin looks and feels fresh.    </li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product because I absolutely love my Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the brush for a couple months now, once a day after I wash my make-up off, the brush always takes off more make-up even though to me my skin already looks clean.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to fuss with anything, but this is as easy to use as shaving.</li>
            <li> Exchanging the face brush and body brush is so easy.</li>
            <li> So easy to use</li>
            <li> Product is easy to work.</li>
            <li> Easy to use,</li>
            <li> Charging it is so easy, just put it in the cradle.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks so much better and just feels clean.</li>
            <li> this would DEFINITELY be included on my top 10 - MAYBE even top 5 list!!</li>
            <li> so I happy the item I got was apparently legit.</li>
            <li> I use a really neat powdered clay product that give the best result of any facials I do with other nice products.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a decolletage that I know of, but this is an easy product for a man to use and see genuine results of a smoother healthier face.</li>
            <li> I even noticed that some of my fine lines seemed to have softened.  </li>
            <li> Supposedly they say that it cleans your face much more effectively and that serums such as vitamin C is absorbed into the skin much more effectively.</li>
            <li> Change the brush head as suggested, even if yours looks fine and feels fine, it&#x27;s going to breed bacteria</li>
            <li> If I had a list of my absolute favorite things, (material that is!</li>
            <li> The unit looks completely brand new and packaging was perfect.  </li>
            <li> To be honest the pro speed was much too strong for me, but it does have that</li>
            <li> Every day use is fine and not overly done, because the feel of the brush is smooth.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know if I saw any huge improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have seen a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge turn around in the quality of my skin.</li>
            <li> The package itself says \\&quot;available exclusively from your skin care</li>
            <li> The brushes feel light against the skin...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the Clarisonic cleaners that it comes with are all that fabulous.</li>
            <li> The design of the handle is ergonomic and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Skin Smooth.</li>
            <li> The design of the handle is ergonomic and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Skin Smooth.</li>
            <li> I am using the Clarisonic with Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant and am having great results.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m free...</li>
            <li> Looking foward to a smooth skintastic journey with it.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve read both descriptions, I can&#x27;t figure out what the real difference is between the Pro Deluxe model and the ______ model.  </li>
            <li> The brush heads are easy to rotate, remove, clean and replace.</li>
            <li> risk free.  </li>
            <li> The spot therapy brush for the body is fantastic.</li>
            <li> After five months, my skin texture is baby smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li> it is only $26 for a great face exfoliation Device</li>
            <li> No problems and enjoy the fresher feeling it provides.</li>
            <li> They confirmed the order, but they never even charged my card.  </li>
            <li> I have reported this to Amazon and they confirmed that the ad should not promise that there are products in stock.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need more than one speed, it would be more compact, cheaper, and I find I&#x27;m not using the body brush anyway.</li>
            <li> Right now, that is the most powerful, most convenient Clarisonc.  </li>
            <li> To really benefit from it, you need to find the right cleanser, and post treatment, good quality products that work for your skin and address your issues.  </li>
            <li> and I always use a cetaphil moisturizer right after, to make sure my skin is hydrated.  </li>
            <li> until I stopped using this awesome little machine!</li>
            <li> Make sure to dry the brushes fairly well, as bacteria does develop.  </li>
            <li> When using, I make sure to wash my face first, then follow with the Clarisonic Brush.</li>
            <li> On top of this, you can tell someone&#x27;s handled the product before - the packaging was pretty sketchy.    </li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> Not that user friendly.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s fun!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually review items but felt compelled to log on to share my great experience!</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and this has significantly helped my complexion.  </li>
            <li> She loves it, and her friends can tell obviously her skin gets fine and fair in just 2 weeks after continuous usage.  </li>
            <li> for the cheeks to give a new brightness; softness and amazing clean to your face.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean, and it&#x27;s the softest its been in ages.</li>
            <li> After use, I also take the time to clean my Clarisonic brush(and</li>
            <li> I am now able to use primers more frequently -</li>
            <li> I usually clean my face for 2-3 cycles of the face cleaning (i.e., I go over my face 2-3 times) because the face cleaning is on a timer and shuts off.  </li>
            <li> If it does, then take the brush off the machine after each use to clean it out - or it will cause build up.</li>
            <li> I use it at night when I remember to clean my face.</li>
            <li> no matter how well you clean</li>
            <li> AND I actually wash my face more often because I can feel how effective it is.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how nice and comfortable it feels on the face.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product on the market for facial cleaning.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so clean &amp; I get compliments on my skin all the time.</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic is a great product that leaves your skin feeling soft and very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It keeps pores clean and</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it will clean batter &amp; minimize pores....</li>
            <li> My face is totally clean.</li>
            <li> This is a good product (overpriced in my opinion) for many people and does clean the skin well, if you&#x27;re careful and don&#x27;t overuse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, it feels fresh, it feels clean.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist haven&#x27;t been able to do much for my skin, even after spending money on medicinal creams.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the various Sonicare toothbrushes for years and loved the results, which is what attracted me to the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> I love my Clarisonic so much that I went in on this one for my sister with her husband for her birthday.</li>
            <li> She has been enjoying it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I love the Spot Therapy Kit as well and would highly recommend it to everyone!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Clarisonic PRO Deluxe Professional 4-Speed Skin Care System for about a month now</li>
            <li> Does not come with a travel bag, but there is a Spot Therapy Kit on sale for $50, which includes the Spot body brush head, exfoliating Clarisonic Body Polish (6 oz, full size), and a travel bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really does help products penetrate more efficiently.</li>
            <li> It really helps cleanse and leaves your face feeling smooth!</li>
            <li> and I saved so much I was able to get over the guilt.</li>
            <li> I love the timer and the wand for getting your whole body.</li>
            <li> A GOOD eye creame (Swiss Ultimate Serum,) face creame, neck creame (MD-Direct Serum soon to be sold on Amazon.)</li>
            <li> I was able to register my brush on the Calrisonic website and have read some reviews here that said they could not get service for the battery ect because they did not have a real clarisonic item.  </li>
            <li> a full charge Will not be enough for a good face exfoliation or the body for this matter  </li>
            <li> In maybe the most surprising result my husband, who previously had no interest in his looks whatsoever, sometimes uses it, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As for the product, I was glad to get it in the mail &amp; experienced facial relief at first for the first nice facial.</li>
            <li> I received the brush very quickly and it was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I always used to wash my face regularly with my hands and very nice soap for skin, but this definitely works better not to mention I get compliments on my skin all the time now because of how smooth it looks.</li>
            <li> Within 3 months I will be done with acne altogether, but my clarisonic will keep my skin fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> I bought this unit because this company was the only one that says they are selling the 2009 model, and I wanted to be sure I got the latest technology.  </li>
            <li> every year, I want to make sure I get the most of them by having the cleanest skin possible.     </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t take quick showers</li>
            <li> Oh, but be warned the battery can run out quickly</li>
            <li> But overall, the battery issues aside, I love, love this product.</li>
            <li> however, saw almost immediate improvement in their skin texture and clearing of skin.surprised that worked so quickly and did not traumatize skin</li>
            <li> but from my own perspective the one major drawback I find on the unit is that the power supply unit is not detachable from the charging cradle stand.</li>
            <li> Their customer service rep told me they are very aware of this problem, but can&#x27;t do anythning to help me.  </li>
            <li> I felt my skin before I used the product, pretty darn smooth.</li>
            <li> I just know that the very first time that I used it, my skin felt SMOOTHER, SOFTER and it literally had that &#x27;glow&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the entire purchase and would recommend this product without reservation.</li>
            <li> Thinking that I could use \\&quot;normal people\\&quot; skin care products, I bought this based on the rave reviews, looking to just boost a healthy glow, exfoliate, etc.  </li>
            <li> I KNOW for sure now that I am effectively using the whole amount of the facial wash that I&#x27;m pouring.</li>
            <li> The charge stays good for quite a long while, so I don&#x27;t have to take the charger</li>
            <li> The charging cradle makes it easy to store and charge, which is very convenient.</li>
            <li> You could actually use your own mild cleanser for the face or mild \\&quot;bead\\&quot; type body cleanser.</li>
            <li> My large pores seemed to disappear and smooth out combined with a moisturizer afterward.</li>
            <li> They were very nice, asked for my name (I was already in the system from the previous replacement) and the serial # on the handle.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it helps to clean my skin so much better than hand washing and seems to have helped my acne breakouts calm down a bit.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Clarisonic is a bit pricy but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Turns out all that has been said about the product is pretty much true.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The product gives a man&#x27;s face a fresh look and feel after shaving.</li>
            <li> If you have the money to blow, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, if you have extremely sensitive skin, this product may hurt your skin more than it helps.  </li>
            <li> and so far I love it.  </li>
            <li> I have the Pro Deluxe version which comes with 3 various levels / speeds for the face and 1 for the body.  </li>
            <li> I always used it on freshly cleansed skin-</li>
            <li> I wanted to see what this thing could do, and it&#x27;s definetly powerful.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been pleased with the results so far.  </li>
            <li> I use it twice daily on my face and neck with my own cleanser (noevir).   </li>
            <li> I would have liked to got the one with the various brushes, just to try them -</li>
            <li> The brushes come with caps, which are useful when attaching and detaching from the unit; I suppose they also serve a sanitary purpose.</li>
            <li> I think the reason is that I didn&#x27;t use the facial wash that came with the device; I kept using my own (Paula&#x27;s Choice)</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money -</li>
            <li> This is worth having for me</li>
            <li> This was by far the most extravagant item I have ever purchased for myself</li>
            <li> Another thing I noticed was the laugh lines started to fade.</li>
            <li> Only the bravest of women should dare own a magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> 3 days later she unwrapped it and was thrilled.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s where the smile stopped.  </li>
            <li> Based on their prompt &amp; very positive response I would purchase product from them again.  </li>
            <li> I suspect that the fine little laugh lines are partly more prominent due to the dry skin from the excellent exfoliation this gadget delivers.</li>
            <li> i have been made fun of my whole life with people telling me to clean my face...</li>
            <li> The brush will get your skin VERY  clean and really clear out your pores.</li>
            <li> There are two buttons, one to turn it on/off, and the other is good for the speeds.</li>
            <li> I just turned 60 and have noticed quite a difference in my skin - a positive difference!</li>
            <li> Also within a week my husband got really close, peered at my face and said, \\&quot;Your skin looks really clean.</li>
            <li> I have tried the 2 main cheap ones neutrogena and Oil of Olay&#x27;s rotating brush</li>
            <li> The place where I bought it from (on Amazon) was nice enough to include a complimentary Skin Polisher (large size) with it.</li>
            <li> I got this before my wedding so that I would have a lovely fresh face without having to go get facials every week in the months leading up to the big day, and it was totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> I recommend you use your own cleansers (as long as it doesn&#x27;t have exfoliants in it.</li>
            <li> I have now been using the new one for well over six months, and it works fabulously.  </li>
            <li> You get mild exfoliation, too, though I still exfoliate 1-2 times per week separately (with Origins Modern Friction).</li>
            <li> easy to handle, not heavy.</li>
            <li> This device is gentle yet effective as a facial and spot treatment cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I used a very gentle cleanser with it, one you can buy at the drug store.  </li>
            <li> I wish there were larger facial brushes sold though, the size given &amp; sold is good, but it&#x27;d be nice to have a facial brush the size of the body brush.  </li>
            <li> After the inital breakouts, I didn&#x27;t really notice that my complexion improved significantly, but my products do work better, which has led to better skin of late.  </li>
            <li> They told me the retailer that sold it to me wasn&#x27;t legitimate, yet it uses their brush heads, it came in their exact packaging, and has a registration number stamped on the bottom.  </li>
            <li> I contacted the retailer and they confirmed that this unit was purchased DIRECTLY from Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> Clarisonic - if you&#x27;re aware of this, why won&#x27;t you fix it???  </li>
            <li> I bought the first Clarisonic Pro</li>
            <li> Gently but thoroughly cleans the face and leaves skin glowing!.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately not the case.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to getting facial treatments at the spa, and this product makes all the difference in giving my skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> &quot; being used on many of the adds on Amazon and such.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it a try over the next week and review more.  </li>
            <li> Sonic brush worth the money it really works.</li>
            <li> This product is really life-changing!  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> My children, hubby and family come first)</li>
            <li> in retrospect, it makes more sense to use nicer products since they&#x27;re actually going to making a difference.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had more facial brushes</li>
            <li> I still get monthly facials, but the Clarisonic is an effective tool for everyday use, like a mini facial in the privacy of my own home.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love my Clarisonic brush and definitely recommend it to friends and family!ation</li>
            <li> I still get monthly facials, but the Clarisonic is an effective tool for everyday use, like a mini facial in the privacy of my own home.  </li>
            <li> I have used my Clarisonic daily for two months now and love the way it makes my face feel.  </li>
            <li> that is a first not receiving an invoice/receipt with an order.</li>
            <li> I have always used a healthy skin care regimen and the Clarisonic only adds to that.</li>
            <li> After I first bought it, though, my charger stopped working after about 3 or 4 months.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty squat.</li>
            <li> Any cleanser works, and I am using the deep pore cleansing brush for my face - Love the body brush in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I dropped the first three times and it broke.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I decided to finally purchase it.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; model does have four speeds, which I love and has a beep/pause for facial cleansing so that you don&#x27;t overdo it.</li>
            <li> now i use Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System   </li>
            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]  </li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> At first, as with anything, I started to break out.  </li>
            <li> I will never be able to go back to hand cleansing.</li>
            <li> So we plugged it back into the charger and after another 24 hours she was finally able to use it.  </li>
            <li> , The Mister......great item to feed the skin on those hot summer days</li>
            <li> so most likely don&#x27;t need to order one separate.</li>
            <li> Many of her colleagues now have purchased the same device.  </li>
            <li> I loved the unit when it worked, but now it is completely dead and Clarisonic won&#x27;t fix it since it was purchased through Amazon, who is a \\&quot;non-authorized\\&quot; retailer.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard of a few others, and maybe they&#x27;re as good without the hefty price tag- who knows.  </li>
            <li> Also a few coupons good for purchases made from the Clarisonic website.</li>
            <li> so much so that I ordered one right away</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I routinely exfoliated my face, I&#x27;d never used anything like this, and it certainly does pack a punch on a full charge at high speed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning to switch to all natural products soon, though, rich in Vitamin E.    </li>
            <li> I can see that my pores are clean and it feels like my facial products, like moisturizers, can work more effectively now.&lt;br /&gt;+ 3-Minute timer for your body, so I will focus on one part of the body each day, or use it multiple times in one long shower.</li>
            <li> Without sounding like a commercial, ladies, this item is TOTALLY worth treating yourself for!!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not at all drying since you are essentially using your own cleansers and this &#x27;sonic&#x27; cleansing action.    </li>
            <li> I think the motion of the brush (vibrates really fast, doesn&#x27;t spin), has a tendency to push sloughing skin back into the pores, leading to more breakouts and in my case, some cystic acne.  </li>
            <li> I actually have had very oily, acne-prone skin most of my life.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m showing good results after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;Appears to be very durable.</li>
            <li> Used for 6 weeks saw no difference in my skin-did see a few more light wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I wanted this for a long time before I was finally able and willing to spend the cash to get this brush</li>
            <li> I had to scale back my every day use of 10% glycolic acid toner to twice a week, and switch to a much lighter moisturizing cream while getting better results (and saving some money).</li>
            <li> I might add that I am using a good face soap like dermilogica, tea tree green tea, Dr Brandt that I have used with just a face cloth and have seen much improved results.  </li>
            <li> My face was so much softer after the  first use.  </li>
            <li> Skin is much smother even after first use.</li>
            <li> I will say that any downside if there is any is that the Pro Deluxe version is a bit bulky to hold...a really petite woman, young pre-teen or something with arthritic hands would most likely prefer the smaller Mia or Classic versions instead.  </li>
            <li> It really makes my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li> and it has really helped keep my skin clear and clean.</li>
            <li> Pump Bottle]] and the gentle sonic brush help keep my skin clean, clear and flake-free.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a good complection with very few breakouts.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels fresh and new.  </li>
            <li> so it becomes part of your daily routine quite easily.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to change the brush -which makes it possible for you to share the device with someone.  </li>
            <li> Having the different speeds and the beeps make it v easy.  </li>
            <li> For the past 3 years I have experienced continual breakouts, sores and whitheads that never seemed to clear up.</li>
            <li> It is a good device when it works, but who knows how long anything last anymore.</li>
            <li> The other part of why is, it is a good product, but you get the feeling that even a better level can be obtained in a stronger, durable, lasting, facial machine.  </li>
            <li> It certainly does not hold a charge like a Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> To buy this is to invest in yourself and you certainly deserve it.</li>
            <li> She suggested I buy a new one!!  </li>
            <li> I put it back in the charger, make sure it is making full contact with the charger, and the next day it will work.  </li>
            <li> Not only is this unit great for my skin, but I find I use much less cleanser making it a money saver as well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry this is so long... hope it helped!! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a skin care routine and recently I&#x27;ve noticed fine lines around my eyes and decided to start.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, face is cleaner, fine lines are softer.  </li>
            <li> The sonic action is exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> The next morning I woke up with two HUGE pimples on my cheek and one on my chin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely furious with Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try it, when I found out how much it cost...</li>
            <li> My acne scars haven&#x27;t diminished that much, but the Clarisonic can&#x27;t do it all.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I REALLY like it, as well as the results.  </li>
            <li> I am getting the regular brush, I think the one that came with it is not quite enough for me, but overall I have discovered a really wonderful tool for my skin and can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> No matter how expensive/cheap/raved about cleanser I&#x27;ve used, nothing really cleaned my face.</li>
            <li> VERY</li>
            <li> I was hesitant and kinda scoffed at the idea that a rotating brush could do much for me.</li>
            <li> It really buffed away some spots that had raised bumps before.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think I need this product.</li>
            <li> This is what really hit me.</li>
            <li> This is what really hit me.</li>
            <li> Thanks.          </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t convinced a cleansing system should cost so much</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care much for it.</li>
            <li> My husband looked at me one day and said, \\&quot;Your skin really looks</li>
            <li> The unit is quiet and smooth.  </li>
            <li> no charger to clutter up your counter, can go in the shower and is lighter than the Clarisonic, but not quite as smooth or quiet.  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed my blemishes heal about three times as fast as they did before.</li>
            <li> This has also helped reduce my blackheads, and I don&#x27;t break out as much since I&#x27;ve been using my Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> My face feels so much smoother and cleaner when I use it.  </li>
            <li> Very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Kelly</li>
            <li> actually really like the Clarisonic Pro.  </li>
            <li> But can you really put a price on your skin??</li>
            <li> But can you really put a price on your skin??</li>
            <li> The scrubbing is not abrasive at all - its very therapeutic and relaxing.</li>
            <li> It gently vibrates and massages the face while giving it a very thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> She indicated it was what she really wanted.  </li>
            <li> No receipt came with the order, although it arrived in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> ZeoForce is one of the neatest internal detoxifying powdered clays, but when used as a facial after wetting the brush of the Clarisonic, there is a very refined noticeable nice affect on your face/neck.</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t consume the battery fast)....</li>
            <li> The price is a bit high!  </li>
            <li> Very convenient for face.</li>
            <li> I really missed the great&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your&lt;br /&gt;Foundation goes on so much nicer and doesn&#x27;t cake up any where.</li>
            <li> But it cleans really well</li>
            <li> and I really like the Clarisonic cleansers it came with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really noticed improved softness/smoothness on my arms,legs,</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be used every day since it is so gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> If you do not buy straight from Clarisonic or authorized dealer, you are out of your money if something happens to your unit.</li>
            <li> I have found that I need to be more careful of what I put on my skin now, as using the Clarisonic</li>
            <li> it is much batter in exfoliation   </li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything as described thank you for the fast turnover and delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit rough and if you want a softer brush you would have to purchase one for twenty five dollars on the company&#x27;s website (which is more money you have to spend).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care much for the products that come with the unit.</li>
            <li> I use it once to twice per day, depending on my activities and how much make-up I am wearing.</li>
            <li> There is really nothing like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Always use a liquid gentlewash soap (CeraVe works very well.)</li>
            <li> It keeps your skin from going into overdrive to rehydrate itself and producing way too much oil.  </li>
            <li> I really like the &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; feeling you get after using this product.  </li>
            <li> I love what this product does for my skin, however for the price I expected it to be a \\&quot;lifetime\\&quot; (5-10 years) product.  </li>
            <li> At this point I figured well maybe I don&#x27;t really need to buy another one</li>
            <li> I purchased my white Clarisonic PRO Deluxe Professional 4-Speed Skin Care System with Spot Therapy Kit five (5) months ago directly from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush and would not come back to my old way of cleaning my face.  </li>
            <li> I received the Clarisonic Pro Deluxe but missing the Skin Care System w/ Spot Therapy Kit.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the Clarisonic feels like a nice facial massage, but needs to cover a larger facial/neck area.</li>
            <li> With this simple engineering change, it would take 30 minutes to charge, and would run for far more than the 30 minutes you get out of NiMH</li>
            <li> I am 45 years old, have good skin yet getting adult acne due to bio-identical hormones (highly recommend!)  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to order this product for what seemed like such a bargain - and I assumed ordering from Amazon it was reliable.    </li>
            <li> I saw WAY better results using Neutrogena products, than I did using other products.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this latest replacement for almost 2 months with no problems, but the 3-4 month mark is where I had problems on the other 2.</li>
            <li> I tried numerous solutions that never made any significant changes.  </li>
            <li> I use it nightly and you get an entirely differnent level of clean with brush than you do with washing your face with your hands...</li>
            <li> Plus my face didn&#x27;t necessarily feel clean after the Neutrogena brush, so I stopped using it.    </li>
            <li> I do like the way it makes my face extra clean</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean, and it helped with some of the flaking, but I noticed some cystic acne issues that I hadn&#x27;t had prior to using this.  </li>
            <li> You only think your skin is clean now, but once you use Clarisonic your skin changes.</li>
            <li> Nice design, it&#x27;s not hard to hold it or too heavy to carry it.  </li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, they sent me a whole new unit, because the one I bought was out of production.  </li>
            <li> Comes with plastic covers/caps, one for the facial brush head and another one for the spot body brush head, which are handy when traveling or trying to dry the brush heads.</li>
            <li> less breakouts and much smoother, with better appearance of makeup.  </li>
            <li> Gets my face super clean in less time.</li>
            <li> They told me that my brush had a full 3-YEAR warranty (that all brushes purchased in 2010 were protected one-year longer than the standard 2-year warranty).  </li>
            <li> They immediately sent me out a FULL replacement via UPS and a pre-paid UPS label to send my defective one back.  </li>
            <li> It makes any skin surface so smooth that I seriously want my whole body this smooth and soft!!!  </li>
            <li> 1 minute on the face twice daily and several minutes in the shower on the full body makes a huge difference to this old ladies skin.</li>
            <li> I only use once a day due to skin sensitivity but overall great</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments, my skin is refreshed, it takes less product (lotion, makeup, ect) on my face</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m in my 20s, my skin has a bit less acne and a bit more dryness.</li>
            <li> But there is a better way to exfoliate your skin for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> I wash my skin twice a day, and never get the squeaky-clean feeling I do, except when using a Clarisonic -- even when following with the handy cotton ball wet with toners or astringents.  </li>
            <li> My delicate skin has cleared up a great deal, but I still have the occasional pimple here and there.</li>
            <li> I noticed that initially it made the acne more obvious.  </li>
            <li> I found that my Elizabeth Arden cleanser worked much better with it however, so now I try to stick with that even though it&#x27;s more expensive.  </li>
            <li> This product is meant to really exfoliate your skin, so your products aren&#x27;t just sitting on top of dead skin cells-</li>
            <li> Overall, I love my Clarisonic brush and definitely recommend it to friends and family!</li>
            <li> Using this device daily on my face, and once or twice a week on my body, has improved my skin tremendously...</li>
            <li> Love the body brush head and the handle to reach the middle of my back where I can never quite reach otherwise!</li>
            <li> (if yours is lucky enough to run at all!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it, although I don&#x27;t care for the washes that came with the kit.</li>
            <li> I can highly recommend both products.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for it to help me stop breaking out, but it has not made a bit of change to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the brush.</li>
            <li> If your thinking about getting it I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> so other family members could have their own individual brushes to use with the one Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the Clarisonic supports enough power to affect a larger area of your face for a purposeful facial massage or not, but that kind of a machine would be nice.</li>
            <li> When it starts, there&#x27;s a cute little \\&quot;beep-beep-beep\\&quot; to know it&#x27;s about to begin.</li>
            <li> Yeh, my skin is silky smooth awesome, but it only lasts for a few days, then I feel a few dry spots here and there.</li>
            <li> Yeh, my skin is silky smooth awesome, but it only lasts for a few days, then I feel a few dry spots here and there.</li>
            <li> What I love about it is that even after using various exfoliants on my face, they sometimes are a bit too harsh or at other times, not as effective as I&#x27;d like them to be</li>
            <li> First of all this system is easy enough to use every single day twice a day.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so much smoother and feels so soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is worth $225, but I haven&#x27;t found anything else that delivers the same results.  </li>
            <li> When I was first debating over this product, I was on the fence about forking out so much money for it, but after hundreds of rave reviews from users on Sephora, here, and my personal friends, I decided to give it a try.      </li>
            <li> I could&#x27;ve bought the Mia and used the normal brush head on my body.  </li>
            <li> Clarisonic themselves even suggest that the normal brush head can be used below the neck on their brush head manual.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t improve scars or discoloration on its own, at least it didn&#x27;t for me, but if you combine its use with a lightening agent, then you&#x27;ll see results quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> exactly the opposite of what you are trying to do by spending this much on a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, at stores like Sephora there&#x27;s a bigger selection of trial cleansers included with the Clarisonic instead of just Clarisonic brand cleansers (I recently saw a Josie Maran set with a super cute pink travel bag!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> mid-30&#x27;s fine wrinkles, combo skin to the extreme, acne, flaking, oily patches, some discoloration...</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m pleased with the results after less than a week.    </li>
            <li> No idea how the brush itself works, I&#x27;m sending it right back.  </li>
            <li> The other huge benefit is</li>
            <li> I returned it and it was replaced with a brand new one.  </li>
            <li> well, lets chalk that up to my new Clairsonic-induced need to peer into a magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old, and I am very skin conscious since I live in the desert.</li>
            <li> Within a week, I saw a HUGE reduction in not only outbreaks, but oil production, pore size and overall skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and my pores are almost invisible and I used to have kind of big looking pores.  </li>
            <li> I have been wanting a Clarisonic for soooo long but really didn&#x27;t want to invest this type of money without really knowing if it worked and I have to say YES!  </li>
            <li> I was very busy with two babies at the time,</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive</li>
            <li> A month went by without my handy little tool and let me tell you ladies out there, my skin went from being smooth and actually very radiant to dull and sandpaperish feeling!</li>
            <li> no matter how old or young you are!!</li>
            <li> My acne has cleared up by 85 percent (crosses fingers hoping this stays the same ;).</li>
            <li> My face looks so different since the first use.</li>
            <li> My skin is exactly the same since I started using it.  </li>
            <li> This was really only an issue for the first month</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ve had that issue with many rechargable items in the past.  </li>
            <li> a quality product.e had that issue with many rechargable items in the past.  </li>
            <li> Many tiny bumps have gone away or grown smaller and the skin on my neck has a younger texture.</li>
            <li> However, do be mindful of what you put on your skin AFTER you use this brush, since as I mentioned your pores will be pretty open</li>
            <li> The body brush is so relaxing and has my skin sooo soft!</li>
            <li> It took forever to resolve itself and I&#x27;m still dealing with the pigmentation from it even though the rest of my face looks marvelous :(.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time &amp; so worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent $ at spas doing a full body scrub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent $ at spas doing a full body scrub.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, less oily and the facial products I use are accepted so much better than before.  </li>
            <li> Most of the literature in the box refers to make-up and using the brushes on your decolletage--as though only half the planet is their market.</li>
            <li> It also held a charge for a few days, making it fine for weekends</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in fine lines, and only minimal improvement in elasticity.  </li>
            <li> Great product, infuriating service.</li>
            <li> It always felt like there was a still huge layer of dead skin.</li>
            <li> Again, no miracles, but clearly nicer looking skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so clear &amp; smooth!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> being said, I&#x27;ll now explain that a clean pore is less noticable than a clogged one.</li>
            <li> and this is gentle enough to use frequently and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> So far, I like my Clarisonic Pro.</li>
            <li> Now, as an adult, I&#x27;m dealing with eczema and adult acne.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time calling their service department.  </li>
            <li> On occasion they sell this set on Groupon and Livingsocial at a considerable discount (for about $60).  </li>
            <li> after I used the product - wow, it made my before skin feel like sand paper.</li>
            <li> I was thinking a real mask might be my only option.</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t believe that scrubbing didn&#x27;t work but a simple brush could remove so much.</li>
            <li> This product removes my make up completely.  </li>
            <li> I also moved the wand around a lot, in addition to the pulsating action, so I have no doubt that I was adding to the irritation.  </li>
            <li> professional recommended the Clairisonic Skin Care system</li>
            <li> Please note that Clarisonic sells the \\&quot;Plus\\&quot; version, which is 3-speeds, since the \\&quot;Pro\\&quot; version with 4-speeds is supposed to be used by professional.</li>

            <li> I am 25 years old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just really improved the texture and overall look of my skin.    </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think I needed this product until after I had a facial during vacation.  </li>
            <li> My only regret is that I wish I would have bought it much sooner.</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks of using the Clarisonic Pro my face has almost totally cleared up and feels so much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> , Skin Care Investments does not have ANY stock of the Clarisonic Pro, so do not waste you Christmas shopping money.  </li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, my skin is smoother and more firm.  </li>
            <li> Ive been using it for a few weeks only so am expecting more longterm results</li>
            <li> As I mentioned, my skin is not sensitive at all, so I was surprised after my first use that the brush felt too abrasive on my skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no charging issues, and a single overnight charge will last me a full week.  </li>
            <li> (minus one problem right eyebrow</li>
            <li> The brush head does not seem to dry overnight, so make sure to tilt or face it down to drain the water.</li>
            <li> - The brush head does not seem to dry overnight, so make sure to tilt or face it down to drain the water.</li>
            <li> I saw the Youtube video after I had spent hundreds of dollars on the brush when I realized I just as easily could have had the same results and for only $5-$10 dollars.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I purchased it, although I was wary of the price at first glance.  </li>
            <li> The retail price of $225 is pricey, so I bought my first one on eBay which included extra brush heads, but now Amazon is offering it at a competitive price, so I plan on buying a second one to keep at my boyfriend&#x27;s place.</li>

            <li> I discontinued use after 1-2 weeks, and my skin has continued to break out to such an extent that I think I have to go back to the dermatologist for the first time in 10 years.  </li>
            <li> Even an acne scar I had on my nose since high school in the seventies started to get smaller as well.</li>
            <li> The handle is large- but not overly large or heavy for that matter.</li>
            <li> Cleanses pores deeply, removing old sebum, dead skin and bacteria; skin feels invigorated and smooth.</li>
            <li> First impression, the box was partially opened.</li>
            <li> &gt; As far as the heads go, they last a pretty decent amount of time and I am still on the fence if I will buy any on Amazon, I read way too many reviews of the items being fake and if I have a problem after I buy them from Sephora I can take them back no questions asked.  </li>
            <li> but this Clairsonic gives me the effect of a gentle exfoliator - not too much and not too little and unlike some exfoliators</li>
            <li> Now, two months later I couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> this after less than a week&#x27;s worth of use.    </li>
            <li> helped so much with those deep pimples, skin is no longer flakey and it has actually tightened the skin beneath my jaw line....</li>
            <li> I could not believe how much makeup was left on my face after traditional cleaning until I started using the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> , so it&#x27;s not easy to wrap up for traveling.  - Does not come with a travel bag, but there is a Spot Therapy Kit on sale for $50, which includes the Spot body brush head, exfoliating Clarisonic Body Polish (6 oz, full size), and a travel bag.  </li>
            <li> Basically, they are admitting that there is a major problem with the charger.    </li>
            <li> After first use, my pores were smaller, skin smoother, looked 5 years younger instantly.  </li>
            <li> Combined with the tanda red light, it&#x27;s cutting edge, medcially sound skin care.  </li>
            <li> I would steer clear if you have ever had problems with acne, even if you are currently not breaking out.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on other shops, but this one I purchased is a genuine product, we have compared with the other devices we purchase from the official Clarisonic website.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help clear up the skin on my face and back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only given it three stars so far, but if it continues to perform, my rating will raise.</li>
            <li> My problem red areas (my mouth and nose) have completely healed.</li>
            <li> This Clarisonic Pro is only about 4 months old.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different types of brushes and exfoliants, but my skin just wasn&#x27;t baby soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different types of brushes and exfoliants, but my skin just wasn&#x27;t baby soft.</li>
            <li> Now that my skin is exfoliated by the Clarisonic, my skin is smoother and my makeup goes on much easier without emphasizing a lot of rough areas of skin.  </li>
            <li> After reading on makeupalley about different brush heads, I came to the conclusion that a lot of people switch from the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; brush head that comes with the kit to &amp;#34;delicate,&amp;#34; even people that don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only done this twice with the Clarisonic so far</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than any other skincare brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> but you can use other cleansers and it really will work just as well, may be some trial and error there to find what you like.</li>
            <li> After I clean off my foundation make up, I rinse the brush head, wash it for a few seconds with hand soap, and then leave it out to dry.</li>
            <li> : The body brush is really soft like the facial brush, to me it just seems like it&#x27;s bigger</li>
            <li> Despite treatments with antibiotics and topical medicines, i didn&#x27;t see a major improvement until my aesthetician introduced me to revaleskin products, and the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> Also, the brush head fits tighter and is a little more difficult to taken on/off (nothing out of the ordinary, but definitely not a loose/easy fit like the first 2).</li>
            <li> The best thing u can buy for ur face , no more pimbles no more rough skin , no more oily skin , i use it twice a day</li>
            <li> At first my skin did appear dry and rough for about two weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched to the lowest speed possible and use it lightly &amp; avoid pressing it too hard into my skin to avoid wrinkling and breaking down the facial muscles too much.</li>
            <li> my husband and i laugh because i never knew that for the past 16 years i never looked at my face in the mirror anymore</li>
            <li> My pores were less visible, my skin was much softer and my face seemed brighter.</li>
            <li> Acne, adult acne, oily, dry, patchy.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day on the normal speed.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day on the normal speed.</li>
            <li> it is a good purchase  but the Clarisonic purchase was a bad choice</li>
            <li> , then turn it on while applying it to a dry towel which dries it pretty thoroughly, then I put on the little plastic cap and screw the head off</li>
            <li> Now, no more flakes, less visible lines and just a generally smooth overall appearance.  </li>
            <li> The other one was only two months old.</li>
            <li> A second cradle (other than the charging one) for if you want to keep your clarisonic somewhere near the bathroom but don&#x27;t want to put the charger there...</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s been secretly wanting it for a long time (wasn&#x27;t a great secret considering the information was leaked to me).</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and even though I wear oil-free foundation I used to get breakouts all the time even though I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> The whole contraption takes up a lot of counter space because of these condition so once the brush unit is fully charged you still have both pieces laying around, not very tidy.</li>
            <li> The old one doesn&#x27;t work after a year and half, can&#x27;t be fixed as it is a closed unit</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, If any of you get Botox injections (between eyebrows for example), and you use it in the same area often, your botox effects will NOT last long.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest dropping a bundle of new facial products until you use this for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> PLUS this has cleared up dry spots that body scrubs have missed - the back of my thighs and upper arms.</li>
            <li> PLUS this has cleared up dry spots that body scrubs have missed - the back of my thighs and upper arms.</li>
            <li> This is not the case for the body, the brush is too small , and it takes too much time to use it for the&lt;br /&gt;whole body.</li>
            <li> yeah, I expected wrinkles, but suddenly there was no such thing as enough exfoliating.</li>
            <li> If the difference had been minor then there is no way I would justify buying a second unit for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush comes with a 3 year warranty and I expect the battery to not last that long</li>
            <li> After cleansing, I rub the head on a bar of soap and gently scrub it and rinse it out, the rest is the same as the delicate brush.</li>
            <li> pulsating action is what deep cleans, and not in a harsh way.</li>
            <li> I use Retin-A every other night for just general skin maintenance (tretinion gel 0.025%).</li>
            <li> Sensitive skin types should proceed with caution or consult their dermatologists first before making such an expensive purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at an age, 58 to be precise, where I look in the mirror and wonder just what is going wrong here.</li>
            <li> I noticed a dramatic difference in the texture of my skin quite quickly.</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic Pro comes with a Sensitive brush head, a Body brush head and a Body Brush handle, as well as small sample sizes of a facial and body cleanser.</li>
            <li> It also works like a \\&quot;light\\&quot; dermbrasion in the sense that it keeps your skin clear of radicals &amp; makeup from the day, removing dead skin.  </li>
            <li> This has lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> my acne has been there for so long..</li>
            <li> are a few thoughts on it and what I may have done to contribute to the early issues:&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you know how long to scrub each area.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect them to because it had been so long.  </li>
            <li> It only takes 20 seconds on the chin &amp; nose, 20 sec.</li>
            <li> the reason it takes so long to charge.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not totally clear in the listing but my brush came with the body brush extension.  </li>
            <li> have oily skin with large pores, a few active (although small) pimples at a time, and my skin is in no way sensitive.</li>
            <li> my pores were getting clogged and larger, I was getting lazy in my old age, single mother, not always washing my face at night.  </li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, my face is less oily, and my overall skin health is just...</li>
            <li> I started to develop black heads ( and I have NEVER had those even during my younger years as a teen and thereafter )</li>
            <li> By the way, buying replacement brush heads usually include a new plastic cover/cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> still get some blemishes, I have discolorations and large pores in my T-Zone) and I can tell a SERIOUS difference now.  </li>
            <li> It also seems like the handle is a little bit bigger than the regular model.</li>
            <li> Just got the body brush, hoping to see the same results on my rough elbows!</li>
            <li> I personally have extremely oily, acne prone skin and texture.  </li>
            <li> The one thing that I do not like about the handle is that it does NOT hold a charge for very long.  </li>
            <li> Leave the brush off to air dry while the handle charges.  </li>
            <li> It would either dry it up, leave some type of a residue, or just irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> Dry spots GONE.</li>
            <li> Dry spots GONE.</li>
            <li> For those who don&#x27;t know, it works like a &#x27;sonic&#x27; toothbrush but instead has a much larger, round facial / body brush.  </li>
            <li> over the course of 3 months to completely destroy all current and future acne.  </li>
            <li> , if you use a moisurizer that is too thick or put make-up on right away, I think you could have a little problem.  </li>
            <li> I have a terrible time with my back and arms and expect the same good results I have had on my face using my</li>
            <li> Think of how much $ you&#x27;ve spent over the years on cleansers, scrubbers, etc...think about it, seriously think about it..</li>
            <li> Although, the price has come down since I purchased it back in May for $225.    </li>
            <li> and I get dry patches of skin, rough patches, dark coloration and acne very badly on my entire body.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I notice a reduction in the size of the pores or less wrinkles yet, but I&#x27;ve only been using for about 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> My pore size is the same, but they are indeed less noticable.</li>
            <li> After a year an a half of daily use the product stopped taking a charge.  </li>
            <li> After the FIRST USE I saw dramatic changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> I was using the sensitive brush head, but I&#x27;m now using the delicate brush head which is supposed to be even gentler.  </li>
            <li> nights I use the delicate brush on the low setting for one minute by following the indicating beeps and</li>
            <li> But, then I thought I&#x27;ve spent $100s on dermatologists, so it wouldn&#x27;t hurt (if it worked.)</li>
            <li> Then, it dies again a few days later.  </li>
            <li> What I spent for 2 body scrubs &#x3D; this machine.</li>
            <li> What I spent for 2 body scrubs &#x3D; this machine.</li>
            <li> i am crying now because of all the hell i put myself through emotionally..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve EVER SPENT.</li>
            <li> No issues taking it into the shower, or getting it wet.  </li>
            <li> No issues taking it into the shower, or getting it wet.  </li>
            <li> Battery life indicator (4 green dots) is on the back of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> It is not worth the amount i paid for it , any ordinary manual facial brush can do the same.</li>
            <li> &#x27;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks, the pores do appear smaller, but</li>
            <li> on the forehead and 10 sec.</li>
            <li> and I can tell you there is absolutely no comparison.  </li>
            <li> The charger plug is now a regular small plug (a definite improvement), not a huge hair dryer type plug (like was on the previous 2 I had) and the writing/font on the handle is a slightly different color.</li>
            <li> (not to mention my acne, dark spots and dry patches are GONE).    </li>
            <li> (In some cases very little) I think buying them locally ordirectly from Clarisonic is probably the safest bet.</li>
            <li> There are a few dupes on the market for much less, and of those, I&#x27;ve only used the Neutrogena one, and the one you can buy at Sally&#x27;s Beauty store for 20 dollars.  </li>
            <li> You might want to use on one small section to see the results BEFORE you do on your entire face.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely not worth the almost $200 I spent on it.  </li>
            <li> due</li>
            <li> the seller was extremely proactive when I thought that I did not receive the body brush (which I did, but threw in the trash by mistake).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always leave it in the docking station because a tiny bit of water collects at the bottom even though there is a small hole for draining.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> - I don&#x27;t always leave it in the docking station because a tiny bit of water collects at the bottom even though there is a small hole for draining.  </li>
            <li> I am using a dermal clay cleanser for my skin type by Dermologica and it works extremely well with my clarisonic(s).  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want the body extension, I would say save your money and go for one of the other versions of the Clarisonic because I think those will work just as well if you&#x27;re like me.</li>
            <li> A fantastic exfoliation and cleaning tool, I did not really think I needed it that bad</li>
            <li> I read several testimonial at the dermatologist&#x27;s office and was still skeptical but decided to look up the reviews on Amazon, and was surprised-</li>
            <li> As for Face, I purchase the small facial brushes that are easier and less money to replace.    </li>
            <li> Hard to adjust speed due to only two buttons and no speed display.</li>
            <li> I only use the deep-pore brush with OCM because I don&#x27;t want to contaminate my other brushes with the oil since it&#x27;s hard to get out of the brush.</li>
            <li> I am fortunate to not have bad breakouts, but what I do have are a lot of whiteheads.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive, but if I&#x27;m going to spend so much on my skin products (moisturizers, eye creams, exfoliants, anti-aging creams)</li>
            <li> I have had a clarisonic for at least 3 years (the same one)</li>
            <li> I only gave it one star because I had to enter at least one star.</li>
            <li> This was the only negative side effect I&#x27;ve had, and I did it to myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> b/c after using this product, it made me think of how much I&#x27;ve wasted and should have spent it on this product.</li>
            <li> I found it lasted a few days when washing the face twice per day plus a few times for my body, which did not last during my 1-week vacation, so I was out of luck for a few days since I did not bring my charger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin feels a little bit drier than when I use some other stuff -</li>
            <li> No more dry skin for this girl</li>
            <li> Ever since I purchased this product I have had fewer breakouts and less oilier skin.</li>
            <li> I use the body brush if I shower in the evening rather than the morning just because it does seem to take a bit longer since it covers less surface area than the loofah I used to use.  </li>
            <li> My pores are no longer clogged with black dirt &amp; oil.</li>
            <li> and I need less.  </li>
            <li> It arrived in less than the predicted week.</li>
            <li> Many people are pressing too hard/not cleaning their brush heads properly/using the wrong brush heads for their skin and or using the wrong cleansers for their skin AND the clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> less break-outs, smaller-appearing pores, and it glows.</li>
            <li> Unless you have $200 to spend every year and a half don&#x27;t buy a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> &quot; I do have an extremely oily t-zone and large unsightly, dirty pores on both my chin and across the bridge of my nose.</li>
            <li> It comes with the body brush and extension handle (which I did not find awkward to use as some claim), sensitive facial brush, and a sample of the body and face washes, (face wash was a little drying for me).</li>
            <li> Personally this product is not good for people with \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; or \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; skin.</li>
            <li> I was so desperate for the first 24 hrs to go by</li>
            <li> and I had the tight &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling after one minute.</li>
            <li> Maintenance is much cheaper in the long run and much less painful than face lifts and botox.</li>
            <li> Maintenance is much cheaper in the long run and much less painful than face lifts and botox.</li>
            <li> My skin was very dry from having air conditioning blowing on me all day at work (I live in Hawaii) and my skin needed exfoliation badly since I was using heavier creams for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This product is no better than the other scrubby brushes that are avaiable for much less.</li>
            <li> I rinse out my handle and each brush and let them air dry to avoid it getting icky.</li>
            <li> even my Phillip&#x27;s Sonic Pro Toothbrush) with a little soap and rinses it.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant since one reviewer said that Amazon was not an authorized seller.  </li>
            <li> , I was a little underwhelmed.  </li>
            <li> provides but what a difference this little machine makes.  </li>
            <li> I plan on using this little miracle for years to come.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this little scrubber has done wonders.</li>
            <li> I would suggest making it lighter - when you&#x27;re using the body brush, it gets to be a little heavy after a few runs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would suggest making it lighter - when you&#x27;re using the body brush, it gets to be a little heavy after a few runs.     </li>
            <li> It never looked dirty, but now it looks really clean.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if there is something wrong with mine or that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> The one I received was missing the spot therapy brush.  </li>
            <li> I called Clarisonic at their customer service number to request the missing item.  </li>
            <li> Every two or three days, it just stops working even thought it indicates with the green lights that it is fully charged.  </li>
            <li> A few things I noticed about the Clarisonic and some suggestions ...  1.  </li>
            <li> all the products i&#x27;ve bought/used before couldn&#x27;t even come close...made me feel like I did waste a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had trouble cleaning and washing all the impurities off of my face, but with Clarisonic I can wash my face in a few seconds and there wont be a trace of anything.</li>
            <li> i sit in the shower crying while scrubbing my face for hours...</li>
            <li> Be prepared to add on a few minutes to your morning &amp; night skin care routine.      </li>
            <li> Removes dead skin.</li>
            <li> My post treatment moisturizers were probably too heavy.  </li>
            <li> it keeps the dead skin sloughed off.</li>
            <li> Using this product everyday will increase your skins texture,circulation,and&lt;br /&gt;reduces</li>
            <li> and this seemed too harsh.</li>
            <li> She took it upstairs to use it and it was completely DEAD.  </li>
            <li> She put the body brush on it and after 30 seconds, it was dead AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have had my machine for over 5 years w/o any trouble.</li>
            <li> I keep it off the charging base until it&#x27;s ready to be fully recharged, and then I let it sit overnight only.  </li>
            <li> BTW, almost every negative review I have read, has been due to the cleanser NOT a problem with the machine.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit heavy for a small person when using the handle on body.</li>
            <li> it is heavy , big &amp; pricy $200 for exfoliation Device   that you can&#x27;t use any exfoliating cleanser with   the 3 cleansers is useless   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tempted to press hard for a massage (but I&#x27;ve read anecdotal advice that if you massage your face too hard, it breaks down the tissues and can cause premature aging.)     </li>
            <li> Meanwhile, I&#x27;m left with a totally useless unit.  </li>
            <li> The beauty counter has usually been a bust for me.</li>
            <li> in the past they would clog my pores but the brush removes all of that gunk.</li>
            <li> the first time i used this my face looked horrible but thats because all the pits were open....</li>
            <li> I can no longer be lazy to wash my make up off before going to bed.</li>
            <li> In the past, I would wash my face, go to bed and wake up with an oily face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a small nightmare.</li>
            <li> I saw this on tv last year and wanted one since but thought they were expensive.</li>
            <li> No more Clarisonic for me nor</li>
            <li> Due to my process, I never experienced the usual \\&quot;purge\\&quot; from the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> Cheap, fake and bad heads can ruin your skin.....</li>
            <li> My face hasn&#x27;t been this bad since I was in high school</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to say if it is directly a result of this product, but all I know is that my skin flared up immediately after my use of the clarisonic brush.  </li>
            <li> so it is Hard to set  speed</li>
            <li> She loves this thing and uses it at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> and I was just desperate enough to give it</li>
            <li> I used it, and I did use it at least once a day, every day, sometimes twice.  </li>
            <li> I did not have any negative reactions and while it did not eliminate my acne, it does help to reduce it.</li>
            <li> (I am in my late 20s now).  </li>
            <li> And this cleared my acne despite the negative reviews I&#x27;ve read from people with acne.</li>
            <li> Lately, I&#x27;ve had the body head on it, and even if it charges all night or 24hrs</li>
            <li> and I recommend seeing a dermatologist at least ONCE to ensure you are doing everything correctly.  </li>
            <li> It does come with a wand (or at least ours did)</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s slowly clearing.)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the body handle difficult to attach or use as other reviewers have commented.</li>
            <li> My clean routine went from fail to fab!!!!  </li>
            <li> I learned the hard way myself by trying to save $1 or less even by selecting the cheapest option and using a vendor that might be selling you a fake item.  </li>
            <li> It looks like I&#x27;m not the only one getting the raw end of the deal from Amazon :(  </li>
            <li> but seriously, that&#x27;s not the way acne works.  </li>
            <li> A must for anyone who is serious about skin care.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical but had listened to friends talk about theirs for years, so decided to give it a try and get serious about improving my skin&#x27;s quality/texture.</li>
            <li> But, I personally, do not have bad acne ...</li>
            <li> Pretty insane b/c</li>
            <li> Although I have no complaints about the Clarisonic other than the expensive price tag and expensive replacement brush heads, I will not be purchasing this product again.  </li>
            <li> The customer service person was so rude!  </li>
            <li> What a waste of $220.00!!!  </li>
            <li> She informed me that amazon is not an authorized seller of this item and that they will not stand behind the warranty.  </li>
            <li> I am somewhat confused by the word \\&quot;Deluxe\\</li>
            <li> well it is the extra brush and refining skin polish, which does not come with the base kit.        </li>
            <li> I suggest removing the brush head once in awhile to get any trapped dirty water out.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I suggest removing the brush head once in awhile to get any trapped dirty water out.  </li>
            <li> it may be unnecessary for you.</li>
            <li> Addicted to this brush.</li>
            <li> Basically the company doesn&#x27;t stand behind it&#x27;s products and there is nothing I can do.  </li>
            <li> I use and like the body brush, though its effects are not so dramatic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to maintain your skin when your hormones are all over the place!</li>
            <li> I just wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its sad to think</li>
            <li> This sounds silly but use a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This may seem expensive...</li>
            <li> The power cord is permanently connected to the docking station (charging base), so it&#x27;s not easy to wrap up for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It was the horrible, big, painful, under-the-skin type.</li>
            <li> so needless to say, after I read these reviews, I was sold on this very expensive</li>
            <li> After less than a week, my skin broke out terribly, and skin reddened after every use.</li>
            <li> Even though they are few it&#x27;s just so annoying!</li>
            <li> If you have skin and don&#x27;t use this, you&#x27;re crazy.  </li>
            <li> (no need to get expensive facials anymore!).  </li>
            <li> I have had rosacea for 15 years, and have always suffered with itchy, flaky, unpleasant skin as a result.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is impossible not to have one.</li>
            <li> If you have bad acne, use caution.  </li>
            <li> so i can not use it when i want   it needs to charge for 24 hours every time i use it for 3 min bad battery life  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sick of it, I used all sorts of stuff</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am extremely disappointed in amazon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just crazy about that brush!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Clairsonic Pro for 2 months and I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I had been thinking about purchasing this item for quite some time but was a bit nervous about the cost and the fact that I&#x27;ve been disappointed before.  </li>
            <li> but when i got it i was a disappointed ,  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was wrong!!</li>
            <li> And the magnetic field charger is just stupid.  </li>
            <li> I do find it annoying though that it automatically shuts off after one minute though.    </li>
            <li> I hate scrubbing my body with a loofah sponge or a face towel.</li>
            <li> (charging base)</li>
            <li> I plugged in the charging base, and put the unit in the charger.  </li>
            <li> The worst blotchiness disappeared within a week.</li>
            <li> My skin has always been terrible.</li>
            <li> So disappointed!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews saying that these are knock offs.  I don&#x27;t know about that,... but I love it.  It works great!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Clarisonic for about a year and I will NEVER go back to washing my face without it! I use it nightly and you get an entirely differnent level of clean with brush than you do with washing your face with your hands... You get mild exfoliation, too, though I still exfoliate 1-2 times per week separately (with Origins Modern Friction). The other huge benefit is that after cleansing with the Clarisonic your skin care products sink in to your skin SO much better, and you&#x27;ll find them having even better benefits over time. I love to use my Clarisonic with Origins Checks &amp; Balances frothy cleanser.</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE: I&#x27;m absolutely furious with Clarisonic.  I loved the unit when it worked, but now it is completely dead and Clarisonic won&#x27;t fix it since it was purchased through Amazon, who is a \\&quot;non-authorized\\&quot; retailer.\\&quot;  They told me the retailer that sold it to me wasn&#x27;t legitimate, yet it uses their brush heads, it came in their exact packaging, and has a registration number stamped on the bottom.  I contacted the retailer and they confirmed that this unit was purchased DIRECTLY from Clarisonic.  Why is Clarisonic selling units to others for distribution if they aren&#x27;t backing them?  This is a very reputable retailer and I have never had problems with them before.  The reseller blames Clarisonic and Clarisonic blames the reseller.  Meanwhile, I&#x27;m left with a totally useless unit.  Their customer service rep told me they are very aware of this problem, but can&#x27;t do anythning to help me.  Clarisonic - if you&#x27;re aware of this, why won&#x27;t you fix it???  I had no idea when I purchased this that I would not receive the advertised warranty.  And plan on spending about 30 minutes on hold before you can even talk to a customer service rep at Clarisonic.  Great product, infuriating service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a skin care routine and recently I&#x27;ve noticed fine lines around my eyes and decided to start. Since I&#x27;ve been using this product people have been asking me what I&#x27;ve been doing different. My skin is noticably smoother and just short of glowing. I would highly recommend it, although I don&#x27;t care for the washes that came with the kit.</li>
            <li> The one I received was missing the spot therapy brush.  I called Clarisonic at their customer service number to request the missing item.  She informed me that amazon is not an authorized seller of this item and that they will not stand behind the warranty.  The package itself says \\&quot;available exclusively from your skin care professional.\\&quot;  The package also does not correspond with the item I bought has no spot therapy brush is included with this item. The UPC code is covered with a separate label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely disappointed in amazon.  I didn&#x27;t know they sold gray-market goods.</li>
            <li> Love it!  My pores are smaller, face is cleaner, fine lines are softer.  I can also tell my skin absorbs my skin products better!    I recommend this item!</li>
            <li> So far, I like my Clarisonic Pro. I&#x27;ve only had it for a week,. Although it&#x27;s still a bit of a wait-n-see deal with me, I have cautious optimism. I&#x27;ve always had highly-sensitive skin. Now, as an adult, I&#x27;m dealing with eczema and adult acne. Dermatologist haven&#x27;t been able to do much for my skin, even after spending money on medicinal creams.     The beauty counter has usually been a bust for me. I&#x27;ve used highly-advertised products like Neutrogena&#x27;s facial brush (with the disposable soap pads). After less than a week, my skin broke out terribly, and skin reddened after every use. Plus my face didn&#x27;t necessarily feel clean after the Neutrogena brush, so I stopped using it.    I heard a lot of word-of-mouth on YouTube about the Clarisonic. I wanted to try it, when I found out how much it cost... I almost turned and ran. But, then I thought I&#x27;ve spent $100s on dermatologists, so it wouldn&#x27;t hurt (if it worked.) So far, I&#x27;m pleased with the results after less than a week.    When it starts, there&#x27;s a cute little \\&quot;beep-beep-beep\\&quot; to know it&#x27;s about to begin. The device alerts you when you have to change sections to start cleaning the next section. The Clarisonic is water-resistant so you can use it in the shower. The brushes feel light against the skin... I&#x27;ve been tempted to press hard for a massage (but I&#x27;ve read anecdotal advice that if you massage your face too hard, it breaks down the tissues and can cause premature aging.)     I&#x27;ve also been using the facial cleaners from the spot therapy kit that came with the book. The place where I bought it from (on Amazon) was nice enough to include a complimentary Skin Polisher (large size) with it. I&#x27;m planning to switch to all natural products soon, though, rich in Vitamin E.    So far, I&#x27;m pleased with the results. My face feels clean, and it&#x27;s the softest its been in ages. This is miraculous, for me. I wash my skin twice a day, and never get the squeaky-clean feeling I do, except when using a Clarisonic -- even when following with the handy cotton ball wet with toners or astringents.  The reddened eczema areas around my nose (which always look red and irritated) have also healed: this after less than a week&#x27;s worth of use.    When using, I make sure to wash my face first, then follow with the Clarisonic Brush. After use, I also take the time to clean my Clarisonic brush(and even my Phillip&#x27;s Sonic Pro Toothbrush) with a little soap and rinses it. I do this to kill any bacteria collecting in the brushes. I am going to change the brush head at the recommended time too (Hopes this tip helps those who have acne, like myself.)     I&#x27;ve only given it three stars so far, but if it continues to perform, my rating will raise. If there are any changes in my satisfaction with this product, I will add it.    Update: It&#x27;s been two months since I got my Clarisonic. I use it twice daily, and my rating has bumped up to four stars. It&#x27;s much better than any other skincare brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past. My delicate skin has cleared up a great deal, but I still have the occasional pimple here and there. My acne has cleared up by 85 percent (crosses fingers hoping this stays the same ;). My eczema has cleared by 80 percent (minus one problem right eyebrow that&#x27;s slowly clearing.) My problem red areas (my mouth and nose) have completely healed. My acne scars haven&#x27;t diminished that much, but the Clarisonic can&#x27;t do it all. The Clarisonic has four speeds. I&#x27;ve switched to the lowest speed possible and use it lightly &amp; avoid pressing it too hard into my skin to avoid wrinkling and breaking down the facial muscles too much.</li>
            <li> This is a revolutionary product. I LOVE it! Cleanse my skin thoroughly and remove all traces of makeup, leaving my face flawless and refreshed. The Clarisonic makes a good product to have the ability to better penetrate the skin and to raise its power to maximum.&lt;br /&gt;It is impossible not to have one.</li>
            <li> purchased this and have been using it for about 2 months now morning and night.. helped so much with those deep pimples, skin is no longer flakey and it has actually tightened the skin beneath my jaw line.... At first my skin did appear dry and rough for about two weeks but it was working to take off that top layer...No woman should be without this</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time calling their service department.  When I called they said I needed to replace the brush every three months.  I explained it worked intermittently.  They then suggested that the bathroom outlet I had it plugged into had \\&quot;locked\\&quot; the Clarisonic and I should move it to my dining room and charge it again for 24 hours.  What a waste of $220.00!!!  Basically, they are admitting that there is a major problem with the charger.    I bought the first Clarisonic Pro and it stopped holding a charge. I returned it and it was replaced with a brand new one.  Well, guess what?  This one won&#x27;t hold a charge either.  It is kept in the charger all the time.  Every two or three days, it just stops working even thought it indicates with the green lights that it is fully charged.  I read the manual and followed all the instructions, however, it dies every three or four days.  I put it back in the charger, make sure it is making full contact with the charger, and the next day it will work.  Then, it dies again a few days later.  This Clarisonic Pro is only about 4 months old.  The other one was only two months old.</li>
            <li> A fantastic exfoliation and cleaning tool, I did not really think I needed it that bad but now can&#x27;t imagine living without one. I&#x27;ve been using the brush for a couple months now, once a day after I wash my make-up off, the brush always takes off more make-up even though to me my skin already looks clean.  I am now able to use primers more frequently - in the past they would clog my pores but the brush removes all of that gunk. I bought one of these brushes for my sister as a gift. On occasion they sell this set on Groupon and Livingsocial at a considerable discount (for about $60).  The charging cradle makes it easy to store and charge, which is very convenient. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Clarisonic is a bit pricy but worth every penny.  My skin has never looked as good.  I encourage you to give this item a try - you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Gently but thoroughly cleans the face and leaves skin glowing!.  I also like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;spray\\&quot; soap and water all over the place - everything stays on your face, not on your mirror!  Haven&#x27;t tried the body brush yet since I use one of those net scrubbers in the shower but I&#x27;m sure it will work just as well. I just turned 60 and have noticed quite a difference in my skin - a positive difference!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to order this product for what seemed like such a bargain - and I assumed ordering from Amazon it was reliable.    Unfortunately not the case.  The spot care kit and international charger that were supposed to be included were not included.  Why am I paying more for a Spot Therapy Kit I don&#x27;t get, Amazon?    On top of this, you can tell someone&#x27;s handled the product before - the packaging was pretty sketchy.    No idea how the brush itself works, I&#x27;m sending it right back.  It looks like I&#x27;m not the only one getting the raw end of the deal from Amazon :(  Can&#x27;t count on anyone...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed by how well this works. It really makes my skin soft and clean. I&#x27;m used to getting facial treatments at the spa, and this product makes all the difference in giving my skin a healthy glow. This really is an amazing product!</li>
            <li> I purchased my white Clarisonic PRO Deluxe Professional 4-Speed Skin Care System with Spot Therapy Kit five (5) months ago directly from Amazon.  I REALLY like it, as well as the results.  I don&#x27;t know if it is worth $225, but I haven&#x27;t found anything else that delivers the same results.  Let me start off by saying that it does NOT perform miracles, but I do see results.  I have (that is, had) flakey combination dry/T-ozone oily skin.  Now, no more flakes, less visible lines and just a generally smooth overall appearance.  Again, no miracles, but clearly nicer looking skin.  I personally think the level of results that you see depends on the cleanser you use with the Clarisonic.  I saw WAY better results using Neutrogena products, than I did using other products.  So, finding a good face cleanser for your skin type is definitely key to seeing the best results with the Clarisonic.    I&#x27;ve used the various Sonicare toothbrushes for years and loved the results, which is what attracted me to the Clarisonic.  And, yes, Clarisonic has the same EXCELLENT customer service as Sonicare.  I was a little hesitant since one reviewer said that Amazon was not an authorized seller.  Anyway, after two months of use, my handle was taking forever to charge and then not holding the charge.  I called Clarisonic&#x27;s 800 # for customer service.  They didn&#x27;t even ask me WHERE I purchased it, they just asked for the serial number.  They told me that my brush had a full 3-YEAR warranty (that all brushes purchased in 2010 were protected one-year longer than the standard 2-year warranty).  They immediately sent me out a FULL replacement via UPS and a pre-paid UPS label to send my defective one back.  VERY HAPPY with that level of customer service that is rare these days!    The one thing that I do not like about the handle is that it does NOT hold a charge for very long.  And, unless you speed race over your body, there won&#x27;t be enough charge to do your body and your face at the same time.  It certainly does not hold a charge like a Sonicare.  So, if you are traveling, you will need to bring the charger.    A few things I noticed about the Clarisonic and some suggestions ...  1.  Facial cleanser used determines the results you will see with the Clarisonic.  The better the face cleanser for your skin type, the better the results.  2.  Take the brush head off after EVERY use and wash the handle and brush good.  Leave the brush off to air dry while the handle charges.  3.  I usually clean my face for 2-3 cycles of the face cleaning (i.e., I go over my face 2-3 times) because the face cleaning is on a timer and shuts off.  (Beeps like the Sonicare to tell you to move to the next section.)  4.  If you have bad acne, use caution.  You might want to use on one small section to see the results BEFORE you do on your entire face.  I noticed that initially it made the acne more obvious.  But, after using several times, it actually cleared it up faster and gave an overall smoother appearance/complexion.  But, I personally, do not have bad acne ... just an occasional blemish on my forehead or nose (and I noticed it initially ... but not anymore).   5.  Worked great on smoothing knees and elbows.    Overall, with the EXCELLENT customer service and GREAT results, I give this product 5 STARS.  I just wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive.  Although, the price has come down since I purchased it back in May for $225.    UPDATE APRIL 2011: In January 2011 my REPLACEMENT HANDLE stopped holding a change AT ALL. It would sit in the charging cradle, show fully charged and the battery would INSTANTLY die when the on button was pressed. Again, I called Clarisonic&#x27;s 800# and explained my problem (that the handle was not holding a charge). They were very nice, asked for my name (I was already in the system from the previous replacement) and the serial # on the handle. I received my replacement handle and charger via UPS within a week (along with a prepaid label to send the defective/non-working one back). This replacement looks slightly different. The charger plug is now a regular small plug (a definite improvement), not a huge hair dryer type plug (like was on the previous 2 I had) and the writing/font on the handle is a slightly different color. Also, the brush head fits tighter and is a little more difficult to taken on/off (nothing out of the ordinary, but definitely not a loose/easy fit like the first 2). I have been using this latest replacement for almost 2 months with no problems, but the 3-4 month mark is where I had problems on the other 2. I will update this review if this replacement starts to have issues.</li>
            <li> I had thought that the Clarisonic was just a rotating brush and for that it was grossly overpriced, like by $150. I read several testimonial at the dermatologist&#x27;s office and was still skeptical but decided to look up the reviews on Amazon, and was surprised- so much so that I ordered one right away. I&#x27;m just crazy about that brush! It&#x27;s a super cleaner, and you get a pretty great face massage as well. My skin feels cleaner than it ever has when I&#x27;m done. I am getting the regular brush, I think the one that came with it is not quite enough for me, but overall I have discovered a really wonderful tool for my skin and can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> Think of how much $ you&#x27;ve spent over the years on cleansers, scrubbers, etc...think about it, seriously think about it..b/c after using this product, it made me think of how much I&#x27;ve wasted and should have spent it on this product. WHY you ask...No matter how expensive/cheap/raved about cleanser I&#x27;ve used, nothing really cleaned my face. It would either dry it up, leave some type of a residue, or just irritated my skin. After years of trial and error, I gave up, and stuck to good ol fashion water and oil of olay. I&#x27;m blessed with good skin, but I still have my problem areas. I got this as a gift. VERY GLAD I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical. I was hesitant and kinda scoffed at the idea that a rotating brush could do much for me. I felt my skin before I used the product, pretty darn smooth. I tested it after I used the product - wow, it made my before skin feel like sand paper. I just knew that it cleaned out buildup of product (makeup, cleanser, lotion, whatever) because my skin actually GLOWED. I used the standard 2 minutes function on my t-zone. It really buffed away some spots that had raised bumps before. Pretty insane b/c I really didn&#x27;t think I need this product. I could only imagine what it could do for people who have problematic skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all the products i&#x27;ve bought/used before couldn&#x27;t even come close...made me feel like I did waste a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else do iI like about the Pro vs. the Mia - the 4 speed rules - only because I want it. I end up using the standard speed a lot for me face. It also seems like the handle is a little bit bigger than the regular model. I don&#x27;t think the Clarisonic cleaners that it comes with are all that fabulous. My skin feels a little bit drier than when I use some other stuff - I recommend you use your own cleansers (as long as it doesn&#x27;t have exfoliants in it. If it does, then take the brush off the machine after each use to clean it out - or it will cause build up. I like that there are grooves under the brushes so water can flow out and not stay stagnant in the machine. The design of the handle is ergonomic and comfortable to use. I would suggest making it lighter - when you&#x27;re using the body brush, it gets to be a little heavy after a few runs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the brush head that it comes with. Great for sensitive skin, great at all modes of the machine (I use the Pro mode for m t-zone and chin - my problem areas) - about once a week. I use it every other day on the normal speed. And alternate with the body brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I find most valuable - BODY BRUSH! This is what really hit me. I&#x27;ve tried different types of brushes and exfoliants, but my skin just wasn&#x27;t baby soft. I&#x27;ve spent $ at spas doing a full body scrub. Yeh, my skin is silky smooth awesome, but it only lasts for a few days, then I feel a few dry spots here and there. Not anymore!!! Dry spots GONE. Skin Smooth. It&#x27;s amazing. What I spent for 2 body scrubs &#x3D; this machine. It makes me happy. PLUS this has cleared up dry spots that body scrubs have missed - the back of my thighs and upper arms. My skin is like butter now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRUSHES - find some online -there are deals out there.r can flow out and not stay stagnant in the machine.

            <li> I received my order today.  My Clarisonic Pro \\&quot;Deluxe\\&quot; 4 Speed Skin Care System &amp; Spot Therapy Kit was packaged and shipped by Fab Products.  The unit looks completely brand new and packaging was perfect.  I am somewhat confused by the word \\&quot;Deluxe\\&quot; being used on many of the adds on Amazon and such.  I do not see the word \\&quot;Deluxe\\&quot; anywhere.  I will also point out I have read reviews where buyers want to know where the Spot Therapy Kit is, well it is the extra brush and refining skin polish, which does not come with the base kit.        I&#x27;ll give it a try over the next week and review more.  Thanks.          Three weeks in and I am loving the system.  I am using the Clarisonic with Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant and am having great results.  My pores are smaller, my skin is smoother and more firm.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> My wife has been after me to get her a Clarisonc for a while, so for her birthday I ordered one and had it delivered to the house. She loves this thing and uses it at least twice a day. You know the old saying when the wife is happy we are both happy</li>
            <li> Turns out all that has been said about the product is pretty much true. I wasn&#x27;t convinced a cleansing system should cost so much but the girl friend&#x27;s elatedand that more than makes up for it. She says it works great and she&#x27;s been secretly wanting it for a long time (wasn&#x27;t a great secret considering the information was leaked to me). The product works as described and seems to do a pretty good job of making sure the skin looks and feels fresh.    Guys, get this thing. It will make her happy.</li>
            <li> This has been a great face cleaner, the sonic system relaxes and soothes as well as it cleans.    My face feels refreshed after using.    Variety of brush/bristle types and cleaners.    Holds its charge for a very nice length of time.  Travels well.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money. It thoroughly cleans your skin and removes oil from pores.I have extremely oily skin and even though I wear oil-free foundation I used to get breakouts all the time even though I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s.  Ever since I purchased this product I have had fewer breakouts and less oilier skin. My pores seem smaller as well. Before I had Clarisonic I had trouble cleaning and washing all the impurities off of my face, but with Clarisonic I can wash my face in a few seconds and there wont be a trace of anything. I just love this product and I wish it existed when I was a teenager!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and my pores are almost invisible and I used to have kind of big looking pores.  This cleansing brush feels like a face massage.  I really love it, no problems or complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This has lasted a long time.  I do not use it as often as instructed, but it does a great job cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> I have had rosacea for 15 years, and have always suffered with itchy, flaky, unpleasant skin as a result.  Despite treatments with antibiotics and topical medicines, i didn&#x27;t see a major improvement until my aesthetician introduced me to revaleskin products, and the Clarisonic.  The combination of non-irritating cleanser [[ASIN:B00150DBN2 Revaleskin Facial Cleanser with Exclusive 0.1% Coffeeberry Formulation 6 Fluid Ounces (180ml) Pump Bottle]] and the gentle sonic brush help keep my skin clean, clear and flake-free.  And the revale moisturizer [[ASIN:B001185D3O Revaleskin by Revaleskin: Revaleskin Night Cream with Coffeeberry 1.7 oz]] makes sure the effect lasts all day.  I can highly recommend both products.  Just got the body brush, hoping to see the same results on my rough elbows!</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I use the facial brush twice a day and it works great.  My skin is smoother, less oily and the facial products I use are accepted so much better than before.  I use the body brush if I shower in the evening rather than the morning just because it does seem to take a bit longer since it covers less surface area than the loofah I used to use.  I&#x27;m so glad I got this product on Amazon and was able to save money and get free shipping as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at an age, 58 to be precise, where I look in the mirror and wonder just what is going wrong here. When it comes to the face yeah, I expected wrinkles, but suddenly there was no such thing as enough exfoliating. And what was up with all those blotches that were impervious to masques. I was thinking a real mask might be my only option. Then I heard about the Clarisonic and I was just desperate enough to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every morning. I use it at night when I remember to clean my face. I have had it for about a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliation issue was gone from the start. The worst blotchiness disappeared within a week. Also within a week my husband got really close, peered at my face and said, \\&quot;Your skin looks really clean. It never looked dirty, but now it looks really clean.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blotchiness is gone. While I have no way to know whether the skin is tighter or the wrinkles are disappearing, the overall visual effect is such that it looks like both have happened. I&#x27;ll take that. I use and like the body brush, though its effects are not so dramatic. In maybe the most surprising result my husband, who previously had no interest in his looks whatsoever, sometimes uses it, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you can afford it, it&#x27;s a good purchase.</li>
            <li> First impression, the box was partially opened. I didn&#x27;t care much for it. Got the item out and followed the charging instructions, and after 24 hours of charge the item never worked. And to top it off. I had to pay for a return label as if it was my fault.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and would not come back to my old way of cleaning my face.  I feel cleaner and fresher in just a minute.  It is very easy to use, is fast, and effective.  I would recommend anybody to buy this wonderful brush!</li>
            <li> CLARISONIC ONLY VIBRATES.  There is no rotating of the brush.      This product is no better than the other scrubby brushes that are avaiable for much less. (Olay)  You get a better body scrub with the \\&quot;Scrub Gloves\\&quot; you can find in most any store. As for Face, I purchase the small facial brushes that are easier and less money to replace.    My clarisonic is under the cabinet, I wish I had done better homework on my purchase.  I could&#x27;ve had a nice pair of shoes instead.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product because I absolutely love my Sonicare toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve had this product for about  a month.  While I do think it does an excellent job of cleaning my skin, and my skin definitely feels cleaner, I was a little underwhelmed.  I did not have any amazing changes in my skin and it&#x27;s quite pricey.  If I had it to do all over again, I would buy the Clarasonic Mia.  You really don&#x27;t need more than one speed, it would be more compact, cheaper, and I find I&#x27;m not using the body brush anyway.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting a Clarisonic for soooo long but really didn&#x27;t want to invest this type of money without really knowing if it worked and I have to say YES!  My face was so much softer after the  first use.  I can&#x27;t comment on the face wash clarisonic  provides but what a difference this little machine makes.  I am so happy with my purchase and would tell all women this  is worth the money for maintaining and improving your face. A+</li>
            <li> I am 45 years old, have good skin yet getting adult acne due to bio-identical hormones (highly recommend!)  my pores were getting clogged and larger, I was getting lazy in my old age, single mother, not always washing my face at night.  After first use, my pores were smaller, skin smoother, looked 5 years younger instantly.  I love it!!!  Using it once a day.... Worth it!</li>
            <li> Sonic brush worth the money it really works.My face looks so different since the first use.I use it every night.</li>
            <li> I have gone to specialists and nothing has worked, i have used home remedy treatments like egg masks or honey, lemon masks.. my face has still been scarred with deep pits. i have been made fun of my whole life with people telling me to clean my face... i sit in the shower crying while scrubbing my face for hours... i had an intuition to by this.. an i am so happy i did.. the first time i used this my face looked horrible but thats because all the pits were open.... barely touching them would squeeze that oil out.. i was amazed.. i couldn&#x27;t believe that scrubbing didn&#x27;t work but a simple brush could remove so much. it has been 5 days and... my husband and i laugh because i never knew that for the past 16 years i never looked at my face in the mirror anymore..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its sad to think... that i am only now noticing.. my acne has been there for so long..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;during my experience i noticed that also my deep pits were lessoning.. i am crying now because of all the hell i put myself through emotionally.. and I&#x27;m free...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;please don&#x27;t suffer anymore. just buy it.</li>
            <li> I received the brush very quickly and it was exactly as described.  I love this brush, it helps to clean my skin so much better than hand washing and seems to have helped my acne breakouts calm down a bit.  I would definitely recommend this product and the seller</li>
            <li> I received the Clarisonic Pro Deluxe but missing the Skin Care System w/ Spot Therapy Kit. DO NOT BUY From THEM.</li>
            <li> The product gives a man&#x27;s face a fresh look and feel after shaving. Most of the literature in the box refers to make-up and using the brushes on your decolletage--as though only half the planet is their market. I don&#x27;t have a decolletage that I know of, but this is an easy product for a man to use and see genuine results of a smoother healthier face. Every day use is fine and not overly done, because the feel of the brush is smooth.I don&#x27;t like to fuss with anything, but this is as easy to use as shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought this with holiday money last year. I have used it faithfully all year. I don&#x27;t think it affects wrinkles although the plastic surgeon on the TV show The Doctors said it would help with crow&#x27;s feet.  My wrinkles require botox and I am happy to provide it!  That said I think my skin texture and tone look much better. My husband looked at me one day and said, \\&quot;Your skin really looks nice.\\&quot; He never gives compliments....thank you Clarisonic!</li>
            <li> I bought this unit because this company was the only one that says they are selling the 2009 model, and I wanted to be sure I got the latest technology.  My face is softer and healthier looking in just a week of use.  The unit is quiet and smooth.  My 3 teenage daughters like it too, but I can&#x27;t afford to buy more of these units.  I found one called ISkin for $25.00 at Sally Beauty, and it works almost as well.  It runs on batteries, so no charger to clutter up your counter, can go in the shower and is lighter than the Clarisonic, but not quite as smooth or quiet.  Seems to be producing the same results.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the results from this product.Met all expectations.Looking foward to a smooth skintastic journey with it. Used as a family spa treatment.Love the ease of changing the brush heads.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Clairsonic Pro for 2 months and I am disappointed.  I do like the way it makes my face extra clean but that&#x27;s about all it does.  I had high hopes for it to help me stop breaking out, but it has not made a bit of change to my skin.  My skin is exactly the same since I started using it.  It is definitely not worth the almost $200 I spent on it.  I wish I would have bought the Olay device instead of this.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My skin never looked and felt better. If you have the money to blow, it is worth it. I am 30 years old, and I am very skin conscious since I live in the desert.</li>
            <li> I have PCOS and I get dry patches of skin, rough patches, dark coloration and acne very badly on my entire body. It&#x27;s very hard to maintain your skin when your hormones are all over the place! I purchased my Clarisonic Pro 2 months ago. After the FIRST USE I saw dramatic changes in my skin. My pores were less visible, my skin was much softer and my face seemed brighter. Now, two months later I couldn&#x27;t live without it. I get so many compliments, my skin is refreshed, it takes less product (lotion, makeup, ect) on my face and it just FEELS better (not to mention my acne, dark spots and dry patches are GONE).    I got a body brush head as well and it does the same. Best money I&#x27;ve EVER SPENT.</li>
            <li> I truly love this product.  In fact, I got one for my mom the week after I got my own.    When I was first debating over this product, I was on the fence about forking out so much money for it, but after hundreds of rave reviews from users on Sephora, here, and my personal friends, I decided to give it a try.      I am SOOO glad I did.  This product is really life-changing!  It&#x27;s everything it&#x27;s promised to be and more. After using it just for a day (AM and PM), my skin was glowing and looked noticably healthier.      Also, I have noticed that my products have worked better since using Clarisonic!  Yes, it is expensive, but if I&#x27;m going to spend so much on my skin products (moisturizers, eye creams, exfoliants, anti-aging creams) every year, I want to make sure I get the most of them by having the cleanest skin possible.     Everytime I use this, I feel like my skin can breathe (no need to get expensive facials anymore!).  I have also noticed my blemishes heal about three times as fast as they did before.</li>
            <li> This product removes my make up completely.  When I apply my toner afterward, there is no make up residue on the the cotton pad.  This has also helped reduce my blackheads, and I don&#x27;t break out as much since I&#x27;ve been using my Clarisonic.  I was using the sensitive brush head, but I&#x27;m now using the delicate brush head which is supposed to be even gentler.  I aslo like that there is a timer to let you know when to move on to a different area of your face.  I do find it annoying though that it automatically shuts off after one minute though.    I regret buying this model and not the Mia.  I could&#x27;ve bought the Mia and used the normal brush head on my body.  You do not have to buy this model if you want to use it on your body.  Clarisonic themselves even suggest that the normal brush head can be used below the neck on their brush head manual. Although I may have had to contend with it shutting off automatically after each minute.  With this model, when I put on the brush head for the body, the Clarisonic does not automatically shut off after a minute like it does with the facial brushes.    I also purchased my Clarisonic at Sephora, that way, the warranty was guaranteed.    Bottom line:  Don&#x27;t feel like you have to purchase this item to take care of your skin.  If you can afford it, that&#x27;s great.  If not, your skin will not suffer.  You can also use a washcloth to wash and exfoliate your face and body.  Although I have no complaints about the Clarisonic other than the expensive price tag and expensive replacement brush heads, I will not be purchasing this product again.  Furthermore, if you have extremely sensitive skin, this product may hurt your skin more than it helps.  Sensitive skin types should proceed with caution or consult their dermatologists first before making such an expensive purchase.</li>
            <li> A gift. Arrived as advertised. Receiver of gift loves it and tells all how great it is. I&#x27;ll take her word for it.</li>
            <li> The best investment I have made  awesome has helped my face feel clean and fresh due I only use once a day due to skin sensitivity but overall great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the deep pore brush head &amp; see an improvement in my pores. I wasn&#x27;t expecting the results to be this great!!</li>
            <li> I love my Clarisonic so much that I went in on this one for my sister with her husband for her birthday. She has been enjoying it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Not that user friendly. Hard to adjust speed due to only two buttons and no speed display. It also stop by itself in the middle of cleaning, don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li> I love the body brush.  My skin is smoother.  Haven&#x27;t had time to see a difference on the cellulite yet but am told it works great.    As for the facial brush, my skin is definitely smoother.  I can&#x27;t say I notice a reduction in the size of the pores or less wrinkles yet, but I&#x27;ve only been using for about 3 weeks.  Overall, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> i have used it for one week and it leaves your skin nice and smooth.  cleaner than washing by hand alone</li>
            <li> I have had my Clarisonic Pro cleaner for about a month now and so far I love it.  My face feels so much smoother and cleaner when I use it.  I even noticed that some of my fine lines seemed to have softened.  I would highly recommend this product.  The seller Uniquepath was great.  The item arrived in perfect condition and very quickly.  I ordered it on a Friday and received it on Tuesday.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Delivers everything it says it does. And the price is unbeatable. You cannot find this product for this price anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting a Clairsonic facial skin care thingamajiggy for about years now and I finally have one.  My only regret is not getting it sooner!!  For those who don&#x27;t know, it works like a &#x27;sonic&#x27; toothbrush but instead has a much larger, round facial / body brush.  Supposedly they say that it cleans your face much more effectively and that serums such as vitamin C is absorbed into the skin much more effectively. I just know that the very first time that I used it, my skin felt SMOOTHER, SOFTER and it literally had that &#x27;glow&#x27;.  What I love about it is that even after using various exfoliants on my face, they sometimes are a bit too harsh or at other times, not as effective as I&#x27;d like them to be but this Clairsonic gives me the effect of a gentle exfoliator - not too much and not too little and unlike some exfoliators, it&#x27;s not at all drying since you are essentially using your own cleansers and this &#x27;sonic&#x27; cleansing action.    I have the Pro Deluxe version which comes with 3 various levels / speeds for the face and 1 for the body.  I personally prefer the 2nd setting for my face and decollete area.  Although I&#x27;ve read both descriptions, I can&#x27;t figure out what the real difference is between the Pro Deluxe model and the ______ model.  Both seem to have 3 settings for the face and 1 for the body.  Both come with a facial brush and a brush for the body (FYI: The body brush is really soft like the facial brush, to me it just seems like it&#x27;s bigger but the texture is the same.)  My kit did come with a tube of \\&quot;Skin Polish\\&quot; to use on the body...basically an exfoliating gel to be used with the Clairsonic but there is no reason why you can&#x27;t use your own body polishers / body exfoliators and cleansers.    I will say that any downside if there is any is that the Pro Deluxe version is a bit bulky to hold...a really petite woman, young pre-teen or something with arthritic hands would most likely prefer the smaller Mia or Classic versions instead.  I knew this going inbut opted for this model anyway because of the 4th body &#x27;polishing&#x27; option.  I almost wish for the size of this, I wish there was an option to purchase a larger body brush to use on my body. It makes any skin surface so smooth that I seriously want my whole body this smooth and soft!!!  If I travelled a lot, I&#x27;d definitely purchase a smaller version to take on the road with me.  One REQUEST that I&#x27;d love Clairsonic to consider is to make a wall mount charger...this one sits on the counter and has a cord that you plug in...I&#x27;d prefer it be stored off of my bathroom counter and on the wall instead.  Between an electronic toothbrush, Hydrofloss, facial steamer and now this, my bathroom counter is looking busier than I&#x27;d prefer...    For those who are wanting a miracle makeover, I can&#x27;t say that there really is a such thing out there but I will tell you that I noticed a difference after using it just ONE time.  I&#x27;m on day #3 now and I swear - I do NOT have the greatest skin (I&#x27;m 38...still get some blemishes, I have discolorations and large pores in my T-Zone) and I can tell a SERIOUS difference now.  My pores DO LOOK smaller. Make no mistake, I don&#x27;t believe that anything can MAKE your pores shrink but I do think that if your skin is cleaner, your pores will of course be cleaner and then appear to be smaller in size.  I hope that over time, I see more improvements in my skin.  I&#x27;ll be sure to post any updates!    If I had a list of my absolute favorite things, (material that is! My children, hubby and family come first) this would DEFINITELY be included on my top 10 - MAYBE even top 5 list!! Just maybe...  Considering that my water ionizer, car GPS system are my top 2, that&#x27;s saying A LOT!!    Men out there, PERSONALLY, I think a Clairsonic would make an AWESOME girly gift for that special lady in your life...whether it be your wife, girlfriend, sister or Mom.  Without sounding like a commercial, ladies, this item is TOTALLY worth treating yourself for!! Like I said, Ionly wish that I had it sooner!! Be prepared to add on a few minutes to your morning &amp; night skin care routine.      PS- The mfg suggests removing the brush head and cleaning it out once a week...personally I&#x27;m reluctant not to do it after every use...I rinse out my handle and each brush and let them air dry to avoid it getting icky.</li>
            <li> Cleanses pores deeply, removing old sebum, dead skin and bacteria; skin feels invigorated and smooth. After two weeks complexion is radiant. Very good porduct. I especially like the cleansers that come with it. Very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Kelly</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 3 weeks and my pores have become much smaller.  Leaves face very clean.  Removes dead skin.</li>
            <li> Initally experienced misunderstanding with seller wrt product; however, the seller was great at promptly resolving the problem...would definitely use this seller again. Plus the product is a 5-star!</li>
            <li> Received my order within days ... the seller was extremely proactive when I thought that I did not receive the body brush (which I did, but threw in the trash by mistake). Based on their prompt &amp; very positive response I would purchase product from them again.  Impressed with the quality of Clarisonic Pro; have only used it three times, but feel that it will be extremely effective.</li>
            <li> I have every skin issue a person can have- mid-30&#x27;s fine wrinkles, combo skin to the extreme, acne, flaking, oily patches, some discoloration...so needless to say, after I read these reviews, I was sold on this very expensive machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually really like the Clarisonic Pro.  My skin feels clean, and it helped with some of the flaking, but I noticed some cystic acne issues that I hadn&#x27;t had prior to using this.  Yeah, I know that supposedly it&#x27;s bringing all the impurities to the surface...but seriously, that&#x27;s not the way acne works.  I think the motion of the brush (vibrates really fast, doesn&#x27;t spin), has a tendency to push sloughing skin back into the pores, leading to more breakouts and in my case, some cystic acne.  This was really only an issue for the first month I used it, and I did use it at least once a day, every day, sometimes twice.  I always used it on freshly cleansed skin- I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using it to take your makeup off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few thoughts on it and what I may have done to contribute to the early issues:&lt;br /&gt;While I routinely exfoliated my face, I&#x27;d never used anything like this, and it certainly does pack a punch on a full charge at high speed.  I probably should have started off on low...but who does that?  I wanted to see what this thing could do, and it&#x27;s definetly powerful.  I used a very gentle cleanser with it, one you can buy at the drug store.  I found that my Elizabeth Arden cleanser worked much better with it however, so now I try to stick with that even though it&#x27;s more expensive.  This product is meant to really exfoliate your skin, so your products aren&#x27;t just sitting on top of dead skin cells- in retrospect, it makes more sense to use nicer products since they&#x27;re actually going to making a difference.  I also moved the wand around a lot, in addition to the pulsating action, so I have no doubt that I was adding to the irritation.  My post treatment moisturizers were probably too heavy.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest dropping a bundle of new facial products until you use this for a few weeks.  How your skin reacts to them prior to using the Clarisonic is no indication of how they&#x27;ll work for you after using it.  Now I use a much lighter formula that works great.  Wash the brush thoroughly after each use, that&#x27;s a given.  Wash it, then wash it again.  Change the brush head as suggested, even if yours looks fine and feels fine, it&#x27;s going to breed bacteria no matter how well you clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the size of my pores, and it didn&#x27;t get rid of my blackheads.  After the inital breakouts, I didn&#x27;t really notice that my complexion improved significantly, but my products do work better, which has led to better skin of late.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in fine lines, and only minimal improvement in elasticity.  It won&#x27;t improve scars or discoloration on its own, at least it didn&#x27;t for me, but if you combine its use with a lightening agent, then you&#x27;ll see results quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this isn&#x27;t a stand alone device.  To really benefit from it, you need to find the right cleanser, and post treatment, good quality products that work for your skin and address your issues.  There are a few dupes on the market for much less, and of those, I&#x27;ve only used the Neutrogena one, and the one you can buy at Sally&#x27;s Beauty store for 20 dollars.  Both of those were junk, honestly.  I&#x27;ve heard of a few others, and maybe they&#x27;re as good without the hefty price tag- who knows.  In the end, I knew I&#x27;d always want a Clarisonic just based on the reviews, so perhaps it&#x27;s best that I went ahead and bit the bullet instead of spending the extra 100 dollars on something else, just to purchase this later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no charging issues, and a single overnight charge will last me a full week.  I keep it off the charging base until it&#x27;s ready to be fully recharged, and then I let it sit overnight only.  I think the battery issues come from recharging before the battery is low- I know I&#x27;ve had that issue with many rechargable items in the past.  No issues taking it into the shower, or getting it wet.  It&#x27;s definitely a quality product.e had that issue with many rechargable items in the past.

            <li> This is WONDERFUL. My skin glows after I use it. I did not have any negative reactions and while it did not eliminate my acne, it does help to reduce it. To buy this is to invest in yourself and you certainly deserve it. Besides, with a 3 year warranty, you can&#x27;t beat it with a stick.</li>
            <li> I love the clarisonic. After just one use I am hooked. My skin feels so much smoother and feels so soft. Exchanging the face brush and body brush is so easy. 1 minute on the face twice daily and several minutes in the shower on the full body makes a huge difference to this old ladies skin.</li>
            <li> I had been thinking about purchasing this item for quite some time but was a bit nervous about the cost and the fact that I&#x27;ve been disappointed before.  I am happy to say that I think it was worth every cent!  So easy to use, I have already found a difference in my skin.  I love the Spot Therapy Kit as well and would highly recommend it to everyone!  Not only is this unit great for my skin, but I find I use much less cleanser making it a money saver as well.  I only wish I had bought it sooner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Clarisonic PRO Deluxe Professional 4-Speed Skin Care System for about a month now and I&#x27;ve been pleased with the results so far.  I use it twice daily on my face and neck with my own cleanser (noevir).   My skin was very dry from having air conditioning blowing on me all day at work (I live in Hawaii) and my skin needed exfoliation badly since I was using heavier creams for my dry skin.  I actually have had very oily, acne-prone skin most of my life.  Now that my skin is exfoliated by the Clarisonic, my skin is smoother and my makeup goes on much easier without emphasizing a lot of rough areas of skin.  Many tiny bumps have gone away or grown smaller and the skin on my neck has a younger texture. I wish I had more facial brushes so other family members could have their own individual brushes to use with the one Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> My skin care professional recommended the Clairisonic Skin Care system and I am so glad I purchased it, although I was wary of the price at first glance.  I saved quite a bit buying it at Amazon rather than through the salon.  I notice a difference in how my face feels after using it only just over a week AND I actually wash my face more often because I can feel how effective it is. Plus, it&#x27;s fun! I also like the sample they sent of their cleanser. I have found no drawbacks to the system yet, and my order arrived promptly just as described. I was very satisfied with the entire purchase and would recommend this product without reservation.</li>
            <li> This product is the best I have purchased , had one before and I use it all the time and always will !!!</li>
            <li> I have had a clarisonic for at least 3 years (the same one) and I can&#x27;t say enough about it.  I recently bought one for 2 of my daughters as graduation presents and will buy one for my 3rd daughter in December when she graduates!  My pores have never been clearer or smaller.  I will continue to use it forever!</li>
            <li> Product is easy to work. I&#x27;m showing good results after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;Appears to be very durable. Luv it!</li>
            <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to use, easy to handle, not heavy. Clarisonic is like a mechanical toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;+ There are two buttons, one to turn it on/off, and the other is good for the speeds. For the \\&quot;Pro\\&quot; Model, there are 3 speeds for the faces, and 2 speeds for the body.&lt;br /&gt;+ 60-Second timer for your face, which is plenty of time to fully remove make up, so my white towels stay white when drying off. I can no longer be lazy to wash my make up off before going to bed. I can see that my pores are clean and it feels like my facial products, like moisturizers, can work more effectively now.&lt;br /&gt;+ 3-Minute timer for your body, so I will focus on one part of the body each day, or use it multiple times in one long shower. I hate scrubbing my body with a loofah sponge or a face towel. Let&#x27;s just say... I don&#x27;t take quick showers anymore!!&lt;br /&gt;+ Clarisonic claims that the battery life is good for 30 minutes (or washing twice a day &#x3D; 2 weeks). I found it lasted a few days when washing the face twice per day plus a few times for my body, which did not last during my 1-week vacation, so I was out of luck for a few days since I did not bring my charger.&lt;br /&gt;+ Comes with plastic covers/caps, one for the facial brush head and another one for the spot body brush head, which are handy when traveling or trying to dry the brush heads. By the way, buying replacement brush heads usually include a new plastic cover/cap.&lt;br /&gt;+ Battery life indicator (4 green dots) is on the back of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;+ The brush heads are easy to rotate, remove, clean and replace. The brush heads are supposed to last 3-4 months, but I have only had it since February. After I clean off my foundation make up, I rinse the brush head, wash it for a few seconds with hand soap, and then leave it out to dry. By the way, the brush heads can be found for $20 nowadays (save $5 off retail price).&lt;br /&gt;+ Waterproof so it can be used in and out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS (or room for improvement)&lt;br /&gt;- The power cord is permanently connected to the docking station (charging base), so it&#x27;s not easy to wrap up for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;- Does not come with a travel bag, but there is a Spot Therapy Kit on sale for $50, which includes the Spot body brush head, exfoliating Clarisonic Body Polish (6 oz, full size), and a travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;- The brush head does not seem to dry overnight, so make sure to tilt or face it down to drain the water. I suggest removing the brush head once in awhile to get any trapped dirty water out.&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t always leave it in the docking station because a tiny bit of water collects at the bottom even though there is a small hole for draining.&lt;br /&gt;- The retail price of $225 is pricey, so I bought my first one on eBay which included extra brush heads, but now Amazon is offering it at a competitive price, so I plan on buying a second one to keep at my boyfriend&#x27;s place.

            <li> Good product.  An effective device for efficient and thorough face cleansing.  Conveniently rechargeable.  Large brush surface is another superior feature.</li>
            <li> Well , i saw the ad. liked it but when i got it i was a disappointed ,  It is not worth the amount i paid for it , any ordinary manual facial brush can do the same.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today - it came in 2 days and I have to say, I&#x27;m very pleased! I was surprised at how nice and comfortable it feels on the face. The scrubbing is not abrasive at all - its very therapeutic and relaxing. It gently vibrates and massages the face while giving it a very thorough cleaning. My face felt great afterwards and it seems to do an excellent job. I would have liked to got the one with the various brushes, just to try them - so that would be my only suggestion is to take a look at the options that come with 3 brushes.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift to my wife, and she say&#x27;s it&#x27;s the best gift I ever gave (above the diamonds dear??)!  Her skin looks awesome ....... radiant even!  Invest in the future of her face, and jump it ........ she&#x27;ll love you for the results and for thinking of her in this way.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! Skin is much smother even after first use. Can not wait to use it again and again. Bye-bye scrubs and itchy acne products.&lt;br /&gt;One of the best purchases for myself!</li>
            <li> This device is gentle yet effective as a facial and spot treatment cleanser.  Highly recommend.  Best price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Used for 6 weeks saw no difference in my skin-did see a few more light wrinkles. I already have wrinkles and do not need any more.  Felt good while using, that is the one star!</li>
            <li> Using this device daily on my face, and once or twice a week on my body, has improved my skin tremendously...less breakouts and much smoother, with better appearance of makeup.  I highly recommend it.  The gel cleanser and body scrub that are included are also very nice, and I plan to order more of these.</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with acne, but it had cleared up for awhile.  Thinking that I could use \\&quot;normal people\\&quot; skin care products, I bought this based on the rave reviews, looking to just boost a healthy glow, exfoliate, etc.  I started breaking out immediately, which I had heard might happen but would go away.  It didn&#x27;t go away.  I discontinued use after 1-2 weeks, and my skin has continued to break out to such an extent that I think I have to go back to the dermatologist for the first time in 10 years.  My face hasn&#x27;t been this bad since I was in high school (I am in my late 20s now).  It&#x27;s impossible to say if it is directly a result of this product, but all I know is that my skin flared up immediately after my use of the clarisonic brush.  I would steer clear if you have ever had problems with acne, even if you are currently not breaking out.</li>
            <li> My daughter has informed me that she is very happy with this product.  I gave it to her for her birthday.  She indicated it was what she really wanted.  And she loves it.</li>
            <li> My skin is so clear &amp; smooth!&lt;br /&gt;Love this product plus it has a body brush! No more dry skin for this girl</li>
            <li> I have used my Clarisonic daily for two months now and love the way it makes my face feel.  I love that it can be used in the shower so it becomes part of your daily routine quite easily.</li>
            <li> I wanted this for a long time before I was finally able and willing to spend the cash to get this brush -I bought it based on all of the great reviews and I&#x27;ve not been disappointed. The brush will get your skin VERY  clean and really clear out your pores. I don&#x27;t mind the sample cleansers that came with the brush but you can use other cleansers and it really will work just as well, may be some trial and error there to find what you like. However, do be mindful of what you put on your skin AFTER you use this brush, since as I mentioned your pores will be pretty open, if you use a moisurizer that is too thick or put make-up on right away, I think you could have a little problem.  That having been said, I am sure there are many people who don&#x27;t have a problem with that, it probably just depends on your skin and how prone you are to breaking out. In any case, my skin never looks better than after using this brush followed by a good mask and favorite cream, it was worth the money. Oh, but be warned the battery can run out quickly, I make sure to always store it on the charger so I don&#x27;t find the battery running out on me when I need it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and your skin will feel so clean and exfoliated.&lt;br /&gt;Your skin glows and is fresher and brighter.</li>
            <li> No receipt came with the order, although it arrived in a reasonable amount of time. There&#x27;s a warning you can&#x27;t return it without a receipt, so that should arrive with a product &amp; that is a first not receiving an invoice/receipt with an order. That&#x27;s part of why there&#x27;s a 4 star rating given. The other part of why is, it is a good product, but you get the feeling that even a better level can be obtained in a stronger, durable, lasting, facial machine.  Facials just feel good, &amp; I know they can feel even better.  As for the product, I was glad to get it in the mail &amp; experienced facial relief at first for the first nice facial. I use a really neat powdered clay product that give the best result of any facials I do with other nice products.  ZeoForce is one of the neatest internal detoxifying powdered clays, but when used as a facial after wetting the brush of the Clarisonic, there is a very refined noticeable nice affect on your face/neck. I wish there were larger facial brushes sold though, the size given &amp; sold is good, but it&#x27;d be nice to have a facial brush the size of the body brush.  Sometimes the Clarisonic feels like a nice facial massage, but needs to cover a larger facial/neck area. I&#x27;m not sure if the Clarisonic supports enough power to affect a larger area of your face for a purposeful facial massage or not, but that kind of a machine would be nice.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product on the market for facial cleaning. I could not believe how much makeup was left on my face after traditional cleaning until I started using the Clarisonic. It changed my complexion. Also, it has a timer for each section of your face so you know how long to scrub each area.</li>
            <li> Good product, but I don&#x27;t know if I saw any huge improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li> I got this before my wedding so that I would have a lovely fresh face without having to go get facials every week in the months leading up to the big day, and it was totally worth it.  The Clarisonic helped reduce my acne and revealed softer skin.  Love!</li>
            <li> This has worked great for my wife!</li>
            <li> A Clarisonic Pro Deluxe was ordered in mid-December and never arrived. Their customer service did not respond to my repeated requests for information regarding the shipment status. I had to file a claim with Amazon to receive refund. Awaiting refund at this time. I do not recommend that anyone make a purchase from the company Queen Bee Supply. I only gave it one star because I had to enter at least one star. It deserves zero.</li>
            <li> DO YOUR RESEARCH. Although this product is AMAZING for me- it may be unnecessary for you. Every person&#x27;s skin is different. Although I do not suffer from \\&quot;acne\\&quot; I do have an extremely oily t-zone and large unsightly, dirty pores on both my chin and across the bridge of my nose. Yuck!    I have always used a healthy skin care regimen and the Clarisonic only adds to that. What used to take 3 pumps of soap, to get a desirable lather, now only takes one pump- thus I&#x27;m not purchasing $18 bottles of face soap as often as before. My skin is instantly smoother and cleaner than by hand. I no longer experience that \\&quot;tight\\&quot; sensation I used to, which was often followed by oily skin. In the past, I would wash my face, go to bed and wake up with an oily face. Not with the Clarisonic. It has literally reduced the oils that my skin produces.     My pores are no longer clogged with black dirt &amp; oil. They are cleaner and smaller. Overall, my face is the best it has been in years! I am 25 years old. I plan on using this little miracle for years to come. :)     As for the product itself- it is pricey but shop around and you&#x27;ll find a deal somewhere. The handle is large- but not overly large or heavy for that matter. I wash my face twice a day and sometimes use the fourth body speed in the shower. I have a habit of charging mine nightly, so I can&#x27;t speak for the overall length of charge. The brushes come with caps, which are useful when attaching and detaching from the unit; I suppose they also serve a sanitary purpose. Unit is waterproof, so I can use it in the shower, while taking a bath or just at the bathroom sink- with no worries of ruining it.     THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT! My husband has his own brush head and I use it on his jaw line to eliminate ingrown facial hairs from shaving.</li>
            <li> I had acne ever since puberty. And this cleared my acne despite the negative reviews I&#x27;ve read from people with acne. I think the reason is that I didn&#x27;t use the facial wash that came with the device; I kept using my own (Paula&#x27;s Choice) the anti-acne wash gel.    Why I Love It:  1. Nice design, it&#x27;s not hard to hold it or too heavy to carry it.  2. Reduced the time I spend washing my face every morning.  3. I KNOW for sure now that I am effectively using the whole amount of the facial wash that I&#x27;m pouring. This creates a lather and lather is what cleans dirt, not just rubbing.  4. Using this regularly smoothed my skin because this will actually exfoliate (it&#x27;s a brush!).  5. It is so easy to change the brush -which makes it possible for you to share the device with someone.  6. You can use a body brush and you don&#x27;t even have to set up the speed.... etc; it&#x27;ll automatically know and set up itself. You can use an exfoliating scrub for your body as well.  7. You can totally use it under water in the bath... risk free.  8. Charging it is so easy, just put it in the cradle.  9. You can use it for a loooooooong time before recharging (it takes just one minute to wash your face!! -so it won&#x27;t consume the battery fast).... Unless you&#x27;re using the body brush, you&#x27;re gonna have to recharge before and after.  10. Multiple speeds!  11. Multiple brushes availble!  12. You can use it with whatever facial wash you want -some others force you to buy theirs or some sort of inserts that contain the wash and are activated by water... etc... this one is basically a brush.  13. Good quality.    What needs to be improved:  1. It lasts only for 20 minutes if used with the body brush.  2. The price is a bit high!  3. A second cradle (other than the charging one) for if you want to keep your clarisonic somewhere near the bathroom but don&#x27;t want to put the charger there... (water spillage or something.  4. Low battery warning would be awesome. Actually; I need this!      I highly recommend the brush. I didn&#x27;t use (or try) the products though, I used my own.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  My sister works in a derm office and recommended it for me, because I have acne-prone skin.  It truly does make a difference; my skin has never looked better!  After I first bought it, though, my charger stopped working after about 3 or 4 months.  I was very busy with two babies at the time, so I never tried to take it back or call Clarisonic.  I just put it under my cabinet for over a year.  However, I finally decided to call about it to see if they could send me a replacement charger.  I didn&#x27;t expect them to because it had been so long.  Much to my surprise, they sent me a whole new unit, because the one I bought was out of production.  I have now been using the new one for well over six months, and it works fabulously.  I don&#x27;t usually review items but felt compelled to log on to share my great experience!</li>
            <li> Probably the best birthday gift I&#x27;ve ever received.     My skin has always been terrible. Well, since middle school. Acne, adult acne, oily, dry, patchy. It&#x27;s been a small nightmare. Now that I&#x27;m in my 20s, my skin has a bit less acne and a bit more dryness. Mostly in patches. Anyway, this little scrubber has done wonders. I used to exfoliate daily and my skin never felt \\&quot;clean\\&quot;. It always felt like there was a still huge layer of dead skin. Not anymore. My skin feels the way I never thought it could. It&#x27;s smooth, it feels fresh, it feels clean. When I use this on a regular basis, I have virtually no dryness. (I do moisturize.) I don&#x27;t know what else to say about how great it is. It&#x27;s just really improved the texture and overall look of my skin.    The only downside is the battery life. It&#x27;s pretty squat. Basically, it has to be charging when not in use. With the face heads, I could probably get 2-3 uses out of it in 2 days before it has to be charged. Lately, I&#x27;ve had the body head on it, and even if it charges all night or 24hrs +, it doesn&#x27;t even last 1 min off the charger. Not sure if there is something wrong with mine or that&#x27;s normal. But it never did that with the face heads.     But overall, the battery issues aside, I love, love this product.</li>
            <li> Am so happy I bought this - my aging and acne-prone skin has never looked better.  Having the different speeds and the beeps make it v easy.  Any cleanser works, and I am using the deep pore cleansing brush for my face - Love the body brush in the shower.  Definitely worth the money - my serums and makeup go on much more smoothly and I need less.  Am so happy I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> I truly recomend this ! The best thing u can buy for ur face , no more pimbles no more rough skin , no more oily skin , i use it twice a day if im applying make up , and once if im not applying make up , before bed time , it leaves my skin glowing and smooth LOVE IT !</li>
            <li> This is a good product (overpriced in my opinion) for many people and does clean the skin well, if you&#x27;re careful and don&#x27;t overuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, If any of you get Botox injections (between eyebrows for example), and you use it in the same area often, your botox effects will NOT last long. I am saying as this happened to me -- I couldn&#x27;t figure out why my botox injections weren&#x27;t lasting as before and figured this was the reason. You might want to use a peel or something in those areas and not use your device there. Just an FYI to any other mature folks out there like me who may indulge in the freeze or the fill here and there!</li>
            <li> Very convenient for face. This is not the case for the body, the brush is too small , and it takes too much time to use it for the&lt;br /&gt;whole body. I will recommand it only for face</li>
            <li> I love my clarisonic. I use it every night to wash my face. My skin feels so clean &amp; I get compliments on my skin all the time.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think I needed this product until after I had a facial during vacation.  I so loved how it felt, I purchased one when I returned home.  Great investment for me and my husband (he loves it too!).  My skin looks so much better and just feels clean.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it about 3 times a week and it has really helped keep my skin clear and clean.</li>
            <li> I have tried both the Clarasonic Mia and the Pro and have to say their is a BIG difference with the Pro. WIth the Mia ,it just feels like something is vibrating on your skin but the Pro really scrubs the skin and is a great exfoliator. My skin has a nice rosy glow after using and moisturizer seems to go on more nicely as well as make-up. I am not prone to breakouts but get them every once in awhile. However, my face has not shown the slightest sign of a pimple since I began using the Pro.</li>
            <li> This is my second Clarisonic. I dropped the first three times and it broke. I really missed the great&lt;br /&gt;results. I&#x27;ve always had a good complection with very few breakouts. This is worth having for me&lt;br /&gt;Because it keeps the dead skin sloughed off. It makes your skin feel so soft and smooth. Your&lt;br /&gt;Foundation goes on so much nicer and doesn&#x27;t cake up any where. I like to take it in the shower&lt;br /&gt;Since its waterproof. The charge stays good for quite a long while, so I don&#x27;t have to take the charger&lt;br /&gt;when I take a short trip. Using this product everyday will increase your skins texture,circulation,and&lt;br /&gt;reduces the appearance of pores. I love it!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and have received compliments about how fresh and bright my skin is.  My husband actually made a comment about how my face seems brighter!  I am happy that I bought this item.  It is a great investment.</li>
            <li> I bought the device on October 7 2011.  It had a three years warranty period.  The device stopped working/running on December 2013.</li>
            <li> I believe I received a defective device.  Used it as suggested and it died after 3 days use.  Wouldn&#x27;t charge.  Had to return it to the seller for exchange but received an e-mail that my monies would be refunded to my credit card.  Keeping a check on my credit card account to ensure that it was indeed refunded.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple of weeks so I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed diminished lines or smaller pores quite yet! But it cleans really well and I really like the Clarisonic cleansers it came with. The spot therapy brush for the body is fantastic. I&#x27;ve really noticed improved softness/smoothness on my arms,legs,decollote...wherever you use it! I&#x27;m glad I decided to finally purchase it.</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic is a great product that leaves your skin feeling soft and very clean.&lt;br /&gt;It can be used every day since it is so gentle on your skin. It keeps pores clean and&lt;br /&gt;clear and helps to prevent blemishes My man and I both use it daily.</li>
            <li> Love this product, and my skin has never been cleaner or healthier! A must for anyone who is serious about skin care.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. I am fortunate to not have bad breakouts, but what I do have are a lot of whiteheads. This helps my skin prevent whitehead breakouts. Even though they are few it&#x27;s just so annoying! I always used to wash my face regularly with my hands and very nice soap for skin, but this definitely works better not to mention I get compliments on my skin all the time now because of how smooth it looks. Either from this or the combined products I use all together.</li>
            <li> For a year I had been comtemplating trying the Clarisonic out. After shopping around, this was the best deal. It comes with the body brush and extension handle (which I did not find awkward to use as some claim), sensitive facial brush, and a sample of the body and face washes, (face wash was a little drying for me). Included was a &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; subscription to Women&#x27;s Fitness Magazine, or you could send cancellation and get the $10 refunded, vs filling out the info card to receive the magazine. Also a few coupons good for purchases made from the Clarisonic website. If you do not buy straight from Clarisonic or authorized dealer, you are out of your money if something happens to your unit. I took the risk and have had no problems and have been enjoying my Clarisonic for five months now. The &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; model does have four speeds, which I love and has a beep/pause for facial cleansing so that you don&#x27;t overdo it. The beep/pause CAN be turned off and the instructions are in the manual. After five months, my skin texture is baby smooth and glowing. I have found that I need to be more careful of what I put on my skin now, as using the Clarisonic really does help products penetrate more efficiently. I had to scale back my every day use of 10% glycolic acid toner to twice a week, and switch to a much lighter moisturizing cream while getting better results (and saving some money).</li>
            <li> My Nu Skin Cleansers work even better with this.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it will clean batter &amp; minimize pores.... it does not  i try it for 6 months ........ nothing change   a full charge Will not be enough for a good face exfoliation or the body for this matter  so i can not use it when i want   it needs to charge for 24 hours every time i use it for 3 min bad battery life  it is sounds &amp; lights  in  $200 Skin Care System like any $20 Device  no LCD screen  so it is Hard to set  speed &amp; you can&#x27;t configure the timer  it is heavy , big &amp; pricy $200 for exfoliation Device   that you can&#x27;t use any exfoliating cleanser with   the 3 cleansers is useless   the refining skin polish for the body is good but not that great    now i use Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System   [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]  it is much batter in exfoliation   the Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser is great product   it use  2 AA batteries  i use Energizer® Rechargeable Batteries with it  [[ASIN:B00339NINQ Energizer Value Charger with AA Rechargeable Batteries, 4 Batteries Included]]  it is only $26 for a great face exfoliation Device it is a good purchase  but the Clarisonic purchase was a bad choice</li>
            <li> My skin has never been healthier and had such a glow. I&#x27;m very sensitive but I can use this without irritation.</li>
            <li> I have a Clarisonic Pro and have used it for several years.  I have bought one for each of my daughters, and they love it too.  It really helps cleanse and leaves your face feeling smooth!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!!!! Gets my face super clean in less time. My skin is smooth and clear. My clean routine went from fail to fab!!!!  The body brush is so relaxing and has my skin sooo soft! Addicted to this brush.</li>
            <li> good quality. I like it and I have used machine more than 1 week. My face is totally clean. Work very well.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, seller provides good after-sales service.</li>
            <li> I noticed a dramatic difference in the texture of my skin quite quickly. My large pores seemed to disappear and smooth out combined with a moisturizer afterward. This was by far the most extravagant item I have ever purchased for myself and I was quite hesitant until I found this item on amazon and I saved so much I was able to get over the guilt. I love it.  Everything as described thank you for the fast turnover and delivery.</li>
            <li> This product came rapidly through standard shipping and included the body attachment which is an additional part I wasn&#x27;t expecting. Ive been using it for a few weeks only so am expecting more longterm results but no complaints about it&#x27;s workability.</li>
            <li> Best product I ever bought for my skin. My spouse and I each bought one. Amazing skin care product. Going to buy the Pedicure model next.</li>
            <li> its not working - i had 2 of them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Clarisonic Pro for about a month now. I saw this on tv last year and wanted one since but thought they were expensive. Then I decided to take the plunge. Another thing holding me back was, was it going to work. The skeptic in me said, we&#x27;ll see how it works. I have to say two weeks in the big pores on my forehead started to shrink. Even an acne scar I had on my nose since high school in the seventies started to get smaller as well. Another thing I noticed was the laugh lines started to fade. I&#x27;m a believer this works. My only regret is that I wish I would have bought it much sooner.</li>
            <li> Now that I have been using my Clarisonic for a month, I have to admit it works like a charm. No problems and enjoy the fresher feeling it provides. I was a little skeptical but had listened to friends talk about theirs for years, so decided to give it a try and get serious about improving my skin&#x27;s quality/texture. So far, so good, and it kind of motivates me to stick to a regimen of cleaning, moisturizing, and sun protection. The body brush was a bonus that I haven&#x27;t yet tried. :)&lt;br /&gt;PS It arrived in less than the predicted week.</li>
            <li> If you have skin and don&#x27;t use this, you&#x27;re crazy.  Combined with the tanda red light, it&#x27;s cutting edge, medcially sound skin care.  Buy the pro.</li>
            <li> Ok, I am seeing the best dermatologist in Texas.  I started using the clarisonic two weeks AFTER I started my oral/topical acne medication.  I started using Tazorac as a topical overnight along with Solodyn orally in the morning...over the course of 3 months to completely destroy all current and future acne.  At first, as with anything, I started to break out.  As soon as most of the acne ceased to \\&quot;purge\\&quot;, I started using the Aria model.  Right now, that is the most powerful, most convenient Clarisonc.  Within a week, I saw a HUGE reduction in not only outbreaks, but oil production, pore size and overall skin tone.  My skin looks and feels fresh and new.  I personally have extremely oily, acne prone skin and texture.  I am using a dermal clay cleanser for my skin type by Dermologica and it works extremely well with my clarisonic(s).  I now use the pro (top of the line) and the Aria when out of town.  I use it two to three times per day and I always use a cetaphil moisturizer right after, to make sure my skin is hydrated.  Within 3 months I will be done with acne altogether, but my clarisonic will keep my skin fresh and clean.  Due to my process, I never experienced the usual \\&quot;purge\\&quot; from the Clarisonic.  BTW, almost every negative review I have read, has been due to the cleanser NOT a problem with the machine.  Many people are pressing too hard/not cleaning their brush heads properly/using the wrong brush heads for their skin and or using the wrong cleansers for their skin AND the clarisonic.  Do your research and I recommend seeing a dermatologist at least ONCE to ensure you are doing everything correctly.  I got my Aria on ebay for $150 and my Pro from blushbeautystore.com for $168, with all the bells and whistles.  The former is not an authorized dealer, so there is no warranty.  Make sure to dry the brushes fairly well, as bacteria does develop.  Also, make sure to replace the brushes every 60 uses.  I have the acne head and the deep pore head for now.  Ebay sells the brushes for about $14-15 each, the best I&#x27;ve found and also sells larger supplies for sometimes cheaper.  The pro is the very best but the Aria is the best if your on the move...good luck :)</li>
            <li> It is a good value for the money. I got the Mia 2 last year and my dad likes it and took it. So I figure I would upgrade to the Clarisonic Pro which allows me to use it on face and body. It is a bit heavy for a small person when using the handle on body. But overall it is very good.</li>
            <li> bought for pre-teen and teen. family have been using for only a short time. however, saw almost immediate improvement in their skin texture and clearing of skin.surprised that worked so quickly and did not traumatize skin</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my clarisonic. I am so happy with my purchase. I have seen a huge difference in my skin. I love the timer and the wand for getting your whole body. I have dropped it a couple times and it had not affected it at all. If your thinking about getting it I would highly recommend it. Great product. 😃</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this seller, received product as promised and shipped in a timely fashion.  I gave this Clarisonic Pro as a gift to a friend and she reports she just loves it!</li>
            <li> Personally this product is not good for people with \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; or \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; skin. It&#x27;s a bit rough and if you want a softer brush you would have to purchase one for twenty five dollars on the company&#x27;s website (which is more money you have to spend). But there is a better way to exfoliate your skin for a lot less money. This sounds silly but use a toothbrush. Rub your preferred skin treatment on your face and then exfoliate with an electric toothbrush. If you want to know step by step procedure just look up the Michelle Phan tutorial on Youtube. I saw the Youtube video after I had spent hundreds of dollars on the brush when I realized I just as easily could have had the same results and for only $5-$10 dollars.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t resist this because all I needed was to read &#x27;smaller pores....&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks, the pores do appear smaller, but (YIKES!) there are now wrinkles where I never noticed them before!&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I&#x27;ll now explain that a clean pore is less noticable than a clogged one. My pore size is the same, but they are indeed less noticable. And the wrinkles....well, lets chalk that up to my new Clairsonic-induced need to peer into a magnifying mirror. Only the bravest of women should dare own a magnifying mirror. I suspect that the fine little laugh lines are partly more prominent due to the dry skin from the excellent exfoliation this gadget delivers. I can&#x27;t say this strongly enough...invest in a good cream to apply after each cleansing! I didn&#x27;t care much for the products that come with the unit. LOVE the fact that it can be used in the shower. It also held a charge for a few days, making it fine for weekends away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the price is a bit daunting, I suggest the 3-speed model. To be honest, I wish I had gone that route, as 4 speeds are overkill. Truth be told, I wish they just made an attatchment for our sonic toothbrushes, the technology is about the same!&lt;br /&gt;So, all in all, this is a terrific item if you have the type of skin that needs deep cleaning, and/or you wear a lot of foundation. It will scrub every bit of makeup off. Otherwise, just get a nice exfoliant like Philosophy&#x27;s Microdelivery.</li>
            <li> I have had the Clarisonic after my beautician used it on me a couple of years ago. I use it once to twice per day, depending on my activities and how much make-up I am wearing. It is incredible how my skin reacts: less break-outs, smaller-appearing pores, and it glows. I love the Clarisonic and am glad I decided to invest in it. My skin thanks me for it everyday.</li>
            <li> Totally the best thing since sliced bread. You only think your skin is clean now, but once you use Clarisonic your skin changes. The Clarisonic Pro comes with a Sensitive brush head, a Body brush head and a Body Brush handle, as well as small sample sizes of a facial and body cleanser. You could actually use your own mild cleanser for the face or mild \\&quot;bead\\&quot; type body cleanser. It only takes 20 seconds on the chin &amp; nose, 20 sec. on the forehead and 10 sec. for the cheeks to give a new brightness; softness and amazing clean to your face. I didn&#x27;t find the body handle difficult to attach or use as other reviewers have commented. Love the body brush head and the handle to reach the middle of my back where I can never quite reach otherwise! Yes, the price is a big gulp....but I truly get it why people love, love, love Clarisonic. There is really nothing like it. Save up and get one...you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS! It&#x27;s even better than I imagined. I got the Clarisonic Pro from a local Plastic Surgery doctor&#x27;s office after receiving a facial. I never even looked into the Clarisonic before because of the price, and thought manual cleansing with my hands would be just as good. It&#x27;s not until I talked to the esthetician about it, that it clicked in my mind. She said that it was the same premise as a Sonicare toothbrush (which I have) in that it&#x27;s pulsating action is what deep cleans, and not in a harsh way. The brush in the middle does not spin. It&#x27;s not even technically a exfoliator. This made perfect sense to me because my dentist has shown me pictures of the state that my gums were in before and after I was using a sonicare toothbrush at home (you just wouldn&#x27;t think it would make that big of a difference!). I was sold. So I asked for one for Christmas and have been using it nightly ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin with large pores, a few active (although small) pimples at a time, and my skin is in no way sensitive. I use Retin-A every other night for just general skin maintenance (tretinion gel 0.025%). As I mentioned, my skin is not sensitive at all, so I was surprised after my first use that the brush felt too abrasive on my skin and I had the tight &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling after one minute. I knew what the Clarisonic was supposed to feel like because the esthetician had used it on my face before my facial and this seemed too harsh. After reading on makeupalley about different brush heads, I came to the conclusion that a lot of people switch from the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; brush head that comes with the kit to &amp;#34;delicate,&amp;#34; even people that don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. I also read great reviews on the &amp;#34;deep pore&amp;#34; brush so I decided to try that one as well. I have not used the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; brush since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most nights I use the delicate brush on the low setting for one minute by following the indicating beeps and the results have been amazing (and using Fresh&#x27;s Soy Cleanser). My pores are smaller, my face is less oily, and my overall skin health is just... better. I will never be able to go back to hand cleansing. I have traveled with the brush as well and it is sooo easy! Every time I&#x27;m done with the brush I rinse it out, then turn it on while applying it to a dry towel which dries it pretty thoroughly, then I put on the little plastic cap and screw the head off (it&#x27;s easier with the cap on) and place the handle back in the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I think that it&#x27;s necessary to get the Pro (or the Plus)? Well, I got the highest-end one because I have back acne and want to use the body brush (have not tried it yet). I also wanted the widest range of speeds that is offered. But after actually using it, I don&#x27;t see myself going much above the lowest speed, if at all, for my face. If you don&#x27;t want the body extension, I would say save your money and go for one of the other versions of the Clarisonic because I think those will work just as well if you&#x27;re like me. Also, at stores like Sephora there&#x27;s a bigger selection of trial cleansers included with the Clarisonic instead of just Clarisonic brand cleansers (I recently saw a Josie Maran set with a super cute pink travel bag!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAUTION:&lt;br /&gt;Do not use the Clarisonic longer than recommended, especially at first! The second night using it, I kept turning it back on after the automatic shut-off to cleanse longer. The next morning I woke up with two HUGE pimples on my cheek and one on my chin. It was the horrible, big, painful, under-the-skin type. It took forever to resolve itself and I&#x27;m still dealing with the pigmentation from it even though the rest of my face looks marvelous :(. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did, it some how miraculously cleans out your pores in just that one minute. This was the only negative side effect I&#x27;ve had, and I did it to myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE ON OCM:&lt;br /&gt;I have also done the oil-cleansing method using the Clarisonic and I like it. I use my own concoction of oils (castor, grape seed, jojoba, lavender), rub it on my face, then run the deep-pore brush over my face on the lowest setting for one minute. I only use the deep-pore brush with OCM because I don&#x27;t want to contaminate my other brushes with the oil since it&#x27;s hard to get out of the brush. After cleansing, I rub the head on a bar of soap and gently scrub it and rinse it out, the rest is the same as the delicate brush. I&#x27;ve only done this twice with the Clarisonic so far so I will have to update on whether I think it is an improvement to OCM on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry this is so long... hope it helped!! :)</li>
            <li> I had this device for 3 years and it bit the dust. You think after paying almost $200 for it and it bears the name Clarasonic it would last longer. I only use it a night so it is not constantly in use. Clarisonic will not honor the warranty of 3 years because I bought it from Amazon. No more Clarisonic for me nor will I buy anything electronic off Amazon or ebay. So if you buy it from an authorized dealer you will pay more but the warranty of 2 to 3 years depending on the type of Clarisonic you buy, will be good and then you can call them and get a replacement. It is a good device when it works, but who knows how long anything last anymore. We are a throw-a-way world.</li>
            <li> I head problem skin for years - dermatologists, Accutane, Rx&#x27;s, you name it...and this is gentle enough to use frequently and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I love how it recharges easily and let&#x27;s me know when it is fully charged.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my wife for Christmas.  I plugged in the charging base, and put the unit in the charger.  I noticed there were no actual contact points and realized the charger must be using magnetic fields to charge.  This sucks because it is the least effective way to charge anything.  After waiting 28 hours it was finally charged fully.  I repacked it all back into the packaging and wrapped it up for my wife for Christmas.  3 days later she unwrapped it and was thrilled.  That&#x27;s where the smile stopped.  She took it upstairs to use it and it was completely DEAD.  So we plugged it back into the charger and after another 24 hours she was finally able to use it.  It worked GREAT!..  for two minutes.  She put the body brush on it and after 30 seconds, it was dead AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an age of lithium batteries, I have NO idea why the manufacturer has opted to use NiMH batteries.  And the magnetic field charger is just stupid.  This is what jacks up the price of the thing and the reason it takes so long to charge.  It should have had proper batteries, with a proper charging port, with a rubber plug to keep water out of the port.  With this simple engineering change, it would take 30 minutes to charge, and would run for far more than the 30 minutes you get out of NiMH (if yours is lucky enough to run at all!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be taking this unit back for a replacement and if I experience the same problems again, I&#x27;m probably going to just void the warranty, open it up, and re-engineer it properly!</li>
            <li> Great Product, easy to use and amazing results for Husband and Wifey! Our skin looks and feels great!!! The waterproof in the shower is a great feature.</li>
            <li> This may seem expensive...it&#x27;s your skin/face/neck...you MUST take care of it!!!  This cleans so thoroughly. It also works like a \\&quot;light\\&quot; dermbrasion in the sense that it keeps your skin clear of radicals &amp; makeup from the day, removing dead skin.  Your creams absorb better &amp; your skin has a glow.  How much better do you want it????  (ALWAYS include your neck from back to front!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had my machine for over 5 years w/o any trouble. It lasts a long time &amp; so worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always use a liquid gentlewash soap (CeraVe works very well.) A GOOD eye creame (Swiss Ultimate Serum,) face creame, neck creame (MD-Direct Serum soon to be sold on Amazon.) Wear a SunScreen &amp; you will have beautiful skin, I promise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To tighten your facial muscles purchase Cenoire (from Amazon) it helps to stimulate &amp; infuse your creames.  (It is on back order but a \\&quot;must-have!) A very wonderful gadget at a very reasonable cost.&lt;br /&gt;Also, The Mister......great item to feed the skin on those hot summer days (all days really.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!!!</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and this has significantly helped my complexion.  My dermatologist recommended it.  Also my face feels so smooth after using it!</li>
            <li> I bought this Clarisonic brush for my wife&#x27;s birthday along with the Opal Sonic Infusion system and she loves both but from my own perspective the one major drawback I find on the unit is that the power supply unit is not detachable from the charging cradle stand. The whole contraption takes up a lot of counter space because of these condition so once the brush unit is fully charged you still have both pieces laying around, not very tidy.</li>
            <li> This product was not for me but for my wife. Her cousin suggested it to her, and it seems to be a solid product. It does come with a wand (or at least ours did) so most likely don&#x27;t need to order one separate.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister.  She loves it, and her friends can tell obviously her skin gets fine and fair in just 2 weeks after continuous usage.  Many of her colleagues now have purchased the same device.  It&#x27;s also cheaper to buy from individual shop.  I can&#x27;t comment on other shops, but this one I purchased is a genuine product, we have compared with the other devices we purchase from the official Clarisonic website.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 47 and have had sporadic breakouts all my life.  I&#x27;m sick of it, I used all sorts of stuff and they work for a bit then if I stop for a day even it comes back with a vengeance.  First of all this system is easy enough to use every single day twice a day.  It only takes 1 or 2 minutes and you are done.  I might add that I am using a good face soap like dermilogica, tea tree green tea, Dr Brandt that I have used with just a face cloth and have seen much improved results.  I have tried all sorts of soaps with the brush and they all seem to work equally well for me.  My conclusion is it&#x27;s not the soap it was how I was using the soap that has made the difference for me.  If the difference had been minor then there is no way I would justify buying a second unit for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think most people that have had complaints on this item and the brush heads are not buying from Amazon or a supplier that fulfills Amazon&#x27;s orders.  I learned the hard way myself by trying to save $1 or less even by selecting the cheapest option and using a vendor that might be selling you a fake item.  I was able to register my brush on the Calrisonic website and have read some reviews here that said they could not get service for the battery ect because they did not have a real clarisonic item.  This brush comes with a 3 year warranty and I expect the battery to not last that long so I happy the item I got was apparently legit. The PLUS edition has only a 2 year warranty.  This one also has 4 speeds and the Plus has 3.  To be honest the pro speed was much too strong for me, but it does have that option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As far as the heads go, they last a pretty decent amount of time and I am still on the fence if I will buy any on Amazon, I read way too many reviews of the items being fake and if I have a problem after I buy them from Sephora I can take them back no questions asked.  Looking at what you save it on the brush heads (In some cases very little) I think buying them locally ordirectly from Clarisonic is probably the safest bet. Cheap, fake and bad heads can ruin your skin.....exactly the opposite of what you are trying to do by spending this much on a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people don&#x27;t like this brush and say it does not work,  I can for one say it works for me,  I have tried the 2 main cheap ones neutrogena and Oil of Olay&#x27;s rotating brush and I can tell you there is absolutely no comparison.  I have combination skin and after using the Clarisonic my face feels neutral,  that is the best way I can describe it.  I also have deep pores in the oily spots and they have gotten smaller.  Mostly by cleaning out the pores.  I will give a warning for people not used to having to hydrate your skin or use any lotion, You have to use lotion.  It keeps your skin from going into overdrive to rehydrate itself and producing way too much oil.  I bought this item because of the body brush option,  I have a terrible time with my back and arms and expect the same good results I have had on my face using my \\&quot;Wife&#x27;s\\&quot; Mia 2 LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not totally clear in the listing but my brush came with the body brush extension.  I wish I had known that before, Since I probably will only get $10-$15 back I am considering keeping the second one as a spare.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help clear up the skin on my face and back. I have noticed a huge turn around in the quality of my skin. The sonic action is exactly as advertised! I would recommend this product to anyone who may have skin imperfections.</li>
            <li> I really like the &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; feeling you get after using this product.  Jury is still out as to whether it will help curb acne though.</li>
            <li> I love what this product does for my skin, however for the price I expected it to be a \\&quot;lifetime\\&quot; (5-10 years) product.  After a year an a half of daily use the product stopped taking a charge.  The customer service person was so rude!  I didn&#x27;t have a receipt as this was a gift from my sister, but I did give her the number on the bottom of my unit.  Basically the company doesn&#x27;t stand behind it&#x27;s products and there is nothing I can do.  She suggested I buy a new one!!  The old one doesn&#x27;t work after a year and half, can&#x27;t be fixed as it is a closed unit and you think I will spend another $200 with your company!!!  So disappointed!!!  Unless you have $200 to spend every year and a half don&#x27;t buy a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> For the past 3 years I have experienced continual breakouts, sores and whitheads that never seemed to clear up. I tried numerous solutions that never made any significant changes.  Within 2 weeks of using the Clarisonic Pro my face has almost totally cleared up and feels so much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> I attempted to purchase this item on Dec. 10 when the Skin Care Investments advertisement said they had \\&quot;Only 4 Left\\&quot; in stock. I put my order through and received a confirmation number and delivery date. Three days later, I received a note canceling the order because they do not have ANY stock on the Clarisonic Pro.  The Ad is a lie. I repeat, Skin Care Investments does not have ANY stock of the Clarisonic Pro, so do not waste you Christmas shopping money.  They confirmed the order, but they never even charged my card.  Their advertisement is a lie. They also do not respond to calls or customer service inquiries. I have reported this to Amazon and they confirmed that the ad should not promise that there are products in stock. They are working removing the claim of product availability from the site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> she claims that within the three weeks she has had it, her face is clearer and its smoother! she looks great</li>
            <li> I have used clarisonic for quite some time and loved it! It wasn&#x27;t until my unit stop working that I realized just how good my skin was. At this point I figured well maybe I don&#x27;t really need to buy another one well......I was wrong!! A month went by without my handy little tool and let me tell you ladies out there, my skin went from being smooth and actually very radiant to dull and sandpaperish feeling! I started to develop black heads ( and I have NEVER had those even during my younger years as a teen and thereafter ) until I stopped using this awesome little machine! So I went ahead and splurged and bought the &amp;#34;PRO&amp;#34;. All I have to say is now I know I CAN NOT and WILL NOT go again without it. I was so desperate for the first 24 hrs to go by so I can start my regimen again! Now with just days of using it again my skin is looking much better! I am very blessed with good genes and my skin is in great condition at the tender age of 54, but I can not take all of the credit this machine REALLY MAKES A DIFFERNCE no matter how old or young you are!! TOTALLY RECOMMEND IT! YOU WILL BE HOOKED I PROMISE!!</li>
