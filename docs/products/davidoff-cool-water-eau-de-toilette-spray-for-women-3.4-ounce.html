            <li> excellent cool water and best for the money</li>
            <li> my favorite perfume - order all the time from Amazon since they give the best price</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Excelente 100% recomendable&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and have used it for over a decade.  Oddly, this particular batch of perfume is not as potent as I&#x27;m used to from Davidoff.  Usually, I occasionally get a whiff of my perfume throughout the day at work, but I haven&#x27;t had that with this batch of perfume.  Disappointing, but I still love the smell and will continue to purchase this perfume.</li>
            <li> Nice size bottle, great smell</li>
            <li> This is great value for money.. Smell really good and lasts longer than usual or it&#x27;s just me? Will again when it&#x27;s gone</li>
            <li> BEST BUY ONLINE I COULD FIND ON THIS PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;I USE THIS PRODUCT ALL THE TIME AND USUALLY HAVE&lt;br /&gt;TO BUY TESTERS BUT THIS BEAT EVEN THAT PRICE</li>
            <li> great price for this scent</li>
            <li> The bottle is not so designed and nice, but the smell is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;me and my wife really loved it.</li>

            <li> Amazing perfume for women bought it for my wife an she loves it to bits, it smells great an would recommend it to any lady or guy who is buying for there significant other</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes however it scent doesnt last.  It might be watered down thats why its a great price.</li>
            <li> Davidoff cool water eau de toilet spray is my favorite will recommend highly to any one woman who likes a good scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Cool Water, yet for some reason even though I spritzed it every time I saw it in the store, I never purchased it. A couple of weeks ago I decided to fix that, and was shocked at the price. It has been a bit of time since I purchased scent, but $62? Really?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw it here, saw that it was the retail package and not a tester, was sold by Amazon, and decided to give it a chance. I&#x27;m so glad I did! What I received is most definitely Cool Water, and the bottle and packaging are fresh and new and pristine - though I&#x27;m keeping it for myself, I could easily give it as a gift. And when I bought it (2/26/14), it was considerably less than half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, though it said it would take additional days to receive it, I got it the next day... not even the two days through Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Amazon!</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite perfume for over 20 years.  It lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Was hoping the negative comments weren&#x27;t true but defnitely not the real thing. Sour and more alcoholic top note and none of the middle or base notes. I went back and the order said the item is non-refundable (doh!) Figure I call customer service and see what happens. Turns out Amazon has amazing customer service and gave me a refund since the item can&#x27;t be return (due to it being a spray and is consider HAZMAT material).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh wells, at least I got my money back. Will go to department store and buy the real thing.</li>
            <li> This was my sister&#x27;s cologne. It reminds me of her....fresh and clean. I am reminded of her every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> Have always loved this perfume for my wife. She loves it and she was happy when I bought it for her.</li>
            <li> Its at a cheap enough price for the size that you are not going to want to pass up at all.</li>
            <li> This product was terrible and smelled nothing like cool water. I tried to return the product but I can&#x27;t since it is listed under hazardous material. Money wasted.</li>
            <li> This perfume lasts long and the scent is not over powering. It is great for all day use and is a definite must have. Lots of heads turn whenever I wear this. Would strongly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and purchased it because of the price online.  It is a cool, summery fragrance but strong, you only need a little.  Very nice, not too &amp;#34;sweet-smelling&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites.. Crisp, clean scent. I switch off depending on my groove :)... this is a happy one!</li>
            <li> Thanks, that is what I expected</li>
            <li> this was such a great deal. I have paid almost the same price for a 1 oz bottle of the same thing</li>
            <li> I have worn Cool Water for years.  I absolutely love Cool Water.  This is a spray for anyone.</li>
            <li> RECOMMENDED SELLER EXCELLENT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Excellent time delivery and good product</li>
            <li> My order arrived on time as promised. I was disappointed to see that the bottle was 1/4 short of the perfume, but when I looked at the picture of the product I received exactly what the seller advertised. Nonetheless, I love the fragrance of Cool Water and the seller was honest.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife and she loed it. Arrived quickly</li>

I got this order on time and it smells really good and stays for long...I already gifted Davidoff cool water to my boyfriend and now I am trying Davidoff cool water for women. Trust me its a good product with a good value for money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been definitely one of my favourite fragrances for a couple of years now. It&#x27;s perfect for hot summer days, because of its fresh scent. Long-lasting for me, but every woman should be careful with this, it may be not on everyone. This one from amazon is not a fake, it&#x27;s the same as I used to buy in the perfume store.</li>

            <li> I always wanted to try this perfume and so glad I did.  It smells really great and I would recommend it</li>
            <li> Did not like...smells nothing like what you buy at the retail store...won&#x27;t purchase again...</li>
            <li> Great smelling fragrance; very clean and refreshing scent!  I really like it!</li>
