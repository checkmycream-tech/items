            <li>Love Love it!  </li>

            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>As a Licensed Esthetician, I try as many anti-aging products that I can get my hands on.</li>
            <li>I love the ease of use as opposed to digging into a jar, you drop the liquid onto your hand.</li>
            <li>Much more convenient to use.</li>
            <li>that I just ordered more.</li>
            <li>This seems to do ok</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with it and have definitely noticed a difference in the lines around my eyes and my forehead.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been better.</li>
            <li>After reading so many glowing reviews for this product, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>it a better option</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks dewy &amp; healthy even in the winter months.  </li>
            <li>I think this is getting me better results.  </li>
            <li>My akin feels so smooth!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok .dont</li>
            <li>Love waking up and looking at smoother skin now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been noticing a decrease in pore size and a much more balanced complexion.</li>
            <li>I use it on my chest and neck and it is just OK.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff, as a 50+ year old man I have tried several products and Azure Naturals works the best of anything I have tried.</li>
            <li>What I love about it is that it glides on smoothly, has 20% Vitamin C (which is the amount you need for good outcomes) and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>This product using it every morning has faded it completely leaving my face smooth!!!</li>
            <li>I like the dropper dispenser; it&#x27;s easy to get just the amount I want.  </li>
            <li>Of course wear sunscreen  on top, but so far very pleased with this VITAMIN C serum.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much smoother, firmer and more even-toned!</li>
            <li>The ingredients are pure and the formula is light, not greasy and effective.  </li>
            <li>I can see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a month now and can already see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Great product only used for a month and noticed lined diminishing!!</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product and would certainly recommend this to a friend!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>thank you so much for your fast delivering and good packing.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expected to be so watery, doesn&#x27;t do magic, fair for the price.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am a 56 yr old from the south, many years of sun worshipping, smoked for 35 yrs (smoke free for 6 yrs).</li>
            <li>This serum immediately made my skin feel smoother and more vibrant.  </li>
            <li>This helped me tremendously.</li>
            <li>Applied next morning again in a mix with different serum and my face looked brighter, fresher, felt very pleasant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice knowing there is something working to heal skin all day, as well as acting as another layer between my skin and bb cream/powder makeup.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>The company says that the product doesn&#x27;t sit on shelves so is always fresh.</li>
            <li>You can feel your pores tighten up right away.  </li>
            <li>If its too good to be true its not true!</li>
            <li>:) I really like how soft my skin feels and the glow.</li>
            <li>I will keep using it every day and update my review in a few more months. :)</li>
            <li>It give you a bit of a tight feeling in a good way.</li>
            <li>I think I like it very much.</li>
            <li>My skin feels a little tighter after I put it on which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Prompt delivery, item exactly as described.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used it long enough to get results but so far so good love the way my skin feels after using it</li>
            <li>It goes on first.  </li>
            <li>This is a big deal for me as I deal with so many vendors.</li>
            <li>Overall the complexion on my face looks better.</li>
            <li>The remaining contents did exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what the Dr ordered.</li>
            <li>Upon first application, my skin immediately felt tightened and toned.</li>
            <li>I have already ordered two more bottles and cannot wait to see what happens long term.  </li>
            <li>though I think it&#x27;s too early to see all benefits in full&#x27;ve noticed some improvement in the look and tone of the skin,</li>
            <li>These new companies which pop-up claiming phenomenal results such as “ Top Anti Aging Anti Wrinkle Facial Skin Care Serum Available” simply does not work.</li>
            <li>I have had allergic reactions and why I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Azure Naturals Anti-Aging Serum for approximately two weeks now and have already experienced positive changes in my skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks and I keep continue to order this from now on.</li>
            <li>Really don&#x27;t have time to write a review</li>
            <li>They are much softer looking, not as deep in appearance, my face honestly looks 10 yrs younger.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very runny and watery.  </li>
            <li>The real reviews are all one star.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 days now (morning and night) and really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 weeks now; I use it on my whole face.  </li>
            <li>really fast delivery</li>
            <li>I have been using it for several months and have had many comments on how young I look.  </li>
            <li>However, after a week or two I noticed a significant reduction in the appearance of tiny lines around my mouth.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a simple Vitamin C serum, this is definitely worth a try before you go and pay 70 bucks for a department store jar that doesn&#x27;t even tell you how much Vitamin C you are getting!</li>
            <li>I suffer from acne prone sensitive skin that gets easily inflamed and red</li>
            <li>I have some big sun spots on my face and it definitely turned into light color, so I am buying it again!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend their products.</li>
            <li>WOW !!  </li>
            <li>So far my skin feels much softer and has a bit of a glow to it.</li>
            <li>You only need a couple drops and it glides on the skin and absorbs right away.</li>
            <li>It dries to a nice tight finish, leaving my skin the way I want it prior to putting on my SPF and then foundation.</li>
            <li>It cracked the first time I closed it, but luckily I sell essential oils and had a stopper that was identical.  </li>
            <li>The first time it was clear; the second time it was cloudy and smelled yucky.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and you can feel a little tightness.  </li>
            <li>Honestly none of them really worked, so I was skeptical.</li>
            <li>I like how soft my skin feels after my moisturizer and mak up are on.  </li>
            <li>I just started using it after I had roller derming done, professionally.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s action packed ingredients</li>
            <li>I ordered the Ultimate Premium Anti-Aging Serum, which I love for my face, but both times I have received this serum which is too harsh for my face.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t believe any of the fake good reviews.</li>
            <li>I pair it with hydraluric acid - put on the C serum first, let dry, then the acid, then after this dries, a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly and makes my face feel pleasantly tight, but not dried out.  </li>
            <li>It does dry fast when put on.</li>
            <li>I will say I do younger than my age but seem to have had more comments lately.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion, that sticking to major brands</li>
            <li>I have two dark spots that did not fade even slightly or the rest of my face look any better.</li>
            <li>I applied this serum, let it dry completely, followed with a hyaluronic acid serum, then my normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this product for more than a month, my skin did not improve, and the minimal improvement I did see while using Jack Black Protein Booster Skin Serum prior to this product, was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smooths on easily, not requiring a lot and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am 32 years old and got my first dark spot on my face from the sun last year.  </li>
            <li>Azure Naturals made up for the mistake last time by sending me a bottle of what I had ordered but I am running low now and need a new bottle</li>
            <li>I received it few days ago and immediately applied to clean face in the evening in a mix with rosehip oil, because I have somewhat dry skin type.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to spill because it&#x27;s a thin liquid).  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> :) I really like how soft my skin feels and the glow.</li>
            <li> I will keep using it every day and update my review in a few more months. :)</li>
            <li> It give you a bit of a tight feeling in a good way.</li>
            <li> I think I like it very much.</li>
            <li> My skin feels a little tighter after I put it on which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery, item exactly as described.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough to get results but so far so good love the way my skin feels after using it</li>
            <li> It goes on first.  </li>
            <li> This is a big deal for me as I deal with so many vendors.</li>
            <li> Overall the complexion on my face looks better.</li>
            <li> The remaining contents did exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what the Dr ordered.</li>
            <li> Upon first application, my skin immediately felt tightened and toned.</li>
            <li> I have already ordered two more bottles and cannot wait to see what happens long term.  </li>
            <li> though I think it&#x27;s too early to see all benefits in full&#x27;ve noticed some improvement in the look and tone of the skin,</li>
            <li> These new companies which pop-up claiming phenomenal results such as “ Top Anti Aging Anti Wrinkle Facial Skin Care Serum Available” simply does not work.</li>
            <li> I have had allergic reactions and why I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Azure Naturals Anti-Aging Serum for approximately two weeks now and have already experienced positive changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks and I keep continue to order this from now on.</li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t have time to write a review</li>
            <li> They are much softer looking, not as deep in appearance, my face honestly looks 10 yrs younger.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very runny and watery.  </li>
            <li> The real reviews are all one star.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 days now (morning and night) and really like it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 weeks now; I use it on my whole face.  </li>
            <li> really fast delivery</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several months and have had many comments on how young I look.  </li>
            <li> However, after a week or two I noticed a significant reduction in the appearance of tiny lines around my mouth.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a simple Vitamin C serum, this is definitely worth a try before you go and pay 70 bucks for a department store jar that doesn&#x27;t even tell you how much Vitamin C you are getting!</li>
            <li> I suffer from acne prone sensitive skin that gets easily inflamed and red</li>
            <li> I have some big sun spots on my face and it definitely turned into light color, so I am buying it again!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend their products.</li>
            <li> WOW !!  </li>
            <li> So far my skin feels much softer and has a bit of a glow to it.</li>
            <li> You only need a couple drops and it glides on the skin and absorbs right away.</li>
            <li> It dries to a nice tight finish, leaving my skin the way I want it prior to putting on my SPF and then foundation.</li>
            <li> It cracked the first time I closed it, but luckily I sell essential oils and had a stopper that was identical.  </li>
            <li> The first time it was clear; the second time it was cloudy and smelled yucky.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and you can feel a little tightness.  </li>
            <li> Honestly none of them really worked, so I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I like how soft my skin feels after my moisturizer and mak up are on.  </li>
            <li> I just started using it after I had roller derming done, professionally.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s action packed ingredients</li>
            <li> I ordered the Ultimate Premium Anti-Aging Serum, which I love for my face, but both times I have received this serum which is too harsh for my face.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe any of the fake good reviews.</li>
            <li> I pair it with hydraluric acid - put on the C serum first, let dry, then the acid, then after this dries, a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly and makes my face feel pleasantly tight, but not dried out.  </li>
            <li> It does dry fast when put on.</li>
            <li> I will say I do younger than my age but seem to have had more comments lately.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion, that sticking to major brands</li>
            <li> I have two dark spots that did not fade even slightly or the rest of my face look any better.</li>
            <li> I applied this serum, let it dry completely, followed with a hyaluronic acid serum, then my normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this product for more than a month, my skin did not improve, and the minimal improvement I did see while using Jack Black Protein Booster Skin Serum prior to this product, was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smooths on easily, not requiring a lot and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> I am 32 years old and got my first dark spot on my face from the sun last year.  </li>
            <li> Azure Naturals made up for the mistake last time by sending me a bottle of what I had ordered but I am running low now and need a new bottle</li>
            <li> I received it few days ago and immediately applied to clean face in the evening in a mix with rosehip oil, because I have somewhat dry skin type.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to spill because it&#x27;s a thin liquid).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not been used long enough yet to determine its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not used to but idc as long as it does</li>
            <li> see how it goes in the next few days.</li>
            <li> Seems to do the job, when paired with my other products.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed a reduction in dark spots and acne scars since using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 68 and everyone thinks I&#x27;m at least 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> This combination seems like it reduces pores &amp; lightens the dark spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Saw results in a few days.</li>
            <li> Been using Azure Naturals products for well over a year now, and while I know there&#x27;s no magic bullet, their products are quality and I am liking how they are on my skin, and I have had compliments about my skin too.</li>
            <li> So I will be sending it back as its too expensive for a product that did&#x27;nt work.</li>
            <li> I have used other top-line expensive serums and other vitamin C serums.</li>
            <li> I realize this is not permanent and will need to be used every morning for this appearance but is a small price to pay for the results it has.  </li>
            <li> Finally, no more caked on moisturizers that make foundation slip and slide</li>
            <li> I checked my face 1 hour later and was really shocked at the appearance of my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Also decreased my pores and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> crow&#x27;s feet &amp; my skin was looking tired.  </li>
            <li> nothing has changed  poor product</li>
            <li> I was tired of paying 40-70 dollars for an ounce or two of Vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but when I received this</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s way too expensive for me.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Thank you for a great product and quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  It&#x27;s not been used long enough yet to determine its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  You can see and feel an improvement in your skin overnight.  I made my mom and my sister buy it.</li>
            <li> Been using Azure Naturals products for well over a year now, and while I know there&#x27;s no magic bullet, their products are quality and I am liking how they are on my skin, and I have had compliments about my skin too. Since I have used them daily, they must be contributing well to my skin care. Highly recommend their products.</li>
            <li> So far this is the best vitamin C I ever try . I have acne, oily skin , noting work but thes . Thanks and I keep continue to order this from now on.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery, item exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I love this wonderful product. thank you so much for your fast delivering and good packing.</li>
            <li> Great product only used for a month and noticed lined diminishing!!</li>
            <li> I did get this product within a week and in good condition.  I have used it for a month now and there is no difference in appearance of my facial skin.It does dry fast when put on. I have two dark spots that did not fade even slightly or the rest of my face look any better. So I will be sending it back as its too expensive for a product that did&#x27;nt work.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and you can feel a little tightness.  I like how soft my skin feels after my moisturizer and mak up are on.  My skin is bighter</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expected to be so watery, doesn&#x27;t do magic, fair for the price.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough to get results but so far so good love the way my skin feels after using it</li>
            <li> Has made my skin glow. I have also noticed a reduction in dark spots and acne scars since using. I have been using it daily (in the morning and whenever I wash off makeup during day to reapply. At night I use the Strongest Wrinkle Eraser) for several months. I am on second bottle and intend to continue with use. It&#x27;s nice knowing there is something working to heal skin all day, as well as acting as another layer between my skin and bb cream/powder makeup.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product for the price and a good compliment for your sunscreen. It&#x27;s not greasy or smelly. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> These products are wonderful.I switch between them alternating days.I noticed a wonderful difference right away,I will be using these products from now on.</li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t have time to write a review but this product is so good that I feel like I owe it. I have used other top-line expensive serums and other vitamin C serums. Honestly none of them really worked, so I was skeptical. But just after a couple weeks of use of this product, I can see a huge difference! My skin tone and texture have improved a lot! I can see a huge difference. This product actually works!!! My skin is so much smoother, firmer and more even-toned! My face has a healthy glow. I apply this after wash and under face lotion. It does not make my face break out. I am very happy with this serum and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is between a liquid and a gel.  It smooths on easily, not requiring a lot and dries quickly.  I would probably order again since it is a good value.</li>
            <li> WOW !!  This is amazing serum. I am a 56 yr old from the south, many years of sun worshipping, smoked for 35 yrs (smoke free for 6 yrs). Needless to say I have many deep wrinkles because of this, eyes, upper lip. I was skeptical but when I received this I cleaned my face well, looked really good at my wrinkles so I would be able to see any difference.  I applied this serum, let it dry completely, followed with a hyaluronic acid serum, then my normal moisturizer. I checked my face 1 hour later and was really shocked at the appearance of my wrinkles. They are much softer looking, not as deep in appearance, my face honestly looks 10 yrs younger. I realize this is not permanent and will need to be used every morning for this appearance but is a small price to pay for the results it has.  I will never let myself run out of this serum.</li>
            <li> this is amazing. i will buy it again, again and again.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Love the smell.</li>
            <li> It does nothing.  It&#x27;s very runny and watery.  It does have pleasant citrus-like smell though.</li>
            <li> I am 32 years old and got my first dark spot on my face from the sun last year.  This product using it every morning has faded it completely leaving my face smooth!!! Also decreased my pores and wrinkles.  Love love this product!!</li>
            <li> The reviews were great on this product.  I just started using it after I had roller derming done, professionally.  It feels kind of sticky after I apply it.  It goes on first.  Then I apply a serum, followed by face cream/sunblock.  No immediate benifits, but as I said, I just started using it.  Fingers are crossed.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all. Clogs pores and causes cystics acne. I stopped using and the breakouts calmed down.&lt;br /&gt;Does nothing for wrinkles or age spots. Waste of money. If its too good to be true its not true! Don&#x27;t believe any of the fake good reviews. The real reviews are all one star.</li>
            <li> ...and, it looks to me like it is doing the job. You only need to use 1 or 2 squirts, it goes along way.  I would happily recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this in Oct last year and I have been using twice a day for almost six months. I have some big sun spots on my face and it definitely turned into light color, so I am buying it again!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Will continue to buy more.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The ingredients are pure and the formula is light, not greasy and effective.  My skin is hydrated and glowing.  Try it.</li>
            <li> Saw results in a few days. Definitely softened my deep wrinkles.</li>
            <li> As a Licensed Esthetician, I try as many anti-aging products that I can get my hands on. When I saw this serum with all it&#x27;s action packed ingredients I was excited to try it. My clients are always asking for my recommendation on skin care products and I was so happy to tell them about this one. You only need a couple drops and it glides on the skin and absorbs right away. I use it all around my eyes as well. It give you a bit of a tight feeling in a good way. I moisturize immediately after morning and night and that&#x27;s all I need. Their customer service is amazing as well. This is a big deal for me as I deal with so many vendors. I&#x27;m so happy I found this product.</li>
            <li> It helped me a lot with my acne and I use it before my foundation it&lt;br /&gt;Make my skin look a lot fresher !!!</li>
            <li> Seems to do the job, when paired with my other products. I love the ease of use as opposed to digging into a jar, you drop the liquid onto your hand. Much more convenient to use.</li>
            <li> This serum immediately made my skin feel smoother and more vibrant.  I have also used this serum sparingly on some sun spots I have on my chest and arms.  They are starting to fade dramatically after only a month.  I have already ordered two more bottles and cannot wait to see what happens long term.  Thank you Azure Naturals!</li>
            <li> I had used Vitamin C on my face for years in a different form and was looking for a liquid which would be easier to apply. I honestly didn&#x27;t expect it to work. However, after a week or two I noticed a significant reduction in the appearance of tiny lines around my mouth. It&#x27;s not a &#x27;fix&#x27; like you would get at a plastic surgeons but it works well enough that I just ordered more. I&#x27;m 68 and everyone thinks I&#x27;m at least 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 days now (morning and night) and really like it. So far my skin feels much softer and has a bit of a glow to it. I use it all over my face including the eye area. My skin feels a little tighter after I put it on which is a good thing. :) I really like how soft my skin feels and the glow.</li>
            <li> Update: 3/6/15   This seems to do ok but it&#x27;s way too expensive for me.  It&#x27;s now up to $52.00 (plus postage) for a two ounce bottle.  I&#x27;ll never purchase this product again.  Keep your money and buy something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month.  I just use it once at night.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with it and have definitely noticed a difference in the lines around my eyes and my forehead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 2 months applying  it morning and night. Reordered a larger bottle so that I could continue using it. I&#x27;ve noticed my pores have reduced in size. Also use the Wrinkle Eraser by Azure Naturals with 2.5% Retinol &amp; 10% Hyaluronic Acid at night only. This combination seems like it reduces pores &amp; lightens the dark spots. Overall the complexion on my face looks better.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I have seen improvement in my skin and lines around my eyes.  I have been using it for several months and have had many comments on how young I look.  I will say I do younger than my age but seem to have had more comments lately.</li>
            <li> Love Love it!  This product arrived in time, was packaged well with the exception of the stopper cap on the bottle.  It cracked the first time I closed it, but luckily I sell essential oils and had a stopper that was identical.  I did however lose about 1/4 of the bottle contents in my suitcase before the crack was discovered.  The remaining contents did exactly what it says.  My skin feels and looks great!  Thank you! I will be buying this product again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 weeks now; I use it on my whole face.  I have noticed a definite reduction in sun spotting on my forehead, and I think I&#x27;m starting to notice a reduction in the wrinkle between my eyebrows.  I like the dropper dispenser; it&#x27;s easy to get just the amount I want.  It dries quickly and makes my face feel pleasantly tight, but not dried out.  I will keep using it every day and update my review in a few more months. :)</li>
            <li> This product works beautifully at smoothing skin texture and repair.</li>
            <li> This thing definitely works!!! It was liquidy which I&#x27;m not used to but idc as long as it does it&#x27;s job. I notice my acne subsiding with each week of use and my discoloration fading. My skin has never been better. I suffer from acne prone sensitive skin that gets easily inflamed and red and it is the hardest thing to get it to recover. This helped me tremendously. Worth it.</li>
            <li> After reading so many glowing reviews for this product, I decided to give it a try.  I waited until I finished the entire bottle before writing my review.  I wanted to give this product a fair chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for more than a month, my skin did not improve, and the minimal improvement I did see while using Jack Black Protein Booster Skin Serum prior to this product, was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion, that sticking to major brands it a better option because they spend thousands to dollars researching their products.  These new companies which pop-up claiming phenomenal results such as “ Top Anti Aging Anti Wrinkle Facial Skin Care Serum Available” simply does not work.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.  I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle (watch out, it&#x27;s easy to spill because it&#x27;s a thin liquid).  My skin looks dewy &amp; healthy even in the winter months.  My glow is back.  Price is low compared to the Murad that I use.  I think this is getting me better results.  I search for something different because I was getting visible crow&#x27;s feet &amp; my skin was looking tired.  This is exactly what the Dr ordered.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! My akin feels so smooth!</li>
            <li> Had never used this product but was told about it. Turns out I will order again.</li>
            <li> nothing has changed  poor product</li>
            <li> Ordered this twice. The first time it was clear; the second time it was cloudy and smelled yucky. The company says that the product doesn&#x27;t sit on shelves so is always fresh. So perhaps it is a manufacturing/ quality control problem. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT: the age spots on my forearms and chest are remarkably lighter after 3 months.</li>
            <li> It is a very good vitamin C. I love it.</li>
            <li> The product is as described, arrived at the specified time, I also sent the indications of use to my email and by the time I&#x27;m by applying as it is in the instructions,  it aboserve breeze, though I think it&#x27;s too early to see all benefits in full&#x27;ve noticed some improvement in the look and tone of the skin, see how it goes in the next few days. I have had allergic reactions and why I have super sensitive skin.Their customer service is amazing as well.</li>
            <li> I was tired of paying 40-70 dollars for an ounce or two of Vitamin C serum so I checked this out. What I love about it is that it glides on smoothly, has 20% Vitamin C (which is the amount you need for good outcomes) and is reasonably priced. The Hyaluronic Acid is a plus, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum will NOT make your face feel oily or dewy. It dries to a nice tight finish, leaving my skin the way I want it prior to putting on my SPF and then foundation. Finally, no more caked on moisturizers that make foundation slip and slide around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a simple Vitamin C serum, this is definitely worth a try before you go and pay 70 bucks for a department store jar that doesn&#x27;t even tell you how much Vitamin C you are getting!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok .dont see any difference</li>
            <li> Great value. It worked, but not as good as others.</li>
            <li> Seems to work best when combined with another skin care product, in this case, one that helps minimize wrinkles.  Love waking up and looking at smoother skin now.  My next addition will be a hylaronic acid skin care product as that is what is recommended in the packaging info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No damage to skin at all.  For a starter, even on aging skin, can recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this serum, I am noticing firmer skin and a nicer texture.</li>
            <li> Notice a big difference in my skin when I use this twice a day.  I pair it with hydraluric acid - put on the C serum first, let dry, then the acid, then after this dries, a moisturizer.  I don&#x27;t want to be without this serum.  Skin looks fresher, and pigment spots appear to diminish after about a month.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month now and can already see a huge difference. Ive had years of sun damage to my face and neck and the spots have faded drastically, especially the darkest one on my neck. My skin looks and feels great! I have been recommending this serum to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Azure Naturals Anti-Aging Serum for approximately two weeks now and have already experienced positive changes in my skin. Upon first application, my skin immediately felt tightened and toned. I especially loved that there is no noticeable scent or fragrance in this product. I&#x27;ve also been noticing a decrease in pore size and a much more balanced complexion. I am pleased with this product and would certainly recommend this to a friend!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, as a 50+ year old man I have tried several products and Azure Naturals works the best of anything I have tried.</li>
            <li> Its a great product. Keeps the moisture in your skin</li>
            <li> Seems to do the job!! I&#x27;ve reorded twice now!</li>
            <li> excellent product and the price is unbeatable you will definitely see a difference in your skin in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li> This is a great vitamin C for the skin.  If you only use once a day use in the mornings to help protect your skin from the sun.  Not a sun screen.</li>
            <li> I think I like it very much. I received it few days ago and immediately applied to clean face in the evening in a mix with rosehip oil, because I have somewhat dry skin type. Applied next morning again in a mix with different serum and my face looked brighter, fresher, felt very pleasant. Of course wear sunscreen  on top, but so far very pleased with this VITAMIN C serum. Also applied to my hands over night in a mix with rosehip oil. Looks great, feels great !!!!</li>
            <li> This serum is NOT what I ordered and this has happened twice now.  I ordered the Ultimate Premium Anti-Aging Serum, which I love for my face, but both times I have received this serum which is too harsh for my face.  I use it on my chest and neck and it is just OK.  Azure Naturals made up for the mistake last time by sending me a bottle of what I had ordered but I am running low now and need a new bottle so I am unsure how to get what I need.</li>
            <li> really fast delivery and I like the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude.  As I&#x27;m aging, I&#x27;m buying this kind of stuff to keep my youth.  It&#x27;s a struggle.  This stuff is great.  You can feel your pores tighten up right away.  I&#x27;ll be buying this for a while and this product makes me want to try others from this manufacturer.  5 solid stars.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  I&#x27;ve been using for a couple of months religiously.  Do not notice any difference in my skin whatsoever.  Disappointed!!</li>
            <li> This stuff smoothed and brightened my skin! Worked amazingly!</li>
