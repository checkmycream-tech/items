            <li>I used this system today for the first time today and its the best yet...</li>
            <li>I liked the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Great and fast shipper!</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Great service and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Lovely scent.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo and condition.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>My curls love both the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to order more.</li>
            <li>I was in my 30&#x27;s, surely this couldn&#x27;t be happening to me?</li>
            <li>Love it and lasts as you just need a dab to wash shoulder length fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always been a challenge to keep it healthy, moisturized and frizz free.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is sulfate free</li>
            <li>Interestingly,  most shampoos &amp; conditioners available in the US contain silicones (you can tell because the ingredient ends in &amp;#34;cone&amp;#34;), while the majority in the UK, France and abroad do not.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair and need something that will clean my hair but not strip it.</li>
            <li>Love it, and fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I have tried millions and nothing has ever made my hair untangle and so soft and healthy as this brand.</li>
            <li>Most shampoos only give body without moisture.  </li>
            <li>I love it and am already planning my next purchase.</li>
            <li>Naturally curly hair friendly.  </li>
            <li>I found a relatively well-known, higher end brand that contained many different types of oils (mainly olive), but that left my hair feeling greasy much more quickly than it should.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely ecstatic that I discovered this brand.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all natural and does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li>I noticed a significant bald spot on the back of my head that, while easily covered by proper styling, sent me into an obvious panic.</li>
            <li>Really provides a silky, soft feel.</li>
            <li>I am mixed with black and white and this works amazing on my curls.</li>
            <li>my natural 2C/3A hair does not like.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Also due to its more natural and less harmful ingredients for hair, i would reccomend this product.</li>
            <li>Elucence may be a hard brand to find, and maybe a bit more costly, but it&#x27;s well worth the trouble and expense.</li>
            <li>So, after some research and trial and error, it became apparent to me</li>
            <li>I never expected it to be SUCH a challenge!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t dry out my hair, instead leaving it soft, bouncy and conditioned (but not greasy).</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this. It smells wonderful. Makes my hair shine</li>
            <li> I loveeee the small of these products, the shampoo is a peach scent. I ordered this product because it was recommended for curly hair. I do like it a lot, i am not sure if it working to make my hair less frizzy and less dry since i also use it in conbination with a deep condition, but i feel like other shampoo and conditioners leave my hair feeling a bit dry but i dont feel the same dryness after using these products. Also due to its more natural and less harmful ingredients for hair, i would reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> Must have sulfates, parabens, or something else my natural 2C/3A hair does not like.  Much less curl and I had to use clarifier twice to get rid of it!</li>
            <li> The works great for Brazilian Keratin hair and smells great. A little goes a long way. Great service and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> wonderful moisturizing effects!  Really provides a silky, soft feel.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have curly hair and need something that will clean my hair but not strip it. The shampoo smells great and I can feel my hair soften as I&#x27;m washing it. Both products are great!</li>
            <li> Naturally curly hair friendly.  Lovely scent.  A little goes a LONG way!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo and condition. I have tried millions and nothing has ever made my hair untangle and so soft and healthy as this brand. I am mixed with black and white and this works amazing on my curls.</li>
            <li> The shampoo dried out my hair and stripped my hair of color.  I liked the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner it&#x27;s all natural and does exactly what I need it to do. The shampoo is sulfate free so that&#x27;s a plus. I love it the best I&#x27;ve used in a while.</li>
            <li> This products works wonderfully!!!</li>
            <li> Love it, and fast delivery.  Will be buying again and again as I run out.  great services</li>
            <li> My curls love both the shampoo and conditioner.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Second purchase of this product.  Love it and lasts as you just need a dab to wash shoulder length fine hair.  My hair is also healthier with the low phone balance.  Would definitely continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and this is my go-to shampoo/conditioner. I have tried other recommendations but keep coming back to this set.</li>
            <li> I have only used the shampoo and conditioner once and I love it.  My hair looks like it has moisture and body. Most shampoos only give body without moisture.  Can&#x27;t wait to order more.</li>
            <li> I used this system today for the first time today and its the best yet...the shampoo alone is so silky and moisturizing it was unbelievable. The conditioner just topped it off...what I did was add some organic cold pressed argan oil to the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great and fast shipper!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long, wavy locks. It&#x27;s always been a challenge to keep it healthy, moisturized and frizz free. A few years ago, I discovered that I had a sensitivity or allergy (not sure which) to the silicones that the majority of shampoos contain. I noticed a significant bald spot on the back of my head that, while easily covered by proper styling, sent me into an obvious panic. I was in my 30&#x27;s, surely this couldn&#x27;t be happening to me? So, after some research and trial and error, it became apparent to me it was the silicones causing the problems. Once the silicones were cut, my hair grew back.  So began an extensive search for shampoos and conditioners that did not contain silicone. I never expected it to be SUCH a challenge! Interestingly,  most shampoos &amp; conditioners available in the US contain silicones (you can tell because the ingredient ends in &amp;#34;cone&amp;#34;), while the majority in the UK, France and abroad do not.  I found a couple low end brands that didn&#x27;t have it. Generally, I found that the scent never last very long and they left my hair really dry. I found a relatively well-known, higher end brand that contained many different types of oils (mainly olive), but that left my hair feeling greasy much more quickly than it should. I was at my wits end, about to submit to a life with shampoos I hated.  Enter Elucence Moisture Benefits Shampoo &amp; Conditioner. I am absolutely ecstatic that I discovered this brand. Wouldn&#x27;t you know it? It&#x27;s a UK based company. The products smell heavenly (like peaches &amp; cream). They don&#x27;t dry out my hair, instead leaving it soft, bouncy and conditioned (but not greasy). Best of all, they are silicone free so my hair is immensely healthy!  Elucence may be a hard brand to find, and maybe a bit more costly, but it&#x27;s well worth the trouble and expense. I love it and am already planning my next purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! Leaves hair soft and manageable. I&#x27;d DEFINITELY recommend!</li>
