            <li>My review will be a comparison of the Amope Pedi Perfect and the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Express Pedi electronic foot file.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>but I found that it worked best for me.</li>
            <li>It works great and the price is perfect.</li>
            <li>Great price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Turns out it works great</li>
            <li>A great investment.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>

            <li>I am so in love with my Amope Pedi Perfect</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully, and it&#x27;s so quick and efficient!</li>
            <li>Need a good knife or shears.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>The Dr. Scholl&#x27;s version turned out to be a good choice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes two AA batteries, and I recommend getting good quality rechargeable batteries.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I spend 8+ hours on my feet at work and while my shoes are good at keeping them from being sore at the end of the day, they have toughened them up a bit.</li>
            <li>But I question if it this product is greatly superior to competitive</li>
            <li>The good news is that you get 2 rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was very easy to use and is very effective.  </li>
            <li>Ease of use is good and effective.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>My feet has never felt better!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this device!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>OMG ... I Love it!</li>
            <li>Last year, I received the Amope Pedi Perfect and loved it!</li>
            <li>So nice.</li>
            <li>This is well made, and it&#x27;s surprisingly effective.</li>
            <li>Another nice feature of this roller is that no pre-soaking of your feet is required.</li>
            <li>You can bring your own tools</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing machine, doing well job, easy to use, good quality, wonderful paking, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>By far the best invention for callused feet.</li>
            <li>My feet will look nice and smooth for summer shoes!  </li>
            <li>I liked the way the Amope roller had more close access to my heels.</li>
            <li>Just add the battery and press up to turn on, how easy is that!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get to try this competitor&#x27;s product to see how it matches up to my beloved Amope.</li>
            <li>This does a fine job!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and fits in my hand nicely.</li>
            <li>the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s is much better</li>
            <li>My feet feel and look fabulous!</li>
            <li>Better than going to the podiatrist..</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>abrasive on this is more aggressive than the Amope.  </li>
            <li>and boy did my foot feel better.  </li>
            <li>Dr. Scholl&#x27;s version, though, does have more power and while it won&#x27;t fix your feet and heels in one sitting, it does make a noticeable difference after just one try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Not one of these metro sexual, fru fru guys that is the norm today.</li>
            <li>and it got my feet nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing like a smooth heel!</li>
            <li>I love this apparatus.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it is safe and won&#x27;t chew up your skin or cause any cuts.</li>
            <li>work ok, but none are a magic bullet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I want to invite friends over to peel our feet! :)</li>
            <li>This device works a lot better and more safely than the blades that are used in a manicure shop.  </li>
            <li>I know Dr. Scholl makes quality products, but I wasn&#x27;t at all sure that their electronic pedicure device was worth a bucket of warm</li>
            <li>Without pedicures my feet can become rough and unattractive and this is the perfect solution.  </li>
            <li>It really works good.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with this tool on the very first use and a month later I am still impressed with the job the original roller and batteries do.</li>
            <li>I love pairing it with a foot scrub and a rich body cream.</li>
            <li>, she finds it easy to use</li>
            <li>I searched for an easy way to do this at home.  </li>
            <li>Use of this automatic smoother was easy to figure out</li>
            <li>Inserting and removing the roller is easy.</li>
            <li>device is easy to hold, by the way.  </li>
            <li>This is an easy, at home way to get smoother feet.  </li>
            <li>then I would consider it strongly.</li>
            <li>then I would consider it strongly.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>As much as I love them, this makes doing it at home cheap, easy, and quick.</li>
            <li>Seriously though, it is awesome, my feet are so smooth and feel great, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It is shaped to fit comfortably in the hand, although it is made of smooth plastic for sanitary reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it actually works great.</li>
            <li>This product does help smooth your feet.</li>
            <li>Fortunately the roller didn&#x27;t break the skin or leave a mark.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Replacement rollers are available from Amazon (e.g., [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>More powerful then I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I decide to get something to smooth it out.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>It is gentle but effective and did the job for me.  </li>
            <li>Overall it seems to work great</li>
            <li>I am happy with it and anyone trying to do something for their feet will likely find this easier than a pumice stone to use.</li>
            <li>my feet are smooth after a i min. sanding.</li>
            <li>It evenly removes calluses so the skin looks smooth as if it never had any hard/dead skin before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both are comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s was much more economical than the Amope</li>
            <li>If the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s was much more economical than the Amope</li>
            <li>The results are visible both in how smooth your feet look and feel but also in the amount of skin particles</li>
            <li>Some do cling to the roller and can be removed by tapping this lightly against a trash can</li>
            <li>roller action is robust and will generate a good deal of skin filings</li>
            <li>Very powerful, unlike the cheaper models.</li>
            <li>a very useful tool</li>
            <li>The tool is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>So, get the original one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Beware, however, of being too enthusiastic in using it on the same patch of skin, because you can end up wearing away more than the callous.</li>
            <li>It could be better, but for products actually designed for this task, this is pretty good.</li>
            <li>so shipping was free and fast!!</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of this foot file, especially as it presents itself as so user friendly and easy to use.</li>
            <li>not really that great a product</li>
            <li>but we do have rough spots that don&#x27;t look great with sandals and sandal season</li>
            <li>It already comes with batteries so once you can get the clam shell package open, you are good</li>
            <li>Once you are done, the tool cleans up nicely and so far it has lasted for weeks</li>
            <li>I used both products side by side for almost a full month to compare and here is what I found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Dremel tool is a good, but less safe option.</li>
            <li>course I did not read the instructions, and just popped the batteries in and turned it on and put it right on my huge calloused</li>
            <li>and I was happy that as someone who is extremely ticklish it didn&#x27;t seem to bother me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to store, easy to keep clean, and ultimately gets the job done quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of keeping my feet soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean--the roller comes out with the click of a button, most of the dander falls out right away, and a soft brush will remove any dander that sticks inside.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will do it a few more times, and I am expecting better and better results.</li>
            <li>This REALLY REALLY does what it says it&#x27;s going to do and removes callouses quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>The roller on the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s is reset and it is not as easy to get around, although that may keep you from putting too much pressure on your skin.</li>
            <li>A must have for anyone wanting pretty feet to wear with sandals!</li>
            <li>careful when first using the foot smoother not to overdo it as it is very effective.</li>
            <li>: Both are great at buffing off the dead skin on my heels.</li>
            <li>you get what you pay for, and this smoother is absolutely worth it.  </li>
            <li>would probably go with something more of a professional grade.</li>
            <li>Stars because we found it fun to use.  </li>
            <li>(It is worth noting that this device has no way to catch and contain them.  </li>
            <li>In 2013, I purchased our first one for my husband as a funny (but useful!)</li>
            <li>The roller wears out pretty quickly and it&#x27;s something like $15 for a set of 2.</li>
            <li>On the down side there are some additional costs with this product as you will need to replace the rollers after a couple of months but overall an effective product to keep your feet nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Right. Eliminates the &#x27;crusty&#x27; heel build up.</li>
            <li>The kit itself contains everything you need to get started right out of the box including 2x AA batteries and one micro-grain roller cartridge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it was overall easy to use and worked fine.</li>
            <li>It makes quick work of it and leaves your feet smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Solidly built and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>However, after multiple mentions (Constant nagging lol) by the wife that my feet felt like sandpaper.</li>
            <li>In fact, you couldn&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;d used the device - except that my feet were smooth and free of gross</li>
            <li>One surprising feature that was not obvious from the product title is that this is completely cordless (battery operated).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very gentle and doesn’t hurt at all.</li>
            <li>This electronic pedicure foot file smoother from Dr. Scholl&#x27;s is quite effective on light to moderate dried, callused feet - anything more severe than</li>
            <li>No more catching your heels in your stockings!</li>
            <li>This works, and works well and works fast!  </li>
            <li>The first day remove what you can.</li>
            <li>Walk Express Pedi Foot Smoother and really like it!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, for dead skins and minor callouses, this unit is great!</li>
            <li>This is the first thing that has worked for me.</li>
            <li>Works very well!  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You actually would get more use out of a pumice stone, which could be used to remove calluses anywhere on your foot, not just on your heels.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The Dr. Scholl&#x27;s only takes 2 batteries so it can be much more compact.</li>
            <li>But for the more calloused parts, this simply didn&#x27;t do the job I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first was the packaging.  </li>
            <li>I have had to deal with dry, cracked feet all my life, and this file makes the care very easy.</li>
            <li>soon as I got the product, which was delivered pretty fast, I had to test it</li>
            <li>I think the &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34; and harder (been there longer) patches will simply take more time and more repeated &amp;#34;grinding&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Then I went to nail wraps, Jamberry, and I pretty much haven’t been in to my manicure place since then.  </li>
            <li>Another minute of use in the same spot and my toe was smooth for the first time in over 20 years, no exageration.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Works great for minor rough patches.</li>
            <li>It is only powered by 2 batteries so that my be the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roller replacement: Both have easy to remove rollers when the time comes to replace them.</li>
            <li>Normally I do the wet filing thing using one of those flat exfoliators that look like cheese graters and they work great, but I don&#x27;t always have time to file my feet in the morning after I shower.</li>
            <li>The nice thing about this model is it has a little shelf that catches some of the dust from the filings.</li>
            <li>ok, the plastic across the top makes it hard to get the callous on my foot near my toes.</li>
            <li>This foot smoother really works.  </li>
            <li>, it wasn&#x27;t really, you have to keep in mind</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone who wants to get rid of yucky looking calluses without paying a spa pedicure price.</li>
            <li>The description claims it removes corns and calluses, but it did not do much for the corns on the soles of my feet.</li>
            <li>The file really lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>This foot file let me get my heels ready for sandals, smoothing them and leaving them (with some lotion) soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a \\&quot;safety stall\\&quot; feature that stops it if you apply too much pressure.  </li>
            <li>The bottom of my feet feel so much smoother.  </li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>Unless you plan on polishing your calluses or trimming your toe nails this will not be of much use.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s smooth like a baby&#x27;s skin but definitely made an improvement.  </li>
            <li>It works well, but you have to have a gentle touch.</li>
            <li>It takes some time and really drains the batteries.</li>
            <li>They are very effective!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: I went through the batteries much faster with the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>that I really thought that it would be a slam dunk decision.</li>
            <li>that I really thought that it would be a slam dunk decision.</li>
            <li>This is a very efficient motorized foot file and buffer.</li>
            <li>Cleaning and replacing the add is also very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The result is soft, healthy feet without the hassle of regular exfoliators.</li>
            <li>It also works on dry feet (as in you don&#x27;t have to soak your feet first - a huge time saver.)</li>
            <li>In fact, I think it is better than other foot files because you can overdo it with others, which results in cracks and sore spots (I really get into my exfoliation).</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find replacement rollers locally either, so that means I&#x27;d have to special order them if I wanted to continue to use</li>
            <li>for Use: Dry feet are necessary for effective use in both.</li>
            <li>However, I find that the sandpaper on the rollers is only good for a few pedis.  </li>
            <li>I was truly in awe of how fast this works to debride my feet of dead skin, but it&#x27;s also safe.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The Amope&#x27;s roller is exposed almost the entire way around and allows me to tackle thick calluses on the bottom of my feet much more easily.  </li>
            <li>In no time at all my small calluses were gone from the heels and balls of my feet and smooth and pretty for spring time flip flops!  </li>
            <li>All it really is good for is light smoothing of your heels, don&#x27;t even think about using it to try and get that callus off of your big toe, you will be sorry if you do.</li>
            <li>The instructions tell you to use this wet after soaking your feet, and you definitely get a better (stronger) exfoliation, but it isn&#x27;t absolutely necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not have a way to catch the dead skin so you will want to file it on top of a towel.  </li>
            <li>I honestly never thought I&#x27;d love this product as much as I do.</li>
            <li>This motorized file completely transformed my rough winter feet into smooth, sandle-worthy ones.  </li>
            <li>I tried to take a callus off of my big toe, and scared myself quite a bit, the device made a funny sound, and needless to say, I had no interest in trying to do that more than once.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just be sure to have a tissue or washcloth to catch the exfoliated dry skin and some moisturizer so the newly exposed skin doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li>The Amope has a round shape to the handle that is much longer than the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s more flat and contoured shape.</li>
            <li>I found that the more minor patches are easier to handle in a &amp;#34;sitting&amp;#34; and then the more rough / thicker ones will take a few or multiple attempts.</li>
            <li>I’m glad I spotted that, though it was hardly obvious.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I was pleasantly surprised to see how it smooths my the heels of my feet without soaking.  </li>
            <li>the gritty \\&quot;antimicrobial treatment\\&quot; roller spins rapidly, and gently grinds away at the surface of your skin, producing dust-like dander particles.  </li>
            <li>the Amope, it isn&#x27;t too loud.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough that I didn&#x27;t worry about her using it by herself.  </li>
            <li>but I find that it&#x27;s underpowered and works much more slowly than a foot file/rasp.</li>
            <li>I would say that this is a painless, easy to use device that will take care of small problems.  </li>
            <li>Hustle your scaly little feet right on over to the  computer and order this!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not certain how effective it will be on heavily callused feet, but I definitely see a marked difference and will continue to use this!</li>
            <li>But, maybe it&#x27;s not fair to review this in comparison with something designed for more industrial tasks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did exactly what I expected it to do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I’ve previously used moisturizers that prevent hard skin but nothing works more quickly on hardened skin than a product like this that simply removes it instead if treating it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The amount of time needed to cut down a callus really isn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t on dry cracked feet.</li>
            <li>It really shreds through dry, dead skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>It handles slightly dry, rough feet well, but it did nothing much for my dad&#x27;s more heavily calloused feet.</li>
            <li>(they aren&#x27;t); it&#x27;s that I want to get the gross job done as fast and cleanly as possible.</li>
            <li>It removed all of my wife&#x27;s dried flaking skin from her heals quickly and complely.</li>
            <li>Please note that you can actually see the dead skin being sloughed off, which can be very disconcerting the first time you use it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>wide window in which a cylinder of sandpaper rotates when a large switch is turned on.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I (she&#x27;s a young teen) don&#x27;t have huge thick callouses</li>
            <li>That means I have to soak my feet when I have time and it becomes just a big old</li>
            <li>Essentially you are sanding away the callous, a process that produces a considerable amount of dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>device did do a decent job on my heels, but I felt it was too limited in function for the price.</li>
            <li>The only downside is the refills are pretty expensive considering how quickly you need to buy new ones.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s kind of expensive to use regularly, because of the need to replace the roller every 2-3 months.  </li>
            <li>This foot file is decent, but not much of the roller is exposed.  </li>
            <li>I can use this dry to gently exfoliate the dry patches on my skin and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li>This just gently removes dry skin without getting too rough but it still does the job.</li>
            <li>This is far safer, but also far less efficient.</li>
            <li>If you have big, thick or stubborn calluses and want a product that is quick, efficient and don&#x27;t mind paying almost $40 for it, this is definitely it!  </li>
            <li>product when on does not seem powerful, if pressed on your foot hard, the roller will stop.</li>

            <li> Best thing ever.</li>
            <li> My review will be a comparison of the Amope Pedi Perfect and the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Express Pedi electronic foot file.</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> but I found that it worked best for me.</li>
            <li> It works great and the price is perfect.</li>
            <li> Great price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Turns out it works great</li>
            <li> A great investment.</li>
            <li> It works great.</li>

            <li> I am so in love with my Amope Pedi Perfect</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully, and it&#x27;s so quick and efficient!</li>
            <li> Need a good knife or shears.</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> The Dr. Scholl&#x27;s version turned out to be a good choice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes two AA batteries, and I recommend getting good quality rechargeable batteries.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spend 8+ hours on my feet at work and while my shoes are good at keeping them from being sore at the end of the day, they have toughened them up a bit.</li>
            <li> But I question if it this product is greatly superior to competitive</li>
            <li> The good news is that you get 2 rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was very easy to use and is very effective.  </li>
            <li> Ease of use is good and effective.</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> My feet has never felt better!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this device!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> OMG ... I Love it!</li>
            <li> Last year, I received the Amope Pedi Perfect and loved it!</li>
            <li> So nice.</li>
            <li> This is well made, and it&#x27;s surprisingly effective.</li>
            <li> Another nice feature of this roller is that no pre-soaking of your feet is required.</li>
            <li> You can bring your own tools</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing machine, doing well job, easy to use, good quality, wonderful paking, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> By far the best invention for callused feet.</li>
            <li> My feet will look nice and smooth for summer shoes!  </li>
            <li> I liked the way the Amope roller had more close access to my heels.</li>
            <li> Just add the battery and press up to turn on, how easy is that!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get to try this competitor&#x27;s product to see how it matches up to my beloved Amope.</li>
            <li> This does a fine job!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and fits in my hand nicely.</li>
            <li> the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s is much better</li>
            <li> My feet feel and look fabulous!</li>
            <li> Better than going to the podiatrist..</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> abrasive on this is more aggressive than the Amope.  </li>
            <li> and boy did my foot feel better.  </li>
            <li> Dr. Scholl&#x27;s version, though, does have more power and while it won&#x27;t fix your feet and heels in one sitting, it does make a noticeable difference after just one try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Not one of these metro sexual, fru fru guys that is the norm today.</li>
            <li> and it got my feet nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Love this item.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing like a smooth heel!</li>
            <li> I love this apparatus.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it is safe and won&#x27;t chew up your skin or cause any cuts.</li>
            <li> work ok, but none are a magic bullet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I want to invite friends over to peel our feet! :)</li>
            <li> This device works a lot better and more safely than the blades that are used in a manicure shop.  </li>
            <li> I know Dr. Scholl makes quality products, but I wasn&#x27;t at all sure that their electronic pedicure device was worth a bucket of warm</li>
            <li> Without pedicures my feet can become rough and unattractive and this is the perfect solution.  </li>
            <li> It really works good.  </li>
            <li> I fell in love with this tool on the very first use and a month later I am still impressed with the job the original roller and batteries do.</li>
            <li> I love pairing it with a foot scrub and a rich body cream.</li>
            <li> , she finds it easy to use</li>
            <li> I searched for an easy way to do this at home.  </li>
            <li> Use of this automatic smoother was easy to figure out</li>
            <li> Inserting and removing the roller is easy.</li>
            <li> device is easy to hold, by the way.  </li>
            <li> This is an easy, at home way to get smoother feet.  </li>
            <li> then I would consider it strongly.</li>
            <li> then I would consider it strongly.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> As much as I love them, this makes doing it at home cheap, easy, and quick.</li>
            <li> Seriously though, it is awesome, my feet are so smooth and feel great, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It is shaped to fit comfortably in the hand, although it is made of smooth plastic for sanitary reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it actually works great.</li>
            <li> This product does help smooth your feet.</li>
            <li> Fortunately the roller didn&#x27;t break the skin or leave a mark.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Replacement rollers are available from Amazon (e.g., [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> More powerful then I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I decide to get something to smooth it out.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> It is gentle but effective and did the job for me.  </li>
            <li> Overall it seems to work great</li>
            <li> I am happy with it and anyone trying to do something for their feet will likely find this easier than a pumice stone to use.</li>
            <li> my feet are smooth after a i min. sanding.</li>
            <li> It evenly removes calluses so the skin looks smooth as if it never had any hard/dead skin before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both are comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s was much more economical than the Amope</li>
            <li> If the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s was much more economical than the Amope</li>
            <li> The results are visible both in how smooth your feet look and feel but also in the amount of skin particles</li>
            <li> Some do cling to the roller and can be removed by tapping this lightly against a trash can</li>
            <li> roller action is robust and will generate a good deal of skin filings</li>
            <li> Very powerful, unlike the cheaper models.</li>
            <li> a very useful tool</li>
            <li> The tool is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> So, get the original one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Beware, however, of being too enthusiastic in using it on the same patch of skin, because you can end up wearing away more than the callous.</li>
            <li> It could be better, but for products actually designed for this task, this is pretty good.</li>
            <li> so shipping was free and fast!!</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of this foot file, especially as it presents itself as so user friendly and easy to use.</li>
            <li> not really that great a product</li>
            <li> but we do have rough spots that don&#x27;t look great with sandals and sandal season</li>
            <li> It already comes with batteries so once you can get the clam shell package open, you are good</li>
            <li> Once you are done, the tool cleans up nicely and so far it has lasted for weeks</li>
            <li> I used both products side by side for almost a full month to compare and here is what I found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Dremel tool is a good, but less safe option.</li>
            <li> course I did not read the instructions, and just popped the batteries in and turned it on and put it right on my huge calloused</li>
            <li> and I was happy that as someone who is extremely ticklish it didn&#x27;t seem to bother me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to store, easy to keep clean, and ultimately gets the job done quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of keeping my feet soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean--the roller comes out with the click of a button, most of the dander falls out right away, and a soft brush will remove any dander that sticks inside.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will do it a few more times, and I am expecting better and better results.</li>
            <li> This REALLY REALLY does what it says it&#x27;s going to do and removes callouses quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> The roller on the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s is reset and it is not as easy to get around, although that may keep you from putting too much pressure on your skin.</li>
            <li> A must have for anyone wanting pretty feet to wear with sandals!</li>
            <li> careful when first using the foot smoother not to overdo it as it is very effective.</li>
            <li> : Both are great at buffing off the dead skin on my heels.</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for, and this smoother is absolutely worth it.  </li>
            <li> would probably go with something more of a professional grade.</li>
            <li> Stars because we found it fun to use.  </li>
            <li> (It is worth noting that this device has no way to catch and contain them.  </li>
            <li> In 2013, I purchased our first one for my husband as a funny (but useful!)</li>
            <li> The roller wears out pretty quickly and it&#x27;s something like $15 for a set of 2.</li>
            <li> On the down side there are some additional costs with this product as you will need to replace the rollers after a couple of months but overall an effective product to keep your feet nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Right. Eliminates the &#x27;crusty&#x27; heel build up.</li>
            <li> The kit itself contains everything you need to get started right out of the box including 2x AA batteries and one micro-grain roller cartridge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was overall easy to use and worked fine.</li>
            <li> It makes quick work of it and leaves your feet smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Solidly built and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> However, after multiple mentions (Constant nagging lol) by the wife that my feet felt like sandpaper.</li>
            <li> In fact, you couldn&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;d used the device - except that my feet were smooth and free of gross</li>
            <li> One surprising feature that was not obvious from the product title is that this is completely cordless (battery operated).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very gentle and doesn’t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> This electronic pedicure foot file smoother from Dr. Scholl&#x27;s is quite effective on light to moderate dried, callused feet - anything more severe than</li>
            <li> No more catching your heels in your stockings!</li>
            <li> This works, and works well and works fast!  </li>
            <li> The first day remove what you can.</li>
            <li> Walk Express Pedi Foot Smoother and really like it!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, for dead skins and minor callouses, this unit is great!</li>
            <li> This is the first thing that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> Works very well!  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You actually would get more use out of a pumice stone, which could be used to remove calluses anywhere on your foot, not just on your heels.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The Dr. Scholl&#x27;s only takes 2 batteries so it can be much more compact.</li>
            <li> But for the more calloused parts, this simply didn&#x27;t do the job I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first was the packaging.  </li>
            <li> I have had to deal with dry, cracked feet all my life, and this file makes the care very easy.</li>
            <li> soon as I got the product, which was delivered pretty fast, I had to test it</li>
            <li> I think the &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34; and harder (been there longer) patches will simply take more time and more repeated &amp;#34;grinding&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Then I went to nail wraps, Jamberry, and I pretty much haven’t been in to my manicure place since then.  </li>
            <li> Another minute of use in the same spot and my toe was smooth for the first time in over 20 years, no exageration.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Works great for minor rough patches.</li>
            <li> It is only powered by 2 batteries so that my be the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roller replacement: Both have easy to remove rollers when the time comes to replace them.</li>
            <li> Normally I do the wet filing thing using one of those flat exfoliators that look like cheese graters and they work great, but I don&#x27;t always have time to file my feet in the morning after I shower.</li>
            <li> The nice thing about this model is it has a little shelf that catches some of the dust from the filings.</li>
            <li> ok, the plastic across the top makes it hard to get the callous on my foot near my toes.</li>
            <li> This foot smoother really works.  </li>
            <li> , it wasn&#x27;t really, you have to keep in mind</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone who wants to get rid of yucky looking calluses without paying a spa pedicure price.</li>
            <li> The description claims it removes corns and calluses, but it did not do much for the corns on the soles of my feet.</li>
            <li> The file really lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> This foot file let me get my heels ready for sandals, smoothing them and leaving them (with some lotion) soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a \\&quot;safety stall\\&quot; feature that stops it if you apply too much pressure.  </li>
            <li> The bottom of my feet feel so much smoother.  </li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> Unless you plan on polishing your calluses or trimming your toe nails this will not be of much use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s smooth like a baby&#x27;s skin but definitely made an improvement.  </li>
            <li> It works well, but you have to have a gentle touch.</li>
            <li> It takes some time and really drains the batteries.</li>
            <li> They are very effective!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : I went through the batteries much faster with the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> that I really thought that it would be a slam dunk decision.</li>
            <li> that I really thought that it would be a slam dunk decision.</li>
            <li> This is a very efficient motorized foot file and buffer.</li>
            <li> Cleaning and replacing the add is also very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The result is soft, healthy feet without the hassle of regular exfoliators.</li>
            <li> It also works on dry feet (as in you don&#x27;t have to soak your feet first - a huge time saver.)</li>
            <li> In fact, I think it is better than other foot files because you can overdo it with others, which results in cracks and sore spots (I really get into my exfoliation).</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find replacement rollers locally either, so that means I&#x27;d have to special order them if I wanted to continue to use</li>
            <li> for Use: Dry feet are necessary for effective use in both.</li>
            <li> However, I find that the sandpaper on the rollers is only good for a few pedis.  </li>
            <li> I was truly in awe of how fast this works to debride my feet of dead skin, but it&#x27;s also safe.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The Amope&#x27;s roller is exposed almost the entire way around and allows me to tackle thick calluses on the bottom of my feet much more easily.  </li>
            <li> In no time at all my small calluses were gone from the heels and balls of my feet and smooth and pretty for spring time flip flops!  </li>
            <li> All it really is good for is light smoothing of your heels, don&#x27;t even think about using it to try and get that callus off of your big toe, you will be sorry if you do.</li>
            <li> The instructions tell you to use this wet after soaking your feet, and you definitely get a better (stronger) exfoliation, but it isn&#x27;t absolutely necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not have a way to catch the dead skin so you will want to file it on top of a towel.  </li>
            <li> I honestly never thought I&#x27;d love this product as much as I do.</li>
            <li> This motorized file completely transformed my rough winter feet into smooth, sandle-worthy ones.  </li>
            <li> I tried to take a callus off of my big toe, and scared myself quite a bit, the device made a funny sound, and needless to say, I had no interest in trying to do that more than once.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be sure to have a tissue or washcloth to catch the exfoliated dry skin and some moisturizer so the newly exposed skin doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> The Amope has a round shape to the handle that is much longer than the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s more flat and contoured shape.</li>
            <li> I found that the more minor patches are easier to handle in a &amp;#34;sitting&amp;#34; and then the more rough / thicker ones will take a few or multiple attempts.</li>
            <li> I’m glad I spotted that, though it was hardly obvious.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I was pleasantly surprised to see how it smooths my the heels of my feet without soaking.  </li>
            <li> the gritty \\&quot;antimicrobial treatment\\&quot; roller spins rapidly, and gently grinds away at the surface of your skin, producing dust-like dander particles.  </li>
            <li> the Amope, it isn&#x27;t too loud.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough that I didn&#x27;t worry about her using it by herself.  </li>
            <li> but I find that it&#x27;s underpowered and works much more slowly than a foot file/rasp.</li>
            <li> I would say that this is a painless, easy to use device that will take care of small problems.  </li>
            <li> Hustle your scaly little feet right on over to the  computer and order this!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not certain how effective it will be on heavily callused feet, but I definitely see a marked difference and will continue to use this!</li>
            <li> But, maybe it&#x27;s not fair to review this in comparison with something designed for more industrial tasks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did exactly what I expected it to do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I’ve previously used moisturizers that prevent hard skin but nothing works more quickly on hardened skin than a product like this that simply removes it instead if treating it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The amount of time needed to cut down a callus really isn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t on dry cracked feet.</li>
            <li> It really shreds through dry, dead skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> It handles slightly dry, rough feet well, but it did nothing much for my dad&#x27;s more heavily calloused feet.</li>
            <li> (they aren&#x27;t); it&#x27;s that I want to get the gross job done as fast and cleanly as possible.</li>
            <li> It removed all of my wife&#x27;s dried flaking skin from her heals quickly and complely.</li>
            <li> Please note that you can actually see the dead skin being sloughed off, which can be very disconcerting the first time you use it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> wide window in which a cylinder of sandpaper rotates when a large switch is turned on.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I (she&#x27;s a young teen) don&#x27;t have huge thick callouses</li>
            <li> That means I have to soak my feet when I have time and it becomes just a big old</li>
            <li> Essentially you are sanding away the callous, a process that produces a considerable amount of dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> device did do a decent job on my heels, but I felt it was too limited in function for the price.</li>
            <li> The only downside is the refills are pretty expensive considering how quickly you need to buy new ones.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s kind of expensive to use regularly, because of the need to replace the roller every 2-3 months.  </li>
            <li> This foot file is decent, but not much of the roller is exposed.  </li>
            <li> I can use this dry to gently exfoliate the dry patches on my skin and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> This just gently removes dry skin without getting too rough but it still does the job.</li>
            <li> This is far safer, but also far less efficient.</li>
            <li> If you have big, thick or stubborn calluses and want a product that is quick, efficient and don&#x27;t mind paying almost $40 for it, this is definitely it!  </li>
            <li> product when on does not seem powerful, if pressed on your foot hard, the roller will stop.</li>
            <li> DO remember to use it over a wastebasket or a towel, or prepare to vacuum the area afterward.  </li>
            <li> She has very rough heels, smoothed them out, left them feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my usually thickly knotted area just below my little toe was after my very first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, the batteries don&#x27;t last long - in the fourth time of use, my husband&#x27;s feet had burned out the power in the batteries!</li>
            <li> (being that I am a human who walks on my feet) and while lotion goes a long way to easing my ashy heels, exfoliating is absolutely critical.</li>
            <li> I was surprised this little device actually made a difference.  </li>
            <li> This worked well on the parts that were only slightly rough, like my pinkie toe and sides of my big toe.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, to be honest, my feet aren&#x27;t that bad.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I was actually kind of shocked at how well the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Pedi Express worked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I was actually kind of shocked at how well the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Pedi Express worked.</li>
            <li> long.  </li>
            <li> The calluses I have (had) on my feet were minor.  </li>
            <li> You have to call for pricing information, which I thought was strange.</li>
            <li> You can use these rollers for a long time before they are shot.</li>
            <li> these rollers for a long time before they are shot.</li>
            <li> This is a bit expensive, but it does offer significant convenience over fully manual methods.</li>
            <li> you can see dry skin flaking off.</li>
            <li> After a dry winter, I was preparing to go out with my feet uncovered.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li> I get dry, calloused feet</li>
            <li> your feet, dry them thoroughly and have at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does work, but I hope that this second round of batteries (AA) that aren&#x27;t from the manufacturer will last longer...</li>
            <li> Not powerful enough to make a difference.</li>
            <li> This hand-held foot smoother is a little over 5 1/2 in.</li>
            <li> If you have really bad callouses you may need something more substantial, like good-old sandpaper.</li>
            <li> I have to say if you have rough feet this is for you.</li>
            <li> The abrasive is not very abrasive and as soon as you put pressure on the motor it slows to a crawl.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat rough feet.  </li>
            <li> The file is 1 ½ inches wide.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t have the power for really rough feet.</li>
            <li> I have really rough patches on the bottom of my feet.</li>
            <li> This will work after a few tries ooh especially.</li>
            <li> This is actually the second one of these foot filers that has made its way into our household in the past few years.</li>
            <li> If you have the usual callous feet in the summer, this will work painlessly (although it may tickle a little if your feet are sensitive).</li>
            <li> It is comparable in price to other stores, like Target, which also has to be ordered on line and shipped to the store.  </li>
            <li> B00O51FGG8 Dr S Exp Pedi Foot Smoth Refil]]), or from Target, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, and other sources (prices start around $15 for two rollers).</li>
            <li> But if you have minor ones, don&#x27;t mind smoothing them by hand and want to save a few dollars</li>
            <li> If you have extremely calloused feet that need an orbital sander to remove, then this won&#x27;t do it.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, Dr. Scholl’s turns out quality products and is dedicated to customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> you get pedicures on a monthly/ every other month basis, I think this would help maintain it between services.</li>
            <li> I just wish that the roller wasn&#x27;t trapped behind so much</li>
            <li> instructions recommend that you NOT use it on children under 12, over sensitive skin areas, or in the presence of poor circulation.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be let down by this pedi smoother.  </li>
            <li> down side is that this doesn&#x27;t have a screen to catch the skin, so the skin falls on the ground and you have to be prepared to catch it with a towel or something.</li>
            <li> so we ended up putting down a slightly damp towel to grab</li>
            <li> callouse was half gone.</li>
            <li> We have used the PedEgg it that worked well, but the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Pedicure Foot File automatic sanding will require less manual movement to use.</li>
            <li> Typically, I use one of those scrapers that have a razor blade in it.</li>
            <li> They both will make quite a mess.</li>
            <li> Because of the wide, electric-shaver-head design, it&#x27;s not useful for smoothing away the hard skin that sometimes forms at the sides of your toes (when you wear tight shoes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : The Amope has a slightly longer buffing roller that takes off the dead skin.</li>
            <li> I think they slapped the word, &amp;#34;electronic&amp;#34; on it to jack up the price a little.</li>
            <li> It’s not just the blades that worry me; it is also the periodic news reports about the cleanliness and the dangers of the little corner manicure shops.  </li>
            <li> little machine has done wonders for my feet.</li>
            <li> The packaging is very hard to open.</li>
            <li> I had tried that one a few times, and agreed that it made little difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no catcher for the dead skin on this device, so have a towel down to catch the flakes!</li>
            <li> Cannot believe the dead skin it took off in just a matter of seconds.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll end up with a pile of dead skin shavings with either option.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> works well and filing off dead skin and calluses.</li>
            <li> The dust is what becomes of the dead skin it removes.</li>
            <li> The powdery storm of dead skin seems finer on the Amope.</li>
            <li> With either, you should not stay in one place longer than a few seconds.</li>
            <li> so I would use this in a place where some skin dust gets left behind doesn&#x27;t bother you.)  </li>
            <li> If you have hard dead skin on your feet.</li>
            <li> There is a small safety lock on one side and a removable plastic cover for the window.&lt;br</li>
            <li> sandpaper cylinder is replaceable and there are other compatible brands that are less expensive and come in a range of grits.  </li>
            <li> You need to be careful with this device--especially if you have thin or delicate skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s underpowered for anything except feet with very minor callouses.</li>
            <li> SCHOLL&#x27;s ELECTRONIC PEDICURE FOOT FILE is a battery-operated sanding device for removing calluses and hard skin from the soles of your feet.  </li>
            <li> But it is not meant to be pressed hard.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t hard as a rock but did need a filing.  </li>
            <li> If you press to hard it will stop rotating.</li>
            <li> You’d hardly want to sand your skin away through a moment</li>
            <li> If you press too hard, which I tried, it just shuts</li>
            <li> Why make it so hard to get a product out of the package.  </li>
            <li> Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Express Pedi Foot Smoother works as advertised--at least on the bottoms and sides of the feet.  </li>
            <li> I almost wrote a negative review.  </li>
            <li> There was a scary pile of skin dust in the bath when I was done (empty bath that I sat on the edge of to catch all the grossness).</li>
            <li> I have watched late night television</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see it working well on thick callouses; it just doesn&#x27;t have the strength nor the grittiness on the roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He tried it a few times and was generally disappointed with its lack of power that made little impact on the canyons and valleys of dry skin on his heels.</li>
            <li> no more Fear of Sandals!</li>
            <li> If you look closely on the bottom of the package, there is a warning in extremely small type: do not use if you have diabetes or poor blood circulation.</li>
            <li> weak motor.</li>
            <li> I read reviews before buying, some stated it was expensive</li>
            <li> The problem with that is that the replacement heads are expensive...</li>
            <li> But alas!  </li>
            <li> ’s careless use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For a product this expensive I would expect it to be re-chargeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very poor.</li>
            <li> spit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong!</li>
            <li> switch was bad- returned item</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that my feet are that bad</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not going in for pedicures has had a disastrous effect on my feet.  </li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s some annoying features as well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The packaging is annoying as is the fact that you have to use batteries.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the hype. It really doesn&#x27;t on dry cracked feet. They must be thinking of 10yr olds.</li>
            <li> Hustle your scaly little feet right on over to the  computer and order this!  No more catching your heels in your stockings! no more Fear of Sandals! This works, and works well and works fast!  DO remember to use it over a wastebasket or a towel, or prepare to vacuum the area afterward.  Buy it!  your pedicurist will thank you.</li>
            <li> I had another brand  from my drug store before I got this one . the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s is much better</li>
            <li> switch was bad- returned item</li>
            <li> Love this! By far the best invention for callused feet. The only downside is the refills are pretty expensive considering how quickly you need to buy new ones.</li>
            <li> This foot smoother really works.  I bought this for my elderly mother, she finds it easy to use and it actually works great. She has very rough heels, smoothed them out, left them feeling soft.  It is comparable in price to other stores, like Target, which also has to be ordered on line and shipped to the store.  I read reviews before buying, some stated it was expensive, it wasn&#x27;t really, you have to keep in mind you get what you pay for, and this smoother is absolutely worth it.  You won&#x27;t be let down by this pedi smoother.  Product was delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> My feet has never felt better!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this device! I have had to deal with dry, cracked feet all my life, and this file makes the care very easy. Love it!</li>
            <li> I honestly never thought I&#x27;d love this product as much as I do. It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to store, easy to keep clean, and ultimately gets the job done quickly. I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my usually thickly knotted area just below my little toe was after my very first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With sandal season just around the corner I would recommend this for anyone who wants to get rid of yucky looking calluses without paying a spa pedicure price. As much as I love them, this makes doing it at home cheap, easy, and quick.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, I am obsessed with it. My feet feel and look fabulous! Buy it and spoil yourself.</li>
            <li> This does a fine job!</li>
            <li> Did exactly what I expected it to do. I recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li> Better than going to the podiatrist..</li>
            <li> This product does help smooth your feet. The description claims it removes corns and calluses, but it did not do much for the corns on the soles of my feet. My podiatrist calls them &amp;#34;seed corns&amp;#34; and prescibed a cream to soften them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We you use this you can see dry skin flaking off.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Priced Right. Eliminates the &#x27;crusty&#x27; heel build up.</li>
            <li> Love it.  It really works good.  I have recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> The file really lived up to my expectations.It removed all of my wife&#x27;s dried flaking skin from her heals quickly and complely. Delivery on the date promised..</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Can be used by MEN&amp;#34; for callouses caused by weightlifting?! How sexist can you be?!! Glad I bought a competitor&#x27;s product instead of yours!</li>
            <li> After a dry winter, I was preparing to go out with my feet uncovered. This foot file let me get my heels ready for sandals, smoothing them and leaving them (with some lotion) soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be using it as I continue to wear sandals over the summer.</li>
            <li> OMG ... I Love it! I didn&#x27;t know what to expect so I was pleasantly surprised to see how it smooths my the heels of my feet without soaking.  Definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> This DR. SCHOLL&#x27;s ELECTRONIC PEDICURE FOOT FILE is a battery-operated sanding device for removing calluses and hard skin from the soles of your feet.  When you switch it on, the gritty \\&quot;antimicrobial treatment\\&quot; roller spins rapidly, and gently grinds away at the surface of your skin, producing dust-like dander particles.  Because of the wide, electric-shaver-head design, it&#x27;s not useful for smoothing away the hard skin that sometimes forms at the sides of your toes (when you wear tight shoes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was painless when I used it on the heels and soles of my feet.  It has a \\&quot;safety stall\\&quot; feature that stops it if you apply too much pressure.  But when I inadvertently touched my thumb against the spinning roller, it hurt!  Fortunately the roller didn&#x27;t break the skin or leave a mark.  You need to be careful with this device--especially if you have thin or delicate skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions recommend that you NOT use it on children under 12, over sensitive skin areas, or in the presence of poor circulation.  It has batteries (included), so it shouldn&#x27;t be used in the bath or shower; also, you don&#x27;t want to drop it in a water-filled sink.  It&#x27;s easy to clean--the roller comes out with the click of a button, most of the dander falls out right away, and a soft brush will remove any dander that sticks inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacement rollers are available from Amazon (e.g., [[ASIN:B00O51FGG8 Dr S Exp Pedi Foot Smoth Refil]]), or from Target, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, and other sources (prices start around $15 for two rollers). The instructions recommend replacing the roller every 60-90 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Express Pedi Foot Smoother works as advertised--at least on the bottoms and sides of the feet.  However, it&#x27;s kind of expensive to use regularly, because of the need to replace the roller every 2-3 months.  I rate it at 3 stars (\\&quot;It&#x27;s okay\\&quot; on the official Amazon scale).</li>
            <li> I have used a similar Amope product and prefer that.  This foot file is decent, but not much of the roller is exposed.  The Amope&#x27;s roller is exposed almost the entire way around and allows me to tackle thick calluses on the bottom of my feet much more easily.  This one, however, won&#x27;t allow me to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The abrasive on this is more aggressive than the Amope.  It really shreds through dry, dead skin quickly.  I just wish that the roller wasn&#x27;t trapped behind so much plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the Amope, it isn&#x27;t too loud.</li>
            <li> I have to say if you have rough feet this is for you. This is very easy to use. It&#x27;s like having a pumice stone on a wheel. If you have hard dead skin on your feet. This will work after a few tries ooh especially. The first day remove what you can. Add lotion to your feet when finish. Repeat the same procedure the next next day. After that keep moisturizing your feet. In a few days your feet will be ready for sandals.  Batteries are located in the package. The packaging is very hard to open. Need a good knife or shears. Overall worked for me.</li>
            <li> Does what it says!! Very effective</li>
            <li> I got the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Dream Walk Express Pedi Foot Smoother and really like it!  Cannot believe the dead skin it took off in just a matter of seconds.  The bottom of my feet feel so much smoother.  A must have for anyone wanting pretty feet to wear with sandals!</li>
            <li> Really works. Good product</li>
            <li> ok, the plastic across the top makes it hard to get the callous on my foot near my toes.</li>
            <li> Every girl needs one of these......best thing I have purchased in ten years......</li>
            <li> Really happy with it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother!  Does NOT work. I&#x27;d have given it 0 stars. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of this foot file, especially as it presents itself as so user friendly and easy to use. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s underpowered for anything except feet with very minor callouses. It handles slightly dry, rough feet well, but it did nothing much for my dad&#x27;s more heavily calloused feet. I couldn&#x27;t find replacement rollers locally either, so that means I&#x27;d have to special order them if I wanted to continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, for dead skins and minor callouses, this unit is great! It makes quick work of it and leaves your feet smooth and soft. It&#x27;s quiet and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Worked like it said it would.</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price. Meets my needs perfectly!</li>
            <li> I love the idea of keeping my feet soft and smooth.  However, I find that the sandpaper on the rollers is only good for a few pedis.  The problem with that is that the replacement heads are expensive...</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have a callous on the side of my foot.  It gets so sore.  My podiatrist took care of it once and boy did my foot feel better.  I searched for an easy way to do this at home.  The Dr. Scholl&#x27;s version turned out to be a good choice.  Smooths out my skin very nicely. My feet will look nice and smooth for summer shoes!  Great price on Amazon.  I am a prime member so shipping was free and fast!!</li>
            <li> Very poor. It doesn&#x27;t do what it says it will do. I hate it. I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This hand-held foot smoother is a little over 5 1/2 in. long.  It is shaped to fit comfortably in the hand, although it is made of smooth plastic for sanitary reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a 1 1/2 in. wide window in which a cylinder of sandpaper rotates when a large switch is turned on.  There is a small safety lock on one side and a removable plastic cover for the window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes two AA batteries, and I recommend getting good quality rechargeable batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sandpaper cylinder is replaceable and there are other compatible brands that are less expensive and come in a range of grits.  This one is a medium-fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful when first using the foot smoother not to overdo it as it is very effective.</li>
            <li> Works well, but over several uses. More powerful then I was expecting. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This motorized file completely transformed my rough winter feet into smooth, sandle-worthy ones.  I fell in love with this tool on the very first use and a month later I am still impressed with the job the original roller and batteries do. The tool is super easy to use. Just be sure to have a tissue or washcloth to catch the exfoliated dry skin and some moisturizer so the newly exposed skin doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> This is actually the second one of these foot filers that has made its way into our household in the past few years. In 2013, I purchased our first one for my husband as a funny (but useful!) stocking stuffer. He tried it a few times and was generally disappointed with its lack of power that made little impact on the canyons and valleys of dry skin on his heels. I had tried that one a few times, and agreed that it made little difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Dr. Scholl&#x27;s version, though, does have more power and while it won&#x27;t fix your feet and heels in one sitting, it does make a noticeable difference after just one try. But, the batteries don&#x27;t last long - in the fourth time of use, my husband&#x27;s feet had burned out the power in the batteries! It does work, but I hope that this second round of batteries (AA) that aren&#x27;t from the manufacturer will last longer...</li>
            <li> My wife loves this simple device. Ease of use is good and effective.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully, and it&#x27;s so quick and efficient! I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised with no issue.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Use outdoors, lots of skin dust.</li>
            <li> It works quite well but is not doing its job quite enough.</li>
            <li> Best bargain for the money!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Not powerful enough to make a difference. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Wow. Really works. This is the first thing that has worked for me. I have tried pedicures, a spray from HSN, files, Avon products, even Bag Balm repeatedly over night.</li>
            <li> Unless you plan on polishing your calluses or trimming your toe nails this will not be of much use. The abrasive is not very abrasive and as soon as you put pressure on the motor it slows to a crawl. The amount of time needed to cut down a callus really isn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li> Very powerful, unlike the cheaper models.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy.  I bought this with a lot of skepticism.  Turns out it works great and I love it.  Already got my wife and a friend using it and they can&#x27;t believe how well it works.</li>
            <li> Works very well!  Exactly as described. I recommend not too harsh but really does the job on calloused skin.</li>
            <li> Solidly built and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I never got to use this item as it was defective and did not work.  I returned the item.</li>
            <li> I consider myself a regular blue collar guy. Not one of these metro sexual, fru fru guys that is the norm today. However, after multiple mentions (Constant nagging lol) by the wife that my feet felt like sandpaper. I decide to get something to smooth it out.&lt;br /&gt;Now going to a salon was out of the question. I looked on amazon and began to read reviews. I decide on this one because a lot of the reviews were great.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I got the product, which was delivered pretty fast, I had to test it out.&lt;br /&gt;Of course I did not read the instructions, and just popped the batteries in and turned it on and put it right on my huge calloused (I hope that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s spelled) toe.&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise within 30 seconds of use,&lt;br /&gt;The callouse was half gone. Another minute of use in the same spot and my toe was smooth for the first time in over 20 years, no exageration.&lt;br /&gt;This product when on does not seem powerful, if pressed on your foot hard, the roller will stop. But it is not meant to be pressed hard. It works great and the price is perfect. A great investment.</li>
            <li> The calluses I have (had) on my feet were minor.  I spend 8+ hours on my feet at work and while my shoes are good at keeping them from being sore at the end of the day, they have toughened them up a bit. Use of this automatic smoother was easy to figure out and I was happy that as someone who is extremely ticklish it didn&#x27;t seem to bother me.  In no time at all my small calluses were gone from the heels and balls of my feet and smooth and pretty for spring time flip flops!  If you have big, thick or stubborn calluses and want a product that is quick, efficient and don&#x27;t mind paying almost $40 for it, this is definitely it!  But if you have minor ones, don&#x27;t mind smoothing them by hand and want to save a few dollars I suggest looking at alternatives.</li>
            <li> It definitely works but I find that it&#x27;s underpowered and works much more slowly than a foot file/rasp. If you don&#x27;t mind putting some effort into it then I suggest just going to manual route. The roller wears out pretty quickly and it&#x27;s something like $15 for a set of 2. It&#x27;s not any messier than a foot file. You&#x27;ll end up with a pile of dead skin shavings with either option.</li>
            <li> not really that great a product</li>
            <li> I have somewhat rough feet.  They aren&#x27;t hard as a rock but did need a filing.  I was surprised this little device actually made a difference.  I took a soak in the tub for 30 minutes and came out and decided to file my feet with it and it got my feet nice and smooth.  I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s smooth like a baby&#x27;s skin but definitely made an improvement.  It already comes with batteries so once you can get the clam shell package open, you are good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It does not have a way to catch the dead skin so you will want to file it on top of a towel.  If you have extremely calloused feet that need an orbital sander to remove, then this won&#x27;t do it.  It is gentle but effective and did the job for me.  I will do it a few more times, and I am expecting better and better results.</li>
            <li> All it really is good for is light smoothing of your heels, don&#x27;t even think about using it to try and get that callus off of your big toe, you will be sorry if you do. I tried to take a callus off of my big toe, and scared myself quite a bit, the device made a funny sound, and needless to say, I had no interest in trying to do that more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You actually would get more use out of a pumice stone, which could be used to remove calluses anywhere on your foot, not just on your heels.&lt;br /&gt;This device did do a decent job on my heels, but I felt it was too limited in function for the price.</li>
            <li> This foot file is battery operated. It runs on 2 AA batteries which are included. The file is 1 ½ inches wide. The grit is not too coarse. It works well, but you have to have a gentle touch. If you press to hard it will stop rotating. Inserting and removing the roller is easy. This product comes with an order form for replacement rollers, but does not list the price. You have to call for pricing information, which I thought was strange. In any case, they currently sell the refills here on Amazon for $14.99 for a 2-pack.</li>
            <li> Works great for minor rough patches. I think the &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34; and harder (been there longer) patches will simply take more time and more repeated &amp;#34;grinding&amp;#34;. Overall it seems to work great and I will continue to use it. I found that the more minor patches are easier to handle in a &amp;#34;sitting&amp;#34; and then the more rough / thicker ones will take a few or multiple attempts. I am happy with it and anyone trying to do something for their feet will likely find this easier than a pumice stone to use.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever. Works wonders on dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Love this item. It works great. There&#x27;s nothing like a smooth heel!</li>
            <li> this thing should be standard issue for senior sandal wearers like me. my feet are smooth after a i min. sanding. a very useful tool</li>
            <li> grinding wheel flimsy. weak motor. would probably go with something more of a professional grade.</li>
            <li> I had difficulty in understanding the battery placement.  I almost wrote a negative review.  But alas!  I found the problem.  I love this apparatus.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised. If you have the usual callous feet in the summer, this will work painlessly (although it may tickle a little if your feet are sensitive). If you have really bad callouses you may need something more substantial, like good-old sandpaper. The nice thing about this model is it has a little shelf that catches some of the dust from the filings. But do it on tile or outside because some of the dust will get on the floor. I also have a model I bought for 14.99 from Menards that works just a well. So shop around, they all have about the same amount of power and work on the same principle. I think they slapped the word, &amp;#34;electronic&amp;#34; on it to jack up the price a little.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t have the power for really rough feet.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my niece, she loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and I can&#x27;t imagine how I lived without it. I get dry, calloused feet (being that I am a human who walks on my feet) and while lotion goes a long way to easing my ashy heels, exfoliating is absolutely critical. Normally I do the wet filing thing using one of those flat exfoliators that look like cheese graters and they work great, but I don&#x27;t always have time to file my feet in the morning after I shower. That means I have to soak my feet when I have time and it becomes just a big old hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I can use this dry to gently exfoliate the dry patches on my skin and it works like a charm. In fact, I think it is better than other foot files because you can overdo it with others, which results in cracks and sore spots (I really get into my exfoliation). This just gently removes dry skin without getting too rough but it still does the job. The result is soft, healthy feet without the hassle of regular exfoliators. The instructions tell you to use this wet after soaking your feet, and you definitely get a better (stronger) exfoliation, but it isn&#x27;t absolutely necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The down side is that this doesn&#x27;t have a screen to catch the skin, so the skin falls on the ground and you have to be prepared to catch it with a towel or something. Once you are done, the tool cleans up nicely and so far it has lasted for weeks and I&#x27;ve used it several times every week without losing any power. So nice.</li>
            <li> Well, my wife used to file away calluses using a Dremel tool. This is far safer, but also far less efficient. But, maybe it&#x27;s not fair to review this in comparison with something designed for more industrial tasks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works well and filing off dead skin and calluses. It takes some time and really drains the batteries. After about two uses (four feet), you&#x27;ll need to replace the batteries. Most importantly, it is safe and won&#x27;t chew up your skin or cause any cuts. It could be better, but for products actually designed for this task, this is pretty good. The Dremel tool is a good, but less safe option.</li>
            <li> This was very easy to use and is very effective.  It&#x27;s battery operated and, no worries - it doesn&#x27;t hurt a bit!  Please note that you can actually see the dead skin being sloughed off, which can be very disconcerting the first time you use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to be honest, my feet aren&#x27;t that bad.  But after using this, I felt like I had just gone to a spa or something.  My feet were so soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not certain how effective it will be on heavily callused feet, but I definitely see a marked difference and will continue to use this!</li>
            <li> Emoji has the same device for $29.95.  So, get the original one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Emjoi-Micro-Pedi-Battery-Operated-Remover/dp/B005BG5CK6</li>
            <li> If you look closely on the bottom of the package, there is a warning in extremely small type: do not use if you have diabetes or poor blood circulation. I’m glad I spotted that, though it was hardly obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Instead, my wife gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It works, but it is not a be-all, end-all. For obvious reasons, it doesn’t provide a lot of power. You’d hardly want to sand your skin away through a moment’s careless use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Essentially you are sanding away the callous, a process that produces a considerable amount of dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soak your feet, dry them thoroughly and have at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It works. But I question if it this product is greatly superior to competitive products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On the other hand, Dr. Scholl’s turns out quality products and is dedicated to customer satisfaction. This is a bit expensive, but it does offer significant convenience over fully manual methods. If you like toys, you’ll lke this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerry</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve tried just about every foot device on the market. It&#x27;s not that my feet are that bad (they aren&#x27;t); it&#x27;s that I want to get the gross job done as fast and cleanly as possible. I know Dr. Scholl makes quality products, but I wasn&#x27;t at all sure that their electronic pedicure device was worth a bucket of warm spit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong! This is well made, and it&#x27;s surprisingly effective. It also works on dry feet (as in you don&#x27;t have to soak your feet first - a huge time saver.) I was truly in awe of how fast this works to debride my feet of dead skin, but it&#x27;s also safe. I didn&#x27;t get any bleeding or pain. In fact, you couldn&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;d used the device - except that my feet were smooth and free of gross skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> This electric foot file worked as advertised, making my feet look and feel smoother. One surprising feature that was not obvious from the product title is that this is completely cordless (battery operated).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very gentle and doesn’t hurt at all. It evenly removes calluses so the skin looks smooth as if it never had any hard/dead skin before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve previously used moisturizers that prevent hard skin but nothing works more quickly on hardened skin than a product like this that simply removes it instead if treating it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have with this is that it doesn’t have any mechanism to catch the flying dust it creates. The dust is what becomes of the dead skin it removes. You have to be prepared to use it in a place (perhaps in your backyard) where you won’t have to deal with this.</li>
            <li> This electronic pedicure foot file smoother from Dr. Scholl&#x27;s is quite effective on light to moderate dried, callused feet - anything more severe than that will require several sessions before the benefits are noticed/felt. The kit itself contains everything you need to get started right out of the box including 2x AA batteries and one micro-grain roller cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The roller action is robust and will generate a good deal of skin filings so I&#x27;d advise that you do this outdoors or someplace where you can contain the debris. Another nice feature of this roller is that no pre-soaking of your feet is required. On the down side there are some additional costs with this product as you will need to replace the rollers after a couple of months but overall an effective product to keep your feet nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Last year, I received the Amope Pedi Perfect and loved it! I was so excited to get to try this competitor&#x27;s product to see how it matches up to my beloved Amope. My review will be a comparison of the Amope Pedi Perfect and the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Express Pedi electronic foot file. I used both products side by side for almost a full month to compare and here is what I found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size: The Amope is a larger unit and takes 4 AA batteries to operate. The Dr. Scholl&#x27;s only takes 2 batteries so it can be much more compact. The weight of these is similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handle Shape: The Amope has a round shape to the handle that is much longer than the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s more flat and contoured shape. Both are comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On/Off and Speed Settings: The Amope has a twisting on/off swith and the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s a sliding on/off. Neither have different speeds, just on or off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prep for Use: Dry feet are necessary for effective use in both. No pre-soaking required for either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roller: The Amope has a slightly longer buffing roller that takes off the dead skin. They both have the same sand paper feel to them. The Dr. Scholl&#x27;s buffing roller is cylindrical and does not have the dome shape to it like the Amope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dead Skin Removal: Both are great at buffing off the dead skin on my heels. The powdery storm of dead skin seems finer on the Amope. They both will make quite a mess. I liked the way the Amope roller had more close access to my heels. The roller on the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s is reset and it is not as easy to get around, although that may keep you from putting too much pressure on your skin. With either, you should not stay in one place longer than a few seconds. They are very effective!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery Life: I went through the batteries much faster with the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s. It is only powered by 2 batteries so that my be the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roller replacement: Both have easy to remove rollers when the time comes to replace them. You can use these rollers for a long time before they are shot. The replacement costs seem similar, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was actually kind of shocked at how well the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Pedi Express worked. I am so in love with my Amope Pedi Perfect that I really thought that it would be a slam dunk decision. If price was not an issue, I would choose the Amope. I like its shape and feel in my hand. I also like that it is longer so that it is easier to reach my heels. If the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s was much more economical than the Amope then I would consider it strongly. It works well so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter what, I am never going back to a pumice stone or cheese grater for my heels ever again! Please let me know if you have any questions.use these rollers for a long time before they are shot.

            <li> This is a very efficient motorized foot file and buffer. The only problem with it seems to be that it produces a lot of dust and it does not have a way to contain that dust</li>
            <li> Great product! We have used the PedEgg it that worked well, but the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Pedicure Foot File automatic sanding will require less manual movement to use. Just add the battery and press up to turn on, how easy is that! Cleaning and replacing the add is also very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no catcher for the dead skin on this device, so have a towel down to catch the flakes!</li>
            <li> I have really rough patches on the bottom of my feet. Typically, I use one of those scrapers that have a razor blade in it. They terrify a lot of people but I found that it worked best for me. I have tried just about every device and all work ok, but none are a magic bullet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product after soaking them in the tub for a bit. it was overall easy to use and worked fine. There was a scary pile of skin dust in the bath when I was done (empty bath that I sat on the edge of to catch all the grossness). This worked well on the parts that were only slightly rough, like my pinkie toe and sides of my big toe. But for the more calloused parts, this simply didn&#x27;t do the job I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get pedicures on a monthly/ every other month basis, I think this would help maintain it between services. It is easy to use and fits in my hand nicely. There are safety measures in place to avoid hurting yourself, like how it slows with pressure.</li>
            <li> Oh my GOD! This is so amazing! I want to invite friends over to peel our feet! :) Seriously though, it is awesome, my feet are so smooth and feel great, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This REALLY REALLY does what it says it&#x27;s going to do and removes callouses quickly and easily. Beware, however, of being too enthusiastic in using it on the same patch of skin, because you can end up wearing away more than the callous.</li>
            <li> This device works a lot better and more safely than the blades that are used in a manicure shop.  It’s not just the blades that worry me; it is also the periodic news reports about the cleanliness and the dangers of the little corner manicure shops.  You can bring your own tools but then you have to worry about the foot basin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I worry but then go in anyway, because my feet get calloused and my toenail polish gets chipped.  I used to go in for a mani-pedi every 2 or 3 weeks, depending on how the polish on my fingernails lasted.  Then I went to gel nails and didn’t go in for 5 or 6 weeks.  Then I went to nail wraps, Jamberry, and I pretty much haven’t been in to my manicure place since then.  That has been nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not going in for pedicures has had a disastrous effect on my feet.  I have watched late night television and I know how to fix callouses on my feet in the same way I no-no how to get rid of body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little machine has done wonders for my feet.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I (she&#x27;s a young teen) don&#x27;t have huge thick callouses but we do have rough spots that don&#x27;t look great with sandals and sandal season is coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tried this Scholl&#x27;s Pedicure &#x27;File&#x27; and like it.  It&#x27;s gentle enough that I didn&#x27;t worry about her using it by herself.  If you press too hard, which I tried, it just shuts down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THAT was the GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s some annoying features as well.  The first was the packaging.  Why?  Why make it so hard to get a product out of the package.  I don&#x27;t want to hunt for a shipping knife or ruin my scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is easy to hold, by the way.  Ergonomically designed.  But it does make a whine and it does spit foot dust into the air so we ended up putting down a slightly damp towel to grab it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost?  A bit pricey.  For reasons of hygiene you should replace the roller every 60 to 90 days and the replacement rollers are about 15 bucks.  The good news is that you get 2 rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;In summary I would say that this is a painless, easy to use device that will take care of small problems.  I can&#x27;t see it working well on thick callouses; it just doesn&#x27;t have the strength nor the grittiness on the roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is annoying as is the fact that you have to use batteries. For a product this expensive I would expect it to be re-chargeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four Stars because we found it fun to use.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for everyone.</li>
            <li> This is an easy, at home way to get smoother feet.  Without pedicures my feet can become rough and unattractive and this is the perfect solution.  I&#x27;ve been using this after taking a bath and it works quite well.  The results are visible both in how smooth your feet look and feel but also in the amount of skin particles it sloughs off.  (It is worth noting that this device has no way to catch and contain them.  Some do cling to the roller and can be removed by tapping this lightly against a trash can but some also do go everywhere so I would use this in a place where some skin dust gets left behind doesn&#x27;t bother you.)  I love pairing it with a foot scrub and a rich body cream.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing machine, doing well job, easy to use, good quality, wonderful paking, fast shipping. I strongly recommend it.</li>
