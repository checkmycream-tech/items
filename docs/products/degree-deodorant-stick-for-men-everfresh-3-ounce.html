    <ol>
            <li>So with that in mind, I&#x27;d say this is a great product if you don&#x27;t mind that one issue!</li>
            <li>However, the scent it produces isn&#x27;t very pleasant.</li>
            <li>&quot; is a very good deodorant.</li>
            <li>it is a great smelling deodorant.</li>
            <li>If you like &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smelling deodorant, this is a good product.  </li>
            <li>It does do a good job of masking odors for a while, but I do prefer to use an antiperspirant/deodorant combo.</li>
            <li>I have been using Degree for quite some time and this one is just as good as the rest.</li>
            <li>If you DO like the scent, then you will find that it does a good job blocking offensive body odor, so it does work as described.</li>
            <li>product does a great job with masking the scent -- i.e. has a strong smell all by itself.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hubby liked the protection it gave him</li>
            <li>This deodorant has a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li>It also lasts nicely throughout the day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an effective antiperspirant and deodorant that smells nice.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not the fault of this product, or course, but our own oversight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought degree deo many times over the years.  </li>
            <li>Others make like the smell better</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why most of the deodorants out there smell so horrid.</li>
            <li>If it was milder I would like it better</li>
            <li>Effective deodorant goes one smoothly without chalky residue.</li>
            <li>maybe I&#x27;m wacky</li>
            <li>It has a great scent---very invigorating in the morning, and it did very well with wetness and odor control.  </li>
            <li>I perspire a bit more on those days but not noticeably so.</li>
            <li>It smells good - it is a bit masculine but in a good way that i like to wear it as a woman.  </li>
            <li>The more you sweat, the more this releases scent.</li>
            <li>I would like it better if it was  unscented so that my deodorant wasn&#x27;t so noticeable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Husband and I thought the scent was okay.</li>
            <li>Smooth application, very long-lasting and works great against odor.</li>
            <li>It does smell better when hubby put it on and wasn&#x27;t as strong.  </li>
            <li>suppose smell is subjective and if you&#x27;re looking for a deodorant that is effective, this might be worth a try.</li>
            <li>The container is well designed and the product comes out easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost too strong, though.  </li>
            <li>The one thing I did not like was the scent which is a strong, musky, woodsy odor.</li>
            <li>It is a strong, musk-meets-pine-trees sort of mash-up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still effective throughout an entire workday, even if he&#x27;s working outside in the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really a great deodorant, and one of the better scents out there!  </li>
            <li>As far as deodorant performance goes, it did a good job</li>
            <li>Degree offers another good deodorant that works to cover odors and keep you going throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>it will pop right off:)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fresh, and green.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay first off my guy is not someone who uses (or needs to use) deodorant daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fortunately, this is a scent we both love and is a deodorant that really works no matter what he is doing over the weekend.  </li>
            <li>He said the deodorant does a great job of keeping him dry and feeling fresh but the scent is too strong and every time he lifts his arms</li>
            <li>The scent is a pleasant clean/laundry detergent type scent, and while it isn&#x27;t objectionable in itself (you don&#x27;t smell like a teenager doused in Axe), it&#x27;s a lot stronger than necessary</li>
            <li>His job is very physical, and he needs a good deodorant.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t combine with my sweat to create a nauseatingly sweet odor or stench as others have done.  </li>
            <li>Cool Silver Antiperspirant ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Cool Silver Antiperspirant  2.7 Oz]]) and Men+Care Cool Silver Deodorant ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Cool Silver Deodorant,3.0 oz]])] also contain silver chloride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall another good product by Degree.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this deodorant more than I did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad product, and in fact I&#x27;m going to sub it to my tween, but this Degree deodorant is not something I&#x27;ll buy for the adults in my household.</li>
            <li>This is great to wear when gong out to dinner or something like that where you are not to active and might need an antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li>This product goes on clear and has a nice fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice fresh scent and pretty highly scented.</li>
            <li>Deodorant should mask smells but not by smelling powerful themselves.</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it goes on so clear and invisible.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is fresh, at first, but then because it lingers, I really feel it is too strong.</li>
            <li>Degree Deodorant Stick for Men, Everfresh, has a pleasant, masculine scent that is barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I cannot really imagine myself becoming accustom to such a potent \\&quot;fragrance.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is just right and not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Someone else might love this fragrance, but I was not a big fan.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is pleasant, but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>This smells nice and keeps my perspiration down to a minimum.  </li>
            <li>I donâ€™t notice it once I put it on and it lasts pretty much the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t overly trilled with this deodorant only because the fragrance is a bit strong and smells like evergreens.  </li>
            <li>This has a really strong smell that certainly does last.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice clean scent and keeps you dry all day long.  </li>
            <li>This Everfresh works great and has a very delicate scent.</li>
            <li>My husband is in the military and was raised as a ranch boy and in many ways does not care too much about body odor.  </li>
            <li>Depending on your activity level and how much you sweat, you may need to reapply this throughout the day to really control body odor.</li>
            <li>the scent is just too much for him.</li>
            <li>This deodorant works really well.</li>
            <li>It works really well though</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind masculine scents, so I would have used it myself if it smelled fresh.</li>
            <li>That being said, the addition of silver microbes really makes a difference where odor is concerned.  </li>
            <li>While this Degree works for most of the day, it&#x27;s almost worse smelling like this super strong scent than my natural body odor.</li>
            <li>Maybe that is what the time released molecules are - that&#x27;s why it smells so strong and for so long.</li>
            <li>just fine - it goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t stain clothes or give you white powder residue, and it kept me dry for the day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the classical &#x27;male musk&#x27; that so many products use</li>
            <li>If you do not mind the underarm wetness, this is a decent choice.</li>
            <li>and when it&#x27;s gone he doesn&#x27;t want me to buy this particular scent again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to any man (or woman) who needs all day protection from noxious, horrid smelling sweat and perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>And, I really like that it is clear ... and</li>
            <li>The price is a little higher than many other deodorants, but it since it works very well</li>
            <li>bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s long lasting, which is a huge plus</li>
            <li>I only have to apply a small amount in order for it to be effective.  </li>
            <li>This is a clear antiperspirant/deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Goes on clear, which is a plus.</li>
            <li>It smells masculine, and is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>However, the scent is completely unreal ...</li>
            <li>it nearly defies words.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t sweat, so I use a natural deodorant to control odor.</li>
            <li>Several of the other deodorants and antiperspirants that I enjoy [e.g., Dove Men+Care</li>
            <li>First off, this is a deodorant stick, not a deodorant/antiperspirant, so don&#x27;t expect dry underarms.  </li>
            <li>I prefer somthing that doesn&#x27;t have too strong a small.  </li>
            <li>Effective, yes, but almost irritating how you&#x27;re constantly smelling it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting more difficult to find decent non antiperspirants at pharmacies</li>
            <li>works even on days where I am more active than usual.</li>
            <li>It glides on nicely without caking and really does prevent wetness and bad odor.  </li>
            <li>My son is always rushing to get ready in the morning, and he throws on deodorant at the last minute, and he didn&#x27;t like the way it felt like it was wet</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and clear with no clumping or reside left behind on clothes.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would actually stay wet enough to affect clothes, but a lot of whether you like something you use briefly each day is perception!  </li>

            <li> My son tried this deodorant for a week, and I tried it for a few days (despite being female!)</li>
            <li> However, it feels wet going on.  </li>

            <li> Is there any other way to deodorize?</li>
            <li> I believe that its \\&quot;all day long\\&quot; protection is due to the \\&quot;silver iron technology\\&quot; of which Degree boasts to have.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly two weeks and it hasn&#x27;t broken out my skin, given me a rash, or produced any other type of allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> Frankly the only difference that I have noticed in this deodorant and some others I have used is that the cap is extremely hard to get off.</li>
            <li> At least this is only a deodorant, and not an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> therefore, I have to invest less time in spritzing my boyfriend&#x27;s black t-shirts with Spray-N-Wash.</li>
            <li> It stayed on all day and fought a hard battle during a long workout.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any difficulty removing the cap or turning the large dial at the base in order to raise the blue gel.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that he had a reaction, it seems like it dried his skin out a bit too much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Is there any other way to deodorize?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought degree deo many times over the years.  It has a nice clean scent and keeps you dry all day long.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> If you like &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smelling deodorant, this is a good product.  It glides on nicely without caking and really does prevent wetness and bad odor.  It also seems to last a long time.  The container is well designed and the product comes out easily.  It&#x27;s a container that fits well in a travel bag.</li>
            <li> I chose this for my husband - looking for something to keep him dry during biking but also that didn&#x27;t smell bad.  Unfortunately, I just didn&#x27;t take to this smell.  It&#x27;s the classical &#x27;male musk&#x27; that so many products use and I just didn&#x27;t like it.  So once this was done, I didn&#x27;t use it again.  Others make like the smell better so I would recommend at least trying it since it does work well.</li>
            <li> Frankly the only difference that I have noticed in this deodorant and some others I have used is that the cap is extremely hard to get off. I have to take my fingernail and pop it between the opening seam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fresh, at first, but then because it lingers, I really feel it is too strong. I would prefer my deodorant to stop smells not create them. Maybe that is what the time released molecules are - that&#x27;s why it smells so strong and for so long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why most of the deodorants out there smell so horrid. I don&#x27;t want to smell like a pine forest all day long! While this Degree works for most of the day, it&#x27;s almost worse smelling like this super strong scent than my natural body odor. At least this is only a deodorant, and not an antiperspirant. Antiperspirants tend to ruin my clothes by leaving behind an impossible-to-remove residue.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t overly trilled with this deodorant only because the fragrance is a bit strong and smells like evergreens.  If it was milder I would like it better but hey I&#x27;m not the one wearing it anyway.  It does smell better when hubby put it on and wasn&#x27;t as strong.  Hubby liked the protection it gave him and he said it lasted all day with no problems.</li>
            <li> This is just a deodorant stick - not an antiperspirant, so it will not protect against wetness. It just provides scent so that you don&#x27;t smell body odor. It does do a good job of masking odors for a while, but I do prefer to use an antiperspirant/deodorant combo. If you do not mind the underarm wetness, this is a decent choice. Depending on your activity level and how much you sweat, you may need to reapply this throughout the day to really control body odor. It is a nice fresh scent and pretty highly scented.</li>
            <li> Effective deodorant goes one smoothly without chalky residue. The scent is a pleasant clean/laundry detergent type scent, and while it isn&#x27;t objectionable in itself (you don&#x27;t smell like a teenager doused in Axe), it&#x27;s a lot stronger than necessary &amp; you&#x27;ll smell it for a long time after applying.</li>
            <li> This has a really strong smell that certainly does last.  It&#x27;s almost too strong, though.  Effective, yes, but almost irritating how you&#x27;re constantly smelling it.</li>
            <li> I got this item and had my husband try it out. His job is very physical, and he needs a good deodorant. I noticed that it definitely did the trick and kept him odor-free during his shifts. The one thing I did not like was the scent which is a strong, musky, woodsy odor. It was almost overpowering to me. Deodorant should mask smells but not by smelling powerful themselves.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has a nice smell to it. It&#x27;s a citrus scent with a hint of musk, so it doesn&#x27;t have that overly spicy man smell that a lot of products have. It goes on smooth and clear with no clumping or reside left behind on clothes. It also lasts nicely throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Okay first off my guy is not someone who uses (or needs to use) deodorant daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does a great job with masking the scent -- i.e. has a strong smell all by itself.&lt;br /&gt;While it did not irritate his skin the scent of the deodorant lingered all day long&lt;br /&gt;  -- the scent was not a &amp;#34;wall of scent&amp;#34; but still was quite noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;  --  maybe I&#x27;m wacky but I want my guy to smell like my guy.  not some product he uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there are days he needs something to take the edge of the sweat smell I&#x27;m still looking for a product that actually decreases the stink without just masking it.</li>
            <li> My husband is in the military and was raised as a ranch boy and in many ways does not care too much about body odor.  Unfortunately, I do. Fortunately, this is a scent we both love and is a deodorant that really works no matter what he is doing over the weekend.  Smooth application, very long-lasting and works great against odor.</li>
            <li> Degree Deodorant Stick for Men, Everfresh, has a pleasant, masculine scent that is barely noticeable.  It doesn&#x27;t combine with my sweat to create a nauseatingly sweet odor or stench as others have done.  Neither does it promise to give me 48 hours protection, like others have done, but it does seem to protect me for longer than 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I believe that its \\&quot;all day long\\&quot; protection is due to the \\&quot;silver iron technology\\&quot; of which Degree boasts to have.  Looking at the ingredients, I learned that it contains silver chloride.  Several of the other deodorants and antiperspirants that I enjoy [e.g., Dove Men+Care Cool Silver Antiperspirant ([[ASIN:B00AO379NE Dove Men+Care Cool Silver Antiperspirant  2.7 Oz]]) and Men+Care Cool Silver Deodorant ([[ASIN:B00AO379SO Dove Men+Care Cool Silver Deodorant,3.0 oz]])] also contain silver chloride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Regardless of what it contains, Degree Deodorant Stick for Men, Everfresh, provides me with all-day protection.  I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly two weeks and it hasn&#x27;t broken out my skin, given me a rash, or produced any other type of allergic reaction.  I only have to apply a small amount in order for it to be effective.  I didn&#x27;t have any difficulty removing the cap or turning the large dial at the base in order to raise the blue gel.  I highly recommend it to any man (or woman) who needs all day protection from noxious, horrid smelling sweat and perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph B. Hoyos</li>
            <li> Degree Deodorant Stick for Men, \\&quot;Everfresh\\&quot; is a very good deodorant. It smells masculine, and is not overpowering. It doesn&#x27;t make me stink like flowers. Unlike some deodorants, it also doesn&#x27;t cause me any irritation or stain my shirts. It gives me odor protection all day long, as advertised. The price is a little higher than many other deodorants, but it since it works very well, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Personal preference here: I was not particularly wild about this scent for some reason (probably my crazy pregnancy sense of smell), but this smelled kind of like B.O. to me. Someone else might love this fragrance, but I was not a big fan. As far as deodorant performance goes, it did a good job (this is deodorant only, not an antiperspirant).  Maybe my husband can try it again after the baby is born, but for now, I can&#x27;t seem to tolerate the smell.</li>
            <li> My son tried this deodorant for a week, and I tried it for a few days (despite being female!) and we both had the same opinion.  It has a great scent---very invigorating in the morning, and it did very well with wetness and odor control.  However, it feels wet going on.  My son is always rushing to get ready in the morning, and he throws on deodorant at the last minute, and he didn&#x27;t like the way it felt like it was wet---he worried it would get his shirts wet.  When I tried it, I could see what he meant.  I don&#x27;t think it would actually stay wet enough to affect clothes, but a lot of whether you like something you use briefly each day is perception!  So with that in mind, I&#x27;d say this is a great product if you don&#x27;t mind that one issue!</li>
            <li> This smells nice and keeps my perspiration down to a minimum.  I donâ€™t notice it once I put it on and it lasts pretty much the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works even on days where I am more active than usual. I perspire a bit more on those days but not noticeably so. Plus, it keeps me smelling nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an effective antiperspirant and deodorant that smells nice.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this deodorant for about a month and when it&#x27;s gone he doesn&#x27;t want me to buy this particular scent again. He said the deodorant does a great job of keeping him dry and feeling fresh but the scent is too strong and every time he lifts his arms the scent is just too much for him.</li>
            <li> This is a clear antiperspirant/deodorant.  I like it just fine - it goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t stain clothes or give you white powder residue, and it kept me dry for the day.  It smells good - it is a bit masculine but in a good way that i like to wear it as a woman.  It&#x27;s very fresh, and green.&lt;br /&gt;My husband did not like it though, he said it made him itch.  He would give it a one  he said - he wore it one time and complained he itched all day.  It wasn&#x27;t that he had a reaction, it seems like it dried his skin out a bit too much.&lt;br /&gt;I put it in my sock drawer.  I&#x27;ve been using it everyday and I like it.  I love the fact that it goes on so clear and invisible.</li>
            <li> Degree offers another good deodorant that works to cover odors and keep you going throughout the day.  This product goes on clear and has a nice fresh smell.  The smell is just right and not too overpowering.  With this being just a deodorant and not an antiperspirant you don&#x27;t have to worry about the white residue.  This is great to wear when gong out to dinner or something like that where you are not to active and might need an antiperspirant.  Overall another good product by Degree.</li>
            <li> I usually only wear deoderant when I have a big meeting or have to make a public speech.  I prefer somthing that doesn&#x27;t have too strong a small.  This Everfresh works great and has a very delicate scent.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this deodorant more than I did. It&#x27;s getting more difficult to find decent non antiperspirants at pharmacies and I don&#x27;t always like to use them. Unfortunately, this one is a bit of a mixed bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s long lasting, which is a huge plus that&#x27;s hard to ignore. This deodorant does in fact work. The problem? The smell is a little potent and that&#x27;s not necessarily a good thing. It does not smell great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose smell is subjective and if you&#x27;re looking for a deodorant that is effective, this might be worth a try. I wasn&#x27;t a big fan though.</li>
            <li> Foremost, this Degree product does fulfill its role as a deodorant. And, I really like that it is clear ... and therefore, I have to invest less time in spritzing my boyfriend&#x27;s black t-shirts with Spray-N-Wash. However, the scent is completely unreal ... it nearly defies words. It is a strong, musk-meets-pine-trees sort of mash-up. I cannot really imagine myself becoming accustom to such a potent \\&quot;fragrance.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, if you find yourself struggling with removing the plastic insert, simply twist the bottom with the insert still on it ... it will pop right off:) Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> What can i say? it is a great smelling deodorant. I have been using Degree for quite some time and this one is just as good as the rest. i would highly recommend it. Kudos, Degree.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works really well. It stayed on all day and fought a hard battle during a long workout. The more you sweat, the more this releases scent. It could fill a room at times. I would like it better if it was  unscented so that my deodorant wasn&#x27;t so noticeable. It works really well though so it is a winner in my book.</li>
            <li> I suppose there are people that don&#x27;t sweat and only need a deodorant.  If that is you, then you might try out this line of Deodorant Only rub for pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Husband and I thought the scent was okay. And it did seem to last.  What neither of us was crazy about is that this Degree product goes on wet and leaves you sort of damp in the armpit area even if you are just sitting around on the couch.  (At least you don&#x27;t smell)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad product, and in fact I&#x27;m going to sub it to my tween, but this Degree deodorant is not something I&#x27;ll buy for the adults in my household.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sweat, so I use a natural deodorant to control odor. My husband sweats a lot, and prefers manly products. We didn&#x27;t initially catch that this was just a deodorant, not an anti-perspirant. He was disappointed when he used it since he was wet and uncomfortable all day. That&#x27;s not the fault of this product, or course, but our own oversight. However, the scent it produces isn&#x27;t very pleasant. It didn&#x27;t smell &#x27;everfresh&#x27; to either one of us. I don&#x27;t mind masculine scents, so I would have used it myself if it smelled fresh. At the end of the day, neither one of us cared for the scent of this product and could not make use of it. If you DO like the scent, then you will find that it does a good job blocking offensive body odor, so it does work as described.</li>
            <li> First off, this is a deodorant stick, not a deodorant/antiperspirant, so don&#x27;t expect dry underarms.  That being said, the addition of silver microbes really makes a difference where odor is concerned.  Silver has antimicrobial and antibacterial properties, so it takes care of the germs that cause odor.  The fragrance is pleasant, but not overwhelming.  I think it&#x27;s almost a unisex fragrance, personally.  Goes on clear, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this brand.  It doesn&#x27;t leave an awful residue or anything, and it has a nice, clean fragrance that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  It&#x27;s still effective throughout an entire workday, even if he&#x27;s working outside in the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really a great deodorant, and one of the better scents out there!  I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
