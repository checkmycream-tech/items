            <li>Thanks again for the awesome product to try.</li>
            <li>There may be some irritation so use some kind of calming cream and use at night</li>
            <li>Like trying to do your own tattoo.  </li>
            <li>I also used the exfoliator and was thrilled with the softness and smoothness of my skin after use.</li>
            <li>My skin felt nice after using it.</li>
            <li>Epilator: nice alternative to shaving my bikini line, which gives me ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>box is very attractive and the directions are very clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great investment worth every penny!</li>
            <li>There is also a light on the epilator that is amazing!</li>
            <li>The convenience of being able to remove hair in or out of the shower is very appealing to me.  </li>

            <li>The tool is great, easy to hold, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I received this item as a bzzagent for review and wow am I so happy I did!</li>
            <li>I have read that it is more popular in Europe than America.</li>
            <li>I liked the side gift that it came with it helped with my acne alot &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I recommend its so amazing this product &amp;#60;3 in love.</li>
            <li>Loved the additional light too.  </li>
            <li>First off the look of the product is beautiful</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in how clean and bright my skin felt and appeared after one use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I got great results the first time, I decided to try using it in the shower, which I have never done before with any epilator.</li>
            <li>Exfoliating is very important when epilating from the research I have done.</li>
            <li>When I was finished both legs, they felt very smooth but were quite irritated.</li>
            <li>One of the cool things about this epilator was that it had a bright light on it that made it easier to see if anything got missed (wish my razor had one!).  </li>
            <li>I really liked how easy it was to use and to switch accessories.</li>
            <li>The light is one of my favorite features!</li>
            <li>I just want to have smooth legs and this product does that and more!  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have the Olay face exfoliator and I like this unit better as the brush head looks and feels like the bristles will have a longer life.  </li>
            <li>It does fit nicely into your hand and does stay put</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really enjoying being hairless</li>
            <li>It worked nicely to make my smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>I love how you get battery and</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I got to try it out</li>
            <li>Thanks Braun for sending me this great product to try.</li>
            <li>The epilation part of this hurts more than waxing.</li>
            <li>This would be perfect for ANY female, including the most non feminine woman you know.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS ITEM</li>
            <li>REALLY LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I have to say that I absolutely love both exfoliators.  </li>
            <li>So overall the epilation was painful-understandably because it is removing hair, and the exfoliating was awesome!</li>
            <li>It has two speeds, though I mostly use the faster speed.</li>
            <li>I think it would be wonderful if it came with multiple brushes.</li>
            <li>epilator exfoliating brush is ok.</li>
            <li>Oh, make sure you stretch the skin as you epilate, the hairs are easier to pull out.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels so smooth!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll come to love this product as well.</li>
            <li>I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN MUCH MORE USE out of the set that includes all the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was definitely much more comfortable than pulling wax strips and unlike wax, there are no areas that are missed!</li>
            <li>I love this product I received it from bzzagent...</li>
            <li>facial brush is awesome...</li>
            <li>I got used to the discomfort and was able to breeze through the rest of the process.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the way my face feels after using it</li>
            <li>Whatever it lacked in the removal process, it sure made up for in the pain department.  </li>
            <li>At this point, which was two days using the epilator, I was completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I do think it cleans my face better, and my skin seems brighter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, so I needed more information to figure out how to move forward with this issue.</li>
            <li>All in all, interesting product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More updates to come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The facial and exfoliating brushes are also awesome.</li>
            <li>I really love the exfoliator brushes for both the face and the body.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I think I will mostly be using the exfoliators.</li>
            <li>I tried out Braun&#x27;s Epil 7-929 Skinspa Beauty Epilator and I made sure to read all of the instructions before using which included how to use the product and what you’re supposed to do with the epilator along with the face exfoliate brush.</li>
            <li>(Maybe more so than waxing).</li>
            <li>it charges fast, you can use it in the shower too and works great.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with a buffer and a cleansing face brush.</li>
            <li>and I love the way my skin feels after using them.</li>
            <li>I WANTED to be able to use this product.</li>
            <li>and I love having and using it.</li>
            <li>and I love having and using it.</li>
            <li>love the brushes though.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has a separate a scrubber</li>
            <li>i love it till it hurts :)</li>
            <li>Better than I thought.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The bikini area was actually not horrible to use it on.</li>
            <li>However, as I kept working myself up to dealing with the pain, I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I got to try out this product through Buzzagent &amp; OMG if you don&#x27;t absolutely love your skin</li>
            <li>Just make sure to moisturize after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the Braun Silk</li>
            <li>The facial and exfoliating brushes are also awesome.</li>
            <li>Love the glittery handle</li>
            <li>using it in the shower was a much better experience.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the braun silk-èpil 7 skinspa 😍</li>
            <li>You want to make sure you read the instructions</li>
            <li>and I love the way it makes my skin feel.    </li>
            <li>I was very excited when I received the Braun Epil 7 929 SkinSpa Beauty Epilator.</li>
            <li>I recieved this product through BzzAgent and was very excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive the Silk-epil 7 epilator kit from Braun in the mail.  </li>
            <li>I had pretty good results until about 9 months into owning it.</li>
            <li>I think i have a pretty good pain tolerance</li>
            <li>It also charges quickly which is nice.</li>
            <li>Overall great product, loving the results.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean and must be cleaned after each use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying going hair free for a week now.  </li>
            <li>I love that there is a light to help see every hair.</li>
            <li>I love the smooth feeling it leaves for days.</li>
            <li>I was really glad that i got it free (complements to BzzAgent) instead of putting out $80 or so to buy something i wouldn&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li>This kit also comes with attachments to exfoliate your skin to help keep your skin healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li>One thing I love about the epilator itself is that it is easy to hold in the hand, and sits comfortably.</li>
            <li>With so many epilators out there I was excited to try the Braun silk epil 7.</li>
            <li>The light feature is really nice and makes it really easy to see exactly what I&#x27;m doing and where I need to go!  </li>
            <li>Both are easy to handle.</li>
            <li>The bristle end pops off easily for cleaning, but stays on well while you are using it.</li>
            <li>I know most people can tolerate pain to an extent and say pain is beauty so for most people I think the pain would&#x27;ve worth</li>
            <li>in all, the epilator worked great and it was refreshing to see a company put in the effort to make such a quality item.  </li>
            <li>in all, the epilator worked great and it was refreshing to see a company put in the effort to make such a quality item.  </li>
            <li>I wish the wand it comes with would have more than two settings, but overall it did a great job.</li>
            <li>It is easy to pack this set up and carry it anywhere without taking up lots of space.</li>
            <li>The brushes on the other hand are wonderful and i enjoyed them very much!</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s a beautiful glittery white.</li>
            <li>it hurts but it works fine.</li>
            <li>The light feature makes it really easy to see the hair.</li>
            <li>My face is super smooth and brighter!</li>
            <li>this is so easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>however Ive found it to be most effective right after I get out from a hot shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m blown away by how smooth all my skin is</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m hair free for the 5th day now.  </li>
            <li>I received this from BzzAgent as a free product.</li>
            <li>I got the Braun Epilator free from Braun.  </li>
            <li>I also received a free product from Braun for submitting my review.</li>
            <li>I recieved Braun Epilator free from Braun to review....</li>
            <li>I hope that my efforts allow me to work through the issues that I’ve had, and that I find the success that most others do with this epilator.  </li>
            <li>I received this kit from Braun for a free trial.</li>
            <li>The light that is available</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#62;Built in light to see what you’re doing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The results were not as great, so I finished outside of the shower.</li>
            <li>(I only use it 1-2 times a week) and I am really happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I was given the opportunity to try the Braun silk epil 7 929 skin spa for free from Braun.</li>
            <li>What I did not expect when i received the product to try free from bzzagent was the eye-tearing pain that ensued when i used this product.</li>
            <li>I got it for free from Braun for review</li>
            <li>The facial and the body brush are great.</li>
            <li>I got it for free from Braun for review</li>
            <li>Now, just smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>I received this product for free from BZZAGENT.</li>
            <li>This product was given to me for free from the brand.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a separate face exfoliator which leaves your face entirely smooth.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even feel like it got as smooth as shaving.  </li>
            <li>I received this for free in a trial from Braun.</li>
            <li>It glides smoothly on skin and does the job well.</li>
            <li>my legs where smooth</li>
            <li>I received this free from Braun to try out.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is a great product and you will never go back to razors again.</li>
            <li>I could tolerate the pain if it would have given me a smooth result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has two speeds which is good, and it makes my face SO soft and it feels refreshed afterwards.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll end up using it more once I get used to it, but for now once in a while is good enough for</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, so good.</li>
            <li>First time using this!!</li>
            <li>the Face Exfolliator is by far one of the best I ever used, but the question is how much are you willing to stand for beauty?</li>
            <li>My legs were hair-free, they were smooth, and I was so excited at the thought that I wouldn’t have to shave again for a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first it hurt like hell, but it got easier the more</li>
            <li>The epillator was not getting as many hairs as it once was on the first swipe</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I received the Braun Silk-epil 7 SkinSpa from BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>I have had excellent experiences in the past with Braun.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this from BzzAgent to review.</li>
            <li>At first i was like oh ouch, but it did get better.</li>
            <li>I do think it’s worth it!</li>
            <li>I was SO excited to use this product</li>
            <li>I have never herd of an epilator before and was hesitant yet excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth it for that radiant skin you&#x27;ve always wanted!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s defiantly worth the money !</li>
            <li>I am excited to ditch razors once and for all.</li>
            <li>My face comes out squeaky clean everytime.</li>
            <li>I guess you bee to weigh out the pain versus shaving daily to decide if the product is a good fit for you.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face clean and</li>
            <li>Also, when using, make sure to be in an area that can be easily cleaned because will definitely drop most of the hair that is being plucked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I felt like my face was super clean after using it, and after applying my face lotion super smooth.</li>
            <li>It comes with a special one for your face that runs off of batteries and another that attaches to the epilator for the rest of your body.</li>
            <li>If you are more used to the pain or more willing to get used to it, this seems like a highly functional tool.    </li>
            <li>Great as I expected.</li>
            <li>I did get a full body exfoliation, and</li>
            <li>it is just so cool</li>
            <li>I also love how fast it is and</li>
            <li>Cool huh?</li>
            <li>The next day I used the exfoliating brush head and loved that as well.</li>
            <li>This model has a light to see the hair as you go, which I found so useful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another item on my good list is the Facial cleansing brush.</li>
            <li>and I was able to get 90% of the hair off before the pain was too much.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Braun &amp; BzzAgent, I was able to try this product.</li>
            <li>Overall I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>It did a good job of cleaning up the area and grabbing even short hairs.</li>
            <li>Although I loved the idea of no more shaving, it just wasn’t effective at removing my leg hair.</li>
            <li>The concept is pretty awesome if it works for your hair type, I liked that it could be used on wet or dry skin and that it also came with a face cleaner as bonus.</li>
            <li>Love the epilator doesnt miss any spots love the feeling of being hairless total bonus!!!</li>
            <li>The epilator is also cordless, which is super convenient.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much need for the facial cleanser, but it&#x27;s great for after a workout when you KNOW that there&#x27;s sweat on your hairline</li>
            <li>and Bam there it was, a new addict!!!!</li>
            <li>The smart light is very helpful for better visibility.</li>
            <li>The smart light is very helpful for better visibility.</li>
            <li>I started to use it on my skin, first the inside of my arm to see how it would feel; it ended up feeling like a HUGE burning sensation.</li>
            <li>I was actually really excited to see how much faster I could epilate my legs since this epilator has a light on it.</li>
            <li>I first heard about this product on bzzagent where i recieved the product free to try.</li>
            <li>so this was also new for me to use, but I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the new Braun silk-epil 7-929 emulator</li>
            <li>Before you try it out be sure to charge your new elipilater for one hour.</li>
            <li>The facial brush was my favorite!</li>
            <li>With an epilator, you can use it when the hairs are very short, which means you won&#x27;t have to go too many days having stubbly legs!</li>
            <li>I received this from Braun and my first time using, it hurt!</li>
            <li>As far as epilators go, I am very happy with this purchase as well as with my previous plug-in Braun.</li>
            <li>I must say I greatly prefer it dry, it doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt nearly as much</li>
            <li>The facial brush/exfoliator is also pretty cool; I had never used anything like that on my face before, but I really love it!</li>
            <li>It also has a light which is very helpful in guiding you to any hairs you may miss.  </li>
            <li>The exfoliating attachment and the facial brush are AMAZING</li>
            <li>About a couple of weeks ago, I received a free package of this product, thanks to Braun and Bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The epilator comes with a body exfoliator attachment which is great for removing all of the dead skin off your body.</li>
            <li>So, thanks to BzzAgent, I got one for free to try out.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the initial results but for $104 + tax</li>
            <li>It works by spinning and when it does these metal things move in and out and a tweazing action occurs which removes the hair, there are many of them all around it.</li>
            <li>That alone is worth using this or purchasing it.</li>
            <li>The face exfolliator alone to me is worth the price of the package.</li>
            <li>And, it came with an extra attachment that feels nice against the skin I just ripped hair from, and</li>
            <li>Before using it I shaved the week before to ensure all the hairs were the same length, honestly I didn&#x27;t have to because it even pulled the baby hairs out.</li>
            <li>I definitely would not be able to see the hairs that I had missed without the light.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it because you won&#x27;t be spending money on razors anymore.</li>
            <li>It is worth letting a bit of razor stubble develop in order to use this epilator.  </li>
            <li>The epilator is nice overall.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even finish one leg, let a lone trying more sensitive places.  </li>
            <li>The pros are definitely the smooth skin and the healthy glow.</li>
            <li>My face regimen had always using a washcloth with moisturizing soap, which seemed to clean my face just fine (I always get compliments on how young I look).</li>
            <li>I noticed that the epilator did not get all of the hair, it was really good at getting the dark thick hair but was not that great at getting the light fuzzy sort of hair.</li>
            <li>Luckily, it has very clear, precise instructions on how to use every part of the kit.</li>
            <li>It left my face and body feeling so smooth and clean!  </li>
            <li>As soon as I receive the package I tore right into it.  </li>
            <li>I charged it right away to try it out.  </li>
            <li>I received my Braun silk epilepsy 7 and tried it right away, took a bit to get use to</li>
            <li>Right out of the box though</li>
            <li>Maybe im just not doing it right</li>
            <li>So when our Epilator came in the mail, we tried it right away.</li>
            <li>The body exfoliation brush is just what you need right after using the epilator and works wonders to moisturize the skin.</li>
            <li>obviously had some kind of a reaction/infection because of bacteria either on my skin, or that got into the follicle when I first epilated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to switch to the different attachments and you get everything you need for a beauty routine in one kit.</li>
            <li>It comes with very clear and easy to follow instructions.</li>
            <li>It comes with very clear and easy to follow instructions.</li>
            <li>The epilator even has a light on it which makes it a little more helpful!</li>
            <li>When I first got it it looked so exciting.</li>
            <li>AND, the epilator has 2 speeds; I tend to use the higher speed as it seems to work the best for my hair type (dark, coarse hair).</li>
            <li>I was aware that there would be some pain involved, but thought it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li>I have usually had good experiences with Braun products, so I was excited to try this and see what it was all about.</li>
            <li>and I think the hair must have been to long, it honestly felt like I was getting a tattoo that never ended.  </li>
            <li>While I enjoy that this bundle comes with many extras, I am pretty simple when it comes to my wants and needs.  </li>
            <li>When my package came I started reading the instructions right away since I am a first time epilator user.</li>
            <li>The next morning my lip was smooth, hairless and free from redness or bumps.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much Braun for giving me the Braun-epil to try for Free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does take several rounds to get enough hair removed to make me even kinda happy.  </li>
            <li>You can feel a light massage and the results are a total smooth and relaxed skin.  </li>
            <li>You can feel a light massage and the results are a total smooth and relaxed skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I personally will stick to shaving but the product does do a great job aside from the red marks.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty amazing machine and I am so excited to keep using it to see just how little I need to worry about my leg hair.  </li>
            <li>I also tried the epilator on my face, as I have more hair on my lip and chin than I’m comfortable with, due to medications</li>
            <li>After using it, my face feels so clean, fresh and soft to touch.</li>
            <li>they left my skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>So I didnt try this particular model, I tried the 820 edition thanks to a free trial by BzzAgent.com</li>
            <li>Overall so far this product has preformed exceptional and I would recommend this to all skin types and hair coarseness.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize at first that it&#x27;s best for shorter hair but even though mine was a little longer than what&#x27;s ideal ,it wasn&#x27;t painful.</li>
            <li>This was the first epilator I bought</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re using this for your legs, be aware, it will hurt at first.  </li>
            <li>When I used this on my legs for the first time, I thought I was going to cry.</li>
            <li>When you first got your eyebrows done, did it not hurt?</li>
            <li>Just make sure the follow the instructions on how to keep your battery life to its max potential.</li>
            <li>it should have lasted more than ten months!</li>
            <li>Works well just make sure you exfoliate often because ingrown hairs become a big problem.</li>
            <li>I did see them decrease after first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is suppose to do</li>
            <li>I will say if this is your first time using an epilator though do it in spurts.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time lastnight at first</li>
            <li>However, the lack of hot wax interested me.  </li>
            <li>I got this product, and I won&#x27;t lie, at first, it hurt like the dickens.  </li>
            <li>Love the facial brushes.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I used a epilator.</li>
            <li>First of all, I have never heard of an epilator.</li>
            <li>I shaved first, making sure I shaved with the hair and then against it to cut back on irritation and to get a closer shave.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;sleep&lt;br /&gt;wake up to soft smooth</li>
            <li>The design of the base fits perfect in your hand, it is easy to take apart and clean, and does not slip while using it in the shower.</li>
            <li>The charge holds for more than enough time to do both my legs.  </li>
            <li>I still love the convenience and the lasting result and will continue to epilate my legs.</li>
            <li>I used it first on my legs</li>
            <li>and yes… the epilator definitely hurt (more like stung…</li>
            <li>On my legs, it looked like an infected hair with a pustule, but on a much bigger scale (much more</li>
            <li>I did try the above recommendation of using a pumice stone, but found that it actually caused more hair breakage, which led to even more ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Using a medium bristle foot brush works better to exfoliate the skin on my legs, and I use it with Dial soap daily.</li>
            <li>I still have issues with inflamed follicles as the hair grows back and becomes ingrown, which Ihave more of now than I did before with shaving.</li>
            <li>I tried to use it on my armpits the first day</li>
            <li>it hurt too much!</li>
            <li>However, the second day way more bearable</li>
            <li>Make sure that you keep the hairs SHORT.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I should be using the Exfoliation Brush first on my face</li>
            <li>Perhaps I should be using the Exfoliation Brush first on my face</li>
            <li>I would most closely compare it to getting a tattoo over a bigger area of skin.</li>
            <li>but after several uses it felt better.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use the brushes that it comes with, but most likely i will not use the epilator.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the extra pieces like the exfoliating face brush and the one for the body.</li>
            <li>once I read through the manual, I felt confident enough to give it a go.</li>
            <li>hurt at first, does what it says</li>
            <li>and I love the facial</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li>The brush was soft enough to not irritate my skin, but I seen a huge difference in how much more of my makeup got removed.  </li>
            <li>, I turned it up to the higher speed.  </li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using a device like this before.</li>
            <li>I thouroughly enjoyed the facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>the first time you use the razor its hurt</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it was in the shower</li>
            <li>I got many compliments on my skin after using the facial cleansing brush...</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product to all of you out there who want to give themselves a skin spa treat!</li>
            <li>The first time I used the epilator I gotta admit, it was not a walk in the park.</li>
            <li>After the first pass on my leg, I felt my leg</li>
            <li>love the facial cleansing brush and the body exfoliation brush.  </li>
            <li>So upon receiving the epilator I first tried it out on my arm.</li>
            <li>I did love how soft and clean my face felt after using the facial cleaning brush.</li>
            <li>The only reason I am not giving this review a five star rating is that while the epilator leaves me legs mainly hair free, they are not as smooth as compared to shaving.  </li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s a good thing, but I&#x27;m not sure if using an epilator is better than simply shaving.</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s a good thing, but I&#x27;m not sure if using an epilator is better than simply shaving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before we get to the actual Epilator, I want to start off by saying I loved the extra attachments.</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to use it very often and the results last for weeks for me.  </li>
            <li>It was sleek, stylish, looked very well made, and included a body brush attachment and facial brush that I hadn’t expected.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Now, even though I said that, I couldn’t bring myself to do anything more than my lower legs and that was always on the lowest speed since the second speed hurt too much for my liking.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I really wanted to take my time in reviewing this because I wanted to give a proper review.</li>
            <li>The lower legs were by far the most sensitive.</li>
            <li>Very easy to operate and left my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>and so does my boyfriend for the super soft legs!</li>
            <li>I was really nervous to purchase Braun Silk-épil 7 SkinSpa 7-929 Epilator at first, but it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everyone complains about how much it hurts the first time you use it, but I discovered a trick to lessing the pain.</li>
            <li>As a girl and as a girl who goes through pain in order to look pretty i was ready for the pain</li>
            <li>I preferred the dry as it does grip better and remove quicker.  </li>
            <li>It worked better when I was in the shower than it did when it was dry.</li>
            <li>but I certainly intend on doing so in the coming week</li>
            <li>The epilator is not too loud, and I would very much like for it to work - I&#x27;ll keep trying!</li>
            <li>I love using new and different skin products.  </li>
            <li>was really excited about the facial brush since I had been looking into getting one, so that was the first thing I tried.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love with being able to use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li>The facial brushes work just fine.  </li>
            <li>It works very well, even on short fine hair.</li>
            <li>a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;The facial and the body brush are great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still catching all the little light blonde ones that are trying to hide, but I&#x27;ll get &#x27;em.  </li>
            <li>It is great at getting rid of gross dead skin.    </li>
            <li>They haven&#x27;t, it still hurts, you won&#x27;t do as well as with shaving your legs, because the pain of using this product is too much.</li>
            <li>It cuts my time by sooooo much, I should&#x27;ve bought it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been curious about the use of a epilator for many years</li>
            <li>how well it exfoliates the skin as I had to add a exfoliating wash to really feel like I was doing anything</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend you not use it thou as you must absolutely exfoliate</li>
            <li>you really should epilate there as well.  </li>
            <li>Then I used it wet much more tolerable.</li>
            <li>and it works really</li>
            <li>well really gets the hair off</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I had never used one before, but it&#x27;s like a tiny massage for your face that leaves the skin baby smooth.  </li>
            <li>I really like how it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li>My skin thanks you</li>
            <li>Ready?</li>
            <li>My hair grows so fast, and the stubble is like trying to sleep with a porcupine.</li>
            <li>(not that it helps much).</li>
            <li>(not that it helps much).</li>
            <li>but it hurt a lot more than i expected.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Braun I got to try the silk-epil.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Braun and and being a member of BzzAgent, I received this product in the mail try out.</li>
            <li>and I think that it could become very addicting.</li>
            <li>I must admit, I was VERY nervous about trying this product out, however,</li>
            <li>but I really like this product and did recommend it to friends,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really tried.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Braun Silk epil 7-929 spa!</li>
            <li>highly recommend the Braun Silk epil 7-929 spa!</li>
            <li>but the skin brushes dont do much for me.  </li>
            <li>Just wish I hadn&#x27;t paid so much for them as I will never use the epistle part again...</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t really thought about it, but it allows you to save tons of money on razors.  </li>
            <li>You know what they say no pain no game.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to any one out there who hates shaving!</li>
            <li>and it didnt really take the hair out.</li>
            <li>The epilator works really well.</li>
            <li>My legs were left smooth and</li>
            <li>Thanks BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>The rest of the package is kind of a waste though.  </li>
            <li>I decided to do my own personal comparison with standard shaving.</li>
            <li>The battery life is good - lasting at least 2 full uses for legs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Moving forward since, I’ve tried other methods with the epilator in order to better my outcome.</li>
            <li>It hurts like no tomorrow the first little bit that gets done, but it’s more manageable after that since you know what’s coming.  </li>
            <li>I would like to begin by saying that I was lucky enough to receive this product for free as a Bzz Agent campaign; to try it out and give some critical feedback.  </li>
            <li>The results were less than spectacular, so I assumed that I hadn’t used it right and tried again the next day.  </li>
            <li>I already use a body exfoliation puff in the shower, which works just as well and is much faster (covers more area in less time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>An older razor had recently given up the ghost, and I needed something new to keep my legs silky smooth.</li>
            <li>push past pain as you will have AMAZING SKIN lol&lt;</li>
            <li>The unit is rechargeable which actually came to full charge within an hour.  </li>
            <li>My legs haven’t been smooth since the first few days after epilating for the first time, and they have scars, but they are healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The area around with less muscle hurts more, but just like tweezing your eyebrows, you get used to it</li>
            <li>I love the facial brush, I use it quite every night for a deep wash and remove my make up.</li>
            <li>I tried it with the hair growth being at several different lengths and nothing seemed to work for the better on my lower legs with the thicker</li>
            <li>The first time my skin was pretty red, but I put aloe vera for sunburn, and by morning any bumps or redness was gone.</li>
            <li>The only I didn&#x27;t like at first was how it hurt at first</li>
            <li>That being said, I just applied some aloe vera and my legs were smooth and completely clear the next morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 100% confident that I will not go back to shaving with a regular razor ever again.</li>
            <li>Overall, the Braun Epil 7 929 SkinSpa Beauty Epilator is very pretty.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this epilator.  </li>
            <li>I also have a high tolerance for pain</li>
            <li>Read the direction before you start, they are very detailed and they will save you some trouble.</li>
            <li>Wow to be able to not shave for a few days is a nice feeling instead of feeling like you have to shave everyday.</li>
            <li>and now i feel like i can’t because of how high the pain is.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, just buy the brush if you don&#x27;t have a high pain</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I will use the facial brush and body exfoliater both worked well and left my skin very clean and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It left myskin feeling so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good size for both not too big not too small.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It wasn’t all a complete bust, I did have more luck with areas that had finer hair such as my upper legs.  </li>
            <li>I still love the dream of not having to shave every few days, so haven’t wanted to give up on this without giving it time.</li>
            <li>It did leave my skin a bit irritated for quite a few hours after going over my legs, but the hair it removed was astonishing.</li>
            <li>I love how you can can rid of dead skin before you shave.  </li>
            <li>:/ on the other hand i really love the face brush, and body exfoliating brush it left my skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>When my Braun Skin Spa arrived in the mail I was so excited to try the new product due to the fact that it was a gift straight from Bzz Agent however once I unpackaged it</li>
            <li>The epilator has a light and it is small, therefore making it easy to travel with if necessary.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to not feel as much pulling as I do with my other epilator, and how well the light works.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed this problem go away, which is why it only gets 4 stars right now.  </li>
            <li>I was given the Braun Epil 7 929 hair remover to try from Braun; my overall opinion is that it may not be the right hair removal tool for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, so I assumed that I hadn’t used it right and tried again the next day.  </li>
            <li>I shaved my right leg and used the Braun Epil 7 929 on the left leg.</li>
            <li>This was a new experience for me because I never even heard of a epilator.</li>
            <li>I saw &amp;#34;the free gift (facial brush) and thought it was a bonus in addition to all the different tips.</li>
            <li>The pain does get better as you get used to it, and now feeling a little discomfort lets me know that it’s working!</li>
            <li>I will start by saying that I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>(my skin is very sensitive and acne prone).</li>
            <li>The right leg that I had used the razor on was needing to be shaved again after just a few days, but the left was still holding strong.  </li>
            <li>So far I have had to shave the right leg an additional 2 times while having no need to do anything to the left leg.</li>
            <li>The instructions say that after using it multiple times the pain will greatly reduce but i can’t even hardly use it once in order to hopefully make the pain reduce next time.</li>
            <li>This is a normal reaction and should quickly disappear, but may be stronger when you are removing hair at the root for the first few times or if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>As for the body exfoliating brush, I barely use because I have an exfoliating towel which I find it much faster to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do not use any toner prior as it closes pores making it more difficult and more</li>
            <li>and I really struggled keeping in my hand and not slipping out once soap got onto my hand.  </li>
            <li>And even after the first time using it I could tell that it was doing a deep cleaning on my face.</li>
            <li>For anyone who has sensitive skin, consider throwing away the razors and chemicals!</li>
            <li>It definitely hurts like heck at first, but about 2 minutes into it</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that this is normal, and the instructions clearly state that continued use diminishes the pain.</li>
            <li>My advice to anyone trying it for the first time, shave your legs first like it tell you in the manual and then when your hair is starting to grow back in use the epil.</li>
            <li>but ladies we all know the old saying &amp;#34; Beauty is Pain!</li>
            <li>It hurts like tiny hot needles poking at my legs.</li>
            <li>Many try different methods of hair removal, only to find that they need to repeat the process several times in a week.  </li>
            <li>Pretty simple.</li>
            <li>your skin is so  sensitive!</li>
            <li>The only cons I can think of is the first rounds of pain</li>
            <li>It did cause some discomfort, but it was not painful and if you just keep going instead of stopping the discomfort is not very noticeable.</li>
            <li>They had red bumps all over, which is normal; however, the redness was slightly more intense than usual.</li>
            <li>After reading through the directions and tips and checking out the items functions (it has a low and high setting, or as the pamphlet says “gentle or efficient speed”), I charged the epilator and gave it a try.</li>
            <li>I don’t use the epilator very much because of the pain, but I do use it when I know I’m going to be too busy to shave later on.  </li>
            <li>more razors!&lt;br /&gt;can be used wet or dry</li>
            <li>I love that it can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that you can use them wet or dry and it comes with a wall</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s cordless and that you can use it dry or wet.</li>
            <li>I really love the facial brush add-on, but the body exfoliator is a little underwhelming.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does take a little more time than you would just shaving your legs, but I feel like if you epilate, the slower your hair grows back.</li>
            <li>It took me a couple of weeks before I got use to it, but once I did I was glad I continued through the pain because I don&#x27;t have to shave hardly at all now.</li>
            <li>I wish the epilator was better at getting around hard areas like the knees.</li>
            <li>And last but not least, the facial cleasing brush works so well to deep clean the face.</li>
            <li>And if you get this and you&#x27;re not a fan of the pain, trying checking out some of their other attachments, I think I seen a shaver one.lts were less than spectacular</li>
            <li>The body exfoliator brush comes with a clear plastic cover for storage.  </li>
            <li>I was genuinely surprised at how much it didn&#x27;t hurt the next day.  </li>
            <li>I dabbed rubbing alcohol on the spots to clear them up.</li>
            <li>The body brush attachment and the face exfoliator are vital for optimal results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will never shave again, I&#x27;m a lifer as far as epliating the hair on by body.  </li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>All in all, I completely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The facial brush was gentle and made my skin feel renewed without having to use any chemicals or creams.</li>
            <li>This model works a lot nicer than my old one.  </li>
            <li>but this one is extremely soft and I can control the speed</li>
            <li>and I had to wait for the hairs to grow pretty long in order to wax them.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the opportunity to try this product and will continue to use the exfoliter attachment and the facial brush.</li>
            <li>I wasn’t expecting too much, just smoother skin like I would get after using the facial brush.  </li>
            <li>since that didn’t really feel like it was working well enough</li>
            <li>My 11 year old daughter and</li>
            <li>make sure to at least exfoliate the skin and moisten it a bit before using.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It wasn’t worth the pain of going over the same area several times to still not have all of the hair gone.  </li>
            <li>I am not someone who gets waxed, so for me, I would more than likely just shave than use the epilator unless I was preparing for a beach vacation where I didn&#x27;t want to shave everyday.</li>
            <li>I read the directions cover to cover and the word pain was mentioned a few more times than I thought was necessary.</li>
            <li>I had a bit of trouble getting the batteries into the separate exfoliater (the battery case is challenging to open and then close again), but the products seems well constructed.  </li>
            <li>The pain is actually worth it because the epilator is removing the hairs from the root causing it not to grow back until 3 or 4 weeks later.</li>
            <li>I used the Silk-epil on my left leg and just a regular razor on my right leg.</li>
            <li>As the week went on I noticed a big difference in the hair growth on the right and left.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have not been able to use facial brushes in the past</li>
            <li>My first use, I used it dry.</li>
            <li>After a few uses the ingrown hair on my legs has diminished significantly.  </li>
            <li>The body exfoliator is good as well, a little harsh, but thats what an exfoliator is!</li>
            <li>It has a soft, rotating brush for the face and has a low and high setting.</li>
            <li>I also love that the second and third times it hurts even less .</li>
            <li>I charged it back up, which only took about an hour, and finished the spots that I had missed the first time.</li>
            <li>Not sure the whole package was worth it.  </li>
            <li>Operates on two provided AA batteries, has a low and high operating speed.  </li>
            <li>Some reviews suggested using the epilator in the shower or on the low setting to decrease the pain, but I just went with it on high.</li>
            <li>As far as the legs go the slight momentary discomfort is well worth</li>
            <li>two hour long epilator uses before even needing to charge and I believe it would have gone much longer</li>
            <li>In general, the skin reaction and the sensation of pain tend to diminish considerably with the repeated use of Silk•épil.</li>
            <li>The result is, minus a few stragglers, perfectly smooth legs for about two weeks (depending on how fast your hair grows of course).</li>
            <li>A stray upper lip hair will swell a tiny bit but barely worth noting because it is only temporary.  </li>
            <li>This retails for $149.99 on average and well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive, and I can only use shaving creams meant for sensitive skin, and not even all of those.  </li>
            <li>We have only been using it for a week, and I have noticed a big difference in my husbands skin (he is acne prone and has very oily skin).</li>
            <li>I enjoyed cleaning my face with a gentle face cleaner and a exfoliating wash wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li>It is painful at first but well worth it since your legs are silky smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>for the instructions , they are pretty simple to follow and overall I like this product and will definitely recommend it to others to try out.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not to say it didn&#x27;t hurt at all, just that the pain was far less than the first night.  </li>
            <li>It hurts like dry shaving, even when I&#x27;ve had a hot bath to open my pores AND am using a shave lotion.</li>
            <li>Also included is a small plastic bristled brush to clean exfoliator head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#62;Comes with small brush to clean epilator</li>
            <li>I did have some serious reddening, as they warn, but it was mostly gone the next day.  </li>
            <li>Overall I like that this is 3 tools in one purchase, but the current price seems too high.</li>
            <li>So far, (I&#x27;ve only been using it a week or so)</li>
            <li>barely stings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The last time I tried an epilator was years ago, during the early Epilady days.  </li>
            <li>I tried three different times, after three different types of preparation (hot shower, long bath, longer bath), and this still HURTS.  </li>
            <li>But I finally gave in and did it..and was surprised.</li>
            <li>And I used the small one on my face same thing, super soft skin.</li>
            <li>exfoliation brushes were great , and the epilator was quite painful the first times, but if it means no shaving every other day (especially in the summer months) then who would say no to that ?</li>
            <li>I do feel some discomfort initially, but once I get going with it, it becomes less and less and is more than tolerable.  </li>
            <li>When I use the large one on my body it makes my skin so soft, like unbelievable soft.</li>
            <li>I am disappointed because I would love to not have to shave daily and have smooth feeling skin.  </li>
            <li>Since using the facial brush to exfoliate, it has cut down a lot on the bumps that I broke out with the first time.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if I&#x27;m willing to share!</li>
            <li>Since I am pretty tolerant to pain, I didn&#x27;t mind going through a little pain if it gets me to not use shaver every 2 days.</li>
            <li>This one was a big letdown, especially after the other two worked so well, but I am excited to see what other attachments there are.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one was a big letdown, especially after the other two worked so well, but I am excited to see what other attachments there are.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought they&#x27;d have improved this type of product since it first came out a while ago (a few years).  </li>
            <li>But like the instructions said use the exfoliator a few times first.</li>
            <li>I used the buffer it comes with first to remove any dead skin cells, then began to remove the hairs from my leg using the epilator.</li>
            <li>I do have to warn you that it is uncomfortable and you won&#x27;t be able to use it through a single use unless you have an extremely high tolerance for pain (which I  thought I had).</li>
            <li>Soak in a tub of hot water prior to open pores to make epliating much less painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used both speeds, but I prefer the fast speed because I have course, dark hair and the fast speed pulls out quicker and faster, so it hurts less.</li>
            <li>When I was done, much like other people said, my skin was irritated and had tiny red bumps.</li>
            <li>Once the epilator was completely charged I used it on dry skin and went to work on my lower legs.</li>
            <li>First things first: Understand that the epilator is going to be a painful experience the first three or four times.</li>
            <li>However, once I started using it in the shower it got better and less painful with each use, but hey when you get it for FREE through being a Bzzagent, you can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>However I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be using them in the winter when my skin gets very dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li>The brush is a little too gentle.</li>
            <li>like you&#x27;re gently scrubbing and getting a little massage.</li>
            <li>When the hair is long enough to start showing again, it looks like the growth is thinner, but it&#x27;s really just that your hair is regrowing with a tapered point as it naturally does and not a sharp, thick end that shaving causes, so even regrowth feels smoother than it does when you shave.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s nice to help you see if you missed any spots.</li>
            <li> Thanks again for the awesome product to try.</li>
            <li> There may be some irritation so use some kind of calming cream and use at night</li>
            <li> Like trying to do your own tattoo.  </li>
            <li> I also used the exfoliator and was thrilled with the softness and smoothness of my skin after use.</li>
            <li> My skin felt nice after using it.</li>
            <li> Epilator: nice alternative to shaving my bikini line, which gives me ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> box is very attractive and the directions are very clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great investment worth every penny!</li>
            <li> There is also a light on the epilator that is amazing!</li>
            <li> The convenience of being able to remove hair in or out of the shower is very appealing to me.  </li>
            <li> it was very easy to use</li>
            <li> The epilator is very easy to use.    </li>
            <li> The tool is great, easy to hold, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I received this item as a bzzagent for review and wow am I so happy I did!</li>
            <li> I have read that it is more popular in Europe than America.</li>
            <li> I liked the side gift that it came with it helped with my acne alot &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I recommend its so amazing this product &amp;#60;3 in love.</li>
            <li> Loved the additional light too.  </li>
            <li> First off the look of the product is beautiful</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in how clean and bright my skin felt and appeared after one use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I got great results the first time, I decided to try using it in the shower, which I have never done before with any epilator.</li>
            <li> Exfoliating is very important when epilating from the research I have done.</li>
            <li> When I was finished both legs, they felt very smooth but were quite irritated.</li>
            <li> One of the cool things about this epilator was that it had a bright light on it that made it easier to see if anything got missed (wish my razor had one!).  </li>
            <li> I really liked how easy it was to use and to switch accessories.</li>
            <li> The light is one of my favorite features!</li>
            <li> I just want to have smooth legs and this product does that and more!  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have the Olay face exfoliator and I like this unit better as the brush head looks and feels like the bristles will have a longer life.  </li>
            <li> It does fit nicely into your hand and does stay put</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really enjoying being hairless</li>
            <li> It worked nicely to make my smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> I love how you get battery and</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I got to try it out</li>
            <li> Thanks Braun for sending me this great product to try.</li>
            <li> The epilation part of this hurts more than waxing.</li>
            <li> This would be perfect for ANY female, including the most non feminine woman you know.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS ITEM</li>
            <li> REALLY LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I have to say that I absolutely love both exfoliators.  </li>
            <li> So overall the epilation was painful-understandably because it is removing hair, and the exfoliating was awesome!</li>
            <li> It has two speeds, though I mostly use the faster speed.</li>
            <li> I think it would be wonderful if it came with multiple brushes.</li>
            <li> epilator exfoliating brush is ok.</li>
            <li> Oh, make sure you stretch the skin as you epilate, the hairs are easier to pull out.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels so smooth!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll come to love this product as well.</li>
            <li> I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN MUCH MORE USE out of the set that includes all the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was definitely much more comfortable than pulling wax strips and unlike wax, there are no areas that are missed!</li>
            <li> I love this product I received it from bzzagent...</li>
            <li> facial brush is awesome...</li>
            <li> I got used to the discomfort and was able to breeze through the rest of the process.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the way my face feels after using it</li>
            <li> Whatever it lacked in the removal process, it sure made up for in the pain department.  </li>
            <li> At this point, which was two days using the epilator, I was completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I do think it cleans my face better, and my skin seems brighter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , so I needed more information to figure out how to move forward with this issue.</li>
            <li> All in all, interesting product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> More updates to come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The facial and exfoliating brushes are also awesome.</li>
            <li> I really love the exfoliator brushes for both the face and the body.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I think I will mostly be using the exfoliators.</li>
            <li> I tried out Braun&#x27;s Epil 7-929 Skinspa Beauty Epilator and I made sure to read all of the instructions before using which included how to use the product and what you’re supposed to do with the epilator along with the face exfoliate brush.</li>
            <li> (Maybe more so than waxing).</li>
            <li> it charges fast, you can use it in the shower too and works great.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with a buffer and a cleansing face brush.</li>
            <li> and I love the way my skin feels after using them.</li>
            <li> I WANTED to be able to use this product.</li>
            <li> and I love having and using it.</li>
            <li> and I love having and using it.</li>
            <li> love the brushes though.  </li>
            <li> I love that it has a separate a scrubber</li>
            <li> i love it till it hurts :)</li>
            <li> Better than I thought.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The bikini area was actually not horrible to use it on.</li>
            <li> However, as I kept working myself up to dealing with the pain, I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I got to try out this product through Buzzagent &amp; OMG if you don&#x27;t absolutely love your skin</li>
            <li> Just make sure to moisturize after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the Braun Silk</li>
            <li> The facial and exfoliating brushes are also awesome.</li>
            <li> Love the glittery handle</li>
            <li> using it in the shower was a much better experience.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the braun silk-èpil 7 skinspa 😍</li>
            <li> You want to make sure you read the instructions</li>
            <li> and I love the way it makes my skin feel.    </li>
            <li> I was very excited when I received the Braun Epil 7 929 SkinSpa Beauty Epilator.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product through BzzAgent and was very excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive the Silk-epil 7 epilator kit from Braun in the mail.  </li>
            <li> I had pretty good results until about 9 months into owning it.</li>
            <li> I think i have a pretty good pain tolerance</li>
            <li> It also charges quickly which is nice.</li>
            <li> Overall great product, loving the results.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to clean and must be cleaned after each use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying going hair free for a week now.  </li>
            <li> I love that there is a light to help see every hair.</li>
            <li> I love the smooth feeling it leaves for days.</li>
            <li> I was really glad that i got it free (complements to BzzAgent) instead of putting out $80 or so to buy something i wouldn&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> This kit also comes with attachments to exfoliate your skin to help keep your skin healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li> One thing I love about the epilator itself is that it is easy to hold in the hand, and sits comfortably.</li>
            <li> With so many epilators out there I was excited to try the Braun silk epil 7.</li>
            <li> The light feature is really nice and makes it really easy to see exactly what I&#x27;m doing and where I need to go!  </li>
            <li> Both are easy to handle.</li>
            <li> The bristle end pops off easily for cleaning, but stays on well while you are using it.</li>
            <li> I know most people can tolerate pain to an extent and say pain is beauty so for most people I think the pain would&#x27;ve worth</li>
            <li> in all, the epilator worked great and it was refreshing to see a company put in the effort to make such a quality item.  </li>
            <li> in all, the epilator worked great and it was refreshing to see a company put in the effort to make such a quality item.  </li>
            <li> I wish the wand it comes with would have more than two settings, but overall it did a great job.</li>
            <li> It is easy to pack this set up and carry it anywhere without taking up lots of space.</li>
            <li> The brushes on the other hand are wonderful and i enjoyed them very much!</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s a beautiful glittery white.</li>
            <li> it hurts but it works fine.</li>
            <li> The light feature makes it really easy to see the hair.</li>
            <li> My face is super smooth and brighter!</li>
            <li> this is so easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> however Ive found it to be most effective right after I get out from a hot shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blown away by how smooth all my skin is</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hair free for the 5th day now.  </li>
            <li> I received this from BzzAgent as a free product.</li>
            <li> I got the Braun Epilator free from Braun.  </li>
            <li> I also received a free product from Braun for submitting my review.</li>
            <li> I recieved Braun Epilator free from Braun to review....</li>
            <li> I hope that my efforts allow me to work through the issues that I’ve had, and that I find the success that most others do with this epilator.  </li>
            <li> I received this kit from Braun for a free trial.</li>
            <li> The light that is available</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#62;Built in light to see what you’re doing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The results were not as great, so I finished outside of the shower.</li>
            <li> (I only use it 1-2 times a week) and I am really happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try the Braun silk epil 7 929 skin spa for free from Braun.</li>
            <li> What I did not expect when i received the product to try free from bzzagent was the eye-tearing pain that ensued when i used this product.</li>
            <li> I got it for free from Braun for review</li>
            <li> The facial and the body brush are great.</li>
            <li> I got it for free from Braun for review</li>
            <li> Now, just smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> I received this product for free from BZZAGENT.</li>
            <li> This product was given to me for free from the brand.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a separate face exfoliator which leaves your face entirely smooth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even feel like it got as smooth as shaving.  </li>
            <li> I received this for free in a trial from Braun.</li>
            <li> It glides smoothly on skin and does the job well.</li>
            <li> my legs where smooth</li>
            <li> I received this free from Braun to try out.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is a great product and you will never go back to razors again.</li>
            <li> I could tolerate the pain if it would have given me a smooth result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has two speeds which is good, and it makes my face SO soft and it feels refreshed afterwards.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll end up using it more once I get used to it, but for now once in a while is good enough for</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, so good.</li>
            <li> First time using this!!</li>
            <li> the Face Exfolliator is by far one of the best I ever used, but the question is how much are you willing to stand for beauty?</li>
            <li> My legs were hair-free, they were smooth, and I was so excited at the thought that I wouldn’t have to shave again for a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first it hurt like hell, but it got easier the more</li>
            <li> The epillator was not getting as many hairs as it once was on the first swipe</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received the Braun Silk-epil 7 SkinSpa from BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> I have had excellent experiences in the past with Braun.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this from BzzAgent to review.</li>
            <li> At first i was like oh ouch, but it did get better.</li>
            <li> I do think it’s worth it!</li>
            <li> I was SO excited to use this product</li>
            <li> I have never herd of an epilator before and was hesitant yet excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s well worth it for that radiant skin you&#x27;ve always wanted!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s defiantly worth the money !</li>
            <li> I am excited to ditch razors once and for all.</li>
            <li> My face comes out squeaky clean everytime.</li>
            <li> I guess you bee to weigh out the pain versus shaving daily to decide if the product is a good fit for you.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face clean and</li>
            <li> Also, when using, make sure to be in an area that can be easily cleaned because will definitely drop most of the hair that is being plucked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I felt like my face was super clean after using it, and after applying my face lotion super smooth.</li>
            <li> It comes with a special one for your face that runs off of batteries and another that attaches to the epilator for the rest of your body.</li>
            <li> If you are more used to the pain or more willing to get used to it, this seems like a highly functional tool.    </li>
            <li> Great as I expected.</li>
            <li> I did get a full body exfoliation, and</li>
            <li> it is just so cool</li>
            <li> I also love how fast it is and</li>
            <li> Cool huh?</li>
            <li> The next day I used the exfoliating brush head and loved that as well.</li>
            <li> This model has a light to see the hair as you go, which I found so useful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another item on my good list is the Facial cleansing brush.</li>
            <li> and I was able to get 90% of the hair off before the pain was too much.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Braun &amp; BzzAgent, I was able to try this product.</li>
            <li> Overall I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> It did a good job of cleaning up the area and grabbing even short hairs.</li>
            <li> Although I loved the idea of no more shaving, it just wasn’t effective at removing my leg hair.</li>
            <li> The concept is pretty awesome if it works for your hair type, I liked that it could be used on wet or dry skin and that it also came with a face cleaner as bonus.</li>
            <li> Love the epilator doesnt miss any spots love the feeling of being hairless total bonus!!!</li>
            <li> The epilator is also cordless, which is super convenient.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much need for the facial cleanser, but it&#x27;s great for after a workout when you KNOW that there&#x27;s sweat on your hairline</li>
            <li> and Bam there it was, a new addict!!!!</li>
            <li> The smart light is very helpful for better visibility.</li>
            <li> The smart light is very helpful for better visibility.</li>
            <li> I started to use it on my skin, first the inside of my arm to see how it would feel; it ended up feeling like a HUGE burning sensation.</li>
            <li> I was actually really excited to see how much faster I could epilate my legs since this epilator has a light on it.</li>
            <li> I first heard about this product on bzzagent where i recieved the product free to try.</li>
            <li> so this was also new for me to use, but I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the new Braun silk-epil 7-929 emulator</li>
            <li> Before you try it out be sure to charge your new elipilater for one hour.</li>
            <li> The facial brush was my favorite!</li>
            <li> With an epilator, you can use it when the hairs are very short, which means you won&#x27;t have to go too many days having stubbly legs!</li>
            <li> I received this from Braun and my first time using, it hurt!</li>
            <li> As far as epilators go, I am very happy with this purchase as well as with my previous plug-in Braun.</li>
            <li> I must say I greatly prefer it dry, it doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt nearly as much</li>
            <li> The facial brush/exfoliator is also pretty cool; I had never used anything like that on my face before, but I really love it!</li>
            <li> It also has a light which is very helpful in guiding you to any hairs you may miss.  </li>
            <li> The exfoliating attachment and the facial brush are AMAZING</li>
            <li> About a couple of weeks ago, I received a free package of this product, thanks to Braun and Bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The epilator comes with a body exfoliator attachment which is great for removing all of the dead skin off your body.</li>
            <li> So, thanks to BzzAgent, I got one for free to try out.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the initial results but for $104 + tax</li>
            <li> It works by spinning and when it does these metal things move in and out and a tweazing action occurs which removes the hair, there are many of them all around it.</li>
            <li> That alone is worth using this or purchasing it.</li>
            <li> The face exfolliator alone to me is worth the price of the package.</li>
            <li> And, it came with an extra attachment that feels nice against the skin I just ripped hair from, and</li>
            <li> Before using it I shaved the week before to ensure all the hairs were the same length, honestly I didn&#x27;t have to because it even pulled the baby hairs out.</li>
            <li> I definitely would not be able to see the hairs that I had missed without the light.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it because you won&#x27;t be spending money on razors anymore.</li>
            <li> It is worth letting a bit of razor stubble develop in order to use this epilator.  </li>
            <li> The epilator is nice overall.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even finish one leg, let a lone trying more sensitive places.  </li>
            <li> The pros are definitely the smooth skin and the healthy glow.</li>
            <li> My face regimen had always using a washcloth with moisturizing soap, which seemed to clean my face just fine (I always get compliments on how young I look).</li>
            <li> I noticed that the epilator did not get all of the hair, it was really good at getting the dark thick hair but was not that great at getting the light fuzzy sort of hair.</li>
            <li> Luckily, it has very clear, precise instructions on how to use every part of the kit.</li>
            <li> It left my face and body feeling so smooth and clean!  </li>
            <li> As soon as I receive the package I tore right into it.  </li>
            <li> I charged it right away to try it out.  </li>
            <li> I received my Braun silk epilepsy 7 and tried it right away, took a bit to get use to</li>
            <li> Right out of the box though</li>
            <li> Maybe im just not doing it right</li>
            <li> So when our Epilator came in the mail, we tried it right away.</li>
            <li> The body exfoliation brush is just what you need right after using the epilator and works wonders to moisturize the skin.</li>
            <li> obviously had some kind of a reaction/infection because of bacteria either on my skin, or that got into the follicle when I first epilated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to switch to the different attachments and you get everything you need for a beauty routine in one kit.</li>
            <li> It comes with very clear and easy to follow instructions.</li>
            <li> It comes with very clear and easy to follow instructions.</li>
            <li> The epilator even has a light on it which makes it a little more helpful!</li>
            <li> When I first got it it looked so exciting.</li>
            <li> AND, the epilator has 2 speeds; I tend to use the higher speed as it seems to work the best for my hair type (dark, coarse hair).</li>
            <li> I was aware that there would be some pain involved, but thought it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li> I have usually had good experiences with Braun products, so I was excited to try this and see what it was all about.</li>
            <li> and I think the hair must have been to long, it honestly felt like I was getting a tattoo that never ended.  </li>
            <li> While I enjoy that this bundle comes with many extras, I am pretty simple when it comes to my wants and needs.  </li>
            <li> When my package came I started reading the instructions right away since I am a first time epilator user.</li>
            <li> The next morning my lip was smooth, hairless and free from redness or bumps.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much Braun for giving me the Braun-epil to try for Free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take several rounds to get enough hair removed to make me even kinda happy.  </li>
            <li> You can feel a light massage and the results are a total smooth and relaxed skin.  </li>
            <li> You can feel a light massage and the results are a total smooth and relaxed skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I personally will stick to shaving but the product does do a great job aside from the red marks.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty amazing machine and I am so excited to keep using it to see just how little I need to worry about my leg hair.  </li>
            <li> I also tried the epilator on my face, as I have more hair on my lip and chin than I’m comfortable with, due to medications</li>
            <li> After using it, my face feels so clean, fresh and soft to touch.</li>
            <li> they left my skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> So I didnt try this particular model, I tried the 820 edition thanks to a free trial by BzzAgent.com</li>
            <li> Overall so far this product has preformed exceptional and I would recommend this to all skin types and hair coarseness.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize at first that it&#x27;s best for shorter hair but even though mine was a little longer than what&#x27;s ideal ,it wasn&#x27;t painful.</li>
            <li> This was the first epilator I bought</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re using this for your legs, be aware, it will hurt at first.  </li>
            <li> When I used this on my legs for the first time, I thought I was going to cry.</li>
            <li> When you first got your eyebrows done, did it not hurt?</li>
            <li> Just make sure the follow the instructions on how to keep your battery life to its max potential.</li>
            <li> it should have lasted more than ten months!</li>
            <li> Works well just make sure you exfoliate often because ingrown hairs become a big problem.</li>
            <li> I did see them decrease after first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is suppose to do</li>
            <li> I will say if this is your first time using an epilator though do it in spurts.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time lastnight at first</li>
            <li> However, the lack of hot wax interested me.  </li>
            <li> I got this product, and I won&#x27;t lie, at first, it hurt like the dickens.  </li>
            <li> Love the facial brushes.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I used a epilator.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have never heard of an epilator.</li>
            <li> I shaved first, making sure I shaved with the hair and then against it to cut back on irritation and to get a closer shave.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;sleep&lt;br /&gt;wake up to soft smooth</li>
            <li> The design of the base fits perfect in your hand, it is easy to take apart and clean, and does not slip while using it in the shower.</li>
            <li> The charge holds for more than enough time to do both my legs.  </li>
            <li> I still love the convenience and the lasting result and will continue to epilate my legs.</li>
            <li> I used it first on my legs</li>
            <li> and yes… the epilator definitely hurt (more like stung…</li>
            <li> On my legs, it looked like an infected hair with a pustule, but on a much bigger scale (much more</li>
            <li> I did try the above recommendation of using a pumice stone, but found that it actually caused more hair breakage, which led to even more ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Using a medium bristle foot brush works better to exfoliate the skin on my legs, and I use it with Dial soap daily.</li>
            <li> I still have issues with inflamed follicles as the hair grows back and becomes ingrown, which Ihave more of now than I did before with shaving.</li>
            <li> I tried to use it on my armpits the first day</li>
            <li> it hurt too much!</li>
            <li> However, the second day way more bearable</li>
            <li> Make sure that you keep the hairs SHORT.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I should be using the Exfoliation Brush first on my face</li>
            <li> Perhaps I should be using the Exfoliation Brush first on my face</li>
            <li> I would most closely compare it to getting a tattoo over a bigger area of skin.</li>
            <li> but after several uses it felt better.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use the brushes that it comes with, but most likely i will not use the epilator.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the extra pieces like the exfoliating face brush and the one for the body.</li>
            <li> once I read through the manual, I felt confident enough to give it a go.</li>
            <li> hurt at first, does what it says</li>
            <li> and I love the facial</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li> The brush was soft enough to not irritate my skin, but I seen a huge difference in how much more of my makeup got removed.  </li>
            <li> , I turned it up to the higher speed.  </li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a device like this before.</li>
            <li> I thouroughly enjoyed the facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> the first time you use the razor its hurt</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it was in the shower</li>
            <li> I got many compliments on my skin after using the facial cleansing brush...</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product to all of you out there who want to give themselves a skin spa treat!</li>
            <li> The first time I used the epilator I gotta admit, it was not a walk in the park.</li>
            <li> After the first pass on my leg, I felt my leg</li>
            <li> love the facial cleansing brush and the body exfoliation brush.  </li>
            <li> So upon receiving the epilator I first tried it out on my arm.</li>
            <li> I did love how soft and clean my face felt after using the facial cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am not giving this review a five star rating is that while the epilator leaves me legs mainly hair free, they are not as smooth as compared to shaving.  </li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s a good thing, but I&#x27;m not sure if using an epilator is better than simply shaving.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s a good thing, but I&#x27;m not sure if using an epilator is better than simply shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before we get to the actual Epilator, I want to start off by saying I loved the extra attachments.</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have to use it very often and the results last for weeks for me.  </li>
            <li> It was sleek, stylish, looked very well made, and included a body brush attachment and facial brush that I hadn’t expected.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now, even though I said that, I couldn’t bring myself to do anything more than my lower legs and that was always on the lowest speed since the second speed hurt too much for my liking.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I really wanted to take my time in reviewing this because I wanted to give a proper review.</li>
            <li> The lower legs were by far the most sensitive.</li>
            <li> Very easy to operate and left my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> and so does my boyfriend for the super soft legs!</li>
            <li> I was really nervous to purchase Braun Silk-épil 7 SkinSpa 7-929 Epilator at first, but it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everyone complains about how much it hurts the first time you use it, but I discovered a trick to lessing the pain.</li>
            <li> As a girl and as a girl who goes through pain in order to look pretty i was ready for the pain</li>
            <li> I preferred the dry as it does grip better and remove quicker.  </li>
            <li> It worked better when I was in the shower than it did when it was dry.</li>
            <li> but I certainly intend on doing so in the coming week</li>
            <li> The epilator is not too loud, and I would very much like for it to work - I&#x27;ll keep trying!</li>
            <li> I love using new and different skin products.  </li>
            <li> was really excited about the facial brush since I had been looking into getting one, so that was the first thing I tried.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love with being able to use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> The facial brushes work just fine.  </li>
            <li> It works very well, even on short fine hair.</li>
            <li> a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;The facial and the body brush are great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still catching all the little light blonde ones that are trying to hide, but I&#x27;ll get &#x27;em.  </li>
            <li> It is great at getting rid of gross dead skin.    </li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t, it still hurts, you won&#x27;t do as well as with shaving your legs, because the pain of using this product is too much.</li>
            <li> It cuts my time by sooooo much, I should&#x27;ve bought it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been curious about the use of a epilator for many years</li>
            <li> how well it exfoliates the skin as I had to add a exfoliating wash to really feel like I was doing anything</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend you not use it thou as you must absolutely exfoliate</li>
            <li> you really should epilate there as well.  </li>
            <li> Then I used it wet much more tolerable.</li>
            <li> and it works really</li>
            <li> well really gets the hair off</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I had never used one before, but it&#x27;s like a tiny massage for your face that leaves the skin baby smooth.  </li>
            <li> I really like how it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li> My skin thanks you</li>
            <li> Ready?</li>
            <li> My hair grows so fast, and the stubble is like trying to sleep with a porcupine.</li>
            <li> (not that it helps much).</li>
            <li> (not that it helps much).</li>
            <li> but it hurt a lot more than i expected.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Braun I got to try the silk-epil.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Braun and and being a member of BzzAgent, I received this product in the mail try out.</li>
            <li> and I think that it could become very addicting.</li>
            <li> I must admit, I was VERY nervous about trying this product out, however,</li>
            <li> but I really like this product and did recommend it to friends,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really tried.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Braun Silk epil 7-929 spa!</li>
            <li> highly recommend the Braun Silk epil 7-929 spa!</li>
            <li> but the skin brushes dont do much for me.  </li>
            <li> Just wish I hadn&#x27;t paid so much for them as I will never use the epistle part again...</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t really thought about it, but it allows you to save tons of money on razors.  </li>
            <li> You know what they say no pain no game.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to any one out there who hates shaving!</li>
            <li> and it didnt really take the hair out.</li>
            <li> The epilator works really well.</li>
            <li> My legs were left smooth and</li>
            <li> Thanks BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> The rest of the package is kind of a waste though.  </li>
            <li> I decided to do my own personal comparison with standard shaving.</li>
            <li> The battery life is good - lasting at least 2 full uses for legs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Moving forward since, I’ve tried other methods with the epilator in order to better my outcome.</li>
            <li> It hurts like no tomorrow the first little bit that gets done, but it’s more manageable after that since you know what’s coming.  </li>
            <li> I would like to begin by saying that I was lucky enough to receive this product for free as a Bzz Agent campaign; to try it out and give some critical feedback.  </li>
            <li> The results were less than spectacular, so I assumed that I hadn’t used it right and tried again the next day.  </li>
            <li> I already use a body exfoliation puff in the shower, which works just as well and is much faster (covers more area in less time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> An older razor had recently given up the ghost, and I needed something new to keep my legs silky smooth.</li>
            <li> push past pain as you will have AMAZING SKIN lol&lt;</li>
            <li> The unit is rechargeable which actually came to full charge within an hour.  </li>
            <li> My legs haven’t been smooth since the first few days after epilating for the first time, and they have scars, but they are healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The area around with less muscle hurts more, but just like tweezing your eyebrows, you get used to it</li>
            <li> I love the facial brush, I use it quite every night for a deep wash and remove my make up.</li>
            <li> I tried it with the hair growth being at several different lengths and nothing seemed to work for the better on my lower legs with the thicker</li>
            <li> The first time my skin was pretty red, but I put aloe vera for sunburn, and by morning any bumps or redness was gone.</li>
            <li> The only I didn&#x27;t like at first was how it hurt at first</li>
            <li> That being said, I just applied some aloe vera and my legs were smooth and completely clear the next morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 100% confident that I will not go back to shaving with a regular razor ever again.</li>
            <li> Overall, the Braun Epil 7 929 SkinSpa Beauty Epilator is very pretty.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this epilator.  </li>
            <li> I also have a high tolerance for pain</li>
            <li> Read the direction before you start, they are very detailed and they will save you some trouble.</li>
            <li> Wow to be able to not shave for a few days is a nice feeling instead of feeling like you have to shave everyday.</li>
            <li> and now i feel like i can’t because of how high the pain is.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, just buy the brush if you don&#x27;t have a high pain</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I will use the facial brush and body exfoliater both worked well and left my skin very clean and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It left myskin feeling so soft and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good size for both not too big not too small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wasn’t all a complete bust, I did have more luck with areas that had finer hair such as my upper legs.  </li>
            <li> I still love the dream of not having to shave every few days, so haven’t wanted to give up on this without giving it time.</li>
            <li> It did leave my skin a bit irritated for quite a few hours after going over my legs, but the hair it removed was astonishing.</li>
            <li> I love how you can can rid of dead skin before you shave.  </li>
            <li> :/ on the other hand i really love the face brush, and body exfoliating brush it left my skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> When my Braun Skin Spa arrived in the mail I was so excited to try the new product due to the fact that it was a gift straight from Bzz Agent however once I unpackaged it</li>
            <li> The epilator has a light and it is small, therefore making it easy to travel with if necessary.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to not feel as much pulling as I do with my other epilator, and how well the light works.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed this problem go away, which is why it only gets 4 stars right now.  </li>
            <li> I was given the Braun Epil 7 929 hair remover to try from Braun; my overall opinion is that it may not be the right hair removal tool for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , so I assumed that I hadn’t used it right and tried again the next day.  </li>
            <li> I shaved my right leg and used the Braun Epil 7 929 on the left leg.</li>
            <li> This was a new experience for me because I never even heard of a epilator.</li>
            <li> I saw &amp;#34;the free gift (facial brush) and thought it was a bonus in addition to all the different tips.</li>
            <li> The pain does get better as you get used to it, and now feeling a little discomfort lets me know that it’s working!</li>
            <li> I will start by saying that I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> (my skin is very sensitive and acne prone).</li>
            <li> The right leg that I had used the razor on was needing to be shaved again after just a few days, but the left was still holding strong.  </li>
            <li> So far I have had to shave the right leg an additional 2 times while having no need to do anything to the left leg.</li>
            <li> The instructions say that after using it multiple times the pain will greatly reduce but i can’t even hardly use it once in order to hopefully make the pain reduce next time.</li>
            <li> This is a normal reaction and should quickly disappear, but may be stronger when you are removing hair at the root for the first few times or if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> As for the body exfoliating brush, I barely use because I have an exfoliating towel which I find it much faster to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not use any toner prior as it closes pores making it more difficult and more</li>
            <li> and I really struggled keeping in my hand and not slipping out once soap got onto my hand.  </li>
            <li> And even after the first time using it I could tell that it was doing a deep cleaning on my face.</li>
            <li> For anyone who has sensitive skin, consider throwing away the razors and chemicals!</li>
            <li> It definitely hurts like heck at first, but about 2 minutes into it</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that this is normal, and the instructions clearly state that continued use diminishes the pain.</li>
            <li> My advice to anyone trying it for the first time, shave your legs first like it tell you in the manual and then when your hair is starting to grow back in use the epil.</li>
            <li> but ladies we all know the old saying &amp;#34; Beauty is Pain!</li>
            <li> It hurts like tiny hot needles poking at my legs.</li>
            <li> Many try different methods of hair removal, only to find that they need to repeat the process several times in a week.  </li>
            <li> Pretty simple.</li>
            <li> your skin is so  sensitive!</li>
            <li> The only cons I can think of is the first rounds of pain</li>
            <li> It did cause some discomfort, but it was not painful and if you just keep going instead of stopping the discomfort is not very noticeable.</li>
            <li> They had red bumps all over, which is normal; however, the redness was slightly more intense than usual.</li>
            <li> After reading through the directions and tips and checking out the items functions (it has a low and high setting, or as the pamphlet says “gentle or efficient speed”), I charged the epilator and gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I don’t use the epilator very much because of the pain, but I do use it when I know I’m going to be too busy to shave later on.  </li>
            <li> more razors!&lt;br /&gt;can be used wet or dry</li>
            <li> I love that it can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that you can use them wet or dry and it comes with a wall</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s cordless and that you can use it dry or wet.</li>
            <li> I really love the facial brush add-on, but the body exfoliator is a little underwhelming.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does take a little more time than you would just shaving your legs, but I feel like if you epilate, the slower your hair grows back.</li>
            <li> It took me a couple of weeks before I got use to it, but once I did I was glad I continued through the pain because I don&#x27;t have to shave hardly at all now.</li>
            <li> I wish the epilator was better at getting around hard areas like the knees.</li>
            <li> And last but not least, the facial cleasing brush works so well to deep clean the face.</li>
            <li> And if you get this and you&#x27;re not a fan of the pain, trying checking out some of their other attachments, I think I seen a shaver one.lts were less than spectacular</li>
            <li> The body exfoliator brush comes with a clear plastic cover for storage.  </li>
            <li> I was genuinely surprised at how much it didn&#x27;t hurt the next day.  </li>
            <li> I dabbed rubbing alcohol on the spots to clear them up.</li>
            <li> The body brush attachment and the face exfoliator are vital for optimal results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will never shave again, I&#x27;m a lifer as far as epliating the hair on by body.  </li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> All in all, I completely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The facial brush was gentle and made my skin feel renewed without having to use any chemicals or creams.</li>
            <li> This model works a lot nicer than my old one.  </li>
            <li> but this one is extremely soft and I can control the speed</li>
            <li> and I had to wait for the hairs to grow pretty long in order to wax them.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the opportunity to try this product and will continue to use the exfoliter attachment and the facial brush.</li>
            <li> I wasn’t expecting too much, just smoother skin like I would get after using the facial brush.  </li>
            <li> since that didn’t really feel like it was working well enough</li>
            <li> My 11 year old daughter and</li>
            <li> make sure to at least exfoliate the skin and moisten it a bit before using.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It wasn’t worth the pain of going over the same area several times to still not have all of the hair gone.  </li>
            <li> I am not someone who gets waxed, so for me, I would more than likely just shave than use the epilator unless I was preparing for a beach vacation where I didn&#x27;t want to shave everyday.</li>
            <li> I read the directions cover to cover and the word pain was mentioned a few more times than I thought was necessary.</li>
            <li> I had a bit of trouble getting the batteries into the separate exfoliater (the battery case is challenging to open and then close again), but the products seems well constructed.  </li>
            <li> The pain is actually worth it because the epilator is removing the hairs from the root causing it not to grow back until 3 or 4 weeks later.</li>
            <li> I used the Silk-epil on my left leg and just a regular razor on my right leg.</li>
            <li> As the week went on I noticed a big difference in the hair growth on the right and left.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have not been able to use facial brushes in the past</li>
            <li> My first use, I used it dry.</li>
            <li> After a few uses the ingrown hair on my legs has diminished significantly.  </li>
            <li> The body exfoliator is good as well, a little harsh, but thats what an exfoliator is!</li>
            <li> It has a soft, rotating brush for the face and has a low and high setting.</li>
            <li> I also love that the second and third times it hurts even less .</li>
            <li> I charged it back up, which only took about an hour, and finished the spots that I had missed the first time.</li>
            <li> Not sure the whole package was worth it.  </li>
            <li> Operates on two provided AA batteries, has a low and high operating speed.  </li>
            <li> Some reviews suggested using the epilator in the shower or on the low setting to decrease the pain, but I just went with it on high.</li>
            <li> As far as the legs go the slight momentary discomfort is well worth</li>
            <li> two hour long epilator uses before even needing to charge and I believe it would have gone much longer</li>
            <li> In general, the skin reaction and the sensation of pain tend to diminish considerably with the repeated use of Silk•épil.</li>
            <li> The result is, minus a few stragglers, perfectly smooth legs for about two weeks (depending on how fast your hair grows of course).</li>
            <li> A stray upper lip hair will swell a tiny bit but barely worth noting because it is only temporary.  </li>
            <li> This retails for $149.99 on average and well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive, and I can only use shaving creams meant for sensitive skin, and not even all of those.  </li>
            <li> We have only been using it for a week, and I have noticed a big difference in my husbands skin (he is acne prone and has very oily skin).</li>
            <li> I enjoyed cleaning my face with a gentle face cleaner and a exfoliating wash wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> It is painful at first but well worth it since your legs are silky smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> for the instructions , they are pretty simple to follow and overall I like this product and will definitely recommend it to others to try out.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not to say it didn&#x27;t hurt at all, just that the pain was far less than the first night.  </li>
            <li> It hurts like dry shaving, even when I&#x27;ve had a hot bath to open my pores AND am using a shave lotion.</li>
            <li> Also included is a small plastic bristled brush to clean exfoliator head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#62;Comes with small brush to clean epilator</li>
            <li> I did have some serious reddening, as they warn, but it was mostly gone the next day.  </li>
            <li> Overall I like that this is 3 tools in one purchase, but the current price seems too high.</li>
            <li> So far, (I&#x27;ve only been using it a week or so)</li>
            <li> barely stings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The last time I tried an epilator was years ago, during the early Epilady days.  </li>
            <li> I tried three different times, after three different types of preparation (hot shower, long bath, longer bath), and this still HURTS.  </li>
            <li> But I finally gave in and did it..and was surprised.</li>
            <li> And I used the small one on my face same thing, super soft skin.</li>
            <li> exfoliation brushes were great , and the epilator was quite painful the first times, but if it means no shaving every other day (especially in the summer months) then who would say no to that ?</li>
            <li> I do feel some discomfort initially, but once I get going with it, it becomes less and less and is more than tolerable.  </li>
            <li> When I use the large one on my body it makes my skin so soft, like unbelievable soft.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed because I would love to not have to shave daily and have smooth feeling skin.  </li>
            <li> Since using the facial brush to exfoliate, it has cut down a lot on the bumps that I broke out with the first time.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m willing to share!</li>
            <li> Since I am pretty tolerant to pain, I didn&#x27;t mind going through a little pain if it gets me to not use shaver every 2 days.</li>
            <li> This one was a big letdown, especially after the other two worked so well, but I am excited to see what other attachments there are.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one was a big letdown, especially after the other two worked so well, but I am excited to see what other attachments there are.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought they&#x27;d have improved this type of product since it first came out a while ago (a few years).  </li>
            <li> But like the instructions said use the exfoliator a few times first.</li>
            <li> I used the buffer it comes with first to remove any dead skin cells, then began to remove the hairs from my leg using the epilator.</li>
            <li> I do have to warn you that it is uncomfortable and you won&#x27;t be able to use it through a single use unless you have an extremely high tolerance for pain (which I  thought I had).</li>
            <li> Soak in a tub of hot water prior to open pores to make epliating much less painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used both speeds, but I prefer the fast speed because I have course, dark hair and the fast speed pulls out quicker and faster, so it hurts less.</li>
            <li> When I was done, much like other people said, my skin was irritated and had tiny red bumps.</li>
            <li> Once the epilator was completely charged I used it on dry skin and went to work on my lower legs.</li>
            <li> First things first: Understand that the epilator is going to be a painful experience the first three or four times.</li>
            <li> However, once I started using it in the shower it got better and less painful with each use, but hey when you get it for FREE through being a Bzzagent, you can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> However I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be using them in the winter when my skin gets very dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li> The brush is a little too gentle.</li>
            <li> like you&#x27;re gently scrubbing and getting a little massage.</li>
            <li> When the hair is long enough to start showing again, it looks like the growth is thinner, but it&#x27;s really just that your hair is regrowing with a tapered point as it naturally does and not a sharp, thick end that shaving causes, so even regrowth feels smoother than it does when you shave.</li>
            <li> With the second use I noticing that it was more effective at getting both types of hair, thick and fuzzy, and it was a lot less painful</li>
            <li> My fiance says it&#x27;s loud, so I just walk into the other room, go at it for 20 minutes or so, and return when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> I mean which woman doesnt love a little glitter?!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item if you are physically disabled and struggle shaving.  </li>
            <li> As for someone like myself who is new to epilators,this was extremely painful, and I couldn&#x27;t use it for more than 3 seconds.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much point of the body exfoliator though and it seems somewhat pointless to me.</li>
            <li> As the saying goes , sometimes beauty hurts, at least for the first time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I want to give the hair time to get long enough to catch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For instance, if I had an irritated follicule after evening use, there would be no apparent redness by morning.  </li>
            <li> The redness was gone in a few hours with no negative side effects.</li>
            <li> so the exfoliation action lets the soap reach a little further into the follicle where it can kill any microbial agents.</li>
            <li> I already had a silk-épil years ago, so I was ready to the pain, if you were used to shave, it hurts at first, but than hair become thin and it&#x27;ll sore always less.</li>
            <li> It definitely takes the edge off of the sting when you use it in the shower, but it doesn&#x27;t make any difference to me for the bath vs. dry use.</li>
            <li> I did my upper lip, which is a very sensitive area, which i usually get waxed.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it five stars is due to the discomfort when using, I can not see using this on the bikini area as it mentions since that is such a tender area</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a very high pain threshold and I was really worried it would be painful but was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> The Braun® Silk-epil 7 SkinSpa Beauty Edition is more than I was expecting it to be and initially I was a little skeptical because of discomfort concerns.   </li>
            <li> Trying to stand on one leg while shaving has definitely gotten harder and more dangerous for me, so six weeks ago I committed to using these products in order to provide a customer review.</li>
            <li> that yes the first time will be painful, but its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not completely sold on</li>
            <li> must include this minor detail...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Comes with a long corded charger</li>
            <li> and there is not much hair left.</li>
            <li> I am being careful to stay near the edges of my bikini line and NOT go too \\&quot;far down\\&quot;, if you know what I mean.    </li>
            <li> personally don&#x27;t like to use the epilator in the shower because it doesn&#x27;t work as well when wet as to when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> SE7681 Silk-épil 7 Wet and Dry Epilator, White (Health and Beauty)&lt;br</li>
            <li> B0077PLNNE Braun SE7681 Silk-épil 7 Wet and Dry Epilator, White]]    </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure that it is something that I am willing to subject myself to again.    </li>
            <li> I am being careful to stay near the edges of my bikini line and NOT go too \\&quot;far down\\&quot;, if you know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The High Density Facial Brush is rather a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Your hair grows back at different paces, so instead of shaving all the hair at once, the hair is removed a little at a time as it grows.</li>
            <li> Staph is all over your skin, and given the opportunity, will infect your hair follicles and cause something similar to razor bumps, though razor bumps are often cause by sharp hair pressing into the side of the follicle as well as staph.</li>
            <li> I had never used anything other than razors but the epil 7 definitely made that change</li>
            <li> It can be used in water or dry.  </li>
            <li> I tried the Braun Silk-epil 7 dry did not like it.</li>
            <li> Use epilator for 2-3 days in a row dry or</li>
            <li> I tried it dry</li>
            <li> This time I shaved in the morning and then tried it at night, dry.  </li>
            <li> I used it on dry legs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently at a stage that it doesn&#x27;t even hurt to do it as it&#x27;s only pulling out a few hairs here and there.  </li>
            <li> I tried this several times on wet and dry skin, didn&#x27;t notice a difference between using on wet vs. dry.</li>
            <li> It stopped hurting after a few mins but left red bumps all over my legs for days!</li>
            <li> , I know that you can use the unit wet in the shower or dry, so I decided to go with dry.</li>
            <li> 1) Use epilator for 2-3 days in a row dry or wet.     </li>
            <li> I like that you can use it wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> This can be used wet and dry, so I figured why not.</li>
            <li> tried using this both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> Wait for the hair to grow back a little bit and exfoliate heavily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, although it is a little painful, one gets used to it.</li>
            <li> The pain while using it on my face and underarms was much more painful than my legs, which I expected from the reviews I had read.</li>
            <li> and it made it more painful then needed.</li>
            <li> It seems like it can&#x27;t catch the hair as well when wet, so it takes a few more tries and sometimes awkward angles.</li>
            <li> and it did not seem to remove the hair unless I went over the same area a few times.</li>
            <li> I used it wet in the shower</li>
            <li> The discomfort is really minimal.  </li>
            <li> The leg hair took longer, and I think it&#x27;s because wet hairs stick to the leg and aren&#x27;t caught by the epilator&#x27;s tweezers.</li>
            <li> My legs are not smooth, and I have to constantly exfoliate in the shower to get rid of the bumps</li>
            <li> My legs are not smooth, and I have to constantly exfoliate in the shower to get rid of the bumps</li>
            <li> I have never really had luck with alternative hair removal methods and I have never had any luck.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had actually received the Braun Epil Skinspa Beauty Epilator a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> few days later</li>
            <li> I ended up trying quite a few times before finally giving up.  </li>
            <li> I ended up trying quite a few times before finally giving up.  </li>
            <li> It did cause some redness, but that is to be expected with this method.</li>
            <li> but I decided to try it wet</li>
            <li> I have always wondered about epilators but never really knew what they were all about.  </li>
            <li> Just did not work like I expected.</li>
            <li> I spent like fifteen minutes just on one leg</li>
            <li> Ive never really tried an epilator before</li>
            <li> Facial and body brushes: wasn&#x27;t harsh on my skin as expected.</li>
            <li> It may sting a little but it definitely beats shaving every other day.</li>
            <li> My pores were a little sore and red but in an hour or less there was no sign</li>
            <li> My pores were a little sore and red but in an hour or less there was no sign</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I don&#x27;t need to shave every day with this as wiea typical razor however it is slightly painful to use.  </li>
            <li> The manual says the more you use it, the less painful it gets so hopefully that is the case.</li>
            <li> Push past initial pain as it does ease up if you keep going.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> But.......if you just push past the initial pain it fades or you get use to it after about 5 minuters.  </li>
            <li> shaving head comes with it like other sets for areas you don&#x27;t want to epilate&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, compact, and very simple to operate.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it on other areas of my body nor have I tried the other pieces in the kit</li>
            <li> and I will be using it in place of my other epilator.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I may try again after investing in an anesthetic cream...</li>
            <li> And if you get this and you&#x27;re not a fan of the pain, trying checking out some of their other attachments, I think I seen a shaver one.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to not having to shave every other day.  </li>
            <li> I wish it came with a little carrying back to make carrying the brush heads and the epilator tip around when traveling a little easier.</li>
            <li> It was still painful during and a little while after, but it gets better every time.</li>
            <li> 2) Wait for the hair to grow back a little bit and exfoliate heavily.     </li>
            <li> When those hairs grow back, they can become trapped under dead skin and cause ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Hair removal on the legs was very painful dry, but much better in the shower wet.</li>
            <li> The High Density Facial Brush is rather a disappointment.</li>
            <li> It has a light which makes things easier to see, and it is just going to be quite painful.</li>
            <li> I also have chin hair and mustache hair from steroid medication and being naturally dark headed.  </li>
            <li> And the hair is slow to come back.  </li>
            <li> I started crying, not really</li>
            <li> I have dark hair, so even when recently shaved, I had a bit of shadow, which is not cute!</li>
            <li> I narrowed my choices down to the emoji and this one.  </li>
            <li> What I mean by that is if your not use to it, its going to hurt like he double hocky sticks!</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for hours on end and is significantly less painful than my previous cheap one.  </li>
            <li> The first use was a little painful, as it stung a bit when pulling out the hairs, but, I did use the tips provided, such as using water and stretching the skin as I went.</li>
            <li> The underarm was another story, although I can say that the results were neat, both first and second epilation were equally painful and it feels sore for a little longer.  </li>
            <li> And with the way it works, even when I get a few hairs popping up, they&#x27;re hard to notice, so I&#x27;m the only one that knows they&#x27;re there.  </li>
            <li> less pain.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Less black heads, clearer skin</li>
            <li> His skin is less oily during the day and brighter.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a slight pinch feeling when epilating, but that faded as my skin seemed to adjust.</li>
            <li> There was slight redness, but no discomfort.</li>
            <li> I plan to use it again tomorrow, and I know that it&#x27;s going to hurt even less.</li>
            <li> It hurts less and goes a bit faster.</li>
            <li> The pain was less but the stubble was the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin on my face feels much less tight now, and softer as well.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to try the epilator at first.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to read the directions because I didn&#x27;t want to mess things up.</li>
            <li> this time it wasn&#x27;t so painful, actually not painful at all, just a little tingle.  </li>
            <li> this time it wasn&#x27;t so painful, actually not painful at all, just a little tingle.  </li>
            <li> My skin needs a heavier exfoliant, so I often feel as though my face is still not clean after I use it.</li>
            <li> My skin needs a heavier exfoliant, so I often feel as though my face is still not clean after I use it.</li>
            <li> and it just burns a little.</li>
            <li> It does take a little bit of time to get used to using if you have never used an epilator before, just give it time</li>
            <li> But then I had a little problem.  </li>
            <li> But then I had a little problem.  </li>
            <li> I got this from Braun to review and it took me a while to try it because I was a little bit nervous about the pain.</li>
            <li> I do think it&#x27;s a little bit pricey</li>
            <li> and I thought I would review that product on here as it may help out a little.</li>
            <li> but I did get a little teary</li>
            <li> It was far less painful the second time around.</li>
            <li> The right leg is still having to be shaved every other day. :(  </li>
            <li> It hurts a little less in those areas!</li>
            <li> But after a few hours it went away.</li>
            <li> But after the course of a few session, you get used to it even though the pain never fully goes away.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use an exfoliating wash as it could be too harsh</li>
            <li> but I do wish there were some rubber grips on sides to improve grip as I did drop it a few times.  </li>
            <li> I am physically disabled</li>
            <li> It is an item I use everyday now.</li>
            <li> It also helps to have about 3-5 days of growth so the tweezers actually have something to grasp, which also helps to minimize the amount of hair that gets broken rather than pulled.</li>
            <li> I have used the face brush a few times now</li>
            <li> so I finished up and dried off.  </li>
            <li> I would like to have an optional accessory head that is narrow, maybe pointed for nooks and crannies.  </li>
            <li> I was slightly disappointed and would not recommend this unless you are really quick with it, otherwise you will be in the shower for longer than it would take to just shave your legs.</li>
            <li> The epilator itself is a little painful at first, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Lately, I’ve been using it every other night and will be looking into getting replacement heads for</li>
            <li> When I first used the epilator on my legs it was a bit painful, like the sensation of little needles, but after a while you get used it.  </li>
            <li> When I first used the epilator on my legs it was a bit painful, like the sensation of little needles, but after a while you get used it.  </li>
            <li> I only do a half inch a day TOPS because it&#x27;s so painful, but the hair hasn&#x27;t grown back at all!</li>
            <li> And if it means no more shaving I can take a little pain.</li>
            <li> My husband used it dry on his arm and was surprised how painful it was.  </li>
            <li> For some reason it didn&#x27;t hurt as bad in the shower the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> Using the epilator for the first time hurts extremely bad, but after a while your body should get used to it.</li>
            <li> I am not going to lie, the Braun Silk-epil 7 is a bit painful to use at first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I use the epilator, I get razor bumps on my legs that are not becoming at all.</li>
            <li> After I use the epilator, I get razor bumps on my legs that are not becoming at all.</li>
            <li> Just a few strays and a small amount of fuzzy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I do have dark thick hairs</li>
            <li> I used it for an hour before the charge started to slow down, which seemed to pullthe majority of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have never used an epilator before but had recently researched alternatives to shaving and heard that epilation lasts longer than regular shaving and was not as painful as waxing (which I haven&#x27; tried before).</li>
            <li> I was anxious to see if I could eliminate some ingrown hairs and clogged follicles</li>
            <li> Truthfully, I am not a girly girl and when I looked at it I got intimidated.</li>
            <li> and I just could not get past the pain.  </li>
            <li> So i started out small.</li>
            <li> went back to the Braun pamphlet of directions and tips to see what I did wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a razor shaver</li>
            <li> No more batteries!)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll ever get used to the pain associated with using an epilator.</li>
            <li> All the different parts looked complicated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Results: I hate when I shave and then get goose bumps right after and need to shave again already.</li>
            <li> Also I found that it was less painful if used at the faster speed.&lt;br /&gt;The underarm was another story, although I can say that the results were neat, both first and second epilation were equally painful and it feels sore for</li>
            <li> Much to my disappointment and dismay, a few days after epilating my legs and face, I broke out with red bumps, where some of the hair had been pulled out of the follicle.</li>
            <li> Shaving is a difficult job that I struggle with due to being physically disabled.</li>
            <li> used to do things the hard way but plucking my armpits because whenever I brought a razor to my armpits, it would get irritated no matter what I tried</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t want to scrub too hard.</li>
            <li> I have now used the product 3 times, and it hardly hurts at all now.</li>
            <li> And it hardly removed any hairs, I would have been at it for hours to do just one lower</li>
            <li> and I finally tried the body brush attachment on my legs and what a disappointment it was.  </li>
            <li> For anyone&#x27;s reference, I am bi-racial and my hair is thick and curly.</li>
            <li> I do think trying it in the shower instead of on dry legs was less painful but hurt quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I MEAN</li>
            <li> I got a bit anxious!</li>
            <li> It was far less painful!  </li>
            <li> The epilator is extremely painful and I was not able to sit through an entire shave.</li>
            <li> (I now hear that wet legs are a bit less painful).</li>
            <li> The chin area was very painful and it snatches very hard ( but they are coarse like a mans facial hair).</li>
            <li> your hair follicle pores must be exfoliated prior to epilator use or it could be really painful.</li>
            <li> Personally I didn&#x27;t find it was painful.</li>
            <li> Being multi-ethnic with coarse hair, this is obviously a painful process.</li>
            <li> When I did try on a few seperate occasions my skin became red and it was very painful</li>
            <li> I found the epilator to be painful when dry but</li>
            <li> I have been careful to avoid this after a painful self-waxing attempt...</li>
            <li> so mine may have been worse then others depending on how hairy you are.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t broken me out or caused any irritation</li>
            <li> I was concerned about reddened follicles or bumps, but I have not experienced that in any area.  </li>
            <li> I thought I had a high pain threshold, having had 2 kids without any drugs, but this was insane.  </li>
            <li> for less painful hair remover:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> Beause of hairs growning in differnt cycles each time you epliate it does get easier and less painful.  </li>
            <li> Also I found that it was less painful if used at the faster speed.   </li>
            <li> and I hated how it would grow back thicker.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not safe and very difficult for me to shave in the shower</li>
            <li> I am an early adopter and ruthless researcher of gadgets.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t researched wither or not the replacement brushes are difficult to locate or the cost.  </li>
            <li> That happens often any time I am in a room where the A/C turns on, and sometimes when creepy things happen.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my leg, underarm and found it to be extremely uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I was WRONG.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference at all.  </li>
            <li> so I was a bit skeptical to use this.</li>
            <li> If was quite uncomfortable but tolerable.  </li>
            <li> Regardless of its crazy name, This product worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I must say it was very uncomfortable</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt as bad as I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not as bad as waxing.</li>
            <li> Instead it gave me a really bad razor burn.</li>
            <li> It sounds painful but hear me out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, it is a bit painful.  </li>
            <li> I knew it would be painful</li>
            <li> It was so painful</li>
            <li> Ugly:&lt;br /&gt;Oh, the ugly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I believe I will stick to shaving or waxing the epilator was too painful.</li>
            <li> It was painful, I was not expecting it to feel like that.</li>
            <li> It was a bit painful but not to the point that I wanted to stop.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Yes this stuff is painful !  </li>
            <li> I hated shaving with a razor</li>
            <li> and it was very painful.  </li>
            <li> and yes it was very painful</li>
            <li> but I dont recommend this unless you can handle the pulling that is worst than waxing.</li>
            <li> The epilator was initially shocking to how abrasive it was.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to deal with shaving cream or those horrible nicks and cuts.    </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I thought they&#x27;d have improved this type of product since it first came out a while ago (a few years).  They haven&#x27;t, it still hurts, you won&#x27;t do as well as with shaving your legs, because the pain of using this product is too much.</li>
            <li> I was already used to an epilator, but it was not a wet/dry model like this one. It definitely takes the edge off of the sting when you use it in the shower, but it doesn&#x27;t make any difference to me for the bath vs. dry use. I really love the facial brush add-on, but the body exfoliator is a little underwhelming. The battery life is good - lasting at least 2 full uses for legs. I just wish it would capture shorter stubble and finer hairs. As far as epilators go, I am very happy with this purchase as well as with my previous plug-in Braun.</li>
            <li> Great as I expected. I already had a silk-épil years ago, so I was ready to the pain, if you were used to shave, it hurts at first, but than hair become thin and it&#x27;ll sore always less. I love the facial brush, I use it quite every night for a deep wash and remove my make up.</li>
            <li> I was really nervous to purchase Braun Silk-épil 7 SkinSpa 7-929 Epilator at first, but it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to do things the hard way but plucking my armpits because whenever I brought a razor to my armpits, it would get irritated no matter what I tried and I hated how it would grow back thicker. This was the first epilator I bought and I love it. It cuts my time by sooooo much, I should&#x27;ve bought it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re using this for your legs, be aware, it will hurt at first.  When I used this on my legs for the first time, I thought I was going to cry. When I was done, much like other people said, my skin was irritated and had tiny red bumps. But after a few hours it went away. It sounds painful but hear me out. When you first got your eyebrows done, did it not hurt? Did it not turn red and get bit irritated that you constantly wanted to scratch it? But after the course of a few session, you get used to it even though the pain never fully goes away. I feel like this is a similar concept. After using it a couple times, the pain becomes bearable. Yes, it does take a little more time than you would just shaving your legs, but I feel like if you epilate, the slower your hair grows back. When using it, I found it helpful when you pulled your skin in the same direction you are using your epilator so it tighten the area that is being epilated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is also really good. Just make sure the follow the instructions on how to keep your battery life to its max potential. Never charge it overnight, unplug it as soon as you see that it&#x27;s been fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never had an exfoliating brush so this was also new for me to use, but I love it. After using it, my face feels so clean, fresh and soft to touch. As for the body exfoliating brush, I barely use because I have an exfoliating towel which I find it much faster to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally don&#x27;t like to use the epilator in the shower because it doesn&#x27;t work as well when wet as to when it&#x27;s dry. It seems like it can&#x27;t catch the hair as well when wet, so it takes a few more tries and sometimes awkward angles. Also, when using, make sure to be in an area that can be easily cleaned because will definitely drop most of the hair that is being plucked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this epilator great to have and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had never epillated before and this made me nervous but I got tired of shaving my legs daily to keep them smooth. At first it hurt like hell, but it got easier the more I used it. I had pretty good results until about 9 months into owning it. The epillator was not getting as many hairs as it once was on the first swipe so it took me longer each time I used it. I also noticed there were always spots it did not get. Now after just ten months and $104 I am looking to replace it. I really liked the initial results but for $104 + tax it should have lasted more than ten months!</li>
            <li> Works well just make sure you exfoliate often because ingrown hairs become a big problem.</li>
            <li> I thought this is very great. it hurts but it works fine. the face brush works amazing</li>
            <li> I have been curious about the use of a epilator for many years but I guess shied away out of fear of the pain. I received this item as a bzzagent for review and wow am I so happy I did! I don&#x27;t think I would have ever purchased one out of the fear of the pain but with it given to me I had to try it.  As soon as I receive the package I tore right into it.  It comes with very good directions and some great tips to ease the pain of removal.  The body brush attachment and the face exfoliator are vital for optimal results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips for less painful hair remover:&lt;br /&gt;1. Exfoliate two days prior to using epilator.&lt;br /&gt;2. Shave all area&#x27;s you are planning to epilate. (with different growing rates it eliminates epilating all hairs &#x3D; less pain.&lt;br /&gt;3. Pull skin taunt in area epilating.&lt;br /&gt;4. Push past initial pain as it does ease up if you keep going.&lt;br /&gt;5. Keep going.....push past pain as you will have AMAZING SKIN lol&lt;br /&gt;6. Do not use any toner prior as it closes pores making it more difficult and more painful.&lt;br /&gt;7. Soak in a tub of hot water prior to open pores to make epliating much less painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so lets talk about what it comes with.  Everything all fits into a nice drawstring bag that is provided.  The body exfoliator/hair epilator unit is rechargeable with a charger that is included.  The face exfoliator takes two AA batteries which are included.  The body exfoliator brush comes with a clear plastic cover for storage.  Also included is a small plastic bristled brush to clean exfoliator head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face exfoliator: Operates on two provided AA batteries, has a low and high operating speed.  The brush has a 3 month life before it needs to be replaced.  I haven&#x27;t researched wither or not the replacement brushes are difficult to locate or the cost.  I have the Olay face exfoliator and I like this unit better as the brush head looks and feels like the bristles will have a longer life.  I enjoyed cleaning my face with a gentle face cleaner and a exfoliating wash wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable.  My face comes out squeaky clean everytime. This can be used daily thou I wouldn&#x27;t use an exfoliating wash as it could be too harsh so I use it a few days a week and stick with the gentle wash daily with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body exfoliator attachment:  Operates by clicking it onto the epilator body. The brush bristles suggested replacement time is 12 months.  The bristles and construction look to be of good quality and I believe you would have no problem getting a year out of it before replacing.  I&#x27;m not completely sold on how well it exfoliates the skin as I had to add a exfoliating wash to really feel like I was doing anything and I really struggled keeping in my hand and not slipping out once soap got onto my hand.  There aren&#x27;t any rubber grips on the body.  It does fit nicely into your hand and does stay put but once any soap is put into the equation some difficulty for me. I don&#x27;t recommend you not use it thou as you must absolutely exfoliate your hair follicle pores must be exfoliated prior to epilator use or it could be really painful. I was anxious to see if I could eliminate some ingrown hairs and clogged follicles I get on the back of my arms and my thighs.  I did see them decrease after first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epilator: The body of the epilator is really very pretty as it sparkles, the shape is perfect for fitting into hand but I do wish there were some rubber grips on sides to improve grip as I did drop it a few times.  It works by spinning and when it does these metal things move in and out and a tweazing action occurs which removes the hair, there are many of them all around it. It is very easy to clean and must be cleaned after each use.  It can be used in water or dry.  I preferred the dry as it does grip better and remove quicker.  In the water I felt it slipped and did not remove at same rate. The unit is rechargeable which actually came to full charge within an hour.  I am really impressed with the battery life as since I&#x27;ve had it I did get a full body exfoliation, and two hour long epilator uses before even needing to charge and I believe it would have gone much longer but I didn&#x27;t want to chance it dying in the middle of a epilator session. It also has a light which is very helpful in guiding you to any hairs you may miss.  The light is one of my favorite features! It has two speeds and I used the highest speed for all locations I removed hair from.  I&#x27;m not going to lie, it is a bit painful.  But.......if you just push past the initial pain it fades or you get use to it after about 5 minuters.  I do have dark thick hairs so mine may have been worse then others depending on how hairy you are. Beause of hairs growning in differnt cycles each time you epliate it does get easier and less painful.  I&#x27;m currently at a stage that it doesn&#x27;t even hurt to do it as it&#x27;s only pulling out a few hairs here and there.  I did both legs (feet, legs, thighs), both underarms.  It actually lightens your underarms so if you dislike the 5 oclock shadow look of your underarms you really should epilate there as well.  I also have chin hair and mustache hair from steroid medication and being naturally dark headed.  The chin area was very painful and it snatches very hard ( but they are coarse like a mans facial hair). I&#x27;m blown away by how smooth all my skin is and I&#x27;m really enjoying being hairless lol.  I am physically disabled so it&#x27;s not safe and very difficult for me to shave in the shower so this is a heaven sent for someone like me.  I highly recommend this item if you are physically disabled and struggle shaving.  I&#x27;m enjoying going hair free for a week now.  I will never shave again, I&#x27;m a lifer as far as epliating the hair on by body.  My facial hair I was having to shave daily like a man and I&#x27;m hair free for the 5th day now.  That alone is worth using this or purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I received this from BzzAgent as a free product. This is my 100% honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before we get to the actual Epilator, I want to start off by saying I loved the extra attachments. The face exfolliator alone to me is worth the price of the package. It is an item I use everyday now. I don&#x27;t see much point of the body exfoliator though and it seems somewhat pointless to me. Now, the epilator works great! It does exactly what it is suppose to do and it does get rid of the hair. I will say if this is your first time using an epilator though do it in spurts. What I mean by that is if your not use to it, its going to hurt like he double hocky sticks! It took me a couple of weeks before I got use to it, but once I did I was glad I continued through the pain because I don&#x27;t have to shave hardly at all now. I think this is one of the best Epilator&#x27;s on the market and the Face Exfolliator is by far one of the best I ever used, but the question is how much are you willing to stand for beauty? I hope this will help someone who reads my review and have a great day!</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time lastnight at first I tried the Braun Silk-epil 7 dry did not like it. Then I used it wet much more tolerable. I could tell a big difference and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun epilator.  I was excited to try it out.  I loved the way it was packaged.  Itblooked very nice and brought me even more excitement.  I charged it right away to try it out.  It worked nicely to make my smooth skin.  I love the fact that I don&#x27;t need to shave every day with this as wiea typical razor however it is slightly painful to use.  I guess you bee to weigh out the pain versus shaving daily to decide if the product is a good fit for you.</li>
            <li> I love the new Braun silk-epil 7-929 emulator I was so happy when I gif it from bzzagent to try out its awesome I love how you get battery and a charger with it it works so well I have tried it on my arms face legs it is just so cool and it works really well really gets the hair off if you have never tried it I would give it a try you will be very happy with it I also love how fast it is and thanks I&#x27;m really happy with this and I&#x27;m so glad I got to try it out</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of waxing, as I am not into self-torture.  However, the lack of hot wax interested me.  I got this product, and I won&#x27;t lie, at first, it hurt like the dickens.  But, I was determined. So after doing all I could one night, I moisturized as suggested, went to bed, and went at it again the next night.  I was genuinely surprised at how much it didn&#x27;t hurt the next day.  That&#x27;s not to say it didn&#x27;t hurt at all, just that the pain was far less than the first night.  I have a big problem with getting prickly legs just as soon as I get goose bumps.  That happens often any time I am in a room where the A/C turns on, and sometimes when creepy things happen.  So far, (I&#x27;ve only been using it a week or so) I haven&#x27;t noticed this problem go away, which is why it only gets 4 stars right now.  The convenience of being able to remove hair in or out of the shower is very appealing to me.  My fiance says it&#x27;s loud, so I just walk into the other room, go at it for 20 minutes or so, and return when I&#x27;m done.  It&#x27;s started to become a routine that I can handle.  My skin is extremely sensitive, and I can only use shaving creams meant for sensitive skin, and not even all of those.  This eliminates that problem.  I did have some serious reddening, as they warn, but it was mostly gone the next day.  And with the way it works, even when I get a few hairs popping up, they&#x27;re hard to notice, so I&#x27;m the only one that knows they&#x27;re there.  I&#x27;m still catching all the little light blonde ones that are trying to hide, but I&#x27;ll get &#x27;em.  As I&#x27;ve said, I&#x27;m determined.  I highly recommend this epilator.  And, it came with an extra attachment that feels nice against the skin I just ripped hair from, and a separate micro-dermabrasion (I think?) brush just for my face.  I had never used one before, but it&#x27;s like a tiny massage for your face that leaves the skin baby smooth.  I&#x27;m a happy customer!</li>
            <li> I was afraid to try the epilator at first. I knew it would be painful and I have sensitive skin. But like the instructions said use the exfoliator a few times first. And I did. It was still painful during and a little while after, but it gets better every time. And if it means no more shaving I can take a little pain. The exfoliator for the face and body are amazing. When I use the large one on my body it makes my skin so soft, like unbelievable soft. And I used the small one on my face same thing, super soft skin. And even after the first time using it I could tell that it was doing a deep cleaning on my face. Less black heads, clearer skin I really like how it makes my skin look and feel. It&#x27;s a good size for both not too big not too small. Both are easy to handle. The epilator even has a light on it which makes it a little more helpful! Overall great product, loving the results. Thanks Braun for sending me this great product to try. My skin thanks you and so does my boyfriend for the super soft legs!</li>
            <li> First time using this!! Love the facial brushes. Felt like a min facial. Hair removal on the legs was very painful dry, but much better in the shower wet. Would definitely buy this product. Save money on waxing!</li>
            <li> The epilation part of this hurts more than waxing. The rest of the exfoliating products I liked but I dont recommend this unless you can handle the pulling that is worst than waxing.</li>
            <li> I was given the Braun Epil 7 929 hair remover to try from Braun; my overall opinion is that it may not be the right hair removal tool for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using the Epil on my legs, I have very coarse hair and it didn’t seem to remove all of the hair even if I ran over areas several times.  It wasn’t worth the pain of going over the same area several times to still not have all of the hair gone.  I tried it with the hair growth being at several different lengths and nothing seemed to work for the better on my lower legs with the thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn’t all a complete bust, I did have more luck with areas that had finer hair such as my upper legs.  This may be a great hair removal tool for someone with finer hair.  The concept is pretty awesome if it works for your hair type, I liked that it could be used on wet or dry skin and that it also came with a face cleaner as bonus.</li>
            <li> I got to try this curtesy of BzzAgent for testing and review purposes. Truthfully, I am not a girly girl and when I looked at it I got intimidated. It took me a while to read the directions because I didn&#x27;t want to mess things up. I do have to warn you that it is uncomfortable and you won&#x27;t be able to use it through a single use unless you have an extremely high tolerance for pain (which I  thought I had). The facial brush was my favorite! My face is super smooth and brighter! The exfoliation brush also did wonders to my skin. This would be perfect for ANY female, including the most non feminine woman you know.</li>
            <li> BzzAgent gave me the opportunity to try this product. This was the first time I used a epilator. It was so painful and it did not seem to remove the hair unless I went over the same area a few times. I did love how soft and clean my face felt after using the facial cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS ITEM I MEAN REALLY LOVE IT FOR THE FEATURE OF IT BEING A FACIAL BRUSH AND ALSO, BODY SHAVER AND I APPRECIATE BZZAGENT SENDING THIS ITEM</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received the Braun Silk-epil 7 SkinSpa from BzzAgent.  I love using new and different skin products.  After I received my package I thoroughly read the directions.  I was impressed that there were batteries and a charger included.  I then tried the epilator......now as noted in the directions, epilation can cause discomfort.  I used it on my leg, underarm and found it to be extremely uncomfortable.  I used it wet in the shower and I just could not get past the pain.  It felt like needles were poking my skin.  My husband used it dry on his arm and was surprised how painful it was.  Now I understand that beauty is pain and I have been waxed/plucked plenty of times before.  I also have a high tolerance for pain so I am determined to keep trying the epilator.  The product also comes with an body exfoliation attachment for the epilation unit and a separate face exfoliator (batter operated).  I have to say that I absolutely love both exfoliators.  I have used both just with water and then both with a face/body scrub.  It left my face and body feeling so smooth and clean!  I am super impressed.  So overall the epilation was painful-understandably because it is removing hair, and the exfoliating was awesome!</li>
            <li> First of all, I have never heard of an epilator. I have read that it is more popular in Europe than America. Very happy that I discovered it though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the face exfoliating brush! It has two speeds, though I mostly use the faster speed. The brush bristles are longer, so the brush reaches even the crevices in my nose.  The bristle end pops off easily for cleaning, but stays on well while you are using it. I noticed a difference in how clean and bright my skin felt and appeared after one use. My husband even tried it out and loved it! Not sure if I&#x27;m willing to share! I think it would be wonderful if it came with multiple brushes. We have only been using it for a week, and I have noticed a big difference in my husbands skin (he is acne prone and has very oily skin). His skin is less oily during the day and brighter. 5 stars for the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epilator exfoliating brush is ok. The brush is a little too gentle. I used an exfoliating scrub and the brush together and it works great! Exfoliating is very important when epilating from the research I have done. The epilator works like a tweezer, pulling out the hairs. When those hairs grow back, they can become trapped under dead skin and cause ingrown hairs. Therefore, before you epilate, exfoliate. They even rhyme lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the epilator, I love it! Everyone complains about how much it hurts the first time you use it, but I discovered a trick to lessing the pain. I shaved first, making sure I shaved with the hair and then against it to cut back on irritation and to get a closer shave. Then, over the next week I used to the epilator every night before going to bed. Your hair grows back at different paces, so instead of shaving all the hair at once, the hair is removed a little at a time as it grows. The area around with less muscle hurts more, but just like tweezing your eyebrows, you get used to it and it just burns a little. I wish the epilator was better at getting around hard areas like the knees. I have heard some people take off the comfort head piece, but I like the spinning piece on each side of the epilator itself. Oh, make sure you stretch the skin as you epilate, the hairs are easier to pull out. The epilator also has two speeds. I have used both speeds, but I prefer the fast speed because I have course, dark hair and the fast speed pulls out quicker and faster, so it hurts less. There is also a light on the epilator that is amazing! You can watch tv in a darker room and still see any hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: I hate when I shave and then get goose bumps right after and need to shave again already. Now, I can get goose bumps all I want and it doesn&#x27;t make a difference! I have sensitive skin. The first time my skin was pretty red, but I put aloe vera for sunburn, and by morning any bumps or redness was gone. After only three uses, I don&#x27;t get any redness at all and my skin feels so smooth! I have also noticed my hairs, when I did let it grow back is lighter and softer, so using the epilator barely stings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Routine:&lt;br /&gt;shower, exfoliate&lt;br /&gt;epilate&lt;br /&gt;apply aloe vera/lotion&lt;br /&gt;sleep&lt;br /&gt;wake up to soft smooth skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Face Exfoliator&lt;br /&gt;Body Exfoliator&lt;br /&gt;Fast speed on epilator&lt;br /&gt;comfort head on epilator&lt;br /&gt;durability (can last 3-5years)&lt;br /&gt;light&lt;br /&gt;amazing results&lt;br /&gt;no more razors!&lt;br /&gt;can be used wet or dry&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t get any struggling to pull out hairs by epilator&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Have to use scrub with exfoliator brush&lt;br /&gt;No shaving head comes with it like other sets for areas you don&#x27;t want to epilate&lt;br /&gt;Some redness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I loved this product. I got the Braun Epilator free from Braun.  It worked well. It does take a little bit of time to get used to using if you have never used an epilator before, just give it time and you&#x27;ll come to love this product as well. The exfoliating brushes were a plus! All in all, I completely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome epilator! I love that it can be used wet or dry. Personally I didn&#x27;t find it was painful. I do wish I would have bought the set with all the different tips/attachments. I assumed this set came with them. I saw &amp;#34;the free gift (facial brush) and thought it was a bonus in addition to all the different tips. I was WRONG. I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN MUCH MORE USE out of the set that includes all the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must include this minor detail... It&#x27;s very pretty! I&#x27;ve attached a photo.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying that I have very sensitive skin so I use a lot of caution with any products. The Braun® Silk-epil 7 SkinSpa Beauty Edition is more than I was expecting it to be and initially I was a little skeptical because of discomfort concerns.   The design of the base fits perfect in your hand, it is easy to take apart and clean, and does not slip while using it in the shower. This was definitely much more comfortable than pulling wax strips and unlike wax, there are no areas that are missed! There&#x27;s a slight pinch feeling when epilating, but that faded as my skin seemed to adjust. I monitored closely how my skin would react and there have been zero problems within the last 8 hours since I tried it. There was slight redness, but no discomfort. The facial brush was gentle and made my skin feel renewed without having to use any chemicals or creams. The exfoliating brush was invigorating while making my skin feel smoother. For anyone who has sensitive skin, consider throwing away the razors and chemicals! I would recommend giving this system a try. I have had excellent experiences in the past with Braun. I also received a free product from Braun for submitting my review.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this from BzzAgent to review. I absolutely LOVE it! The face exfoliating brush is something I&#x27;ve always wanted and it&#x27;s great! It has two speeds which is good, and it makes my face SO soft and it feels refreshed afterwards. The body exfoliator is good as well, a little harsh, but thats what an exfoliator is! The epilator itself is a little painful at first, but you get used to it. The packaging was also so organized! Everything about this was perfect!!</li>
            <li> I love this product I received it from bzzagent... facial brush is awesome... I hated shaving with a razor this is so easy to use, easy to clean. Love the epilator doesnt miss any spots love the feeling of being hairless total bonus!!!</li>
            <li> I recieved Braun Epilator free from Braun to review....So i started out small. I did my upper lip, which is a very sensitive area, which i usually get waxed. At first i was like oh ouch, but it did get better. I did it in the evening as suggested because i knew i would be red after. I applied some moisturizer and went to bed. The next morning my lip was smooth, hairless and free from redness or bumps. PERFECT. I will work on the rest of my needed areas (underarms and arms are next) as i get the nerve to endure the sensation.  Overall so far this product has preformed exceptional and I would recommend this to all skin types and hair coarseness.  Read the direction before you start, they are very detailed and they will save you some trouble.</li>
            <li> I received this product from Braun through a company called BzzAgent to give it an honest review. Ready? Ok!!&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Silk-epil 7-929 is a very interesting product, before I entered the campaign to test this out I had never heard of an epilator. It sounded like some sort of machine they would use in a hospital. Regardless of its crazy name, This product worked wonders for me. It definitely hurts like heck at first, but about 2 minutes into it I got used to the discomfort and was able to breeze through the rest of the process. Before using it I shaved the week before to ensure all the hairs were the same length, honestly I didn&#x27;t have to because it even pulled the baby hairs out. Cool huh? 3 1/2 Week later STILL NO HAIR!! I would not have bought this product 2 months ago, but now that I have tried it I definitely will not be going back to my razor. Hope this product works for you as well!</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I received the Braun Epil 7 929 SkinSpa Beauty Epilator. I have been dealing with ingrown leg hair and haven&#x27;t found anything to get rid of it. This epilator is just what I needed! When my package came I started reading the instructions right away since I am a first time epilator user. I let the machine charge while I used the facial brush. I LOVE the way my face feels after using it and it is now a must in my cleaning routine. Once the epilator was completely charged I used it on dry skin and went to work on my lower legs. I must say it was very uncomfortable but I managed to get both lower legs finished. I love that there is a light to help see every hair. The next day I used the exfoliating brush head and loved that as well. After a few uses the ingrown hair on my legs has diminished significantly.  If it wasn&#x27;t for the pain of using the epilator the first few times I would give 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I received this epilator from Braun and am very happy to have it.  I&#x27;ve been using an epilator for years and jumped at the chance to upgrade!  This model works a lot nicer than my old one.  The light feature is really nice and makes it really easy to see exactly what I&#x27;m doing and where I need to go!  The discomfort is really minimal.  I do feel some discomfort initially, but once I get going with it, it becomes less and less and is more than tolerable.  While I enjoy that this bundle comes with many extras, I am pretty simple when it comes to my wants and needs.  I just want to have smooth legs and this product does that and more!  I am very pleased with it and would recommend it to anyone wanting a good quality epilator.  I love that I don&#x27;t have to use it very often and the results last for weeks for me.  The epilator is also cordless, which is super convenient.  The charge holds for more than enough time to do both my legs.  The only reason I am not giving this review a five star rating is that while the epilator leaves me legs mainly hair free, they are not as smooth as compared to shaving.  I still love the convenience and the lasting result and will continue to epilate my legs.</li>
            <li> The last time I tried an epilator was years ago, during the early Epilady days.  Although I loved the idea of no more shaving, it just wasn’t effective at removing my leg hair. Whatever it lacked in the removal process, it sure made up for in the pain department.  Now all of these years later, an invite to try the Braun Silk•épil 7  SkinSpa Beauty Edition kit, which includes an epilator, exfoliating body brush and a separate device with an exfoliating facial brush, fell into my lap (okay…more like my inbox). Shaving is a difficult job that I struggle with due to being physically disabled. I’ve always had to shave every 2 – 3 days or I can’t sleep with myself.  My hair grows so fast, and the stubble is like trying to sleep with a porcupine. Trying to stand on one leg while shaving has definitely gotten harder and more dangerous for me, so six weeks ago I committed to using these products in order to provide a customer review. Here are my results….the good, the blah, and even the ugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening my box and studying all the goodies, the Braun products look and feel like quality...just what I would expect from the Braun name. After reading through the directions and tips and checking out the items functions (it has a low and high setting, or as the pamphlet says “gentle or efficient speed”), I charged the epilator and gave it a try. From the boxed directions and reviews I read online, I know that you can use the unit wet in the shower or dry, so I decided to go with dry. I used it first on my legs and yes… the epilator definitely hurt (more like stung…but a lot!). The pain does get better as you get used to it, and now feeling a little discomfort lets me know that it’s working! This model has a light to see the hair as you go, which I found so useful. I definitely would not be able to see the hairs that I had missed without the light. I used it for an hour before the charge started to slow down, which seemed to pullthe majority of my hair. I charged it back up, which only took about an hour, and finished the spots that I had missed the first time. I also tried the epilator on my face, as I have more hair on my lip and chin than I’m comfortable with, due to medications I have to take. I also used it on my underarms. The pain while using it on my face and underarms was much more painful than my legs, which I expected from the reviews I had read. Some reviews suggested using the epilator in the shower or on the low setting to decrease the pain, but I just went with it on high. At this point, which was two days using the epilator, I was completely satisfied. My legs were hair-free, they were smooth, and I was so excited at the thought that I wouldn’t have to shave again for a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another item on my good list is the Facial cleansing brush. This is a separate device that operates on two AA batteries, is water-resistant and can be used in the shower. It has a soft, rotating brush for the face and has a low and high setting. My face regimen had always using a washcloth with moisturizing soap, which seemed to clean my face just fine (I always get compliments on how young I look). My opinion has changed, and I’m now sold on this cleansing brush.  I do think it cleans my face better, and my skin seems brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Blah:&lt;br /&gt;Out of the three products that came in this SkinSpa set, the Body exfoliation brush was a dud for me. I already use a body exfoliation puff in the shower, which works just as well and is much faster (covers more area in less time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ugly:&lt;br /&gt;Oh, the ugly. Much to my disappointment and dismay, a few days after epilating my legs and face, I broke out with red bumps, where some of the hair had been pulled out of the follicle. On my face, it looked like a breakout of pimples would.  On my legs, it looked like an infected hair with a pustule, but on a much bigger scale (much more area).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to the Braun pamphlet of directions and tips to see what I did wrong. This is an excerpt from the Braun information that I found helpful:&lt;br /&gt;  “All methods of hair removal at the root can lead to in-growing hair and irritation (e.g. itching, discomfort and reddening of the skin) depending on the condition of the skin and hair. This is a normal reaction and should quickly disappear, but may be stronger when you are removing hair at the root for the first few times or if you have sensitive skin. If, after 36 hours, the skin still shows irritation, we recommend that you contact your physician. In general, the skin reaction and the sensation of pain tend to diminish considerably with the repeated use of Silk•épil. In some cases inflammation of the skin could occur when bacteria penetrate the skin (e.g. when sliding the appliance over the skin). Thorough cleaning of the epilation head before each use will minimize the risk of infection.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so I needed more information to figure out how to move forward with this issue. I searched on the internet, and finally found someone who had a similar reaction. Here is his review on Amazon, which helped me considerably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;38 of 50 people found the following review helpful&lt;br /&gt;5.0 out of 5 stars Great improvement., November 2, 2012 By Matt&lt;br /&gt;Braun SE7681 Silk-épil 7 Wet and Dry Epilator, White (Health and Beauty)&lt;br /&gt;  “To use this without getting ingrown hairs, you HAVE to exfoliate. I use a pumice stone, and immediately after epilation, use an anti-microbial soap (Dial for example) to prevent staph infections of the hair follicles. Staph is all over your skin, and given the opportunity, will infect your hair follicles and cause something similar to razor bumps, though razor bumps are often cause by sharp hair pressing into the side of the follicle as well as staph. So I scrub my skin with Dial and the pumice stone so the exfoliation action lets the soap reach a little further into the follicle where it can kill any microbial agents. After waiting for a minute or two without washing of the soap, I rinse and use a moisturizing body wash to replace some of the moisture drawn out by the soap. It keeps me from having problems when the hair grows back. It also helps to have about 3-5 days of growth so the tweezers actually have something to grasp, which also helps to minimize the amount of hair that gets broken rather than pulled. The result is, minus a few stragglers, perfectly smooth legs for about two weeks (depending on how fast your hair grows of course). When the hair is long enough to start showing again, it looks like the growth is thinner, but it&#x27;s really just that your hair is regrowing with a tapered point as it naturally does and not a sharp, thick end that shaving causes, so even regrowth feels smoother than it does when you shave.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I obviously had some kind of a reaction/infection because of bacteria either on my skin, or that got into the follicle when I first epilated. So I went into fix-it mode. I cleaned the blade and plastic parts that touch the skin in 91% rubbing alcohol to kill any bacteria on the exfoliator. I scrubbed my legs with Dial soap. I dabbed rubbing alcohol on the spots to clear them up. I used a polysporin antibiotic ointment on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving forward since, I’ve tried other methods with the epilator in order to better my outcome. I still love the dream of not having to shave every few days, so haven’t wanted to give up on this without giving it time. So I use an exfoliating bath puff on my legs every day, when before I only did before I shaved. I did try the above recommendation of using a pumice stone, but found that it actually caused more hair breakage, which led to even more ingrown hairs. Using a medium bristle foot brush works better to exfoliate the skin on my legs, and I use it with Dial soap daily. I still have issues with inflamed follicles as the hair grows back and becomes ingrown, which Ihave more of now than I did before with shaving. I’ve tried shaving while trying to get my legs to heal, but that hasn’t worked either since my skin has bumps all over. My legs haven’t been smooth since the first few days after epilating for the first time, and they have scars, but they are healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try epilating the hair on my face again.  Since using the facial brush to exfoliate, it has cut down a lot on the bumps that I broke out with the first time.  I hope that my efforts allow me to work through the issues that I’ve had, and that I find the success that most others do with this epilator.  I do think it’s worth it!</li>
            <li> I recieved this product through BzzAgent and was very excited to try it out. The epilator is extremely painful and I was not able to sit through an entire shave. I will use the facial brush and body exfoliater both worked well and left my skin very clean and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I believe I will stick to shaving or waxing the epilator was too painful.</li>
            <li> First things first: Understand that the epilator is going to be a painful experience the first three or four times. For anyone&#x27;s reference, I am bi-racial and my hair is thick and curly. I tried to use it on my armpits the first day and I couldn&#x27;t even finish the job...it hurt too much! However, the second day way more bearable and I was able to get 90% of the hair off before the pain was too much. I plan to use it again tomorrow, and I know that it&#x27;s going to hurt even less. Keep in mind that this is normal, and the instructions clearly state that continued use diminishes the pain. I&#x27;ve even used it on my stomach and legs. It hurts a little less in those areas! Make sure that you keep the hairs SHORT. You don&#x27;t need to bruise from the pulling and also tangling the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin brush is pleasant and relaxing! I don&#x27;t have much need for the facial cleanser, but it&#x27;s great for after a workout when you KNOW that there&#x27;s sweat on your hairline and you don&#x27;t want to scrub too hard. All in all, interesting product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE* 8/22/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I used the epilator every day in the shower initially, and eventually got rid of all underarm and leg hair. The leg hair took longer, and I think it&#x27;s because wet hairs stick to the leg and aren&#x27;t caught by the epilator&#x27;s tweezers. I can feel hair starting to grow back, but I&#x27;m going to wait for another couple of days before using the epilator again. I want to give the hair time to get long enough to catch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also started using it on my bikini area. Being multi-ethnic with coarse hair, this is obviously a painful process. For all ladies and gents out there wanting to use the epilator on your nether regions, make sure your hairs are trimmed shorter! Otherwise you&#x27;ll clog the device and bruise your skin. I have been careful to avoid this after a painful self-waxing attempt...&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, the device is great on the bikini area! I only do a half inch a day TOPS because it&#x27;s so painful, but the hair hasn&#x27;t grown back at all! I am being careful to stay near the edges of my bikini line and NOT go too \\&quot;far down\\&quot;, if you know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The High Density Facial Brush is rather a disappointment. My skin needs a heavier exfoliant, so I often feel as though my face is still not clean after I use it. Perhaps I should be using the Exfoliation Brush first on my face and THEN the Facial Brush. More updates to come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*update* 10/1/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that I have had to follow this pattern:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Use epilator for 2-3 days in a row dry or wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Wait for the hair to grow back a little bit and exfoliate heavily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Shave rather than epilate one time until hair grows back, then repeat process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I use the epilator, I get razor bumps on my legs that are not becoming at all. My legs are not smooth, and I have to constantly exfoliate in the shower to get rid of the bumps (not that it helps much). Shaving in between gets rid of the bumps, however, and then I can keep trying to get rid of the hair with the epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I assume that I will not have to use this thing after a year because my hair will simply never grow back. I guess that&#x27;s a good thing, but I&#x27;m not sure if using an epilator is better than simply shaving. Shaving makes me legs feel smoother and it is painless. I&#x27;ll keep using the epilator on my bikini area, but I&#x27;m not giving up shaving my legs and armpits.l!

            <li> I received this kit from Braun for a free trial. It is awesome.  It&#x27;s very easy to switch to the different attachments and you get everything you need for a beauty routine in one kit. I&#x27;m usually a razor shaver but this makes me want to continue to maintain using epilation. I didn&#x27;t realize at first that it&#x27;s best for shorter hair but even though mine was a little longer than what&#x27;s ideal ,it wasn&#x27;t painful. The last time I used it was about two weeks ago and the areas I used it on are still \\&quot;clean\\&quot;.  The facial and exfoliating brushes are also awesome. I have very sensitive skin and have not been able to use facial brushes in the past but this one is extremely soft and I can control the speed so I&#x27;ve been using it on my face and neck. The exfoliating brush feels really good like you&#x27;re gently scrubbing and getting a little massage. I would recommend this kit.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Braun &amp; BzzAgent, I was able to try this product. I really love the exfoliator brushes for both the face and the body. The epilator was initially shocking to how abrasive it was. Once I got used to it, it was tolerable. I would most closely compare it to getting a tattoo over a bigger area of skin. It did leave my skin a bit irritated for quite a few hours after going over my legs, but the hair it removed was astonishing. I am not someone who gets waxed, so for me, I would more than likely just shave than use the epilator unless I was preparing for a beach vacation where I didn&#x27;t want to shave everyday. Otherwise, I think I will mostly be using the exfoliators.</li>
            <li> Wow to be able to not shave for a few days is a nice feeling instead of feeling like you have to shave everyday. That is how I feel about the Braun silk -epil 7 skin spa.  I like that you can use it wet or dry.  I prefer using it with water.  I love the smooth feeling it leaves for days. I also  like the different heads that comes with it. I love how you can can rid of dead skin before you shave.  The only I didn&#x27;t like at first was how it hurt at first but after several uses it felt better.  The light that is available it&#x27;s nice to help you see if you missed any spots. Thanks so much Braun for giving me the Braun-epil to try for Free. Thanks again for the awesome product to try.</li>
            <li> I tried out Braun&#x27;s Epil 7-929 Skinspa Beauty Epilator and I made sure to read all of the instructions before using which included how to use the product and what you’re supposed to do with the epilator along with the face exfoliate brush. It also mentions to charge the product before using it (yes, it comes with a charger! No more batteries!)&lt;br /&gt;As I started to use it on my skin, first the inside of my arm to see how it would feel; it ended up feeling like a HUGE burning sensation. As a girl and as a girl who goes through pain in order to look pretty i was ready for the pain but it hurt a lot more than i expected. (Maybe more so than waxing). I then proceeded to try it on my armpits and the pain was severe. I think i have a pretty good pain tolerance but this felt like someone was taking a knife and scalping my armpit! I was SO excited to use this product and now i feel like i can’t because of how high the pain is. I was really glad that i got it free (complements to BzzAgent) instead of putting out $80 or so to buy something i wouldn&#x27;t use. I am still going to try it on my legs but i doubt i will want to continue after using it. The instructions say that after using it multiple times the pain will greatly reduce but i can’t even hardly use it once in order to hopefully make the pain reduce next time. Also i was looking forward to having it done on my bikini line but i would NOT recommend it at all! I will continue to use the brushes that it comes with, but most likely i will not use the epilator. The brushes on the other hand are wonderful and i enjoyed them very much! In my opinion, just buy the brush if you don&#x27;t have a high pain tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Comes with a long corded charger so you don’t have to waist money on batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Comes with 2 batteries for the Skinspa&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Comes with a pouch to put it all in&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Charges fast&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Light Weight&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Cute in appearance&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Comes with small brush to clean epilator&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Comes with 2 face brushes&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Built in light to see what you’re doing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Painful to use&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Loud</li>
            <li> Thanks to Braun I got to try the silk-epil. This was a new experience for me because I never even heard of a epilator. It was painful, I was not expecting it to feel like that. I did like how it left my skin afterwards. My advice to anyone trying it for the first time, shave your legs first like it tell you in the manual and then when your hair is starting to grow back in use the epil. There may be some irritation so use some kind of calming cream and use at night so if you do have any irritation it will be gone in the morning. I really enjoyed the extra pieces like the exfoliating face brush and the one for the body. Overall I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I understand everyone&#x27;s anguish with the pain that goes along with hair removal but ladies we all know the old saying &amp;#34; Beauty is Pain! When my Braun Skin Spa arrived in the mail I was so excited to try the new product due to the fact that it was a gift straight from Bzz Agent however once I unpackaged it I got a bit anxious! I read the directions cover to cover and the word pain was mentioned a few more times than I thought was necessary. Before you try it out be sure to charge your new elipilater for one hour. It&#x27;s small, compact, and very simple to operate. Also it&#x27;s a beautiful glittery white. It seemed to work great on my legs but listen listen listen use it with water to help with the pain. I haven&#x27;t used it on other areas of my body nor have I tried the other pieces in the kit but I certainly intend on doing so in the coming week so watch for my next review.  Jamie C in TN.</li>
            <li> I never used an epilator before receiving this product from Braun...what an amazing surprise. It is painful at first but well worth it since your legs are silky smooth afterwards. The exfoliating brush attachments are amazing as well....they left my skin feeling smooth and clean. I would recommend this product...it charges fast, you can use it in the shower too and works great.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Braun and and being a member of BzzAgent, I received this product in the mail try out. I have been using another epilator of a different brand for about a year now, so I was not that nervous to begin using this one. I was actually really excited to see how much faster I could epilate my legs since this epilator has a light on it. I used the buffer it comes with first to remove any dead skin cells, then began to remove the hairs from my leg using the epilator. I was pleasantly surprised to not feel as much pulling as I do with my other epilator, and how well the light works. When I was finished both legs, they felt very smooth but were quite irritated. They had red bumps all over, which is normal; however, the redness was slightly more intense than usual. That being said, I just applied some aloe vera and my legs were smooth and completely clear the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I got great results the first time, I decided to try using it in the shower, which I have never done before with any epilator. This can be used wet and dry, so I figured why not. I was slightly disappointed and would not recommend this unless you are really quick with it, otherwise you will be in the shower for longer than it would take to just shave your legs. The results were not as great, so I finished outside of the shower. Others may have different experiences and it&#x27;s possible I wasn&#x27;t using it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a really great epilator and I will be using it in place of my other epilator. It may sting a little but it definitely beats shaving every other day. I also wanted to mention that I used to wax, but that was such a pain because I could not always remove all the hairs and I had to wait for the hairs to grow pretty long in order to wax them. With an epilator, you can use it when the hairs are very short, which means you won&#x27;t have to go too many days having stubbly legs! I love that it comes with a buffer and a cleansing face brush. I have used the face brush a few times now (I only use it 1-2 times a week) and I am really happy with the results. It hasn&#x27;t broken me out or caused any irritation (my skin is very sensitive and acne prone).</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, although it is a little painful, one gets used to it. Def recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try the Braun silk epil 7 929 skin spa for free from Braun. When I first got it it looked so exciting. I didn&#x27;t realize that it wasn&#x27;t a razor until I started reading the directions! The exfoliating attachment and the facial brush are AMAZING and I love the way my skin feels after using them. I also love the fact that you can use them wet or dry and it comes with a wall charger.&lt;br /&gt; I had never heard of an epilater before or seen anything like it. I am however a baby when it comes to pain and couldn&#x27;t take the pain. When I did try on a few seperate occasions my skin became red and it was very painful but my hair on my legs remained the same. I do think trying it in the shower instead of on dry legs was less painful but hurt quite a bit. I know most people can tolerate pain to an extent and say pain is beauty so for most people I think the pain would&#x27;ve worth it.&lt;br /&gt;  I really appreciate the opportunity to try this product and will continue to use the exfoliter attachment and the facial brush.</li>
            <li> I am not going to lie, the Braun Silk-epil 7 is a bit painful to use at first. However, once I started using it in the shower it got better and less painful with each use, but hey when you get it for FREE through being a Bzzagent, you can&#x27;t complain. Www.bzzagent.com   [[ASIN:B0077PLNNE Braun SE7681 Silk-épil 7 Wet and Dry Epilator, White]]    I decided that I would do a bit of an experiment. I used the Silk-epil on my left leg and just a regular razor on my right leg. My first use, I used it dry. I think that was a mistake and it made it more painful then needed. I noticed that the epilator did not get all of the hair, it was really good at getting the dark thick hair but was not that great at getting the light fuzzy sort of hair. It could have been that I was not applying enough pressure because of the pain. As always the razor got all of the hair.    With the second use I noticing that it was more effective at getting both types of hair, thick and fuzzy, and it was a lot less painful and I used it in the shower. The light feature makes it really easy to see the hair. I also used the exfoliating brush attachment and I think that it could become very addicting. It is great at getting rid of gross dead skin.    As the week went on I noticed a big difference in the hair growth on the right and left. The right leg that I had used the razor on was needing to be shaved again after just a few days, but the left was still holding strong.  Now after 3 weeks of use I am only using it about 1 time a week and there is not much hair left. Just a few strays and a small amount of fuzzy&#x27;s. The right leg is still having to be shaved every other day. :(  Needless to say, I really love the Braun Silk-epil 7. It is a pretty amazing machine and I am so excited to keep using it to see just how little I need to worry about my leg hair.  who knows I may just start trying it</li>
            <li> Received this specifically for review purposes. I have never really had luck with alternative hair removal methods and I have never had any luck.&lt;br /&gt;I tried using this both wet and dry. I must say I greatly prefer it dry, it doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt nearly as much as it did while wet.&lt;br /&gt;It does take several rounds to get enough hair removed to make me even kinda happy.  But it does work.</li>
            <li> I would like to begin by saying that I was lucky enough to receive this product for free as a Bzz Agent campaign; to try it out and give some critical feedback.  This is a wonderful product, and this comes from a first time user of an epilator! I must admit, I was VERY nervous about trying this product out, however, once I read through the manual, I felt confident enough to give it a go. One thing I love about the epilator itself is that it is easy to hold in the hand, and sits comfortably. The first use was a little painful, as it stung a bit when pulling out the hairs, but, I did use the tips provided, such as using water and stretching the skin as I went. That helped, although there was still a bit of discomfort. I have now used the product 3 times, and it hardly hurts at all now. I think it is simply a matter of getting used to it. AND, the epilator has 2 speeds; I tend to use the higher speed as it seems to work the best for my hair type (dark, coarse hair). It hurts less and goes a bit faster. The facial brush/exfoliator is also pretty cool; I had never used anything like that on my face before, but I really love it! My skin on my face feels much less tight now, and softer as well. I would definitely recommend this kit to any lady; including friends and family.</li>
            <li> Having never seen or heard of an epilator I had no idea what to expect. What I did not expect when i received the product to try free from bzzagent was the eye-tearing pain that ensued when i used this product. I have read that the pain gets easier to handle over time but I&#x27;m not sure that it is something that I am willing to subject myself to again.    I do however like the exfoliators that came with the product. It left myskin feeling so soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I received my Braun silk epilepsy 7 and tried it right away, took a bit to get use to but I really like this product and did recommend it to friends, hurt at first, does what it says and I love the facial brush.where I work it&#x27;s hot so I sweat a lot have noticed a difference in skin have been using 2 weeks now</li>
            <li> I WANTED to be able to use this product. In fact, when Braun offered the chance to review the product, I immediately signed up. An older razor had recently given up the ghost, and I needed something new to keep my legs silky smooth. I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve really tried. I tried three different times, after three different types of preparation (hot shower, long bath, longer bath), and this still HURTS.  It hurts like tiny hot needles poking at my legs. It hurts like dry shaving, even when I&#x27;ve had a hot bath to open my pores AND am using a shave lotion. After reading other reviews, I may try again after investing in an anesthetic cream...or I may go back to an electric razor.  If you are more used to the pain or more willing to get used to it, this seems like a highly functional tool.    Overall, the Braun Epil 7 929 SkinSpa Beauty Epilator is very pretty. It fits well in my hand. I had a bit of trouble getting the batteries into the separate exfoliater (the battery case is challenging to open and then close again), but the products seems well constructed.  The epilator is not too loud, and I would very much like for it to work - I&#x27;ll keep trying!</li>
            <li> I had actually received the Braun Epil Skinspa Beauty Epilator a few weeks ago. But I wanted to off reviewing it until I got the chance to use everything a couple times.  Right out of the box though, I was impressed.  It was sleek, stylish, looked very well made, and included a body brush attachment and facial brush that I hadn’t expected.&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited about the facial brush since I had been looking into getting one, so that was the first thing I tried.  The brush was soft enough to not irritate my skin, but I seen a huge difference in how much more of my makeup got removed.  Lately, I’ve been using it every other night and will be looking into getting replacement heads for it.&lt;br /&gt;The next thing I tried out was the epilator itself and let me just say that the experience is definitely not for everyone.  It hurts like no tomorrow the first little bit that gets done, but it’s more manageable after that since you know what’s coming.  Now, even though I said that, I couldn’t bring myself to do anything more than my lower legs and that was always on the lowest speed since the second speed hurt too much for my liking.  One of the cool things about this epilator was that it had a bright light on it that made it easier to see if anything got missed (wish my razor had one!).  I don’t use the epilator very much because of the pain, but I do use it when I know I’m going to be too busy to shave later on.  Maybe I&#x27;ll end up using it more once I get used to it, but for now once in a while is good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;A few days later and I finally tried the body brush attachment on my legs and what a disappointment it was.  I wasn’t expecting too much, just smoother skin like I would get after using the facial brush.  I started out on the lower speed and, since that didn’t really feel like it was working well enough, I turned it up to the higher speed.  At this point, it did somewhat feel like it was working so I finished up and dried off.  The results were less than spectacular, so I assumed that I hadn’t used it right and tried again the next day.  I ended up trying quite a few times before finally giving up.  No matter how I used it, my legs came out the same as they did beforehand.  This one was a big letdown, especially after the other two worked so well, but I am excited to see what other attachments there are.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the epilator worked great and it was refreshing to see a company put in the effort to make such a quality item.  I would definitely recommend this epilator  to anyone looking to buy one as well as the brand itself.  And if you get this and you&#x27;re not a fan of the pain, trying checking out some of their other attachments, I think I seen a shaver one.lts were less than spectacular, so I assumed that I hadn’t used it right and tried again the next day.

            <li> The Braun silk spa is attractive and easy to use. It comes with very clear and easy to follow instructions. Actually it explains step by step how to use the epilator and the facial and body brushes. I got it for free from Braun for review and I love having and using it. When I first used the epilator on my legs it was a bit painful, like the sensation of little needles, but after a while you get used it.  It&#x27;s not an unbearable pain. My pores were a little sore and red but in an hour or less there was no sign and my legs were smoother than ever. It was great! And best of all, I didn&#x27;t need to shave for two weeks.  But then I had a little problem.  I had a bunch of ingrown hairs.  This never happened before. I had to pick them with a needle before.  I gave it a second try on my legs, this time it wasn&#x27;t so painful, actually not painful at all, just a little tingle.  The smart light is very helpful for better visibility. Also I found that it was less painful if used at the faster speed.   The underarm was another story, although I can say that the results were neat, both first and second epilation were equally painful and it feels sore for a little longer.  The facial and the body brush are great. You can feel a light massage and the results are a total smooth and relaxed skin.  I highly recommend the Braun Silk epil 7-929 spa!</li>

            <li> Not sure the whole package was worth it.  The epilator itself is great.  It holds a charge for hours on end and is significantly less painful than my previous cheap one.  It can be used in the shower however Ive found it to be most effective right after I get out from a hot shower. The rest of the package is kind of a waste though.  Maybe im just not doing it right but the skin brushes dont do much for me.  I also thought that it had the facial attachment for the epilator since the cheaper one had it.  It does not come with that attachment.</li>
            <li> I thought I had a high pain threshold, having had 2 kids without any drugs, but this was insane.  I tried it the tiniest bit on my leg and it was very painful.  Like trying to do your own tattoo.  And it hardly removed any hairs, I would have been at it for hours to do just one lower leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I said to my husband that it could have been a great torture device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the brushes though.  Just wish I hadn&#x27;t paid so much for them as I will never use the epistle part again...ouch!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been wondering what an epilator felt like and when i got the product i was happy. let it charge up and then i put it on my skin,it&lt;br /&gt;felt like a million pinches, its something that i will have to get use to.sooo its not going to be something i would get to help shave my legs.I liked the side gift that it came with it helped with my acne alot &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have had this product for about 1 1/2 weeks now. I received it from Braun, through BzzAgent to test. I have never used an epilator before but had recently researched alternatives to shaving and heard that epilation lasts longer than regular shaving and was not as painful as waxing (which I haven&#x27; tried before). When I received the product I plugged it to charge and used it the next day. I decided to do my own personal comparison with standard shaving. I shaved my right leg and used the Braun Epil 7 929 on the left leg. So far I have had to shave the right leg an additional 2 times while having no need to do anything to the left leg. It did cause some discomfort, but it was not painful and if you just keep going instead of stopping the discomfort is not very noticeable. It did cause some redness, but that is to be expected with this method. The redness was gone in a few hours with no negative side effects. I also used the exfoliator and was thrilled with the softness and smoothness of my skin after use. The only reason I did not give it five stars is due to the discomfort when using, I can not see using this on the bikini area as it mentions since that is such a tender area (and I am a scaredy cat with pain lol). I have only used it on my legs but this is now definitely my preferred method of choice. I will definitely continue to use this and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested. If I work up the nerve to try it under the arms or the bikini line I will edit my review and include that. As far as the legs go the slight momentary discomfort is well worth it considering the thoroughness and effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li> Ok, I really wanted to take my time in reviewing this because I wanted to give a proper review. I got this from Braun to review and it took me a while to try it because I was a little bit nervous about the pain. But I finally gave in and did it..and was surprised. It didn&#x27;t hurt as bad as I had anticipated. It worked better when I was in the shower than it did when it was dry. For some reason it didn&#x27;t hurt as bad in the shower the first time I tried it. I love that it&#x27;s cordless and that you can use it dry or wet. I also love that the second and third times it hurts even less . I love that it has a separate a scrubber so I am able to exfoliate my skin.. which it also does beautifully. I actually have been putting coconut oil on the brush and then exfoliating my face. It leaves my face clean and perfectly moisturised.&lt;br /&gt;So I definitely give this 5 stars. I had the Epilady back in the 80s and this is nothing like it at all. I do think it&#x27;s a little bit pricey but, in the end it&#x27;s worth it because you won&#x27;t be spending money on razors anymore.</li>
            <li> Great product. No pain no gain though. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i love it till it hurts :)</li>
            <li> Works great. Better than I thought.</li>
            <li> I am an early adopter and ruthless researcher of gadgets.  I narrowed my choices down to the emoji and this one.  I have not been disappointed.  It works very well, even on short fine hair. I hadn&#x27;t really thought about it, but it allows you to save tons of money on razors.  It is easy to clean, easy to use.  I haven&#x27;t found any necessity for the two speeds.  I would like to have an optional accessory head that is narrow, maybe pointed for nooks and crannies.  It is worth letting a bit of razor stubble develop in order to use this epilator.  And the hair is slow to come back.  I was concerned about reddened follicles or bumps, but I have not experienced that in any area.  A stray upper lip hair will swell a tiny bit but barely worth noting because it is only temporary.  For instance, if I had an irritated follicule after evening use, there would be no apparent redness by morning.  And I don&#x27;t use any calming balm or lotion. I especially like it for underarms.  I have dark hair, so even when recently shaved, I had a bit of shadow, which is not cute! Now, just smooth skin.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try this product through BzzAgent.  I think it does a great job. Though I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll ever get used to the pain associated with using an epilator. I tried this several times on wet and dry skin, didn&#x27;t notice a difference between using on wet vs. dry. The lower legs were by far the most sensitive. The bikini area was actually not horrible to use it on. The only reason I&#x27;m giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the amount of times I&#x27;d have to ho over the same area to get all the hair removed. I read complaints,on the battery life but haven&#x27;t run into this issue.</li>
            <li> Simply AMAZING. I received this product for free from BZZAGENT. A place that sends products at no cost for completing surveys and sharing your opinion with others. My 11 year old daughter and I were ecstatic to be invited to this opportunity. So when our Epilator came in the mail, we tried it right away. The exfoliation was great like a massage... Then we tried the Epilator. Being a licensed cosmetologist, I&#x27;m used to waxing hair, so I thought, oh, no biggie, hair will stay gone longer according to package... So I tried it on my leg..... Ouchhhhhhhhhh!!!!!! It felt like a tattoo. However, as I kept working myself up to dealing with the pain, I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I gave my electric shaver to my daughter and will use this from now on...if for some reason in the future I need to get another Epilator, (my girls my decide get want one) they will get this Braun Epil 7 Skinspa Beauty Epilator.. This retails for $149.99 on average and well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Many try different methods of hair removal, only to find that they need to repeat the process several times in a week.  I have never herd of an epilator before and was hesitant yet excited to try it out. About a couple of weeks ago, I received a free package of this product, thanks to Braun and Bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon I as received this package I read through the instruction&#x27;s and tried it out. Yes this stuff is painful !  But the good news is that this thing works . Since I am pretty tolerant to pain, I didn&#x27;t mind going through a little pain if it gets me to not use shaver every 2 days. As the saying goes , sometimes beauty hurts, at least for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliation brushes were great , and the epilator was quite painful the first times, but if it means no shaving every other day (especially in the summer months) then who would say no to that ?&lt;br /&gt; If you are going to buy this product I recommend having in mind that yes the first time will be painful, but its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure to at least exfoliate the skin and moisten it a bit before using.&lt;br /&gt;As for the instructions , they are pretty simple to follow and overall I like this product and will definitely recommend it to others to try out.</li>
            <li> I love it. It works amazing and I&#x27;m in love with being able to use it wet or dry. This product was given to me for free from the brand. It does hurt but it&#x27;s not as bad as waxing. Pretty simple. You know what they say no pain no game.</li>
            <li> Was great at the beginning. But after couple months of use, its not holding the charge anymore. It wont even last a minute even after 24 hours of charging</li>
            <li> I got to try out this product through Buzzagent &amp; OMG if you don&#x27;t absolutely love your skin this is not for you! I tried it dry and yes it was very painful but I decided to try it wet and Bam there it was, a new addict!!!! I feel like I&#x27;ve waxed without the pain!! Trust me it&#x27;s well worth it for that radiant skin you&#x27;ve always wanted!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to any one out there who hates shaving! Using the epilator for the first time hurts extremely bad, but after a while your body should get used to it. The pain is actually worth it because the epilator is removing the hairs from the root causing it not to grow back until 3 or 4 weeks later. The epilator comes with a body exfoliator attachment which is great for removing all of the dead skin off your body. It also comes with a separate face exfoliator which leaves your face entirely smooth. This is a great investment worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I had never used anything other than razors but the epil 7 definitely made that change it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a device like this before. I received it from Braun. I have usually had good experiences with Braun products, so I was excited to try this and see what it was all about. The epilator has a light and it is small, therefore making it easy to travel with if necessary. The package comes with the epilator head, a facial cleansing brush. and a body exfoliator. I thouroughly enjoyed the facial cleanser. I wish the wand it comes with would have more than two settings, but overall it did a great job. My skin felt nice after using it. The epilator is nice overall. It has a light which makes things easier to see, and it is just going to be quite painful. Just follow the instructions it comes with if you have never tried using something like an epilator before. Just make sure to moisturize after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I love the Braun Silk I recommend its so amazing this product &amp;#60;3 in love.I receive this product thank to the brand Braun Silk-epil 7 SkinSpa  to test and i  loved.  The facial and exfoliating brushes are also awesome. the first time you use the razor its hurt but then you don&#x27;t note becouse your skin is so  sensitive!</li>
            <li> I have always wondered about epilators but never really knew what they were all about.  So, thanks to BzzAgent, I got one for free to try out.  The first time I tried it was in the shower and I think the hair must have been to long, it honestly felt like I was getting a tattoo that never ended.  I couldn&#x27;t even finish one leg, let a lone trying more sensitive places.  So I let it sit for about a week and thought I would try it again.  This time I shaved in the morning and then tried it at night, dry.  It was far less painful!  I only tried it on one leg because I wanted to see if I could tell a difference.  Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference at all.  I didn&#x27;t even feel like it got as smooth as shaving.  I am disappointed because I would love to not have to shave daily and have smooth feeling skin.  The facial brushes work just fine.  The tool is great, easy to hold, and easy to use.  Loved the additional light too.  Just did not work like I expected.</li>
            <li> I received this for free in a trial from Braun. I like that it is multi-purpose. It also charges quickly which is nice. Facial and body brushes: wasn&#x27;t harsh on my skin as expected. Very easy to operate and left my skin very soft. However I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be using them in the winter when my skin gets very dry and sensitive. Epilator: nice alternative to shaving my bikini line, which gives me ingrown hairs. But just like any epilator, it hurts! It did a good job of cleaning up the area and grabbing even short hairs. The manual says the more you use it, the less painful it gets so hopefully that is the case. Overall I like that this is 3 tools in one purchase, but the current price seems too high.</li>
            <li> With so many epilators out there I was excited to try the Braun silk epil 7. I have tried others before but never one that was wet/dry. First off the look of the product is beautiful I mean which woman doesnt love a little glitter?! Love the glittery handle lol.  I found the epilator to be painful when dry but using it in the shower was a much better experience. It glides smoothly on skin and does the job well. The body exfoliation brush is just what you need right after using the epilator and works wonders to moisturize the skin. And last but not least, the facial cleasing brush works so well to deep clean the face. I got many compliments on my skin after using the facial cleansing brush...I love it.  I really recommend this product to all of you out there who want to give themselves a skin spa treat!</li>
            <li> I love the braun silk-èpil 7 skinspa 😍 it was very easy to use I have sensitive skin so the braun silk-èpil 7 was great on my skin I felt no irritation my legs where smooth it&#x27;s defiantly worth the money !</li>
            <li> I first heard about this product on bzzagent where i recieved the product free to try. I had never used an epilator before. So i tried it. I spent like fifteen minutes just on one leg and it didnt really take the hair out. Instead it gave me a really bad razor burn. :/ on the other hand i really love the face brush, and body exfoliating brush it left my skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a very high pain threshold and I was really worried it would be painful but was pleasantly surprised! I really liked how easy it was to use and to switch accessories.</li>
            <li> This product comes with the Braun epilator, exfoliater head with cover, facial exfoliater, cleaning brush, carrying bag, and a charger. It is easy to pack this set up and carry it anywhere without taking up lots of space. It is very ideal for taking along on trips. You don&#x27;t have to deal with shaving cream or those horrible nicks and cuts.    I received this free from Braun to try out. I have never used an epilator before so I was a bit skeptical to use this. When I received the box, it was a bit intimidating. All the different parts looked complicated. I didn&#x27;t know what to do. Luckily, it has very clear, precise instructions on how to use every part of the kit. You want to make sure you read the instructions so you do not cause yourself excess pain.    The first time I used the epilator I gotta admit, it was not a walk in the park. It was a bit painful but not to the point that I wanted to stop. I used it on dry legs (I now hear that wet legs are a bit less painful). The epilator is very easy to use.    The epilator works really well. My legs were left smooth and even weeks later, I still didn&#x27;t have that stubble feeling that a razor leaves. When I did feel moderate stubble, I grabbed the epilator and went over them again. It was far less painful the second time around. I am excited to ditch razors once and for all. I am 100% confident that I will not go back to shaving with a regular razor ever again. I have been converted and I love it!    This kit also comes with attachments to exfoliate your skin to help keep your skin healthy and smooth. It comes with a special one for your face that runs off of batteries and another that attaches to the epilator for the rest of your body. It works extremely well and I love the way it makes my skin feel.    The pros are definitely the smooth skin and the healthy glow. The only cons I can think of is the first rounds of pain and it&#x27;s a bit pricey. All in all, this is a great product and you will never go back to razors again.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive the Silk-epil 7 epilator kit from Braun in the mail.  I was looking forward to not having to shave every other day.  I was aware that there would be some pain involved, but thought it would be worth it.  I made two attempts to use the epilator out of the shower on my legs.  If was quite uncomfortable but tolerable.  After the first pass on my leg, I felt my leg and I could still fell stubble.  I proceeded to go over the same spot again with no change to the stubble.  I could tolerate the pain if it would have given me a smooth result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried it in the shower hoping for a different experience.  The pain was less but the stubble was the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box is very attractive and the directions are very clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the facial cleansing brush and the body exfoliation brush.  Both products I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> If youre used to epilators than this might be a great product for you. As for someone like myself who is new to epilators,this was extremely painful, and I couldn&#x27;t use it for more than 3 seconds. Though the exfoliation brushes are wonderful !</li>
            <li> I received this from Braun and my first time using, it hurt! It stopped hurting after a few mins but left red bumps all over my legs for days! The hair grew back in about 3 days. I also had my brother (14) try this on his face. He also had what looked like blood blisters for almost a week but the hair is still gone. I personally will stick to shaving but the product does do a great job aside from the red marks.</li>
            <li> So I didnt try this particular model, I tried the 820 edition thanks to a free trial by BzzAgent.com and I thought I would review that product on here as it may help out a little. Here is my review of the Bruan Face Beauty Edition 820..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Ive never really tried an epilator before but ive heard horror stories, but Im the type who still has to expericence it for myself. So upon receiving the epilator I first tried it out on my arm. I started crying, not really but I did get a little teary, I thought it got a lot of hair off but after the redness went away I looked at the spot I tried it on and there was still hair!! All the pain for what? Still I tried it a couple areas on my face and still the same I felt like I wasnt getting anywhere with the hair removal. I gave up on that for a while.. LOL anyway the cleansing brush? Loved it! I felt like my face was super clean after using it, and after applying my face lotion super smooth. I will definetly be using part all the time. I wish it came with a little carrying back to make carrying the brush heads and the epilator tip around when traveling a little easier. But still a good product. I will continue to use it!! Thanks BzzAgent.</li>
