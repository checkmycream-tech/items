            <li>Good for what its intended</li>
            <li>it cleans up with a good rinse.....</li>
            <li>then that it&#x27;s a good product for the price</li>
            <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s good:</li>
            <li>Good for soaking your brush preshave.</li>
            <li>Made of good quality ceramic.</li>
            <li>It looks good and it doe everything that it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li>If you are planning to use this with shaving soap puck, buy the 2-1\2 inch pucks that fit perfectly in the bottom of the mug</li>
            <li>I use shaving soap for my shaves and they are a perfect fit for this mug.</li>
            <li>so I was buying everything recommended to create a good shaving a experience.  </li>
            <li>Bought it as a gift and the recipient loved it.</li>
            <li>Well made heavyand good looking.</li>
            <li>but I would like to know what what brand and size of soap would fit this mug the best.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really good quality.</li>
            <li>This is a great quality bowl which gives you enough room to mix up your shaving cream and give you a perfect lather because if you love shaving you need a good bowl and this is perfect</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s real easy to hold onto while you are lathering up your face .</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the product, arrived on time and everything went well.  </li>
            <li>I love the product and great customer service.</li>
            <li>Looks nice and feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li>The shape is nice for getting a good lather.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The mug is easy for me to handle and I am happy with the purchase</li>
            <li>I have been using it and it keeps my foam and brush nice and warm</li>
            <li>Nice mug but</li>
            <li>Allowing me to create a warm lather that softens my face and hair for an easier shave.</li>
            <li>The SF Mug also has a quality to it with a nice design that fits in the hand well</li>
            <li>: this feels like a nice ceramic mug.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice style with its &amp;#34;knob&amp;#34; handle and will not be mistaken for a coffee mug.</li>
            <li>Material quality is nice tho ...</li>
            <li>Durable and cleans up nicely.</li>
            <li>Nice - seemingly well made - unremarkable shaving mug.</li>
            <li>Georgetown Pottery makes an extremely nice one:[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This gets a lot of use &amp; holding up nicely.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t help you win the lottery, or make your car run better, but it will keep the shaving soap contained for a close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>it also does a good job holding in heat for a nice comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I think that if aesthetics are important this could still be a good option.  </li>
            <li>Mug is nice and handy seller was quick to ship!</li>
            <li>but seems to be a very cheaply made ceramic product.  </li>
            <li>Fits in my hand, keeps my lather warm, and looks pretty good.</li>
            <li>Pure Badger Shaving Brush for great value dad gift....</li>
            <li>great quality, but seems slightly large.</li>
            <li>the style of this mug seems a very good design as far as the type of handle-easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great for when a mug is desired and a bowl maybe too much.</li>
            <li>The flared top is a plus to these shaving mugs.</li>
            <li>I really love this product and would recommend this to anyone who shaves.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it,</li>
            <li>Glad to have</li>
            <li>I use a cream and this might be better with a soap.</li>
            <li>look for a rice bowl, heard that these work better for creams.</li>
            <li>it better.  </li>
            <li>Cheap, nice looking, sturdy.</li>
            <li>I love this mug.  </li>
            <li>I love the color, the feel, and the functionality of this mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>cute mug</li>
            <li>Looks better than my coffee mug I was using.</li>
            <li>it probably better since it does not show a soap film.  </li>
            <li>and i absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this cup.  </li>
            <li>so I am able to use by brush with no problems.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using a bowl from kitchen that is better.</li>
            <li>This is much better, allows you to build more lather.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a  sexy mug, well made but not what I needed/</li>
            <li>My husband has gotten into shaving with lather and is really enjoying his shaving cup.</li>
            <li>Love the old-school feel while shaving.</li>
            <li>This is more a criticism of the shaving soaps than this mug.</li>
            <li>I ended up with Col Cronk&#x27;s Worlds Famous Shaving Soap, Bay Rum, 2.25 oz.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and maintain with good brush depth too.  </li>
            <li>A must have if you love shaving.</li>
            <li>Love the mug-</li>
            <li>The handle is easy to hold mug with and is overall a great design!</li>
            <li>This was a good priced product that does exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>I shopped a long time for the perfect gift.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got a longer handled brush with some long bristles, I imagine this would be perfect!  </li>
            <li>Nice came quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold, and with the knob on the side it gives me more options.</li>
            <li>So it takes me a little more effort to get that perfect lather that I like.</li>
            <li>Holds heat well, easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle, looks good and good quality, but it is just too deep to be really useful.  </li>
            <li>Dumping out most of the hot water and putting a finger tip full of shave cream produces a nice hot lather that stays warm for three passes with the DE.  </li>
            <li>Quality seems fine, easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Soap  fits  fine  easy  to  handle</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>This mug is huge compared to the one I was using</li>
            <li>the warm foam really improves the quality of my shave.</li>
            <li>It is well made and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>it is completely smooth on the inside.</li>
            <li>This gets the job done, and the handle is comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>It looks great sitting on the shelf in the bathroom next to my razor stand.</li>
            <li>The knob handle provides a secure, comfortable grip.</li>
            <li>I had to look for a while online to get a soap that would fit.</li>
            <li>Good size, sturdy, and masculine looking.  </li>
            <li>Great cup, love the wide rim!</li>
            <li>Kids&#x27; gift purchase for dad - he loves this shaving mug, easy to handle, easyt o clean, retro fun!</li>
            <li>Sure, you can think of ways to keep the cup warm, but ultimately I dropped some cash on a nice shaving scuttle from Georgetown pottery and am much happier.</li>
            <li>well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like the knob, but I love it - better than a regular handle.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this purchase and so glad I didn&#x27;t pay $35 for the same mug with a different name on it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fairly happy with the purchase despite the relatively minor drawbacks.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do that with a bowl, but what I like the most about the mug is that I can run hot water in it just before mixing my shave soap and it retains the heat very well.</li>
            <li>gave the mug 3 stars because it looks good and works ok but not stellar.</li>
            <li>If you are just looking for a cool looking mug to melt some col conk in, and then make a lather elsewhere then go for it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s not so good: If you do multiple shave passes,</li>
            <li>A good basic shaving mug that works well with col conk and van der hagen type soaps.</li>
            <li>Looks good too and seems that it will last.</li>
            <li>Too deep to get a good lather.</li>
            <li>All in all not a bad mug.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, not bad and does the job it&#x27;s intended to do.</li>
            <li>The additional length of the bristles and handle make it easy to whip up a nice solid lather.  </li>
            <li>The mug makes it easy to whip up a great, stiff lather in the shower while protecting it from shower .</li>
            <li>Other than that its a great product.</li>
            <li>I fits my puck snugly and has adequate room for working up the lather.</li>
            <li>super well which doesn&#x27;t matter if you lather on your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I am done it rinses/dries out quickly and holds my brush and razor body neatly.</li>
            <li>Other than that the mug is very nice</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly how this ceramic mug keep the shaving cream !  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t arrive broken, the shaving soap I use fits perfectly in the bottom and it doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li>The price is a bargain for such a nice piece.</li>
            <li>This shaving mug is nice and serves its purpose, but is too big for my needs.</li>
            <li>Overall, the quality and appearance of the cup is nice.  </li>
            <li>All in all, totally worth the money</li>
            <li>He will be both surprised and pleased.  </li>
            <li>It is actually great for a coffee mug, but not easy to use for making lather.  </li>
            <li>Found a very apparent flaw on the lip, but prior e is great and it will serve.  </li>
            <li>This makes a good amount of noise unless I am very careful.  </li>
            <li>Even with those minor issues, and they are mine really not the cups, this is a perfect addition to my shaving routine.</li>
            <li>I received a new mug back; it is very well made looks very nice on the sink.</li>
            <li>It certainly looks better on the sink than an old cereal bowl.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no issues with the depth of the mug as many people have complained about though I do have A nice wood handled shave brush.</li>
            <li>Simple, well made and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>while the mug it resting in hot water in the sink.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for when I needed to replace my shaving mug.  </li>
            <li>My first shaving mug that wasn&#x27;t repurposed coffee mug.</li>
            <li>sincerely believe that if Israel and Hamas used this mug that there would be peace in the Middle East</li>
            <li>This mug will hold most shaving soaps and provides enough vertical height that the lather should not spill over the sides.</li>
            <li>I wish i had ordered this mug first.</li>
            <li>only thing that would make this better is if it heated up your shaving cream...</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband with his first safety razor.  </li>
            <li>First, I shave my head and face 3 days a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Pretty well balanced</li>
            <li>They are cheaper, work better for me, and for the cost, I can have multiple loaded with a variety of soaps</li>
            <li>I wish I had been able to get one in a different color</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, as advertised!</li>
            <li>Good heavy mug - works well.  </li>
            <li>Good looking heavy duty mug.</li>
            <li>the larger soaps won&#x27;t fit but the smaller sizes fit fine.</li>
            <li>Now THAT&#x27;S something that will really set you up right.</li>
            <li>(Bigger than expected, which makes me happy.)</li>
            <li>Only my Colonel Conk shaving soap looks the right size to fit.</li>
            <li>So much so, that I stopped using it after the first couple of times.  </li>
            <li>Large cup, keeps your lather from getting everywhere.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably use it as a travel shave tool as my scuttle is rather large.</li>
            <li>This holds a puck of soap perfectly, but is slightly too narrow for my taste.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good lather mug for loose soaps such as the Conk pucks.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping..</li>
            <li>it fits my hands very well.</li>
            <li>I love the shape of the wide rim.  </li>
            <li>Although, that hasn&#x27;t really mattered.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle has a sure grip even with wet or soapy hands.  </li>
            <li>I would really recommend to anyone that is looking to use shave soap instead of the canned foam.</li>
            <li>Is a very functional mug that provides function and ease of handling.</li>
            <li>My advice is to just use a coffee mug or else go the whole nine yards and buy a shaving scuttle.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace a shaving bowl that didn&#x27;t hold much lather before it overflowed from the sides.</li>
            <li>It is very breakable and needs to handled with care .</li>
            <li>really like the shape and weight of this mug.</li>
            <li>I really like mine.</li>
            <li>Holds heat well and saturates brush very well.  </li>
            <li>so I just use the cup to store those items when not in use rather then a stand that tarnishes/dulls or takes up too much space.&lt;br</li>
            <li>no complaints, more durable than I expected.. dropped it once on accident while whipping up my cream</li>
            <li>Nice and heavy means it won&#x27;t slip out of your hands.</li>
            <li>Most all of them are, but I&#x27;m used to the smaller, Old Spice coffee-cup handle mugs</li>
            <li>It is the right size at the top and also deep enough that you don&#x27;t get lather all over the place.</li>
            <li>it is big enough so that the lather doesnt spill over the sides, and the handle is very easy and ergonomic</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers, I agree that this is a well made mug.</li>
            <li>and I figured it would look better sitting around the sink than a bowl or a lot of the other products if I decided to leave it out.</li>
            <li>The knob does not get in the way of holding the cup like any other, but allows more hand positions.</li>
            <li>The mug is good and thick and I generally set the brush in it and run hot water in it and then let it sit a minute to heat up.  </li>
            <li>The handle makes it easy to hold with wet hands.</li>
            <li>I use this mug with an Omega #10098 brush and Classic Brand Soap.  </li>
            <li>The shape is okay, not perfect, as I&#x27;d almost prefer it to have a more bulbous shape as opposed to this &#x27;chopped off tornado&#x27; shape that it has.</li>
            <li>For the cost I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>He just retired and it is one of the little things he is now enjoying because he has the time to do so.</li>
            <li>Nice quality, but far too small for what it&#x27;s intended for.  </li>
            <li>Good shaving mug, although if the klink of the wood brush against the mug would be irritating, I suggest you look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>This mug was too big and did not work right for what I intended.</li>
            <li>So i ordered one of those nice shiny stainless steel &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; cups only to find it was too small.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the red letter brand on the side much, but I doesn&#x27;t matter because I don&#x27;t really notice</li>
            <li>Not sure if I would like a bowl better, but this works for now.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time last night.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, so I&#x27;m not sure if thats normal, of if the finish on this just stains easily.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure about the knob handle as was used to having the coffee mug style in the past, but was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This mug is a bit smaller than I had hoped but it does the job with certain soaps.  </li>
            <li>It remind everyone of the old days</li>
            <li>It has the look &amp; feel of the old days</li>
            <li>Have had this model for a few years and enjoy it.</li>
            <li>it is just enough room to whip up the cream without having to work too much or spreading it around too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put him an old fashioned shave kit together.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty new to DE shaving and will confess I did not really understand the purpose of a shave mug or bowl.  </li>
            <li>and At first I really wanted the black one.  </li>
            <li>The only negative is that it&#x27;s deep, and can make whipping up shaving cream a little more challenging; my husband prefers a shallower dish.  </li>
            <li>I considered buying one that cost three times more (because of the name on it), and I was a little skeptical about this one because it was inexpensive, but I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>which I think most people do, the lather gets cold quickly.</li>
            <li>I personally prefer a more shallow, wider mug or bowl.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to getting and using this for my daily shaving ritual, but it was obvious from the first use that it was not big enough (diameter, not height).</li>
            <li>Every shaving soap brand I have bought so far has a slightly different size.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I first started wet shaving, I bought this to try to keep my costs low</li>
            <li>I did not have a problem working up a mean lather with it that made my razor glide over my face like a smooth piece of glass.  </li>
            <li>This mug works well for soap and cream, but it&#x27;s not very wide.  </li>
            <li>The other issue is that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much standardization amongst shaving soap companies about the size of pucks.</li>
            <li>Although the knob gives the mug that this-ain&#x27;t-your-coffee-mug look, with wet and slippery hands a normal drinking mug would work better...and be cheaper too.</li>
            <li>I usually shave in the shower unless I have a lot of time to do it right, but I do take my proraso soap and brush in with me no matter what.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty hard to work up a good lather in this because it makes holding the brush awkward.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s good:</li>
            <li> Good for soaking your brush preshave.</li>
            <li> Made of good quality ceramic.</li>
            <li> It looks good and it doe everything that it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li> If you are planning to use this with shaving soap puck, buy the 2-1\2 inch pucks that fit perfectly in the bottom of the mug</li>
            <li> I use shaving soap for my shaves and they are a perfect fit for this mug.</li>
            <li> so I was buying everything recommended to create a good shaving a experience.  </li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift and the recipient loved it.</li>
            <li> Well made heavyand good looking.</li>
            <li> but I would like to know what what brand and size of soap would fit this mug the best.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really good quality.</li>
            <li> This is a great quality bowl which gives you enough room to mix up your shaving cream and give you a perfect lather because if you love shaving you need a good bowl and this is perfect</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s real easy to hold onto while you are lathering up your face .</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product, arrived on time and everything went well.  </li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> The mug is easy for me to handle and I am happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> I have been using it and it keeps my foam and brush nice and warm</li>
            <li> Nice mug but</li>
            <li> Allowing me to create a warm lather that softens my face and hair for an easier shave.</li>
            <li> The SF Mug also has a quality to it with a nice design that fits in the hand well</li>
            <li> : this feels like a nice ceramic mug.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice style with its &amp;#34;knob&amp;#34; handle and will not be mistaken for a coffee mug.</li>
            <li> Material quality is nice tho ...</li>
            <li> Durable and cleans up nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice - seemingly well made - unremarkable shaving mug.</li>
            <li> Georgetown Pottery makes an extremely nice one:[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This gets a lot of use &amp; holding up nicely.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t help you win the lottery, or make your car run better, but it will keep the shaving soap contained for a close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> it also does a good job holding in heat for a nice comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I think that if aesthetics are important this could still be a good option.  </li>
            <li> Mug is nice and handy seller was quick to ship!</li>
            <li> but seems to be a very cheaply made ceramic product.  </li>
            <li> Fits in my hand, keeps my lather warm, and looks pretty good.</li>
            <li> Pure Badger Shaving Brush for great value dad gift....</li>
            <li> great quality, but seems slightly large.</li>
            <li> the style of this mug seems a very good design as far as the type of handle-easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great for when a mug is desired and a bowl maybe too much.</li>
            <li> The flared top is a plus to these shaving mugs.</li>
            <li> I really love this product and would recommend this to anyone who shaves.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it,</li>
            <li> Glad to have</li>
            <li> I use a cream and this might be better with a soap.</li>
            <li> look for a rice bowl, heard that these work better for creams.</li>
            <li> it better.  </li>
            <li> Cheap, nice looking, sturdy.</li>
            <li> I love this mug.  </li>
            <li> I love the color, the feel, and the functionality of this mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cute mug</li>
            <li> Looks better than my coffee mug I was using.</li>
            <li> it probably better since it does not show a soap film.  </li>
            <li> and i absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this cup.  </li>
            <li> so I am able to use by brush with no problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using a bowl from kitchen that is better.</li>
            <li> This is much better, allows you to build more lather.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a  sexy mug, well made but not what I needed/</li>
            <li> My husband has gotten into shaving with lather and is really enjoying his shaving cup.</li>
            <li> Love the old-school feel while shaving.</li>
            <li> This is more a criticism of the shaving soaps than this mug.</li>
            <li> I ended up with Col Cronk&#x27;s Worlds Famous Shaving Soap, Bay Rum, 2.25 oz.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and maintain with good brush depth too.  </li>
            <li> A must have if you love shaving.</li>
            <li> Love the mug-</li>
            <li> The handle is easy to hold mug with and is overall a great design!</li>
            <li> This was a good priced product that does exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> I shopped a long time for the perfect gift.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got a longer handled brush with some long bristles, I imagine this would be perfect!  </li>
            <li> Nice came quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold, and with the knob on the side it gives me more options.</li>
            <li> So it takes me a little more effort to get that perfect lather that I like.</li>
            <li> Holds heat well, easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle, looks good and good quality, but it is just too deep to be really useful.  </li>
            <li> Dumping out most of the hot water and putting a finger tip full of shave cream produces a nice hot lather that stays warm for three passes with the DE.  </li>
            <li> Quality seems fine, easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Soap  fits  fine  easy  to  handle</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> This mug is huge compared to the one I was using</li>
            <li> the warm foam really improves the quality of my shave.</li>
            <li> It is well made and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> it is completely smooth on the inside.</li>
            <li> This gets the job done, and the handle is comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> It looks great sitting on the shelf in the bathroom next to my razor stand.</li>
            <li> The knob handle provides a secure, comfortable grip.</li>
            <li> I had to look for a while online to get a soap that would fit.</li>
            <li> Good size, sturdy, and masculine looking.  </li>
            <li> Great cup, love the wide rim!</li>
            <li> Kids&#x27; gift purchase for dad - he loves this shaving mug, easy to handle, easyt o clean, retro fun!</li>
            <li> Sure, you can think of ways to keep the cup warm, but ultimately I dropped some cash on a nice shaving scuttle from Georgetown pottery and am much happier.</li>
            <li> well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like the knob, but I love it - better than a regular handle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this purchase and so glad I didn&#x27;t pay $35 for the same mug with a different name on it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m fairly happy with the purchase despite the relatively minor drawbacks.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do that with a bowl, but what I like the most about the mug is that I can run hot water in it just before mixing my shave soap and it retains the heat very well.</li>
            <li> gave the mug 3 stars because it looks good and works ok but not stellar.</li>
            <li> If you are just looking for a cool looking mug to melt some col conk in, and then make a lather elsewhere then go for it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s not so good: If you do multiple shave passes,</li>
            <li> A good basic shaving mug that works well with col conk and van der hagen type soaps.</li>
            <li> Looks good too and seems that it will last.</li>
            <li> Too deep to get a good lather.</li>
            <li> All in all not a bad mug.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, not bad and does the job it&#x27;s intended to do.</li>
            <li> The additional length of the bristles and handle make it easy to whip up a nice solid lather.  </li>
            <li> The mug makes it easy to whip up a great, stiff lather in the shower while protecting it from shower .</li>
            <li> Other than that its a great product.</li>
            <li> I fits my puck snugly and has adequate room for working up the lather.</li>
            <li> super well which doesn&#x27;t matter if you lather on your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I am done it rinses/dries out quickly and holds my brush and razor body neatly.</li>
            <li> Other than that the mug is very nice</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly how this ceramic mug keep the shaving cream !  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t arrive broken, the shaving soap I use fits perfectly in the bottom and it doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> The price is a bargain for such a nice piece.</li>
            <li> This shaving mug is nice and serves its purpose, but is too big for my needs.</li>
            <li> Overall, the quality and appearance of the cup is nice.  </li>
            <li> All in all, totally worth the money</li>
            <li> He will be both surprised and pleased.  </li>
            <li> It is actually great for a coffee mug, but not easy to use for making lather.  </li>
            <li> Found a very apparent flaw on the lip, but prior e is great and it will serve.  </li>
            <li> This makes a good amount of noise unless I am very careful.  </li>
            <li> Even with those minor issues, and they are mine really not the cups, this is a perfect addition to my shaving routine.</li>
            <li> I received a new mug back; it is very well made looks very nice on the sink.</li>
            <li> It certainly looks better on the sink than an old cereal bowl.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no issues with the depth of the mug as many people have complained about though I do have A nice wood handled shave brush.</li>
            <li> Simple, well made and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> while the mug it resting in hot water in the sink.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for when I needed to replace my shaving mug.  </li>
            <li> My first shaving mug that wasn&#x27;t repurposed coffee mug.</li>
            <li> sincerely believe that if Israel and Hamas used this mug that there would be peace in the Middle East</li>
            <li> This mug will hold most shaving soaps and provides enough vertical height that the lather should not spill over the sides.</li>
            <li> I wish i had ordered this mug first.</li>
            <li> only thing that would make this better is if it heated up your shaving cream...</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband with his first safety razor.  </li>
            <li> First, I shave my head and face 3 days a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Pretty well balanced</li>
            <li> They are cheaper, work better for me, and for the cost, I can have multiple loaded with a variety of soaps</li>
            <li> I wish I had been able to get one in a different color</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, as advertised!</li>
            <li> Good heavy mug - works well.  </li>
            <li> Good looking heavy duty mug.</li>
            <li> the larger soaps won&#x27;t fit but the smaller sizes fit fine.</li>
            <li> Now THAT&#x27;S something that will really set you up right.</li>
            <li> (Bigger than expected, which makes me happy.)</li>
            <li> Only my Colonel Conk shaving soap looks the right size to fit.</li>
            <li> So much so, that I stopped using it after the first couple of times.  </li>
            <li> Large cup, keeps your lather from getting everywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably use it as a travel shave tool as my scuttle is rather large.</li>
            <li> This holds a puck of soap perfectly, but is slightly too narrow for my taste.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good lather mug for loose soaps such as the Conk pucks.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping..</li>
            <li> it fits my hands very well.</li>
            <li> I love the shape of the wide rim.  </li>
            <li> Although, that hasn&#x27;t really mattered.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle has a sure grip even with wet or soapy hands.  </li>
            <li> I would really recommend to anyone that is looking to use shave soap instead of the canned foam.</li>
            <li> Is a very functional mug that provides function and ease of handling.</li>
            <li> My advice is to just use a coffee mug or else go the whole nine yards and buy a shaving scuttle.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a shaving bowl that didn&#x27;t hold much lather before it overflowed from the sides.</li>
            <li> It is very breakable and needs to handled with care .</li>
            <li> really like the shape and weight of this mug.</li>
            <li> I really like mine.</li>
            <li> Holds heat well and saturates brush very well.  </li>
            <li> so I just use the cup to store those items when not in use rather then a stand that tarnishes/dulls or takes up too much space.&lt;br</li>
            <li> no complaints, more durable than I expected.. dropped it once on accident while whipping up my cream</li>
            <li> Nice and heavy means it won&#x27;t slip out of your hands.</li>
            <li> Most all of them are, but I&#x27;m used to the smaller, Old Spice coffee-cup handle mugs</li>
            <li> It is the right size at the top and also deep enough that you don&#x27;t get lather all over the place.</li>
            <li> it is big enough so that the lather doesnt spill over the sides, and the handle is very easy and ergonomic</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I agree that this is a well made mug.</li>
            <li> and I figured it would look better sitting around the sink than a bowl or a lot of the other products if I decided to leave it out.</li>
            <li> The knob does not get in the way of holding the cup like any other, but allows more hand positions.</li>
            <li> The mug is good and thick and I generally set the brush in it and run hot water in it and then let it sit a minute to heat up.  </li>
            <li> The handle makes it easy to hold with wet hands.</li>
            <li> I use this mug with an Omega #10098 brush and Classic Brand Soap.  </li>
            <li> The shape is okay, not perfect, as I&#x27;d almost prefer it to have a more bulbous shape as opposed to this &#x27;chopped off tornado&#x27; shape that it has.</li>
            <li> For the cost I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> He just retired and it is one of the little things he is now enjoying because he has the time to do so.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, but far too small for what it&#x27;s intended for.  </li>
            <li> Good shaving mug, although if the klink of the wood brush against the mug would be irritating, I suggest you look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This mug was too big and did not work right for what I intended.</li>
            <li> So i ordered one of those nice shiny stainless steel &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; cups only to find it was too small.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the red letter brand on the side much, but I doesn&#x27;t matter because I don&#x27;t really notice</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would like a bowl better, but this works for now.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last night.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, so I&#x27;m not sure if thats normal, of if the finish on this just stains easily.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about the knob handle as was used to having the coffee mug style in the past, but was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This mug is a bit smaller than I had hoped but it does the job with certain soaps.  </li>
            <li> It remind everyone of the old days</li>
            <li> It has the look &amp; feel of the old days</li>
            <li> Have had this model for a few years and enjoy it.</li>
            <li> it is just enough room to whip up the cream without having to work too much or spreading it around too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put him an old fashioned shave kit together.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty new to DE shaving and will confess I did not really understand the purpose of a shave mug or bowl.  </li>
            <li> and At first I really wanted the black one.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that it&#x27;s deep, and can make whipping up shaving cream a little more challenging; my husband prefers a shallower dish.  </li>
            <li> I considered buying one that cost three times more (because of the name on it), and I was a little skeptical about this one because it was inexpensive, but I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> which I think most people do, the lather gets cold quickly.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer a more shallow, wider mug or bowl.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to getting and using this for my daily shaving ritual, but it was obvious from the first use that it was not big enough (diameter, not height).</li>
            <li> Every shaving soap brand I have bought so far has a slightly different size.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I first started wet shaving, I bought this to try to keep my costs low</li>
            <li> I did not have a problem working up a mean lather with it that made my razor glide over my face like a smooth piece of glass.  </li>
            <li> This mug works well for soap and cream, but it&#x27;s not very wide.  </li>
            <li> The other issue is that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much standardization amongst shaving soap companies about the size of pucks.</li>
            <li> Although the knob gives the mug that this-ain&#x27;t-your-coffee-mug look, with wet and slippery hands a normal drinking mug would work better...and be cheaper too.</li>
            <li> I usually shave in the shower unless I have a lot of time to do it right, but I do take my proraso soap and brush in with me no matter what.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty hard to work up a good lather in this because it makes holding the brush awkward.  </li>
            <li> The bottom diameter is about the same diameter as my brush, so it was nearly impossible to whip up a nice lather.</li>
            <li> Iwill put this on a small shelf in my bathroom with a strop, shaving soap, shaving brush and a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> If you had an extra long brush, it may might work.</li>
            <li> It is well made and seem like it would last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He got into straight razor shaving lately, and this is something he uses regularly.</li>
            <li> I tried a normal bowl which was too big and a coffee mug which was too small.  </li>
            <li> If you want to save a few dollars, you could always lather the shaving cream in your hand or directly on your face as I&#x27;m doing now, although I&#x27;ll probably purchase some sort of bowl in the future.</li>
            <li> And hey a little too deep is better than a little too shallow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy and a little old school.</li>
            <li> I have gone back to wet shaving and bought this for the soap.  </li>
            <li> mouth of the cup is wide enough to work your brush and build your lather without feeling like you have to jam your hand in to the cup.</li>
            <li> I had to send the first order back because the mug arrived with a broken handle.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s to deep to mix the cream you need a long brush for it other</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the mug is a little too deep.</li>
            <li> My wife and I haven&#x27;t had a single argument, disagreement, or cage fight since I got this mug.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I mean, its a decent product I guess.  </li>
            <li> Annoying enough to where I replaced it with a cheap little stainless bowl I found at a tj maxx for 2 bucks.  </li>
            <li> The only down side to this mug is that it is a bit tall for my brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not particularly fond of the \\&quot;Shaving Factory\\&quot; label on the side.</li>
            <li> So I appreciate that the cup is black and lets me see the white residue.</li>
            <li> It came as a white mug instead of black, just keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> Though the picture is black, the mug I received was white -- not what I wanted, but didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning.</li>
            <li> It is a little deep but nothing to be upset about.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that i have a standard size brush and it seems like the handle should be about 2 inches longer.</li>
            <li> Not much to review here.....</li>
            <li> The bottom is narrower than I expected, but I like it too -</li>
            <li> Be Careful</li>
            <li> Like the handle on the side to hang on to as the mug can get slipppery when wet and soapy.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as nostalgic as a 30 year old old spice mug</li>
            <li> The bowl was terrible as it did not allow for enough room to get a good lather started, without spilling the lather all over.  </li>
            <li> I think a small open bowl, like a soap dish, would probably be easier to use.  </li>
            <li> But the smaller diameter of the bottom of the mug is quite small.</li>
            <li> Entirely too small for my soap disks.</li>
            <li> The mouth is plenty wide but it gets somewhat bothersome since it narrows down towards the end.</li>
            <li> not worth it money you paid</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the over all size.  </li>
            <li> I now buy shallow wooden bowls here on Amazon for $6 each, shipped, for my other soaps.</li>
            <li> My husband considers shaving less of a chore now.</li>
            <li> My lawn is greener even though I have been watering it less.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to have less things on the vanity</li>
            <li> but you can cut a little off of the soap puck.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was a little wider</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavy, but I like it like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few inches shorter</li>
            <li> Sturdy and heavy duty.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was the one shaving accessory missing from my bathroom .</li>
            <li> This mug is a little too small</li>
            <li> A touch small in diameter</li>
            <li> Does the job, not much more to say, it holds soap and fits well in the hand.</li>
            <li> Too small.</li>
            <li> I bought this to take the place of a small bowl that I bought.  </li>
            <li> Way too small to lather with a brush.</li>
            <li> Easier to use than the small prorasso tubs</li>
            <li> He said it was too small.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time making a lather in it.</li>
            <li> Hard to argue.</li>
            <li> Quality is a little poor.</li>
            <li> However, if you are using a standard size shaving brush it is simply too thin at the base.</li>
            <li> For me, however, the base of the cup just seemed to deep and narrow for me to work the brush around in.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer the same base with a wider rim.  </li>
            <li> You end up hitting the ceramic with the handle of your shave brush enough times to where it gets annoying.  </li>
            <li> Not great at all...</li>
            <li> Quality product but the base is small for my brush</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for Christmas and he loves it, and it wasn&#x27;t very expensive</li>
            <li> I wake my wife up every morning with the annoying clinking of my brush against the sides.</li>
            <li> The base inside diameter is 2.25 inches which isn&#x27;t listed in the description but can be found in the Q&amp;A.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Needs a rubber base to prevent chipping.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Great mug.  Does what a mug should do.  A touch small in diameter but you can cut a little off of the soap puck.  Looks good too.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I agree that this is a well made mug. However, if you are using a standard size shaving brush it is simply too thin at the base. I wake my wife up every morning with the annoying clinking of my brush against the sides.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly how this ceramic mug keep the shaving cream !  My husband considers shaving less of a chore now.</li>
            <li> This holds a puck of soap perfectly, but is slightly too narrow for my taste.  I would prefer the same base with a wider rim.  It is well made and inexpensive.  I bought one for myself and one for my nephew.</li>
            <li> Great for when a mug is desired and a bowl maybe too much.</li>
            <li> Mug is nice and handy seller was quick to ship!</li>
            <li> Great cup, love the wide rim!</li>
            <li> The mug was chipped during shipping and so I decided to return it.  To my surprise they apologized and refunded my purchase price and told me to keep it.  I have been using it and it keeps my foam and brush nice and warm while the mug it resting in hot water in the sink.  the warm foam really improves the quality of my shave.</li>
            <li> Iwill put this on a small shelf in my bathroom with a strop, shaving soap, shaving brush and a straight razor.  This will enhance my bathroom. It remind everyone of the old days</li>
            <li> Good for what its intended</li>
            <li> It has the look &amp; feel of the old days</li>
            <li> Not much to review here.....&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a cup..... It holds water and allows you to create a lather to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;Then it cleans up with a good rinse.....</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for when I needed to replace my shaving mug.  Very happy with it and was at a competitive price.</li>
            <li> This shave mug is very good . It is the right size at the top and also deep enough that you don&#x27;t get lather all over the place.Thank&#x27;s for a great product. It&#x27;s real easy to hold onto while you are lathering up your face . The flared top is a plus to these shaving mugs. I really love this product and would recommend this to anyone who shaves. Thank&#x27;s Again.</li>
            <li> The only down side to this mug is that it is a bit tall for my brush.  That will be resolved when I find a brush with a longer handle.</li>
            <li> Looks great on the sink....easy to hold while mixing the soap lather. Glad I bought it, well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.. Great product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cup, it lathers shaving cream. It isn&#x27;t cracked, it doesn&#x27;t leak. I wish it wasnt as deep, but I&#x27;m not getting rid of it for any reason, I&#x27;ll use it until I wear through the bottom of it. should last a lifetime</li>
            <li> My husband loves this thing. He got into straight razor shaving lately, and this is something he uses regularly.</li>
            <li> Holds heat well, easy to hold. My first shaving mug that wasn&#x27;t repurposed coffee mug. Glad to have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is script in red that is unobtrusive. Deep enough to hold a cake of shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Nice mug but the larger soaps won&#x27;t fit but the smaller sizes fit fine. It is well made and comfortable to hold. The deep sides prevents the lather from going over the sides as they do with the shorter mugs. And did I mention it looks great.</li>
            <li> very nice Mug it fits my hands very well.</li>
            <li> I mean, its a decent product I guess.  But It&#x27;s not the easiest thing to make a lather in.  You end up hitting the ceramic with the handle of your shave brush enough times to where it gets annoying.  Annoying enough to where I replaced it with a cheap little stainless bowl I found at a tj maxx for 2 bucks.  I&#x27;d recommend getting a bowl if you are planning on making a lather in here.  If you are just looking for a cool looking mug to melt some col conk in, and then make a lather elsewhere then go for it.</li>
            <li> Great Lil shave mug... Great value</li>
            <li> All in all not a bad mug. I use a cream and this might be better with a soap. My issue is that the is not enough room for my fingers and my brush handle. A few inches shorter and my fingers would be at the widest part of the mug, not banging the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will look for a rice bowl, heard that these work better for creams.</li>
            <li> Bought for Christmas gift.  He loved it!</li>
            <li> Have had this model for a few years and enjoy it. Nothing beats a quality shave each morning.</li>
            <li> I chose the Shaving Factory Mug because I wanted something I can put my safety razor and brush in while it&#x27;s stored in the medicine cabinet.  I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do that with a bowl, but what I like the most about the mug is that I can run hot water in it just before mixing my shave soap and it retains the heat very well. Allowing me to create a warm lather that softens my face and hair for an easier shave. The SF Mug also has a quality to it with a nice design that fits in the hand well and I figured it would look better sitting around the sink than a bowl or a lot of the other products if I decided to leave it out.</li>
            <li> Looks nice and feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li> This is a perfectly sized cup for lathering soap.  I fits my puck snugly and has adequate room for working up the lather.</li>
            <li> This mug works well for soap and cream, but it&#x27;s not very wide.  Not sure if I would like a bowl better, but this works for now.</li>
            <li> This mug goes above and beyond!  It is perfect for working up the lather for my shave every morning. The handle is great to hold so I don&#x27;t drop it.  I have noticed  since I got this mug that almost every facet of my life it better.  My lawn is greener even though I have been watering it less.  My wife and I haven&#x27;t had a single argument, disagreement, or cage fight since I got this mug.&lt;br /&gt;I sincerely believe that if Israel and Hamas used this mug that there would be peace in the Middle East</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shaving mug that fits Conk&#x27;s pucks that&#x27;s what I wanted. I&#x27;m not particularly fond of the \\&quot;Shaving Factory\\&quot; label on the side. It does the job it&#x27;s a good lather mug for loose soaps such as the Conk pucks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an alright product had scratches on it and it&#x27;s to deep to mix the cream you need a long brush for it other then that it&#x27;s a good product for the price</li>
            <li> Cheap, nice looking, sturdy. Does the job, not much more to say, it holds soap and fits well in the hand. It works fine.</li>
            <li> Beautiful goods !! Thank you !!!!</li>
            <li> Works well for what I need it for.</li>
            <li> I love this mug.  I considered buying one that cost three times more (because of the name on it), and I was a little skeptical about this one because it was inexpensive, but I am so glad I did.  I love the color, the feel, and the functionality of this mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look: it is very attractive. I don&#x27;t like the red letter brand on the side much, but I doesn&#x27;t matter because I don&#x27;t really notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size: it is the perfect size for my use.  My brush fits in well and I have not had the problems with my fingers like others have reported.  I guess my brush is longer so my fingers don&#x27;t even go into the cup.  I love the shape of the wide rim.  The bottom is narrower than I expected, but I like it too - it is just enough room to whip up the cream without having to work too much or spreading it around too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weight: this feels like a nice ceramic mug.  It&#x27;s a little heavy, but I like it like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Misc:  I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like the knob, but I love it - better than a regular handle.  Based on the picture, I thought there were ridges on the inside bottom of the mug, but they are only on the outside - it is completely smooth on the inside. Although, that hasn&#x27;t really mattered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this purchase and so glad I didn&#x27;t pay $35 for the same mug with a different name on it.</li>
            <li> Too small. Can&#x27;t agitate cream/soap with brush.</li>
            <li> When I first started wet shaving, I bought this to try to keep my costs low incase I decided it wasn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s good: Large cup, keeps your lather from getting everywhere. Good for soaking your brush preshave. Travels well. Sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not so good: If you do multiple shave passes, which I think most people do, the lather gets cold quickly. Sure, you can think of ways to keep the cup warm, but ultimately I dropped some cash on a nice shaving scuttle from Georgetown pottery and am much happier. Of course, if you don&#x27;t care about warm lather (aka you&#x27;re a zombie, or just hardcore as hell, or have no feeling in your face) then it&#x27;s perfect for you. Doesn&#x27;t build lather super well which doesn&#x27;t matter if you lather on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not bad and does the job it&#x27;s intended to do. I&#x27;ll probably use it as a travel shave tool as my scuttle is rather large.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mug. What else can I say? I didn&#x27;t arrive broken, the shaving soap I use fits perfectly in the bottom and it doesn&#x27;t leak. It does its job and does it well. I&#x27;d promote this thing to shaving manager if it could talk.</li>
            <li> cute mug but seems to be a very cheaply made ceramic product.  Probably from Chine, haven&#x27;t checked that either. Be Careful</li>
            <li> This mug came with multiple chips and a crack in the enamel. Quality is a little poor.</li>
            <li> This mug will hold most shaving soaps and provides enough vertical height that the lather should not spill over the sides. It has a nice style with its &amp;#34;knob&amp;#34; handle and will not be mistaken for a coffee mug. I gave it as a gift and t was well received.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t hold a soap puck but it&#x27;s not meant to. Looks better than my coffee mug I was using.</li>
            <li> To work correctly you have to use a puck soap in the bottom otherwise its too deep</li>
            <li> Good heavy mug - works well.  The base inside diameter is 2.25 inches which isn&#x27;t listed in the description but can be found in the Q&amp;A.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mug as I have started using shaving soap. The mug is the perfect size and has a knob handle, which is easy to hold while applying shave cream or soap. Made of good quality ceramic.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little wider</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to getting and using this for my daily shaving ritual, but it was obvious from the first use that it was not big enough (diameter, not height). The bottom diameter is about the same diameter as my brush, so it was nearly impossible to whip up a nice lather. Material quality is nice tho ...</li>
            <li> Helps me whip my Cella shaving soap into a frothy lather.  Durable and cleans up nicely.</li>
            <li> nice and good quality !!</li>
            <li> This was a good priced product that does exactly what i wanted. It isn&#x27;t as nostalgic as a 30 year old old spice mug but it gets the job done. My soap fits perfect and it seems to holed together well. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Good product  Great Privce</li>
            <li> Just what I have been looking for.  It looks good and it doe everything that it is supposed to.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle, looks good and good quality, but it is just too deep to be really useful.  It is actually great for a coffee mug, but not easy to use for making lather.  If you had an extra long brush, it may might work.</li>
            <li> Nice grip and the soap fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> A good basic shaving mug that works well with col conk and van der hagen type soaps. The quality is very nice and the knob handle is perfect for grip. Looks good too and seems that it will last.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, fits the puck perfectly.  The shape is nice for getting a good lather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty new to DE shaving and will confess I did not really understand the purpose of a shave mug or bowl.  After reading the directions on the shave soap I realized I need something to lather up the soap with my brush in.  I tried a normal bowl which was too big and a coffee mug which was too small.  I decided to purchase this mug with the handle.  I received a white one (there may be an option to select color now), and At first I really wanted the black one.  After using the white it probably better since it does not show a soap film.  The mug is good and thick and I generally set the brush in it and run hot water in it and then let it sit a minute to heat up.  Dumping out most of the hot water and putting a finger tip full of shave cream produces a nice hot lather that stays warm for three passes with the DE.  The handle has a sure grip even with wet or soapy hands.  The price is a bargain for such a nice piece.</li>
            <li> This shaving mug is the perfect size for me.  I have gone back to wet shaving and bought this for the soap.  It holds my Men&#x27;s Soap Company soap puck perfectly.  The mug is easy for me to handle and I am happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> I use this mug with an Omega #10098 brush and Classic Brand Soap.  The additional length of the bristles and handle make it easy to whip up a nice solid lather.  With a shorter brush, I constantly hit the side of the mug with the handle.  If you are planning to use this with shaving soap puck, buy the 2-1\2 inch pucks that fit perfectly in the bottom of the mug</li>
            <li> I bought this to take the place of a small bowl that I bought.  The bowl was terrible as it did not allow for enough room to get a good lather started, without spilling the lather all over.  this can be used either in the shower, or at a sink.  I would really recommend to anyone that is looking to use shave soap instead of the canned foam.</li>
            <li> This mug is a bit smaller than I had hoped but it does the job with certain soaps.  I may end up buying a shaving bowl instead.</li>
            <li> Is a very functional mug that provides function and ease of handling. Wasn&#x27;t sure about the knob handle as was used to having the coffee mug style in the past, but was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> So i ordered one of those nice shiny stainless steel &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; cups only to find it was too small.  I replaced it with this mug and i absolutely love it.  it&#x27;s the perfect size to mix shaving cream with a brush.  I wish i had ordered this mug first.</li>
            <li> Whats there to say? This gets the job done, and the handle is comfortable to hold.  The shaving cream, when rinsed, leaves a white residue on the cup. I&#x27;m new to DE shaving, so I&#x27;m not sure if thats normal, of if the finish on this just stains easily. If you were to get a white cup you would never notice. So I appreciate that the cup is black and lets me see the white residue. It ensures that I don&#x27;t let my shaving equipment build up grime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that would make this better is if it heated up your shaving cream...but then we are talking about an entirely different product.</li>
            <li> It came as a white mug instead of black, just keep that in mind. Works well.</li>
            <li> This shaving mug is just what I was looking for. I use shaving soap for my shaves and they are a perfect fit for this mug.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and heavy duty.</li>
            <li> Needs a rubber base to prevent chipping.</li>
            <li> Holds shaving soap. Works great.</li>
            <li> Well made mug and decorative.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last night.  I did not have a problem working up a mean lather with it that made my razor glide over my face like a smooth piece of glass.  It is a little deep but nothing to be upset about.  And hey a little too deep is better than a little too shallow.</li>
            <li> I am a novice in the safety razor shaving world so I was buying everything recommended to create a good shaving a experience.  This shaving mug is nice and serves its purpose, but is too big for my needs. If you are going to create a lot of lather then this might suit your purpose, but for the regular shaver a smaller mug will suffice</li>
            <li> Item arrived chipped. My husband opened it on Christmas, he didn&#x27;t mind it...but i did. I shopped a long time for the perfect gift.</li>
            <li> This is a very attractive shaving mug. It looks great sitting on the shelf in the bathroom next to my razor stand. The handle makes it easy to hold with wet hands.</li>
            <li> Nice - seemingly well made - unremarkable shaving mug. My advice is to just use a coffee mug or else go the whole nine yards and buy a shaving scuttle. Now THAT&#x27;S something that will really set you up right. Georgetown Pottery makes an extremely nice one:[[ASIN:B00H7Z2EAK Georgetown Pottery G12 Shaving Scuttle Mug - Hamada &amp; Blue]]</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. Bought it friday morning and received it Saturday at 11am. Tested it out after I received it and it works great!</li>
            <li> I love this cup.  I would recommend it to anyone. especially people with retro tastes</li>
            <li> Overall, the quality and appearance of the cup is nice.  For me, however, the base of the cup just seemed to deep and narrow for me to work the brush around in.  So much so, that I stopped using it after the first couple of times.  I think a small open bowl, like a soap dish, would probably be easier to use.  If you want to save a few dollars, you could always lather the shaving cream in your hand or directly on your face as I&#x27;m doing now, although I&#x27;ll probably purchase some sort of bowl in the future.</li>
            <li> This mug is a little too small I have a hard time making a lather in it. However it looks great.</li>
            <li> Great shaving mug. Holds Colonel Conk&#x27;s shaving soaps perfectly. I have no problems with it being to deep. I have big hands so I am able to use by brush with no problems. The handle is perfect for holding the mug as I lather up the soap. All in All this is a perfect mug for the price.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the mug is a little too deep. Other than that the mug is very nice</li>
            <li> Kids&#x27; gift purchase for dad - he loves this shaving mug, easy to handle, easyt o clean, retro fun! Purchase with Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush for great value dad gift....</li>
            <li> Though the picture is black, the mug I received was white -- not what I wanted, but didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning.</li>
            <li> not worth it money you paid</li>
            <li> Too deep to get a good lather. I&#x27;m using a bowl from kitchen that is better. Wouldn&#x27;t recomend to anyone</li>
            <li> Great shaving mug. Nice and heavy means it won&#x27;t slip out of your hands.</li>
            <li> Great gift! Well made</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time today. Worked great.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a shaving bowl that didn&#x27;t hold much lather before it overflowed from the sides. This is much better, allows you to build more lather. Quality seems fine, easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Great value for the money and looks and works great! Bought it as a gift and the recipient loved it.</li>
            <li> Found a very apparent flaw on the lip, but prior e is great and it will serve.  (Bigger than expected, which makes me happy.)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband with his first safety razor.  The ceramic mug is well made, and serves its purpose.  The only negative is that it&#x27;s deep, and can make whipping up shaving cream a little more challenging; my husband prefers a shallower dish.  For those who prefer something deeper, this is perfect, as well as making an ideal gift.</li>
            <li> Good shaving mug, although if the klink of the wood brush against the mug would be irritating, I suggest you look elsewhere. The shape is okay, not perfect, as I&#x27;d almost prefer it to have a more bulbous shape as opposed to this &#x27;chopped off tornado&#x27; shape that it has. The mouth is plenty wide but it gets somewhat bothersome since it narrows down towards the end. All in all, totally worth the money and I&#x27;m fairly happy with the purchase despite the relatively minor drawbacks.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product, arrived on time and everything went well.  I always wanted a shaving mug in this fashion!</li>
            <li> Holds soap perfectly.</li>
            <li> I had to send the first order back because the mug arrived with a broken handle. I received a new mug back; it is very well made looks very nice on the sink. It is very breakable and needs to handled with care . I love the product and great customer service.</li>
            <li> Quality mug that I have used every day since I bought it.  My only complaint is the over all size.  I was using a smaller mug before it broke and I bought this one.  This mug is huge compared to the one I was using and I find the handle of my shave brush hitting the sides every time I use it.  This makes a good amount of noise unless I am very careful.  Perhaps I will look for a brush with longer bristles to see if that will help.  Other than that its a great product.</li>
            <li> First, I shave my head and face 3 days a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the shape and weight of this mug. It is well made and seem like it would last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that i have a standard size brush and it seems like the handle should be about 2 inches longer. it seems like y big paw is deep in the cup. So it takes me a little more effort to get that perfect lather that I like.</li>
            <li> Not great at all... its to deep!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was the one shaving accessory missing from my bathroom . I usually shave in the shower unless I have a lot of time to do it right, but I do take my proraso soap and brush in with me no matter what. The mug makes it easy to whip up a great, stiff lather in the shower while protecting it from shower . When I&#x27;m done, the mug is a convenient holster for my (inverted) brush and razor while in finish my shower. The knob handle provides a secure, comfortable grip. Can&#x27;t find a thing to complain about. Love it!</li>
            <li> I wanted an auxillary mug to use to build lather ALONE. This mug was too big and did not work right for what I intended. It&#x27;s a  sexy mug, well made but not what I needed/what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Nice came quickly. Perfect</li>
            <li> Very nice shaving mug for the money. I really like mine.</li>
            <li> A bit deep,all in all. Great shaving mug!</li>
            <li> this mug was perfect for what I needed. Well made heavyand good looking.I&#x27;ve had no issues with the depth of the mug as many people have complained about though I do have A nice wood handled shave brush. it also does a good job holding in heat for a nice comfortable shave. For the cost I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Easy to hold, and with the knob on the side it gives me more options. The knob does not get in the way of holding the cup like any other, but allows more hand positions.</li>
            <li> My husband has gotten into shaving with lather and is really enjoying his shaving cup. He just retired and it is one of the little things he is now enjoying because he has the time to do so.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too deep.  It&#x27;s pretty hard to work up a good lather in this because it makes holding the brush awkward.  If you&#x27;ve got a longer handled brush with some long bristles, I imagine this would be perfect!  I&#x27;m currently using an escali badger hair brush and it just wasn&#x27;t working out for me.</li>
            <li> Love the old-school feel while shaving.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to my father. It&#x27;s sturdy and a little old school. I put him an old fashioned shave kit together.  He loved it!</li>
            <li> A very nice mug. Pretty well balanced but I would like to know what what brand and size of soap would fit this mug the best.</li>
            <li> This mug works just find. I personally prefer a more shallow, wider mug or bowl. Although the knob gives the mug that this-ain&#x27;t-your-coffee-mug look, with wet and slippery hands a normal drinking mug would work better...and be cheaper too. The other issue is that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much standardization amongst shaving soap companies about the size of pucks. Only my Colonel Conk shaving soap looks the right size to fit. This is more a criticism of the shaving soaps than this mug. Every shaving soap brand I have bought so far has a slightly different size.&lt;br /&gt;I gave the mug 3 stars because it looks good and works ok but not stellar. I now buy shallow wooden bowls here on Amazon for $6 each, shipped, for my other soaps. They are cheaper, work better for me, and for the cost, I can have multiple loaded with a variety of soaps so I can just grab whichever scent fits my mood that day.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Grandson who is about to be a teen.  It&#x27;s perfect!  Good size, sturdy, and masculine looking.  He will be both surprised and pleased.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> the style of this mug seems a very good design as far as the type of handle-easy to use. But the smaller diameter of the bottom of the mug is quite small. I had to look for a while online to get a soap that would fit. I ended up with Col Cronk&#x27;s Worlds Famous Shaving Soap, Bay Rum, 2.25 oz.</li>
            <li> Great and good looking mug.  I will give years of service.</li>
            <li> Way too small to lather with a brush. Best thing to use is a cappuccino mug, $3 at Target</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for Christmas and he loves it, and it wasn&#x27;t very expensive but it&#x27;s really good quality.</li>
            <li> Very nice mug. Easy to clean and maintain with good brush depth too.  Holds heat well and saturates brush very well.  The handle is easy to hold mug with and is overall a great design!</li>
            <li> I wish I had been able to get one in a different color but this was the only one at the time. I do like the handle, I don&#x27;t feel like I am drinking my morning coffee while trying to shave. I only wish the inner diameter were a bit larger, maybe 1/4&amp;#34; or so to accommodate some of the bars I have received or that the bottom had ridges or something rougher to help bring up the lather when I am using my cream. Even with those minor issues, and they are mine really not the cups, this is a perfect addition to my shaving routine. When I am done it rinses/dries out quickly and holds my brush and razor body neatly. I prefer to have less things on the vanity so I just use the cup to store those items when not in use rather then a stand that tarnishes/dulls or takes up too much space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mouth of the cup is wide enough to work your brush and build your lather without feeling like you have to jam your hand in to the cup.</li>
            <li> looks good works great!!</li>
            <li> It works for the job.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of room for mixing but it works.</li>
            <li> A must have if you love shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cup and it holds shaving soap. I won&#x27;t help you win the lottery, or make your car run better, but it will keep the shaving soap contained for a close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Easier to use than the small prorasso tubs</li>
            <li> Simple, well made and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what it looks like.</li>
            <li> Soap  fits  fine  easy  to  handle</li>
            <li> This is a great quality bowl which gives you enough room to mix up your shaving cream and give you a perfect lather because if you love shaving you need a good bowl and this is perfect</li>
            <li> Good looking heavy duty mug. This gets a lot of use &amp; holding up nicely.</li>
            <li> Entirely too small for my soap disks. I don&#x27;t even use it anymore.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my son as a gift. He said it was too small.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Easy to handle.</li>
            <li> great quality, but seems slightly large. Most all of them are, but I&#x27;m used to the smaller, Old Spice coffee-cup handle mugs</li>
            <li> Quality product but the base is small for my brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shaving mug! It works.. no complaints, more durable than I expected.. dropped it once on accident while whipping up my cream and it survived the fall with no damage.</li>
            <li> Product as described.  I now wish I would have just used a bowl as it is easier to lather in a bowl if you have a short handled brush.  I think that if aesthetics are important this could still be a good option.  It certainly looks better on the sink than an old cereal bowl.</li>
            <li> Fits in my hand, keeps my lather warm, and looks pretty good. Hard to argue.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, but far too small for what it&#x27;s intended for.  Makes a half decent paper weight.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, as advertised! Very happy with product.</li>
            <li> Love the mug- it is big enough so that the lather doesnt spill over the sides, and the handle is very easy and ergonomic</li>
            <li> Product arrived as described.  Like the handle on the side to hang on to as the mug can get slipppery when wet and soapy.</li>
