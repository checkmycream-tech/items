            <li> , my braun shaver works like new again.</li>
            <li> Replacing the old parts is like having a new razor.</li>
            <li> getting old</li>
            <li> I want the old style please.</li>
            <li> It might possibly have been worse.i sent the first one back because the cutter was not cutting my beard but was cutting my face.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the difference between the two other than the price.</li>
            <li> I concur with other reviews concerning the foil.</li>
            <li> enough not many places keep this in stock....</li>
            <li> In fact, I held it between my fingers with a slight pressure and it broke in half.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Actually my required time to shave is half of what it was previously!</li>
            <li> The next one that arrived had a broken foil.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this foil.</li>
            <li> It is lighter in weight than the last one and was broken inside the pack.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive after reading a few of the negative reviews, but decided to give it a shot anyways.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was a bit slow.</li>
            <li> Last time i bought the least expensive one and was rather disappointed, so this time I purchased the more expensive one and continue to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the Braun 51S Replacement Foil and Cutter do not fit my razor.  </li>
            <li> but it was awful.</li>

            <li> Received what I ordered and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the Braun 51S Replacement Foil and Cutter do not fit my razor.  I will be returning them, and ordering the correct parts.</li>
            <li> Good price.  Right product</li>
            <li> Part fit right in, works like new</li>
            <li> Works amazingly! Nice close shave</li>
            <li> This made my husband&#x27;s older Braun Series 5 Electric Razor perform as new. The durability on the foil isn&#x27;t that great and has to be replaced every year or so, which is the basis for the 4 star rating. My husband wishes it would last longer.</li>
            <li> It was Ono better then the one that I replaced. It might possibly have been worse.i sent the first one back because the cutter was not cutting my beard but was cutting my face. I sent that one back. The next one that arrived had a broken foil. I don&#x27;t know who is responsible for this but it was awful. If I,could have put zero stars I would have done so.</li>
            <li> Shipping was pretty slow, but the product arrived safe and was as described.</li>
            <li> There are two replacement cassette . Last time i bought the least expensive one and was rather disappointed, so this time I purchased the more expensive one and continue to be disappointed. I don&#x27;t know the difference between the two other than the price. Can someone explain this to me.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery  good quality thanks</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. I was a little apprehensive after reading a few of the negative reviews, but decided to give it a shot anyways.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  Fits perfectly and works well.</li>
            <li> I concur with other reviews concerning the foil. It is a cheap replacement which did not fit comfortably on my shaver. In fact, I held it between my fingers with a slight pressure and it broke in half. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this foil. The blades were great.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and fit, as I have replaced this before, but the razor itself is in great shape and harder to find replacements.</li>

            <li> excellent shaver. The very best.</li>
            <li> Gives real close shaves</li>
            <li> Original quality, great replacement cutter assembly. Shaver works like new again  Vendor shipped quickly and packaging was great.</li>
            <li> The foil is a piece of junk. It is lighter in weight than the last one and was broken inside the pack.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m changing my 5 star to 3 stars. because, the foil is beginning to unravel on both sides nicking  my face. I just purchased this in Feb. &#x27;15 now I have to purchase another one. It&#x27;s only bn 7 months.</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed to make my shaver &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; again.  I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> very good replacement .I love it.</li>
            <li> Worked perfect on my 360 shaver</li>

            <li> great product for the price, my braun shaver works like new again.</li>
            <li> This is obviously different than the one that came with the shaver. It&#x27;s more flimsy, noticeably cheaper design and manufacture.  The first one I got broke, and had to return it.  I want the old style please.</li>
            <li> Both foil and cutter cassette functioned well.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my Braun.  Replacing the old parts is like having a new razor.</li>
