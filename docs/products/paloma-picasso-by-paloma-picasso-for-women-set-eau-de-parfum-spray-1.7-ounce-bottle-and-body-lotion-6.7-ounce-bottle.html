            <li>The price was much better than in a department store.</li>

            <li>This is an old favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>and I found it here at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Perfume &amp; lotion were as described and the shipping was EXTREMELY fast!</li>
            <li>my favorite perfume for the last 20 years.  </li>
            <li>The scent is really intoxicating!</li>
            <li>It smelled like cheap, loud perfume.  </li>
            <li>It may have been very old, but it just didn&#x27;t smell right.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>It did not smell fresh but had an old smell to it.</li>
            <li>Paloma Picasso has become harder to find, but it is still one of my favorite scents.  </li>
            <li>Not too heavy but a light clean scent.</li>

            <li>I was surprised to find this set at a reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Picasso for many years, and it&#x27;s now hard to find in stores, replaced by all the new scents.  </li>
            <li>I thought the set would come in a box, like what is pictured but instead came in clear plastic bag.</li>
            <li>I was a bit trepeditious, hoping it wasn&#x27;t from some old warehoused stockpile.  </li>
            <li>But this one have different scent not like real one.</li>
            <li>Its smell like old \\&quot;pee\\&quot;.(Sorry but its true!)Iam to scare to use it.</li>
            <li>It is womanly, somewhat sophisticated, noticeable but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>But when we received it, we were so excited to see it was the exact same item we have previously purchased, but at almost half the price.  </li>
            <li>its come in clear red with decor.</li>

            <li> I purchased for my Mother and she loves this fragrance. Smells awesome</li>
            <li> ....my favorite wintertime smell....  :)</li>
            <li> My mother-in-law loves this perfume and we buy it for her every year at Christmas.  If we buy this combo at the department store we pay around $75.  When I found this at Amazon, I was a bit skepticle because the price was so good.  I thought once we received it the size of the perfume and lotion would be smaller than what we purchase at the department store.  But when we received it, we were so excited to see it was the exact same item we have previously purchased, but at almost half the price.  FABULOUS!!!!</li>
            <li> Received on time.great value</li>
            <li> My aunt&#x27;s favorite fragrance and was easy to find</li>
            <li> I thought the set would come in a box, like what is pictured but instead came in clear plastic bag. Perfume &amp; lotion were as described and the shipping was EXTREMELY fast! Thanks for the quick shipping!</li>
            <li> My friend loved this gift set. She has been wearing this perfume for years and it was a nice surprise for her.</li>
            <li> I have always loved the fragrance of this perfume.  I was looking around for just the perfume and lotion and I found it here at a very reasonable price.  Quick delivery also.</li>
            <li> I have a very hard time finding perfume that stays with me.  I think it is one of the nicest compliments a woman can get...&amp;#34;you smell nice&amp;#34;.  What a deal...lotion and perfume together.</li>
            <li> Just what my lady wanted!!</li>
            <li> Had picked up a sample hand lotion while on vacation.&lt;br /&gt;Could never find this perfume, till I looked for it ON LINE. It is a little heavy, but want to smell what I wear. Not some weak smell.&lt;br /&gt;The wrapping was unusual to say the least, but the order was perfect when opened. Looked like it had come from an upscale dept. store. Recommend the Seller.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Not too heavy but a light clean scent.</li>
            <li> Awesome to find my mom&#x27;s favorite perfume on here! Seller got product to us on time and was a great value for the price. Appreciate how easy it was to purchase. My mom was very happy with her gift! Will continue to buy this product (and possibly others) through this seller.</li>
            <li> She has loved it since it came first out.  It is womanly, somewhat sophisticated, noticeable but not overwhelming. People always ask her what the fragrance is, even when just using the lotion --it lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li> Every now and then I like to buy Paloma and I like to buy it with the body cream because it is just lovely. Just as promised.</li>
            <li> has always been my fav. frag.!</li>
            <li> Ihave been wearing this scent for years and years. Best price I have found for the product is AMAZON.  I get great compliments.</li>

            <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY VERY SPECIAL AUNT. IT SMELT SO GOOD ON HER AND SHE JUST LOVED IT SO MUCH SO I KEPT HER STOCKED UP. AFTER MY LAST PURCHASED SHE DIDN&#x27;T GET TO RECEIVE IT DUE TO THE FACT SHE PAST AWAY A FEW DAYS BEFORE. BUT I DO RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE THAT WANTS TO STAND OUT AND GET A LOT OF GREAT COMMENTS.</li>

            <li> Smells great on my wife that likes floral. She loves the lotion as the scent last all day and the spray for special or &amp;#34;feel-good&amp;#34; occasions. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this perfume! Kind of glad I don&#x27;t know many women who know about it! The scent it leaves lingering in a room is captivating. I&#x27;ve had women follow me to ask what I&#x27;m wearing! Use with care, a little goes a long way!</li>

I was surprised to find this set at a reasonable cost.  I was a bit trepeditious, hoping it wasn&#x27;t from some old warehoused stockpile.  I was delighted to recieve it very quickly, nicely boxed, full-sized and with the same wonderful fragrance.  This was an excellent deal with absolutely no negatives to any of it:  the cost, the product, the shipping.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to order it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s one of my favorite fragrances.  To me it smells lavenderie,musky which is an acceptable smell to the patients I see everyday in a really busy ER.  One tiny, tiny squirt is all that&#x27;s needed to last all shift.</li>
            <li> Paloma Picasso is my favorite fragrance of all time.This gift set came with lotion and a spray.  I love to wear it; it smells so good.</li>
            <li> I love Paloma Picasso.But this one have different scent not like real one.Its smell like old \\&quot;pee\\&quot;.(Sorry but its true!)Iam to scare to use it.And box not like suppostu be(on the picture its more look like real one) but its come in clear red with decor.Don&#x27;t buy it.For sure you can buy online in Macys real one.</li>
            <li> The body lotion seemed to have been on the shelf for awhile. It did not smell fresh but had an old smell to it. I have used this product before and it never smelt this way before. I am not happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite perfume and all I wear, every day, every occasion. I know all perfume doesnt&#x27; work for the same person but this has worked for me for many years. It&#x27;s wonderfuL!</li>
            <li> My go to set, will be ordering again soon - hope it is still available as it is not in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Received eau de toilet in gold bottle, not perfume as advertised. This shows black bottle in advert, which is not correct</li>
            <li> Paloma Picasso has become harder to find, but it is still one of my favorite scents.  I love to use the scented lotions when traveling because then I don&#x27;t have to carry liquid perfumes with me.  The price was much better than in a department store.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because my wife asked me to get it for her &amp;#34;birthday present&amp;#34;. It appears that she really love it, and I personally love the smell when she wears it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Picasso for many years, and it&#x27;s now hard to find in stores, replaced by all the new scents.  I get so many compliments when i wear it.  i was so pleased to find the gift pack with the lotion!</li>
            <li> This is an old favorite of mine. It is a scent that never changes and I am happy to have it again</li>
            <li> It smelled like cheap, loud perfume.  It may have been very old, but it just didn&#x27;t smell right.</li>
            <li> Have been looking for this for  a long time it&#x27;s a great scent that last for a whole day and I found it at a great price and will be ordering many more for Christmas gifts</li>
            <li> What a deal! This is my favorite fragrance. It is a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> loved the product and was happy to find it.</li>
