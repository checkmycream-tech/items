            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this fragrance for both girls and GUYS!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, delightful, and bold!</li>
            <li>But it softens up and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>amazing.  </li>
            <li>its amazing</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing</li>
            <li>I was given this cologne as a gift and honestly after smelling it I put it on my dresser and that&#x27;s where it sat.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice blend of both a man and a woman in my opinion, and once I&#x27;m done this bottle</li>
            <li>Love unisex smell and makes me feel good to wear without that nose tingling side effect.</li>
            <li>Wife liked the smell and wanted it.</li>
            <li>One of the best colognes , I highly recommended !</li>
            <li>n try it and its actually nice</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>I had not even had a chance to smell it before ordering it, so I was hoping when I received it I liked the smell.</li>
            <li>It is absolute delicious, I received the product within a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>To each his own I guess</li>
            <li>I also bought Kim which is a nice fragrance</li>
            <li>so everyone can have there own...</li>
            <li>love love love it!!</li>
            <li>the bottle is quite large and it&#x27;s a nice shape!!</li>
            <li>Very quick, good experience.</li>
            <li>My son loved the scent and agreed that it is to strong for women but works well for men</li>
            <li>I was real excited to find out that Khloe and Lamar were coming out with a unisex scent</li>
            <li>Awesome, light and crisp</li>
            <li>but later it had a very nice feminine sweet scent to it, which I was REAL happy about!  </li>
            <li>Super cheap, and smells great,</li>
            <li>Nice, just as expected and good price!!</li>
            <li>Smells better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this perfume.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend loves it even more than I do, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought it when I visited the DASH store in Los Angeles.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Everyone who smells me love it</li>
            <li>Love this scent.  </li>
            <li>but the compliments I got were fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of guys cologne</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Better price than the stores.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Its a mixture of a man and a woman favorite perfume and cologne together.</li>
            <li>However, I think its smells more for a man, tnan for a girl.  </li>
            <li>Unisex I love it wear it</li>
            <li>The smell of unbreakable is so completely sexy everyone loves it.  </li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>But I love it :]</li>
            <li>w/out 2 many floral accents.  </li>
            <li>It makes you just want to buy more and more.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite scents a go to fragrance</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to buy this without smelling it</li>
            <li>smells like love in a bottle.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I like this one better than unbreakable love.  </li>
            <li>This is ANOTHER one of my wife&#x27;s favorite scent</li>
            <li>Love it, I&#x27;m wearing it now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s more of a fall and winter scent for me.</li>
            <li>Over time, the more \\&quot;manly\\&quot; notes do fade on this</li>
            <li>If you are one of those woman like me that tends to like more the smell of men&#x27;s cologne more than women, this is for you.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this scent.</li>
            <li>CHEAP!</li>
            <li>I can tell you that this is this 100 times better than CK One</li>
            <li>I still love the Kim K perfume more</li>
            <li>I Love the smell of the two man and woman put together me</li>

            <li>I get so many compliments on this.</li>
            <li>I always love perfumes that can go either way.</li>
            <li>which was a surprise :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of the Kardashians for a while now and even thought Kim is Kris&#x27; favorite, Khloe has always been mine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that Khloe decided to release a unisex scent with Lamar, instead of just a women&#x27;s perfume like Kim.</li>
            <li>B00B608EV0 Khloe and Lamar Eau de Parfum Spray, Unbreakable Love, 3.4 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just that I was expecting something that didn&#x27;t smell like it was geared more towards men than women.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>I love the sent and so does everyone at my job.</li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>Just love the smell of this</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this perfume smell.</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>And get so many compliments.</li>
            <li>but I have to say this is much better.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I LOVE it</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and people love to hug me all the time because of it.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more feminine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other scents I love are Armani Mania (White),Narciso Rodriguez For Her EDP,</li>
            <li>I fell in love.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering 2 more bottles</li>
            <li>My husband and I both LOVE this scent.</li>
            <li>But once he tried it he fell in love with it too.</li>
            <li>Its very unique...</li>
            <li>and I really quickly began to get used to the scent and really love it!</li>
            <li>Women will see you as strong and confident (because you smell like a sexy dude).</li>
            <li>and I loved the smell on him, very clean smelling on him; but my first impression was \\&quot;this is a man&#x27;s cologne.\\</li>
            <li>My manager told me today that I smelt so good and that she wants some for her husband!</li>
            <li>It smells so good at first</li>
            <li>It is fun to share with him!!</li>
            <li>So worth under $30!!</li>
            <li>Unique!</li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed !</li>
            <li>It is not too strong like most colognes are, but not too feminine either.</li>
            <li>Some people feel it&#x27;s too strong or really love it.  </li>
            <li>He loved it so much that he had me order more online.</li>
            <li>Smells very good and lasting.</li>
            <li>the bottle is cheap design, the top fell off soon as I receive it.</li>
            <li>I WILL admit, when I first smelled it, I wasn&#x27;t very pleased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so unique, and I love that it is UNISEX</li>
            <li>Absolutely loved my new perfume!</li>
            <li>a pretty nice value..it is a huge bottle..</li>
            <li>I first tried it, I quickly fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>Everyone noticed it and said what is that fabulous scent you&#x27;re wearing?  </li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t pass it up with such a great price.</li>
            <li>but this scent is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Smells good but doesn&#x27;t last more than 4 hrs...</li>
            <li>I think it suits for a male better but still smells good for either sex.</li>
            <li>Smells really good - of course your natural scent makes a difference</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been wearing this scent for some time now, and I was very excited to find it on Amazon for such a good price.</li>
            <li>The scent is clean smelling, unique and can easily be worn by either gender.</li>
            <li>then it eases up to be very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Received well protected package and item in original wrapping.</li>
            <li>, it was SO worth it!</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth the risk in my opinion!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll be buying another one.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the original..  </li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>It has a very unique smell and I love the mix of masculine and feminine!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and really is a unisex scent, although a bit on the masculine side for me.  </li>
            <li>Khole &amp; Lamar have hit the nail right on the head when it comes to a unisex fragrance!</li>
            <li>I went ahead and purchased it without smelling it first, which I have never been brave enough to do before.</li>
            <li>I loved this fragrance ever since I smelled it 2 years ago but never bought the big bottle because it cost $60, so when i found it for $18 I bought it immediately.</li>
            <li>its so cool</li>
            <li>It is not too sweet, and has a hint of musk to it.</li>
            <li>and I loved it instantly!</li>
            <li>Overall good product recommend</li>
            <li>I still cannot believe how cheap it is, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I am currently in search of finding a good shower foam/gel which enhances well in combination with this</li>
            <li>At first it is somewhat strong but as the smell smoothens, it also changes.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that smells fresh and clean......</li>
            <li>time smell faded quickly</li>
            <li>definitely a perfect combination of a male and female scent!</li>
            <li>The smell fades quickly..  </li>
            <li>The seller is my favorite for several reasons: the cost, delivery, packaging and I was able to track it myself.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m going to a cocktail party, I&#x27;ll sometimes blend a spritz of this with Provocative Woman by Elizabeth Arden for a scent that&#x27;s sexy, confident, and a little more feminine than this perfume on</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t necessarily smell masculine or feminine, it just smells good!</li>
            <li>Light and pretty scent, can&#x27;t imagine it in a man though, even though they say it&#x27;s unisex...  </li>
            <li>Then the vanilla and floral notes started to warm up on my skin, and the sweet and sultry scent was enough to drive my beau bonkers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks Khloe and Lamar, keep them coming!!</li>
            <li>and It got here fast!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always bought and used colognes, and although I like ones such as Beckham Signature and Deisel, there&#x27;s always something about most colognes that&#x27;s too strong.</li>
            <li>This perfume gets me in trouble, lol...</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s different and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Thanks to seller, I really appreciate this item :)</li>
            <li>Unbreakable is a refreshing and classy fragrance.</li>
            <li>On top of it, I&#x27;m a very girly girl and was nervous this would be too much of a \\&quot;guy\\&quot; scent.  </li>
            <li>Smells so fresh.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny</li>
            <li>surely worth the 44  </li>
            <li>, This is the third time I buy this same perfume and looking forward to getting it many times more, I absolutely recommend it!!!!</li>
            <li>I like to think of Unbreakable as bold but fresh, having strength but also being soft and clean.</li>
            <li>So I was lookin around for a new perfume; I have Kim Kardashains original one</li>
            <li>and now i finally got it :)</li>
            <li>i love nautica voyage, Pi givinchy , christian audigier but</li>
            <li>The only scent I wear, Love It......</li>
            <li>This fragrance is lovely and lasting.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this fragrance, and I can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
            <li>but I received exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>some say its more for the male</li>
            <li>The first spray, I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Men will see you as an equal (because you smell like a sexy dude).</li>
            <li>I love the fact that is so unique and masculine/feminine mixture without being extremely manly, I always get compliments when wearing it</li>
            <li>Oddly enough it smelled better when they were together.</li>
            <li>He first sprayed it on him</li>
            <li>&quot; I then sprayed it on myself and at first I smelt like a dude</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what The seller describes</li>
            <li>Soft light smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly like the product we bought from their store in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a (not particularly feminine) male, and the scent of this, though flowery, has been well appreciated by my girlfriend and friends on me, my girlfriend also wears it with great satisfaction, regardless of your gender, the soft yet pleasant smell will work for you, unless you&#x27;re a man who likes the uber-musky, overbearing scents that scream male.</li>
            <li>Item was exactly how it was described in the ad...</li>
            <li>It is definitely a Unisex scent tending towards more of a man&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li>This is BY FAR my new favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This scent is great but it doesn&#x27;t last very long on my skin.</li>
            <li>Large amount for very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It really captures the whole idea of what a unisex fragrance is supposed to smell like!</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been looking pretty much everywhere for this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It smelled too much like Clementine/Orange when I first sprayed it, and I&#x27;m not used to my perfumes smelling that fruity.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was shipped pretty fast</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my daughter, I love this fragrance because it is both subtle and elegant at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast</li>
            <li>And really, thats all that matters.  </li>
            <li>its very manly if you as me</li>
            <li>I work with patients in really close proximity</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves the smell as well.</li>
            <li>i really like kloe and lamar</li>
            <li>I also thought the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>That being said this is really a cologne(imo).</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really see a woman wanting to wear this...</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>The scent is very agreeable to either sex.  </li>
            <li>It has that fruity, citrus-y scent to it, but with darker, stronger undertones like chocolate and tonka bean to even it out and make it more masculine at the same time.</li>
            <li>I prefer a more masculine scent than this personally</li>
            <li>I receive at least 3 complements a day on how good I smell...</li>
            <li>I am pretty pickey about this sort of thing, I haven&#x27;t found a new perfume I like for a couple of years now.</li>
            <li>It smells different on her than me, that&#x27;s the cool part.</li>
            <li>I have found my new scent!</li>
            <li>decent longevity.  </li>
            <li>i was kinda steady for getting this because i didnt want to smell like a guy</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m careful not to wear strong scents.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I highly suggest purchasing this fragrance.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product and buying from this seller.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li>Like one of these other reviews, I do actually smell a little chocolate, vanilla, and even orange, but that just makes it all the more amazing.  </li>
            <li>It has a hint of masculinity, which makes it a little sexy, and makes it wearable for a man.</li>
            <li>It has that masculine scent but also a very girly fruity and flowery scent to it as well.  </li>
            <li>BUT, I tried a few more sprays</li>
            <li>Have never smelled it, but ordered because I actually like more masculine smelling perfumes such as eternity aqua and ck one...</li>
            <li>it is a little soft [more girly] once the scent settles in.</li>
            <li>The packaging is the same, looks identical to original, but not quite the same.  </li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>The fragrance was not what I expected it to be but its not a bad thing I&#x27;ve never smelled b4 buying it</li>
            <li>so u don&#x27;t have much to loss but the one thing I will say is most likely unless I really have to I don&#x27;t plan on ordering den this saler again due to the fact that it took way to long for me to get it</li>
            <li>the .9 pounds is a large enough bottle.</li>
            <li>Clearly a knock out..</li>
            <li>but you won&#x27;t smell like you just put on Old Spice</li>
            <li>underrated by far.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t believe the price and shipped early.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old sons also loves to use it.</li>
            <li>I do wear this just not everyday.</li>
            <li>It goes on Masculine</li>
            <li>Getting ready to pull the trigger on my 3rd bottle I decided to write this review...</li>
            <li>It IS a little bit on the feminine side, which I was a little iffy about at first, but the more you smell it</li>
            <li>has a great musky smell that can be confused for a  male or female scent, and the smell is different on each person.</li>
            <li>the first spray seems like dudes cologne, but dries down a soft floral..like it!</li>
            <li>I love it, I buy from Italy because here is so hard to find!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re left behind with something that is positively suitable for either or any</li>
            <li>I was worried it would be too masculine, but it&#x27;s definitely not.</li>
            <li>surprised that I actually like this!</li>
            <li>Most of my favorite celebrities (Britney Spears comes to mind) only cater to their female fan base when it comes to perfume and cologne.</li>
            <li>So as a guy I was a little nervous to order this without smelling it first, but I figure if a guy like Lamar could wear it, so could I.&lt;br /&gt;I am an athlete as well and didn&#x27;t want something that would smell feminine, but also living in sunny</li>
            <li>The chocolate notes were the first thing to hit me and I thought to myself \\&quot;well, this is only just a little bit racist\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I could really care less about Khloe and Lamar</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this perfume is original, as I have noticed that the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last very long when I use it...  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and at a much less expensive price!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a nice blend of both a man and a woman in my opinion, and once I&#x27;m done this bottle</li>
            <li> Love unisex smell and makes me feel good to wear without that nose tingling side effect.</li>
            <li> Wife liked the smell and wanted it.</li>
            <li> One of the best colognes , I highly recommended !</li>
            <li> n try it and its actually nice</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> I had not even had a chance to smell it before ordering it, so I was hoping when I received it I liked the smell.</li>
            <li> It is absolute delicious, I received the product within a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> To each his own I guess</li>
            <li> I also bought Kim which is a nice fragrance</li>
            <li> so everyone can have there own...</li>
            <li> love love love it!!</li>
            <li> the bottle is quite large and it&#x27;s a nice shape!!</li>
            <li> Very quick, good experience.</li>
            <li> My son loved the scent and agreed that it is to strong for women but works well for men</li>
            <li> I was real excited to find out that Khloe and Lamar were coming out with a unisex scent</li>
            <li> Awesome, light and crisp</li>
            <li> but later it had a very nice feminine sweet scent to it, which I was REAL happy about!  </li>
            <li> Super cheap, and smells great,</li>
            <li> Nice, just as expected and good price!!</li>
            <li> Smells better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it even more than I do, so</li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Everyone who smells me love it</li>

            <li> Better price than the stores.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Its a mixture of a man and a woman favorite perfume and cologne together.</li>
            <li> However, I think its smells more for a man, tnan for a girl.  </li>
            <li> Unisex I love it wear it</li>
            <li> The smell of unbreakable is so completely sexy everyone loves it.  </li>

            <li> It makes you just want to buy more and more.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents a go to fragrance</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to buy this without smelling it</li>
            <li> smells like love in a bottle.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell.  </li>
            <li> I like this one better than unbreakable love.  </li>
            <li> This is ANOTHER one of my wife&#x27;s favorite scent</li>
            <li> Love it, I&#x27;m wearing it now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s more of a fall and winter scent for me.</li>
            <li> Over time, the more \\&quot;manly\\&quot; notes do fade on this</li>
            <li> If you are one of those woman like me that tends to like more the smell of men&#x27;s cologne more than women, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent.</li>
            <li> CHEAP!</li>
            <li> I can tell you that this is this 100 times better than CK One</li>
            <li> I still love the Kim K perfume more</li>
            <li> I Love the smell of the two man and woman put together me</li>
            <li> is really big and smells delicious</li>
            <li> so I like it better on my daughter</li>
            <li> females love the cologne on me.</li>
            <li> I have many as gifts</li>
            <li> Love it</li>

            <li> he should try to wear it also! :)</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this.</li>
            <li> I always love perfumes that can go either way.</li>
            <li> which was a surprise :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of the Kardashians for a while now and even thought Kim is Kris&#x27; favorite, Khloe has always been mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that Khloe decided to release a unisex scent with Lamar, instead of just a women&#x27;s perfume like Kim.</li>
            <li> B00B608EV0 Khloe and Lamar Eau de Parfum Spray, Unbreakable Love, 3.4 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just that I was expecting something that didn&#x27;t smell like it was geared more towards men than women.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> I love the sent and so does everyone at my job.</li>
            <li> Love love love.</li>
            <li> Just love the smell of this</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this perfume smell.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> And get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> but I have to say this is much better.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I LOVE it</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and people love to hug me all the time because of it.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more feminine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other scents I love are Armani Mania (White),Narciso Rodriguez For Her EDP,</li>
            <li> I fell in love.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering 2 more bottles</li>
            <li> My husband and I both LOVE this scent.</li>
            <li> But once he tried it he fell in love with it too.</li>
            <li> Its very unique...</li>
            <li> and I really quickly began to get used to the scent and really love it!</li>
            <li> Women will see you as strong and confident (because you smell like a sexy dude).</li>
            <li> and I loved the smell on him, very clean smelling on him; but my first impression was \\&quot;this is a man&#x27;s cologne.\\</li>
            <li> My manager told me today that I smelt so good and that she wants some for her husband!</li>
            <li> It smells so good at first</li>
            <li> It is fun to share with him!!</li>
            <li> So worth under $30!!</li>
            <li> Unique!</li>
            <li> and I am not disappointed !</li>
            <li> It is not too strong like most colognes are, but not too feminine either.</li>
            <li> Some people feel it&#x27;s too strong or really love it.  </li>
            <li> He loved it so much that he had me order more online.</li>
            <li> Smells very good and lasting.</li>
            <li> the bottle is cheap design, the top fell off soon as I receive it.</li>
            <li> I WILL admit, when I first smelled it, I wasn&#x27;t very pleased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so unique, and I love that it is UNISEX</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved my new perfume!</li>
            <li> a pretty nice value..it is a huge bottle..</li>
            <li> I first tried it, I quickly fell in love with it!</li>
            <li> Everyone noticed it and said what is that fabulous scent you&#x27;re wearing?  </li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t pass it up with such a great price.</li>
            <li> but this scent is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t last more than 4 hrs...</li>
            <li> I think it suits for a male better but still smells good for either sex.</li>
            <li> Smells really good - of course your natural scent makes a difference</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been wearing this scent for some time now, and I was very excited to find it on Amazon for such a good price.</li>
            <li> The scent is clean smelling, unique and can easily be worn by either gender.</li>
            <li> then it eases up to be very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Received well protected package and item in original wrapping.</li>
            <li> , it was SO worth it!</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth the risk in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll be buying another one.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the original..  </li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> It has a very unique smell and I love the mix of masculine and feminine!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and really is a unisex scent, although a bit on the masculine side for me.  </li>
            <li> Khole &amp; Lamar have hit the nail right on the head when it comes to a unisex fragrance!</li>
            <li> I went ahead and purchased it without smelling it first, which I have never been brave enough to do before.</li>
            <li> I loved this fragrance ever since I smelled it 2 years ago but never bought the big bottle because it cost $60, so when i found it for $18 I bought it immediately.</li>
            <li> its so cool</li>
            <li> It is not too sweet, and has a hint of musk to it.</li>
            <li> and I loved it instantly!</li>
            <li> Overall good product recommend</li>
            <li> I still cannot believe how cheap it is, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I am currently in search of finding a good shower foam/gel which enhances well in combination with this</li>
            <li> At first it is somewhat strong but as the smell smoothens, it also changes.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that smells fresh and clean......</li>
            <li> time smell faded quickly</li>
            <li> definitely a perfect combination of a male and female scent!</li>
            <li> The smell fades quickly..  </li>
            <li> The seller is my favorite for several reasons: the cost, delivery, packaging and I was able to track it myself.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m going to a cocktail party, I&#x27;ll sometimes blend a spritz of this with Provocative Woman by Elizabeth Arden for a scent that&#x27;s sexy, confident, and a little more feminine than this perfume on</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t necessarily smell masculine or feminine, it just smells good!</li>
            <li> Light and pretty scent, can&#x27;t imagine it in a man though, even though they say it&#x27;s unisex...  </li>
            <li> Then the vanilla and floral notes started to warm up on my skin, and the sweet and sultry scent was enough to drive my beau bonkers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks Khloe and Lamar, keep them coming!!</li>
            <li> and It got here fast!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always bought and used colognes, and although I like ones such as Beckham Signature and Deisel, there&#x27;s always something about most colognes that&#x27;s too strong.</li>
            <li> This perfume gets me in trouble, lol...</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s different and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Thanks to seller, I really appreciate this item :)</li>
            <li> Unbreakable is a refreshing and classy fragrance.</li>
            <li> On top of it, I&#x27;m a very girly girl and was nervous this would be too much of a \\&quot;guy\\&quot; scent.  </li>
            <li> Smells so fresh.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny</li>
            <li> surely worth the 44  </li>
            <li> , This is the third time I buy this same perfume and looking forward to getting it many times more, I absolutely recommend it!!!!</li>
            <li> I like to think of Unbreakable as bold but fresh, having strength but also being soft and clean.</li>
            <li> So I was lookin around for a new perfume; I have Kim Kardashains original one</li>
            <li> and now i finally got it :)</li>
            <li> i love nautica voyage, Pi givinchy , christian audigier but</li>
            <li> The only scent I wear, Love It......</li>
            <li> This fragrance is lovely and lasting.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance, and I can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
            <li> but I received exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> some say its more for the male</li>
            <li> The first spray, I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Men will see you as an equal (because you smell like a sexy dude).</li>
            <li> I love the fact that is so unique and masculine/feminine mixture without being extremely manly, I always get compliments when wearing it</li>
            <li> Oddly enough it smelled better when they were together.</li>
            <li> He first sprayed it on him</li>
            <li> &quot; I then sprayed it on myself and at first I smelt like a dude</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what The seller describes</li>
            <li> Soft light smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly like the product we bought from their store in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a (not particularly feminine) male, and the scent of this, though flowery, has been well appreciated by my girlfriend and friends on me, my girlfriend also wears it with great satisfaction, regardless of your gender, the soft yet pleasant smell will work for you, unless you&#x27;re a man who likes the uber-musky, overbearing scents that scream male.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly how it was described in the ad...</li>
            <li> It is definitely a Unisex scent tending towards more of a man&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li> This is BY FAR my new favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This scent is great but it doesn&#x27;t last very long on my skin.</li>
            <li> Large amount for very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It really captures the whole idea of what a unisex fragrance is supposed to smell like!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been looking pretty much everywhere for this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It smelled too much like Clementine/Orange when I first sprayed it, and I&#x27;m not used to my perfumes smelling that fruity.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was shipped pretty fast</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter, I love this fragrance because it is both subtle and elegant at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast</li>
            <li> And really, thats all that matters.  </li>
            <li> its very manly if you as me</li>
            <li> I work with patients in really close proximity</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves the smell as well.</li>
            <li> i really like kloe and lamar</li>
            <li> I also thought the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> That being said this is really a cologne(imo).</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really see a woman wanting to wear this...</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> The scent is very agreeable to either sex.  </li>
            <li> It has that fruity, citrus-y scent to it, but with darker, stronger undertones like chocolate and tonka bean to even it out and make it more masculine at the same time.</li>
            <li> I prefer a more masculine scent than this personally</li>
            <li> I receive at least 3 complements a day on how good I smell...</li>
            <li> I am pretty pickey about this sort of thing, I haven&#x27;t found a new perfume I like for a couple of years now.</li>
            <li> It smells different on her than me, that&#x27;s the cool part.</li>
            <li> I have found my new scent!</li>
            <li> decent longevity.  </li>
            <li> i was kinda steady for getting this because i didnt want to smell like a guy</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m careful not to wear strong scents.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I highly suggest purchasing this fragrance.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product and buying from this seller.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Like one of these other reviews, I do actually smell a little chocolate, vanilla, and even orange, but that just makes it all the more amazing.  </li>
            <li> It has a hint of masculinity, which makes it a little sexy, and makes it wearable for a man.</li>
            <li> It has that masculine scent but also a very girly fruity and flowery scent to it as well.  </li>
            <li> BUT, I tried a few more sprays</li>
            <li> Have never smelled it, but ordered because I actually like more masculine smelling perfumes such as eternity aqua and ck one...</li>
            <li> it is a little soft [more girly] once the scent settles in.</li>
            <li> The packaging is the same, looks identical to original, but not quite the same.  </li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> The fragrance was not what I expected it to be but its not a bad thing I&#x27;ve never smelled b4 buying it</li>
            <li> so u don&#x27;t have much to loss but the one thing I will say is most likely unless I really have to I don&#x27;t plan on ordering den this saler again due to the fact that it took way to long for me to get it</li>
            <li> the .9 pounds is a large enough bottle.</li>
            <li> Clearly a knock out..</li>
            <li> but you won&#x27;t smell like you just put on Old Spice</li>
            <li> underrated by far.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe the price and shipped early.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old sons also loves to use it.</li>
            <li> I do wear this just not everyday.</li>
            <li> It goes on Masculine</li>
            <li> Getting ready to pull the trigger on my 3rd bottle I decided to write this review...</li>
            <li> It IS a little bit on the feminine side, which I was a little iffy about at first, but the more you smell it</li>
            <li> has a great musky smell that can be confused for a  male or female scent, and the smell is different on each person.</li>
            <li> the first spray seems like dudes cologne, but dries down a soft floral..like it!</li>
            <li> I love it, I buy from Italy because here is so hard to find!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re left behind with something that is positively suitable for either or any</li>
            <li> I was worried it would be too masculine, but it&#x27;s definitely not.</li>
            <li> surprised that I actually like this!</li>
            <li> Most of my favorite celebrities (Britney Spears comes to mind) only cater to their female fan base when it comes to perfume and cologne.</li>
            <li> So as a guy I was a little nervous to order this without smelling it first, but I figure if a guy like Lamar could wear it, so could I.&lt;br /&gt;I am an athlete as well and didn&#x27;t want something that would smell feminine, but also living in sunny</li>
            <li> The chocolate notes were the first thing to hit me and I thought to myself \\&quot;well, this is only just a little bit racist\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I could really care less about Khloe and Lamar</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this perfume is original, as I have noticed that the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last very long when I use it...  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and at a much less expensive price!</li>
            <li> my product shud follow shortly after so definite on star on this saler due to that main fact, it was packaged and handled well with a nice size reusable bag so that wasn&#x27;t to bad</li>
            <li> Yes smell good long lasting too nothing bad about it</li>
            <li> A little really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The bottle was surprisingly big, so it should last a long time!!</li>
            <li> the smell do not last very long</li>
            <li> I was skeptical given how cheap it is.</li>
            <li> i have looked for a long time for a perfume that i wana claim as MY SCENT.  </li>
            <li> but now i have found my long awaited FIND.  </li>
            <li> this fragrance  lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is sometimes one may have is a whiff of wet dog if you&#x27;ve gone out for a workout and drenched in sweat.</li>
            <li> I typically basically use it for my son, which is really why I bought it anyway, but thought maybe i could get a few uses out of it being unisex.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, like it.  </li>
            <li> I ran out of my other scents though and used this because I had nothing left.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this for my daughter for Christmas/Birthday; She wanted this a long time ago and could not find it anywhere!</li>
            <li> im not a high on but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been wearing it a few hours but hope that it will last all day like the other reviews read.</li>
            <li> once I wore it for a little while, I realized that it actually is a woman&#x27;s perfume as well.  </li>
            <li> She complained about how it \\&quot;smelled like old lady\\&quot; and re-gifted to me</li>
            <li> I paid far less for the 3.4 oz bottle that I usually purchase.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, it being a unisex scent and all, but after reading the reviews I decided I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> but other then that I support K&amp;L</li>
            <li> It is extremely manly.</li>
            <li> It reminds me a little of GAP OM that I loved and hated when they discontinued it.</li>
            <li> My man and I both wear it especially when we want to add a little spice!!  </li>
            <li> I have two other friends that have also bought it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this scent, but was a little worried to spend $45 on something I have never smelled before.  </li>
            <li> and I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> but u really have to juz go with it, the price isn&#x27;t to bad from this saler</li>
            <li> I STARTED OUT WITH A SMALL BOTTLE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its been diluted or  &#x27;knock-off.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> First when I tried it on, I thought crap..</li>
            <li> Not right for a man and just plain weird for a woman.</li>
            <li> It was shipped Late though thats what made me upset</li>
            <li> At least thats my opinion.  </li>
            <li> So when I heard that Khloe and Lamar were coming out with a unisex scent, I knew I had to get it, at least just to try it out, because I&#x27;d never smelt a perfume meant for both sexes.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;this is definitely a man&#x27;s perfume\\&quot; and was a little disappointed, but</li>
            <li> , I mean it could of been faster</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and won&#x27;t buy from this seller in the future.</li>

            <li> I know that sounds weird</li>
            <li> Asking, what it is, to where they can get it, to is it expensive.</li>

            <li> Nice, just as expected and good price!!</li>
            <li> I always wanted this and now i finally got it :) Everyone should get it, it smells awesome! It was shipped Late though thats what made me upset</li>
            <li> Smells better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume. It has a different smell on a woman then it does on a man. It is great!</li>
            <li> I loved this fragrance ever since I smelled it 2 years ago but never bought the big bottle because it cost $60, so when i found it for $18 I bought it immediately. Shipping was fast</li>
            <li> It was a gift and my daughter loved it. Great price too.</li>
            <li> Parfum is Amazing!!! I love it, I buy from Italy because here is so hard to find! Thanks to seller, I really appreciate this item :)</li>
            <li> So as a guy I was a little nervous to order this without smelling it first, but I figure if a guy like Lamar could wear it, so could I.&lt;br /&gt;I am an athlete as well and didn&#x27;t want something that would smell feminine, but also living in sunny So Cal, I wanted something that would remind me of the beach/summer, like a tropical smell.&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried it, I quickly fell in love with it! It doesn&#x27;t necessarily smell masculine or feminine, it just smells good! And really, thats all that matters.  This is BY FAR my new favorite fragrance.  It is not too strong like most colognes are, but not too feminine either. It really captures the whole idea of what a unisex fragrance is supposed to smell like! I HIGHLY recommend this fragrance for both girls and GUYS!!!!!! If you are a guy and worried about whether or not it may come off as too feminine, don&#x27;t worry!!!  My girlfriend loves it even more than I do, so if you have a gf you should prob get the bigger bottle, i promise you will catch her stealing some on multiple occasions!</li>
            <li> love love love it!! my very favorite!!</li>
            <li> Unbreakable is a refreshing and classy fragrance. I&#x27;m so glad I bought it when I visited the DASH store in Los Angeles.</li>
            <li> I love this scent! I was skeptical at first, it being a unisex scent and all, but after reading the reviews I decided I would give it a try. I went ahead and purchased it without smelling it first, which I have never been brave enough to do before. I am pretty pickey about this sort of thing, I haven&#x27;t found a new perfume I like for a couple of years now. So, I just went ahead and did it, and I am glad I did! I was worried it would be too masculine, but it&#x27;s definitely not. It has a hint of masculinity, which makes it a little sexy, and makes it wearable for a man. Its very unique...I have found my new scent!</li>
            <li> I love it. Everyone who smells me love it</li>
            <li> i have looked for a long time for a perfume that i wana claim as MY SCENT.  I have worn Euphoria for years but now i have found my long awaited FIND.  Love this scent.  I do like the notes of a mans cologne but with an added feminine touch.  This has it all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unbreakable, received it on time smell faded quickly the bottle is cheap design, the top fell off soon as I receive it. Do not recommend buying it</li>
            <li> This fragrance is like my crack! lol jk im not a high on but rlly this was an amazingggg purchase! i love nautica voyage, Pi givinchy , christian audigier but this beats it!!! its so cool cuz when its on a man it smells different than when its on a woman! kloe and lamar did an amazing job and definetly stocking up on this :D</li>
            <li> The only scent I wear, Love It......</li>
            <li> I was given this cologne as a gift and honestly after smelling it I put it on my dresser and that&#x27;s where it sat.  I ran out of my other scents though and used this because I had nothing left.  I still wasn&#x27;t that impressed but the compliments I got were fabulous!  Everyone noticed it and said what is that fabulous scent you&#x27;re wearing?  I continued wearing it and a day has not passed that I haven&#x27;t been complimented on it.  It grows on you.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Received well protected package and item in original wrapping. Just as if I went to a store and purchased it. Awesome value.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted this since I saw them making it on Khloe and Lamar! So one day I was on Amazon and I saw it! I immediately put it in my cart and checked out! When I got it, I tore into and sprayed it on.its the best stuff I have ever smelllled!!!! I am so happy!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is lovely and lasting.</li>
            <li> I love this scent! It is not too sweet, and has a hint of musk to it. I always get compliments when I wear it. In my opinion, it is not too manly for the ladies to wear. I love the smell of guys cologne but you won&#x27;t smell like you just put on Old Spice I promise! Love it! Love it! Love it! You have to give it a try and see for yourself!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been looking pretty much everywhere for this fragrance.  Here and on Perfumania were the only places to find it. I ordered this scent, but was a little worried to spend $45 on something I have never smelled before.  On top of it, I&#x27;m a very girly girl and was nervous this would be too much of a \\&quot;guy\\&quot; scent.  But I have to say, it was SO worth it! I absolutely love this fragrance, and I can&#x27;t get enough of it! First when I tried it on, I thought crap.. \\&quot;this is definitely a man&#x27;s perfume\\&quot; and was a little disappointed, but once I wore it for a little while, I realized that it actually is a woman&#x27;s perfume as well.  It has that masculine scent but also a very girly fruity and flowery scent to it as well.  Like one of these other reviews, I do actually smell a little chocolate, vanilla, and even orange, but that just makes it all the more amazing.  Khole &amp; Lamar have hit the nail right on the head when it comes to a unisex fragrance! I will definitely recommend this scent to both males and females! :) So even if you haven&#x27;t tested this out yet, take the chance and buy it.  It was definitely worth the risk in my opinion!</li>
            <li> Wife was happy. Smells good. Better price than the stores.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance!!</li>
            <li> Love this sent can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> smells sooo good! definitely a perfect combination of a male and female scent! great purchase! AND AFFORDABLE! i highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved my new perfume! It smells yummy and not only do I lvoe it but my grandson loves it!! It is fun to share with him!!</li>
            <li> Awesome, light and crisp</li>
            <li> Way bigger then I thought the bottle would be 👌 plus came in 2 days ‼️🙌👏</li>
            <li> Very quick, good experience.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. Its a mixture of a man and a woman favorite perfume and cologne together. A the price that I paid for it, the size is big enough.</li>
            <li> Smells good.  However, I think its smells more for a man, tnan for a girl.  At least thats my opinion.  I typically basically use it for my son, which is really why I bought it anyway, but thought maybe i could get a few uses out of it being unisex.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, like it.  But for a man.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product... smells wonderful</li>
            <li> Unisex I love it wear it all the time get complimented on its scent !! Buy it wear it!!yes yes</li>
            <li> the smell do not last very long i wasnt impressed i will never order this one ever again not please</li>
            <li> The smell of unbreakable is so completely sexy everyone loves it.  Lots of compliments.  My man and I both wear it especially when we want to add a little spice!!  I would recommend it to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> So I was lookin around for a new perfume; I have Kim Kardashains original one and I loved that. I&#x27;ve never heard a bad thing about this uni sex fragrance; so I said why not? You can [obviously] tell when you spray it it&#x27;s a uni sex fragrance. But it softens up and smells amazing. Lasts all day. I get so many compliments on it. If you&#x27;re a guy I don&#x27;t think I would recommend this it is a little soft [more girly] once the scent settles in. But I love it :]</li>
            <li> Unbreakable Bond was a Christmas gift for my girlfriend,  who tends to wear cologne rather than perfume. She&#x27;s been wearing this scent for some time now, and I was very excited to find it on Amazon for such a good price. I paid far less for the 3.4 oz bottle that I usually purchase. The scent is clean smelling, unique and can easily be worn by either gender.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always bought and used colognes, and although I like ones such as Beckham Signature and Deisel, there&#x27;s always something about most colognes that&#x27;s too strong. So when I heard that Khloe and Lamar were coming out with a unisex scent, I knew I had to get it, at least just to try it out, because I&#x27;d never smelt a perfume meant for both sexes. And it didn&#x27;t disappoint.    I WILL admit, when I first smelled it, I wasn&#x27;t very pleased. It smelled too much like Clementine/Orange when I first sprayed it, and I&#x27;m not used to my perfumes smelling that fruity. BUT, I tried a few more sprays and I really quickly began to get used to the scent and really love it! I wanna wear it all the time now. It IS a little bit on the feminine side, which I was a little iffy about at first, but the more you smell it you realize that it definitely does not smell like a woman&#x27;s perfume. You can tell it&#x27;s meant for both sexes, which is great. It has that fruity, citrus-y scent to it, but with darker, stronger undertones like chocolate and tonka bean to even it out and make it more masculine at the same time. I like to think of Unbreakable as bold but fresh, having strength but also being soft and clean. It&#x27;s a nice blend of both a man and a woman in my opinion, and once I&#x27;m done this bottle I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll be buying another one.     (Side note: I think it&#x27;s great for all year, but it&#x27;s definitely a perfect scent for Summer)</li>
            <li> The smell is awesome and not overpowering.  Love unisex smell and makes me feel good to wear without that nose tingling side effect.</li>
            <li> I love this scent! Perfect for men or women.</li>
            <li> Loved the smell this is my 4th purchase of this perfume! I bought for myself and my son he loved it</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!  I STARTED OUT WITH A SMALL BOTTLE THAT I FOUND ON CLEARANCE, AND AFTER THAT WAS GONE I HAD TO BUY A BIGGER BOTTLE.  IT ONLY TAKES A COUPLE DABS SO YOU WON&#x27;T HAVE TO DROWN YOURSELF IN IT.  EVERYONE ALWAYS COMPLIMENT ME ON HOW GOOD I SMELL!</li>
            <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t last more than 4 hrs...</li>
            <li> The relationship they had has failed, but this is still my fav perfume.  Super cheap, and smells great, w/out 2 many floral accents.  I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend this for a guy, but for the price, this is a great perfume.  I use this over my 80.00 perfumes.</li>
            <li> bought this as a requested gift for a friend. did not like the smell myself. its very manly if you as me</li>
            <li> What can you say about Toilette Spray.  Wife liked the smell and wanted it. She is happy with it. .</li>
            <li> One of the best colognes , I highly recommended !</li>
            <li> Best scent ever. It makes you just want to buy more and more. Great packaging. Just 5 star quality! Try it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents a go to fragrance</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to buy this without smelling it but I couldn&#x27;t pass it up with such a great price. I received it and was very pleased. My husband and I both use it.</li>
            <li> amazing.  smells like love in a bottle.  decent longevity.  underrated by far.  this is one of my fav. fragrances. a keeper in my collection.</li>
            <li> Good product. I purchased as a gift for a family member. I took a while to get it but I received exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> great perfume.  Love the smell.  I would recommend.  I like this one better than unbreakable love.  Would buy again soon</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!! Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Definitely one of my favorites. It&#x27;s cheap, delightful, and bold! 😁❤️</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this perfume is original, as I have noticed that the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last very long when I use it...  The packaging is the same, looks identical to original, but not quite the same.  I&#x27;m not sure if its been diluted or  &#x27;knock-off.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is ANOTHER one of my wife&#x27;s favorite scent and she gets my continuing satisfaction and pleasing comments from anyone and everyone that she comes in contact with.</li>
            <li> The fragrance was not what I expected it to be but its not a bad thing I&#x27;ve never smelled b4 buying it I just decided to go out on a limb n try it and its actually nice I get mixed opinions about it some say its more for the male but I do think its truly n between mayb its juz me but I get a hint of tootsie roll flavor going on or a lite chocolate I know that sounds weird but u really have to juz go with it, the price isn&#x27;t to bad from this saler so u don&#x27;t have much to loss but the one thing I will say is most likely unless I really have to I don&#x27;t plan on ordering den this saler again due to the fact that it took way to long for me to get it, I don&#x27;t understand you process in take my money the same day my product shud follow shortly after so definite on star on this saler due to that main fact, it was packaged and handled well with a nice size reusable bag so that wasn&#x27;t to bad but other then that I support K&amp;L</li>
            <li> My daughter purchased this for herself, she loves it  the bottle is quite large and it&#x27;s a nice shape!! Good buy smells great</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter, I love this fragrance because it is both subtle and elegant at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Love it, I&#x27;m wearing it now. Smells very good and lasting. Couldn&#x27;t believe the price and shipped early. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> My roommate&#x27;s grandmother gave her the gift set of Unbreakable By Khloe &amp; Lamar. She complained about how it \\&quot;smelled like old lady\\&quot; and re-gifted to me (I blame it on her pregnancy nose). The first spray, I didn&#x27;t like it. The chocolate notes were the first thing to hit me and I thought to myself \\&quot;well, this is only just a little bit racist\\&quot;. Then the vanilla and floral notes started to warm up on my skin, and the sweet and sultry scent was enough to drive my beau bonkers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more of a fall and winter scent for me. When I&#x27;m going to a cocktail party, I&#x27;ll sometimes blend a spritz of this with Provocative Woman by Elizabeth Arden for a scent that&#x27;s sexy, confident, and a little more feminine than this perfume on it&#x27;s own. Over time, the more \\&quot;manly\\&quot; notes do fade on this and you&#x27;re left behind with something that is positively suitable for either or any gender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protip: Ladies who are ballsy enough to wear cologne make a statement with their scent. Men will see you as an equal (because you smell like a sexy dude). Women will see you as strong and confident (because you smell like a sexy dude). But you didn&#x27;t hear it from me!</li>
            <li> If you are one of those woman like me that tends to like more the smell of men&#x27;s cologne more than women, this is for you. I love the fact that is so unique and masculine/feminine mixture without being extremely manly, I always get compliments when wearing it, This is the third time I buy this same perfume and looking forward to getting it many times more, I absolutely recommend it!!!!</li>
            <li> Oddly enough it smelled better when they were together.</li>
            <li> Yes smell good long lasting too nothing bad about it</li>
            <li> I received this product for Christmas from my mom and then my husband used it all. He loved it so much that he had me order more online. I think it suits for a male better but still smells good for either sex. My 4 year old sons also loves to use it. this product arrived on time and packed perfect.</li>
            <li> I signed up on Khloe&#x27;s blog for a sample of this perfume and I loved it instantly! I had some credits on my account so I decided to buy it, and wow! I absolutely love this scent. It is amazing, and smells great. It&#x27;s so unique, and I love that it is UNISEX, my boyfriend actually likes the scent too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was shipped pretty fast, I mean it could of been faster but I was very happy with this purchase. When I run out, I will definitely buy again! The bottle was surprisingly big, so it should last a long time!! So worth under $30!!</li>
            <li> Smells so fresh. I work with patients in really close proximity so I&#x27;m careful not to wear strong scents. This perfume is just perfect I get complements from both men and women. I love it!</li>
            <li> The scent evaporates within a couple hours&#x3D;CHEAP! Very disappointed and won&#x27;t buy from this seller in the future.</li>
            <li> I was real excited to find out that Khloe and Lamar were coming out with a unisex scent so I had to buy it for my husband and myself.  He first sprayed it on him and I loved the smell on him, very clean smelling on him; but my first impression was \\&quot;this is a man&#x27;s cologne.\\&quot; I then sprayed it on myself and at first I smelt like a dude but later it had a very nice feminine sweet scent to it, which I was REAL happy about!  I can tell you that this is this 100 times better than CK One (I was never a fan). I would recommend this for sure!  I still love the Kim K perfume more but this is perfect for both man and a woman!</li>
            <li> I received this product made by the wonderful Khloe and Lamar Odom! I Love the smell of the two man and woman put together me and my husband can share the same scent. He absolutely loves the smell as well. It is worth every penny the .9 pounds is a large enough bottle. My manager told me today that I smelt so good and that she wants some for her husband! She questioned me where to find the scent! It is worth your buy people and would make an awesome gift for your wives or husbands, friends, family!</li>
            <li> i really like kloe and lamar and i saw at his program de perfume! i search it and saw it on amazon, i wait for a while so it will  a great price and i buy it! is really big and smells delicious</li>
            <li> Smells really good - of course your natural scent makes a difference so I like it better on my daughter but it&#x27;s still very good</li>
            <li> will purchase again. recevied a lot of comments. females love the cologne on me. this fragrance  lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical given how cheap it is. It&#x27;s musky and feminine at the same time!</li>
            <li> The smell fades quickly..  It&#x27;s not the original..  Clearly a knock out..</li>
            <li> Excellent smelling cologne. Good for anytime.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE this scent......makes me happy!!! It&#x27;s one of my favorites and my son wears it too....thats the best part, its made for women and men</li>
            <li> I loved this perfume, I think I&#x27;ll buy, I am a man and women they like smell that fregancia in my body.</li>
            <li> I think Khloe and Lamar missed the uni-sex scent.  This does not work for women but is great for men. I was very disappointed.  I love the bottle it is beautiful, but however to manly for sure! My son loved the scent and agreed that it is to strong for women but works well for men so I gave it to him and he likes it when he wears it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear perfumes at all. I have many as gifts but! I wear oils. This perfume gets me in trouble, lol...Love it</li>
            <li> My wife and I received this in the mail,  we both wore it when we went out. And everyone loved it. It smells different on her than me, that&#x27;s the cool part. We ordered Unbreakable Love and Unbreakable Joy and we can&#x27;t wait to have all 3. The bottles are cute and my wife has a shelf just for them in our bathroom because they display well! Thanks Khloe and Lamar, keep them coming!!</li>
            <li> At first it is somewhat strong but as the smell smoothens, it also changes. very pleasant smell for both men and women.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift. The recipient, my sons&#x27; girlfriend, hated it. Not right for a man and just plain weird for a woman.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy another on for my boyfriend. The smell last all day ,... I&#x27;m in love with this smell 😍😍😍😍😍</li>
            <li> has a great musky smell that can be confused for a  male or female scent, and the smell is different on each person. I love this perfume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with Unbreakable! It has a very unique smell and I love the mix of masculine and feminine!</li>
            <li> I get alot of compliments about how good I smell! I have two other friends that have also bought it! Im trying to convience my Boyfriend he should try to wear it also! :)</li>
            <li> amazing cologne for a men or woman!  im a man, and it seems more so of a mans cologne then a womans!  surely worth the 44  i reccomend that every cologne enthusiast has this cologne!!  its amazing</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my daughter for Christmas/Birthday; She wanted this a long time ago and could not find it anywhere!</li>
            <li> I just adore this couple so i had to try their scent.  It&#x27;s great and really is a unisex scent, although a bit on the masculine side for me.  I do wear this just not everyday.</li>
            <li> Good smelling stuff my girlfriend wears it... She loves this perfume... It&#x27;s actually unisex I think.. Overall good product recommend</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents ever; I hope it isn&#x27;t discontinued! I get so many compliments on this.</li>
            <li> I have received nothing but complements about the fragrance. Asking, what it is, to where they can get it, to is it expensive. Excellent choice for a first time wearer of a fragrance.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what The seller describes</li>
            <li> Great product! I recommend!</li>
            <li> This scent is great but it doesn&#x27;t last very long on my skin. I usually only use perfume instead of eau de toilette.</li>
            <li> I always love perfumes that can go either way. Meaning it can smell just as great on a woman as it can on a man! I could really care less about Khloe and Lamar but this scent is fabulous. I smelled it at my local department store, sprayed it on me, and it lingered all day. I came home and had to order it. If you&#x27;re looking for something that smells fresh and clean......here it is! Great for day or evening.</li>
            <li> this is a very nice scent...lingers all day and my husband likes it as well which was a surprise :) I adore Khloe &amp; Lamar and how dedicated she/they are to their marriage. priority #1 n it shows~</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of the Kardashians for a while now and even thought Kim is Kris&#x27; favorite, Khloe has always been mine. I&#x27;m so glad that Khloe decided to release a unisex scent with Lamar, instead of just a women&#x27;s perfume like Kim. Most of my favorite celebrities (Britney Spears comes to mind) only cater to their female fan base when it comes to perfume and cologne. The scent is amazing and I wear it everyday. I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on how great I smell. The box and the bottle are beautiful. I can&#x27;t wait to try [[ASIN:B00B608EV0 Khloe and Lamar Eau de Parfum Spray, Unbreakable Love, 3.4 Ounce]] and [[ASIN:B009SANKYG Khloe And Lamar Unbreakable Joy Eau de Toilette Spray for Unisex, 3.4 Ounce]]!</li>
            <li> I just got this perfume in the mail and had to put it on immediately. It reminds me a little of GAP OM that I loved and hated when they discontinued it. I&#x27;ve only been wearing it a few hours but hope that it will last all day like the other reviews read.</li>
            <li> Item as described. I love this perfume. Soft light smell. Good for during the day at work or at night..</li>
            <li> Have never smelled it, but ordered because I actually like more masculine smelling perfumes such as eternity aqua and ck one...surprised that I actually like this! Not a Kardashian fan...but this perfume reminds me of my faves..a pretty nice value..it is a huge bottle..the first spray seems like dudes cologne, but dries down a soft floral..like it!</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be a unisex perfume but smells like men&#x27;s cologne. I like Kardashian products but I think they dropped the ball with this one. I&#x27;m not saying it smells bad, it&#x27;s just that I was expecting something that didn&#x27;t smell like it was geared more towards men than women. I ended up giving it to my husband.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on Amazon because I heard from a friend that it smells great. I had not even had a chance to smell it before ordering it, so I was hoping when I received it I liked the smell. I ended up liking it and I have gotten tons of compliments how good it smells. Khloe &amp; Lamar did a great job making this fragrance because it really smells perfect for both men and women. I highly suggest purchasing this fragrance.</li>
            <li> It goes on Masculine then it eases up to be very clean and fresh. Love it! I gotten so many compliments! Unique!</li>
            <li> This perfume is one of my favorites!!! Purchased it without knowing what it smelled like and I was not disappointed. I also thought the price was reasonable. Will definitely purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> Have ordered this item before. It&#x27;s exactly like the product we bought from their store in Las Vegas. It&#x27;s great and at a much less expensive price!</li>
            <li> I dunno. It&#x27;s just okay. A little really goes a long way. I prefer a more masculine scent than this personally and I get generally mixed reviews when I wear this. Some people feel it&#x27;s too strong or really love it.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the 50/50 split so I will probably retire this a month or so after purchase. It&#x27;ll make a good room spray I suppose.</li>
            <li> Getting ready to pull the trigger on my 3rd bottle I decided to write this review... This stuff is great! I love the sent and so does everyone at my job. I receive at least 3 complements a day on how good I smell... That being said this is really a cologne(imo). I couldn&#x27;t really see a woman wanting to wear this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 for me but seeing as this is marketed as \\&quot;unisex\\&quot; I rated this 4/5...</li>
            <li> Love love love. We always repurchase this fragrance</li>
            <li> I recommend it.  It is absolute delicious, I received the product within a couple of days.  I am very happy with this one....</li>
            <li> Just love the smell of this and so do the ladies</li>
            <li> Light and pretty scent, can&#x27;t imagine it in a man though, even though they say it&#x27;s unisex...  To each his own I guess</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this perfume smell. My favorite perfume. I have purchased 3 already. And get so many compliments. A must to buy. I give ot 5 *****</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a (not particularly feminine) male, and the scent of this, though flowery, has been well appreciated by my girlfriend and friends on me, my girlfriend also wears it with great satisfaction, regardless of your gender, the soft yet pleasant smell will work for you, unless you&#x27;re a man who likes the uber-musky, overbearing scents that scream male.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfume for months and I finally found it. It smells awesome. The seller is my favorite for several reasons: the cost, delivery, packaging and I was able to track it myself. Perfect timing  before I go on vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and buying from this seller. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I thought the price was great so I gave it a shot and I am not disappointed ! My sister and Daughter went crazy for this scent so now I know what to get them as a gift for the Holiday&#x27;s ! I also bought Kim which is a nice fragrance but I have to say this is much better. It can be used for both men and women but I think it leans towards women for sure!</li>
            <li> This is the only fragrance I use!! I love it and It got here fast!!</li>
            <li> Item was exactly how it was described in the ad... Delivery was fast. I am very satisfied and would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> The perfume truly does smell like both a man and a woman. I LOVE it, it&#x27;s different and it smells amazing. It has become my signature scent. I still cannot believe how cheap it is, but it&#x27;s worth every penny. It lasts all day and people love to hug me all the time because of it. lol But try it out! What&#x27;s the worst that could happen?</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more feminine. It is extremely manly. I hate it. I thought it would be sweeter and wearable unfortunately it will sit and collect dust.</li>
            <li> It smells so good at first i was kinda steady for getting this because i didnt want to smell like a guy but the smell is just perfect it smells good</li>
            <li> I got a 2 oz sample from myperfumesamples.com (International shipping too! Woohoo!)&lt;br /&gt;I loved this out of all the Kardashian perfumes on the market. It is definitely a Unisex scent tending towards more of a man&#x27;s scent. (But it&#x27;s gorgeous!!) It is not overpowering and lasts for lengthy periods during the day. It&#x27;s a good day AND night scent. Only drawback is sometimes one may have is a whiff of wet dog if you&#x27;ve gone out for a workout and drenched in sweat. (I cycle to work for about 2 hours a day up hills,etc, so yes, sweat with this perfume doesn&#x27;t smell as good! As one would expect!)&lt;br /&gt; I am currently in search of finding a good shower foam/gel which enhances well in combination with this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Other scents I love are Armani Mania (White),Narciso Rodriguez For Her EDP, Idylle EDP by Guerlain (Summer Scent), Gucci&#x27;s Gardenia and Jacob Classique (Canadian Scent - not Marc Jacobs), to name a few!&lt;br /&gt;Do try them especially if you like Unbreakable Bond..mmm.</li>
            <li> I was not at all impressed with Kim&#x27;s releases.  I seen this at a local Claire&#x27;s at the mall and deicded to try it out.  I fell in love.  It was a sensual smell, not too fruity, and not flowery.  I belive it states it can be used by men or women and I would have to say I agree.  The scent is very agreeable to either sex.  I love the price I got and am very satisfied ith my purchase!</li>
            <li> My favorite out of all the Khloe and Lamar fragrances!!!</li>
            <li> Great smell , great price around , the perfume stores in the mall are overcharging this item.. my daughter loves this perfume but so does her brother and dad smh I will be ordering 2 more bottles so everyone can have there own...</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume as a Christmas gift. My daughter loved the smell. Would highly recommend to others. Arrived quickly and packaged perfect!</li>
            <li> Just received this. Shipping was quick. Packaging excellent. My husband and I both LOVE this scent. I knew I would. I was unsure about him. But once he tried it he fell in love with it too. Large amount for very reasonable price. I&#x27;m very happy with this and will buy again.</li>
