            <li>I absolutely love this makeup!!</li>

            <li>I LOVE THIS FOUNDATION!</li>
            <li>My favorite foundation!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>so I have to bulk order it online (which is okay too!).</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>But I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>but it gives a glow on its own</li>
            <li>I thought maybe it was the brush, so I used my own name brand brush and it did not help with the application or irritation.</li>
            <li>lmao</li>
            <li>Very good price first of all and</li>
            <li>The brush is very cheap, I use my own instead.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of pricey, but I keep one container for a minimum of 2 weeks, more like a month.</li>
            <li>Best foundation I have found so far</li>
            <li>and it made her pretty happy.</li>
            <li>It is the only foundation I&#x27;ve found that blends and matches my skin PERFECTLY!</li>
            <li>, it goes on smooth, kind of like powdered sugar does to your fingers</li>
            <li>love love love looooooove this makeup.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>I love this foundation.  </li>
            <li>I cant find it in stores any more.</li>
            <li>I love this make up</li>
            <li>I cannot recommend a better face make up product than this one.</li>
            <li>I love this foundation.</li>
            <li>Wish it had more coverage&lt;br /&gt;though</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this does a great job.</li>
            <li>I wish it came in larger containers as well, its that good!</li>
            <li>I bought it once because I wanted a light color, and when it didn&#x27;t cover, I realized it wasn&#x27;t the mineral powder but just a finishing powder or something</li>
            <li>great ,,enough coverage when im in a rush and goes on well over my matte dream mousse cr√®me ,,</li>
            <li>but even a light coating felt like I had caked it on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t cake up on my face.</li>
            <li>light and yet covers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this mineral powder for 5+ years and find the coverage to be light but conceals skin color imperfections.</li>
            <li>Even if you are on the fence, for a price this cheap, you need to try it.</li>
            <li>Light coverage, not too powdery looking when on the face.</li>
            <li>Powder goes on light</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that Maybelline no longer makes the mineral powder since it is natural and good for your skin.</li>
            <li>At first I was okay with that, thinking I&#x27;ll try it anyways.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more than enough, i have gotten more than what i have paid for!</li>
            <li>If you love mineral foundations give this one a try;)</li>
            <li>It matches wonderfully to my skin and I can hardly tell I&#x27;m wearing</li>
            <li>This is much cheaper than bare minerals and just as a great of a product.</li>
            <li>Gives good coverage for my oily and slightly red in spots skin.  </li>
            <li>I think I like it better, and it doesnt cost as much.  </li>
            <li>It covers very well and stays on for 12 hours!!</li>
            <li>Organic or natural brands of anything, even food and vitamins and cosmetics are so much better for people</li>
            <li>Did not receive the right color</li>
            <li>Obviously there are better products out there, but for this price it does exactly what I need it to.</li>
            <li>This product has made me a powder mineral foundation lover for life ;)</li>
            <li>Covers blemishes pretty well considering how cheap it is and stays on for the entire day.</li>
            <li>does this work with very skin color</li>
            <li>The lightest shade I&#x27;ve seen of this, kind of close to white, it actually just a powder.</li>
            <li>Why pay a bunch of money for bare minerals when you are getting a product of similar or even better quality?</li>
            <li>hello I&#x27;m very new to the make up world</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone back and forth between many foundations and yet always find myself coming back to this one.</li>
            <li>I tried this make up out for the first time roughly 3 years ago, and fell in love with it instantly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>If i need to conceal a spot i just put a little powder on an eyeshadow brush and apply it like I would a concealer and then apply the foundation on top of it.</li>
            <li>So be careful if you come across a really light version of this.</li>
            <li>I liked that it was flat and didn&#x27;t have sparkles in it like some of the other brands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe to say that I wasted $10</li>
            <li>I used to spend a lot of money buying the bare mineral makeup when it first came out</li>
            <li>I first used this product after I tried Bare minerals, and you know what?  </li>
            <li>This is EXACTLY like Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>it looks very naturally and medium coverage.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural and I have used it for years.</li>
            <li>I purchased a light and a dark</li>
            <li>For being LIGHT color, it was way too dark</li>
            <li>and I loved it so much that I was afraid to try something new.</li>
            <li>I would certainly buy this product for anyone looking for such an item.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day my face still looks clear.</li>
            <li>Another one of my friends watched me put it on and said \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>and it gives you like a natural look</li>
            <li>&quot; It was \\&quot;Mineral Power Natural Perfecting Foundation.\\&quot;     </li>
            <li>it is soft and looks so naturally.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin (literally found out</li>
            <li>It also really natural, doesn&#x27;t deplete the ozone layer, no crazy chemicals and other stuff I have to worry about breaking out to.  </li>
            <li>Bare Minerals gets greasy looking during the day.</li>
            <li>so I just use the one that came with my bare minerals.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really low as far as chemicals go according to skindeeps website which talks above the dangers of what products you use and how they effect your body.</li>
            <li>same goes for my old shampoo!), and my skin texture varies from oily to dry depending on the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried bare minerals, and personally felt like there wasn&#x27;t enough coverage.</li>

            <li> I tried bare minerals, and personally felt like there wasn&#x27;t enough coverage.</li>
            <li> I expected it to rub off in the first few hours</li>
            <li> When I ordered this item, I was assuming I would receive a loose powder, as pictured above.</li>
            <li> I have oily/combination skin that becomes very dry in the winter and this suits my skin throughout all its different \\&quot;moods\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> but they do not keep making them or they over price them so much that it is hard to afford them.</li>
            <li> It seems like you get a small amount but a little really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am a little allergic do some stuff that is dumped into the water supply and therefore get a red break out on my cheek that never goes away (trying to get a filtering shower head).</li>
            <li> I have also used the mineral power liquid foundation from Maybelline, but no thanks.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the image above is inaccurate or there was a flux in the shipment, but whatever it was, it was not \\&quot;Mineral Power</li>
            <li> first and foremost the price is not too hurtful unlike other brands, it&#x27;s not entirely perfect</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the jar is too small, I wear it everyday (and probably touch up one to two times)  and it only lasts one month to six weeks.</li>
            <li> My job is very active and it doesn&#x27;t melt off through sweat.</li>
            <li> so I can blend them and use them year round.</li>
            <li> and I am not that pale.  </li>
            <li> This works as well as the expensive Bare Mineral line</li>
            <li> I did not put it on thick-</li>
            <li> And by coverage I don&#x27;t mean that it cakes on, because it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after trying other Maybelline products expecting the same bang for my buck; however, this product is horrible!</li>
            <li> $$ Wasted :(</li>
            <li> im just sad</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I cannot find it anywhere in the stores</li>
            <li> The world is crazy.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed about that as it&#x27;s usually over priced online for this reason.  </li>
            <li> but I was wrong!</li>
            <li> I have NOTHING bad to say about this stuff.</li>
            <li> Badly.</li>
            <li> they dont sell these in stores anymore :( :(</li>
            <li> It made my skin break out terribly</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back and forth between many foundations and yet always find myself coming back to this one. It is the only foundation I&#x27;ve found that blends and matches my skin PERFECTLY! I have oily/combination skin that becomes very dry in the winter and this suits my skin throughout all its different \\&quot;moods\\&quot;. If i need to conceal a spot i just put a little powder on an eyeshadow brush and apply it like I would a concealer and then apply the foundation on top of it. Why pay a bunch of money for bare minerals when you are getting a product of similar or even better quality? My only complaint is that the jar is too small, I wear it everyday (and probably touch up one to two times)  and it only lasts one month to six weeks. I LOVE THIS FOUNDATION! If you like powder/mineral foundations, definitley give this one a try!</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll start buying this stuff online now. It&#x27;s a littler cheaper than it comes on the shelf.  I have NOTHING bad to say about this stuff. It is the ONLY makeup I use and all I need! I don&#x27;t wear eye makeup.  Note that this is a foundation-powder mix, no foundation necessary, it goes on smooth, kind of like powdered sugar does to your fingers lol  I am a little allergic do some stuff that is dumped into the water supply and therefore get a red break out on my cheek that never goes away (trying to get a filtering shower head). This stuff makes it fanish! One of my friends has the same thing and I put this on her and it made her pretty happy. Another one of my friends watched me put it on and said \\&quot;Wow it just makes everything disappear! It turns invisible!\\&quot;  It truly does! love love love looooooove this makeup. It also really natural, doesn&#x27;t deplete the ozone layer, no crazy chemicals and other stuff I have to worry about breaking out to.  The lightest shade I&#x27;ve seen of this, kind of close to white, it actually just a powder. I bought it once because I wanted a light color, and when it didn&#x27;t cover, I realized it wasn&#x27;t the mineral powder but just a finishing powder or something kept in the same container. So be careful if you come across a really light version of this. It&#x27;s probably the vanishing or finishing powder or whatever it&#x27;s called.  AGAIN, NOOOO complaints! none! It seems like you get a small amount but a little really goes a long way. It&#x27;s kind of pricey, but I keep one container for a minimum of 2 weeks, more like a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this mineral powder foundation for a while now but I fear it&#x27;s been discontinued.  I was very happy to be able to get 4 of them at a very good price.  Gives good coverage for my oily and slightly red in spots skin.  Goes on smoothly and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The only makeup I ever use. Blends perfectly with my skin tone, I love it.</li>
            <li> great ,,enough coverage when im in a rush and goes on well over my matte dream mousse cr√®me ,,but it gives a glow on its own</li>
            <li> Great coverage! This is the best foundation out there for women on a budget. At the end of the day my face still looks clear.</li>
            <li> My favorite foundation! Great cover, perfect for combination skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after trying other Maybelline products expecting the same bang for my buck; however, this product is horrible! It made my skin break out terribly and you can feel it sinking into your skin. I thought maybe it was the brush, so I used my own name brand brush and it did not help with the application or irritation. I did not put it on thick- but even a light coating felt like I had caked it on. It looks and feels like you&#x27;re rubbing colored chalk all over your face. I will NEVER buy this or any of Maybelline&#x27;s &#x27;mineral&#x27; products again. $$ Wasted :(</li>
            <li> this is just the most perfect powder for face it stays on and makes me look sexy lmao oh yeah also its not noticeable that you have makeup on your face meaning it blends in well with the skin and it gives you like a natural look im just sad they dont sell these in stores anymore :( :(</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I haven&#x27;t found another mineral powder that covers as well as this stuff. Unfortunately, I cannot find it anywhere in the stores so I have to bulk order it online (which is okay too!). The brush is very cheap, I use my own instead. I wish it came in larger containers as well, its that good!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this does a great job. I also have freckles and it covers them moderately (which I like, I don&#x27;t want the caked on look and this is perfect).</li>
            <li> I am hooked on this product. Does not cause any pimples or irritation on my skin. Price is a steal.</li>
            <li> Great coverage for a mineral foundation. It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t cake up on my face. I feel as if I&#x27;m wearing no makeup at all. And it stays on all day. I expected it to rub off in the first few hours but I was wrong! I purchased a light and a dark so I can blend them and use them year round.</li>
            <li> Great powder...light and yet covers.</li>
            <li> Did not receive the right color</li>
            <li> I use this powder whenever I go out and I love it! Covers blemishes pretty well considering how cheap it is and stays on for the entire day. Obviously there are better products out there, but for this price it does exactly what I need it to.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that Maybelline no longer makes the mineral powder since it is natural and good for your skin.I liked that it was flat and didn&#x27;t have sparkles in it like some of the other brands. Organic or natural brands of anything, even food and vitamins and cosmetics are so much better for people but they do not keep making them or they over price them so much that it is hard to afford them.The world is crazy. I guess I won&#x27;t be buying Maybelline  products anymore.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this item, I was assuming I would receive a loose powder, as pictured above. What I got was a liquid foundation. I&#x27;m not sure if the image above is inaccurate or there was a flux in the shipment, but whatever it was, it was not \\&quot;Mineral Power POWDER.\\&quot; It was \\&quot;Mineral Power Natural Perfecting Foundation.\\&quot;     At first I was okay with that, thinking I&#x27;ll try it anyways. So I did and discovered that this liquid foundation caused my skin to break out. Badly. It&#x27;s safe to say that I wasted $10</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals gets greasy looking during the day. This does not. It&#x27;s perfect! I have also used the mineral power liquid foundation from Maybelline, but no thanks. This product has made me a powder mineral foundation lover for life ;)</li>
            <li> Love this.  Wish they had not stopped making it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this makeup!! I used to spend a lot of money buying the bare mineral makeup when it first came out and I loved it so much that I was afraid to try something new. But I am so glad I did! This is much cheaper than bare minerals and just as a great of a product. This has become my go to product. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the application brush so I just use the one that came with my bare minerals.</li>
            <li> While I do not personally use this product, my granddaughter does and swears by the quality and effectiveness.  I would certainly buy this product for anyone looking for such an item.</li>
            <li> first and foremost the price is not too hurtful unlike other brands, it&#x27;s not entirely perfect but it&#x27;s more than enough, i have gotten more than what i have paid for!</li>
            <li> I love this foundation.  I cant find it in stores any more. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This works as well as the expensive Bare Mineral line</li>
            <li> I could no longer find this product in stores so I purchased 3 to have a supply on hand. I&#x27;ve been using this mineral powder for 5+ years and find the coverage to be light but conceals skin color imperfections.</li>
            <li> this powder is the best i have been ever used. it stays all day. it is soft and looks so naturally. i wear it all the time.</li>
            <li> For being LIGHT color, it was way too dark and I am not that pale.  Plus the coverage is sparse.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Wife loved it--and the price! However the packages appeared to have been around the world a time or two.</li>
            <li> I love this make up and it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find.  I can no longer find it in local stores as I think Maybelline has stopped making it.  I am very disappointed about that as it&#x27;s usually over priced online for this reason.  It matches wonderfully to my skin and I can hardly tell I&#x27;m wearing anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s really low as far as chemicals go according to skindeeps website which talks above the dangers of what products you use and how they effect your body.</li>
            <li> I tried this make up out for the first time roughly 3 years ago, and fell in love with it instantly. It gives the coverage of a liquid foundation, but feels like air putting it on. I tried bare minerals, and personally felt like there wasn&#x27;t enough coverage. And by coverage I don&#x27;t mean that it cakes on, because it doesn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s the best part: it blends so well, yet you are still able to cover blemishes, etc. Great for lots of skin types too. I have extremely sensitive skin (literally found out I was allergic to my mascara only when it touches my skin...same goes for my old shampoo!), and my skin texture varies from oily to dry depending on the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I cannot recommend a better face make up product than this one. Even if you are on the fence, for a price this cheap, you need to try it.</li>
            <li> Very good price first of all and the product is what I&#x27;d hoped for.  Light coverage, not too powdery looking when on the face.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation. it looks very naturally and medium coverage. If you love mineral foundations give this one a try;)</li>
            <li> My go-to makeup as I use just serum and/or moisturizer and this powder - no foundation. It looks very natural and I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Goes on well. Last for 8 hours at work. My job is very active and it doesn&#x27;t melt off through sweat. Wish it had more coverage&lt;br /&gt;though</li>
            <li> I first used this product after I tried Bare minerals, and you know what?  I think I like it better, and it doesnt cost as much.  But for some reason the stores dont seem to carry this product any longer, does any one know why?</li>
            <li> This is EXACTLY like Bare Minerals. It covers very well and stays on for 12 hours!! I love this stuff. Powder goes on light but you can add it thicker if you want. It blends well with a larger brush. Love it!</li>
            <li> Best foundation I have found so far</li>
            <li> hello I&#x27;m very new to the make up world and I hope someone out there is welling to help. I have question does this work with very skin color I&#x27;m black.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and found I could not purchase it in Australia.  Thank you</li>
