            <li>The Gabels&#x27; lotion version does not bite and still has that wonderful crisp smell of bay rum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>nice fragrance...</li>
            <li>I love the smell of good bay rum</li>
            <li>This Bay Rum has a nice aroma.  </li>
            <li>Feels refreshing good  barbershop style aftershave.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this product IF you are looking for that clean scent and feel you experienced after the barber finished your haircut and neckline trim.</li>
            <li>when my grandfather tought me how to use a straight razor, it felt good , smelt good, and made me feel good</li>
            <li>shipper did a great job securing this for transit and arrived safe and sound.</li>
            <li>The feeling is oily and the scent is like a sage and very strong, like the spice that is stuck on a ham before baking it.     </li>
            <li>This stuff is a great addition to a nice shave set you might have or a double edge razor/straight edge, and has a great smell.  </li>
            <li>An inexpensive (OK, real cheap) aftershave, the sort of thing barbers buy by the gallon.</li>
            <li>Nothing fancy here, dollar for dollar just an honest aftershave that leaves your face feeling great and you smelling like a real man.</li>
            <li>Feels great and smells very nice especially in anticipation of the workday.</li>
            <li>First experienced it at a mens salon.</li>
            <li>Certainly a fine value, even with the shipping charge--which was MORE than the cost of the product!  </li>
            <li>Aftershave for men is not meant to cover scent, but to be pleasant and therapeutic for a freshly shaved face.</li>
            <li>Such a great product!</li>
            <li>My most favorite aftershave.</li>
            <li>And for a fantastic price!  </li>
            <li>better than aqua velva  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an interesting scent.</li>
            <li>I bought and am enjoying using the Gabels Bay Rum.</li>
            <li>The aftershave was everything I hoped for and more.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>It was a great &amp; fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many I have ordered so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>many, many years ago so I bought this product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this and will purchase more when the time comes.</li>
            <li>Smells like the Barber Shop when I was a kid...went with my father or grand daddy to get a haircut</li>
            <li>I always felt more grown up sitting in that chair,</li>
            <li>I love Bay Rum.</li>
            <li>Per the listed ingredients, Gabel&#x27;s is mostly denatured alcohol, WATER, some type of sugar and then Bay Oil.  </li>
            <li>One more note:  </li>
            <li>I have been using Gabel&#x27;s Bay Rum for many years now; there is just nothing else like it.  </li>
            <li>It feels good going on a freshly shaved face meaning it will not bite you.  </li>
            <li>This feels better on the face, and is easier to use.  </li>
            <li>huge bottle..sets nicely on the skin...</li>
            <li>I had finished a bottle of Pinaud&#x27;s and now think it was much better than the Gabels.</li>
            <li>Love this shave lotion.</li>
            <li>This bay rum smells better than the rest</li>
            <li>but today&#x27;s barber shops are more like a woman&#x27;s salon and don&#x27;t know what Bay Rum is..</li>
            <li>I love the smell and feel of Bay Rum.</li>
            <li>but for much more than on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Also great for putting on a warm towel old fashioned style.</li>
            <li>All and all OK, but will not buy again.</li>
            <li>this is the genuine stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff for aftershave.  </li>
            <li>I love this bay rum scent.  </li>
            <li>I love Bay Rum and have since I was a kid.</li>
            <li>remember my barber using many years ago.</li>
            <li>Make sure you shake the bottle before use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very innocuous and good right after shaving.</li>
            <li>Of course everyone prefers their own unique smell.</li>
            <li>If you want bay rum aftershave  without all the fussy additives and at a great price then I highly recommend gabels bay rum.</li>
            <li>Also good for a pick-me up on a hot day.</li>
            <li>while i was saddened the scent fades after a tiny bit the fact that it&#x27;s not overpowering or burns offsets, a very good product.</li>
            <li>Great old school scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s barely available in stores any more, so</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use most fragrances, because of chemical allergies, but this seems to be free of &amp;#34;chemical pollutants.&amp;#34; Will order again.</li>
            <li>Good price, very speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>I am searching for a clean refreshing feeling with the scent of telic powder.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, there it was and I am happy to have found it.  </li>
            <li>initially strong.....</li>
            <li>The scent is authentic and the price is right!</li>
            <li>A nice, light, clove smelling aftershave that is suitable for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for the working man, who has to go to the office or job site everyday and doesn&#x27;t want the smell to be too strong.</li>
            <li>liked it so much</li>
            <li>A light comfortable aftershave.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t hurt that this stuff is CHEAP.</li>
            <li>Still, if the product is still available when I&#x27;ve gone through 16 oz.</li>
            <li>The fact that no animal testing is performed with Gabel&#x27;s is also important to me as well as others.</li>
            <li>Everything went as planned and the product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>great value, and a trip back in time....</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful everyday use aftershave.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased a bottle of this bay rum and am extremely happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this Bay Rum so that I could enjoy that old time Barber Shop feeling and fragrance after a good shave.</li>
            <li>PRODUCT IS AS DESCRIBED, SELLER WAS VERY EASY TO DEAL WITH AND VERY RESPONSIVE TO QUESTIONS.</li>
            <li>After Shave Lotion Made with Original Bay Rum Oils from the Virgin Islands</li>
            <li>and then it&#x27;s just the perfect amount of fragrance - not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li>It stings at first when you splash it on your face but then immediately feels refreshing.      </li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Pretty potent, but I like that.</li>
            <li>The fragrance level is just right for me since I don&#x27;t use strong over powering fragrances.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands of bay rum, and this is just as good, and at a better price.</li>
            <li>But for personal use, Gabels is a good choice.</li>
            <li>Gabels Bay Rum is too sweet like sugar to please me.</li>
            <li>I was using another bay rum aftershave (Honey Bee Gardens) which I found to be too sweet.  </li>
            <li>A good purchase, and I plan on getting the gallon size next.</li>
            <li>and  you should try it if you are looking for quality, without  the clove smell...a true bay rum smell....</li>
            <li>However, I have tried many bay rum products and really like this as it does not try to hide or mix the bay rum smell.</li>
            <li>Most effective for a soothing afershave,and a body lotion for any scrapes or dry skin.</li>
            <li>IN VERY QUICK ORDER.WOULD DO BUSINESS WITH HIM AGAIN;-).</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands and this has a great value.</li>
            <li>It has a subtle, wonderful, not overpowering, fragrance for which I get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li>Give it a try and you will become a loyal fan.</li>
            <li>fades quickly even though I now do what the bottle says and coat my face, neck, shoulders and chest with the stuff.</li>
            <li>LIke most other after shaves in my opinion but this one burns the right amount which is nice.</li>
            <li>Modern, get Gabels !!</li>
            <li>When it arrived the first thing I did was have a clean shave and put it on.</li>
            <li>A great value - why would you spend far more money for mucl less product that is of inferior qulity?</li>
            <li>I was looking for the classic bay rum \\&quot;barbershop smell\\&quot; and wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to be exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Service was amazing, as product arrived only two days after I placed order, traveling from California to Massachusetts!</li>
            <li>Love the smell old skool barber smell</li>
            <li>This after shave is refreshing and contains natural ingredients, so it does not affect people with fragrence allergies.  </li>
            <li>If you like the Old School Barber shop smell, you will love this Bay rum</li>
            <li>This is now a favorite with a soft scent and coolness upon the skin.</li>
            <li>The smell alone is worth the purchase ...</li>
            <li>Husband Charles says this product is worth the search for it.  </li>
            <li>I believe their formula most closely resembles the old formulae found in barber shops of years past,regardless of what their competitors may say...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Stings like hell, worth every second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not fancy, just honest daily bay rum.</li>
            <li>Nice different smell.</li>
            <li>This aftershave has a subtle scent, and it&#x27;s the most appealing, most soothing aftershave</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s right...</li>
            <li>While I have \\&quot;finer\\&quot; bay rums that I reserve for special occasions, this one is superb for frequent everyday use, particularly in the summer months.</li>
            <li>While this stuff smells pretty good coming out of the plastic bottle, it has absolutely NO staying power whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>Better than Old Spice my first aftershave when I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>The scent is definitely not over powering, and is suitable for a work environment.</li>
            <li>If people come in close proximity to you they will smell a light, but complimenting smell of lovely spice, cinnamon, and bay oil scents which seem to work very well with male skin</li>
            <li>It is different and unique and smells so much better than many of the other aftershave products available today.  </li>
            <li>The haircut was always a pleasure and when the barber was done he take that warm lather to the back of my neck and finish with a straight razor.</li>
            <li>good price value for a typical Barber shop product</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy, just wish the fragrant smell would last a bit longer.</li>
            <li>Scent is kinda strong when you first put it on, but it does lessen considerably.</li>
            <li>I like the smell of Gabels Bay Rum VERY much..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin, &#x27;cause my complexion has never been better.    </li>
            <li>I first bought this bay rum while working in California.  </li>
            <li>This is great for daily use when you&#x27;re not going out or needing something to smell all day long.  </li>
            <li>My only thought that would make this better, would be the addition of witch hazel.  </li>
            <li>Man I miss those days, at least I have that great fragrance once again to remember those by gone days of yesteryear.</li>
            <li>If you put your contacts on first the fragrance won&#x27;t get on your eyes.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>and I definitely will order more when the first order is nearing depletion..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; barber shop bay rum scent (Stephan&#x27;s, Pinaud, etc...), the Gabels has more of a bay oil scent mixed with clove.</li>
            <li>I love the smell though, brings back my childhood and hanging with my Dad...</li>
            <li>It has a clean and refreshing smell, and does not sting or burn like some other products.</li>
            <li>Not overpowering or perfumy just right and very inexpensive</li>
            <li>/&gt;Was introduced to this great product by a Nice Gillette Super Speed, has a little less additives then Pinaud and a little more pain&lt;</li>
            <li>It comes in a plastic bottle, so if you intend it as a nice gift, you might try one of the other brands that use a fancy glass bottle.  </li>
            <li>it arived wednesday afternoon at four oclock, i could not wait i went in and took a good hot shower and then aplied the bay rum, the sudden rush of scent sent me back in time to</li>
            <li>, i will be buying more in the future thanks.</li>
            <li>I love the &#x27;old timey&#x27; scent of Bay Rum but would not waste my money on this brand again.</li>
            <li>Order a bottle and enjoy wearing a distinctive scent that few will recognize,but many will admire.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an affordable bay rum aftershave with great skin toning properties, and reasonably long lasting scent.</li>
            <li>When you splash it on, the aftershave is somewhat astringent but not markedly so, and the fragrance is more on the fresh/spicy side.</li>
            <li>Nice aftershave for the skin; not useful as a cologne.</li>
            <li>The smell is def bay rum, however it doesn&#x27;t stick around long, which is why I say its good for daily use.  </li>
            <li>Same bottle is still going strong after five years.</li>
            <li>of bay rum, I&#x27;ll almost certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li>I bought two large bottles from this company and use it every day..</li>
            <li>I just wish the bottle wasn&#x27;t so large</li>
            <li>my skin&#x27;s nice and soft after, neither dry nor oily.</li>
            <li>he explains it very well too.</li>
            <li>My father really likes it as well.</li>
            <li>The Gabels product is very satisfactory, pehaps not quite the quality of St. John&#x27;s Bay Rum.</li>
            <li>and I really, really like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;A very manly scent.</li>
            <li>when the package arrived it had a distinct bay rum aroma, but the bottle was sealed and as far as I can tell had not leaked.</li>
            <li>I did not expect as much from an inexpensive Bay Rum.</li>
            <li>After Shave Lotion does have a very man pleasing scent.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be crippled for the whole day.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what happens</li>
            <li>I really like the smell</li>
            <li>Bay Rum.. when a man wants to feel like a real man..</li>
            <li>thanks john</li>
            <li>think that every bay rum aftershave I have tried is better than this swill.  </li>
            <li>and I must say I really like the way it feels and smells.</li>
            <li>Too much water and alcohol.  </li>
            <li>The price difference and common sense make it a good and serviceable choice.</li>
            <li>Sure enough I immediately started to receive compliments on the smell and how much it reminded people of an old fashioned barbershop--exactly what I wanted to hear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found Pinaud Clubman to be better and especially like some of the higher end Bay Rums - but for the money still a solid purchase</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like, but it has a very authentic Natural Bay rum fragrance and you can&#x27;t beat the amount for the price.</li>
            <li>the scent is better than average.  </li>
            <li>and my skin is pretty sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Not an expensive Bay rum like most of them, but was surprised how much I liked the scent and after shave wake up with this.</li>
            <li>I also have tried the Stephan&#x27;s brand, and that fragrance is recognizable, along with the old stand-by Clubman Pinaud after shave.</li>
            <li>live on St. John island if that makes any difference!</li>
            <li>A classic.</li>
            <li>I prefer to use witch hazel for my after shave, but having caught a whiff of this stuff at a classic barber shop, I had to buy a bottle of this liquid.</li>
            <li>I will be a steady customer of Gabels Bay Rum</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended -- this is my aftershave for life.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly&#x27;</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>dont waste your time with other bay rums that claim to be great...</li>
            <li>Smells good when it goes on, but the Rum spreads so thinly</li>
            <li>And despite a very modest price, it proved to be of high quality.</li>
            <li>I think Pinaud&#x27;s version of Bay Rum is a little nicer in my humble opinion, but this is pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great everyday aftershave that costs so little</li>
            <li>This stuff is mostly alcohol, very little bay rum scent.</li>
            <li>Unlike some of the reviews, I found that the fragrance lasted all day, although it certainly mellowed and became more subtle as the day wore on.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so I have tried every new product sold, so believe me when I say Gabel&#x27;s Bay Rum does not clog pores, leave an oily feel or film, nor does it promote acne.  </li>
            <li>It has a light clove, slightly spicey fragrance.</li>
            <li>It smells just slightly different than what I usually sniff at the barbershop, but it&#x27;s the same good stuff.</li>
            <li>It has a rich and fairly long lasting scent...</li>
            <li>Be careful when you pour it into you hand because it comes out of the bottle real fast.  </li>
            <li>girlfriend said that it smells like an old man</li>
            <li>Unmistakeable masculine scent 4)</li>
            <li>I will buy the Humco product on line directly online from them.  </li>
            <li>Cannot really review the product as it arrived all beat up, torn and leaking inside three different mailing packages.</li>
            <li>even tho i,am 80 years old</li>
            <li>all the people comment on my OLD</li>
            <li>wow...</li>
            <li>and my eyes are sensitive to it, but it happened and I want to put this out there to warn contact wearers.</li>
            <li>gabels bay rum is old school</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly worth trying, I only wish I could get it locally.</li>
            <li>This historical aftershave lotion defines classic barber shop masculine scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very strong, but strong enough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very low burn and has a nice (but subtle) bay rum scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Like almost all bay rums, the fragrance is not strong for hours but fades to a subtle scent, which makes it great for today&#x27;s workplace.</li>
            <li>But then again, it&#x27;s about half the price and quite adequate.</li>
            <li>I have used lots of different bay rums, this one is great.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to anyone who likes bay rum.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d figure an average of 4 stars on reviews would mean a good product?</li>
            <li>It is made from pure bay leaf crushed oils, and feels soft and soothing on the skin.</li>
            <li>This does tighten the skin up and leaves my face feeling soft, not dry.  </li>
            <li>or my skin would get super dried out.     </li>
            <li>I bought it for my husband because he has a very sensitive skin and has to shave on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>Has less alcohol than many aftershaves, so less sting.</li>
            <li>I like the product very much and have used it for several years; however the last 2 times I ordered from you the bottles were not sealed properly and about one third had leaked out in the delivery process.</li>
            <li>So far have purchased 6 different kinds.</li>
            <li>but I think the fragrance floats around and gets into your eyes a little bit, and if you put on your contacts it traps it right in your eye and BURNS.  </li>
            <li>It has the right scent, and isn&#x27;t too harsh on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I was fooled at first because of the slight medicine smell on the nose of the fragrance, don&#x27;t let it fool you.</li>
            <li>buy a large container and pour a little in the spa!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Good price.  </li>
            <li> It may as well be a bottle of perfume, it did not do anything good for my skin after shaving.</li>
            <li> The good part is the fragrance (smell?)</li>
            <li> It feels good all over after a shower and is never overbearing.  </li>

            <li> Good price on this bay rum.  </li>
            <li> Having tried the range of bay rums, I am convinced that for cost, ease of use, aroma GABELS Bay Rum is the best buy available.</li>

            <li> Has a pleasant smell and a nice feel when applying after a shave.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Works great, smells great, price is right</li>
            <li> The Gabels&#x27; lotion version does not bite and still has that wonderful crisp smell of bay rum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite after shave!</li>
            <li> Even better, my wife likes it also!</li>
            <li> So nice to be able to splash this on every morning!  </li>

            <li> Nice scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, not overpowering aroma.</li>
            <li> Well used after a shower or even better in consonance with a good close shave.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice that I can get it here.</li>
            <li> nice fragrance...</li>
            <li> I love the smell of good bay rum</li>
            <li> This Bay Rum has a nice aroma.  </li>
            <li> Feels refreshing good  barbershop style aftershave.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product IF you are looking for that clean scent and feel you experienced after the barber finished your haircut and neckline trim.</li>
            <li> when my grandfather tought me how to use a straight razor, it felt good , smelt good, and made me feel good</li>
            <li> shipper did a great job securing this for transit and arrived safe and sound.</li>
            <li> The feeling is oily and the scent is like a sage and very strong, like the spice that is stuck on a ham before baking it.     </li>
            <li> This stuff is a great addition to a nice shave set you might have or a double edge razor/straight edge, and has a great smell.  </li>
            <li> An inexpensive (OK, real cheap) aftershave, the sort of thing barbers buy by the gallon.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy here, dollar for dollar just an honest aftershave that leaves your face feeling great and you smelling like a real man.</li>
            <li> Feels great and smells very nice especially in anticipation of the workday.</li>
            <li> First experienced it at a mens salon.</li>
            <li> Certainly a fine value, even with the shipping charge--which was MORE than the cost of the product!  </li>
            <li> Aftershave for men is not meant to cover scent, but to be pleasant and therapeutic for a freshly shaved face.</li>
            <li> Such a great product!</li>
            <li> My most favorite aftershave.</li>
            <li> And for a fantastic price!  </li>
            <li> better than aqua velva  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an interesting scent.</li>
            <li> I bought and am enjoying using the Gabels Bay Rum.</li>
            <li> The aftershave was everything I hoped for and more.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> It was a great &amp; fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many I have ordered so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> many, many years ago so I bought this product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this and will purchase more when the time comes.</li>
            <li> Smells like the Barber Shop when I was a kid...went with my father or grand daddy to get a haircut</li>
            <li> I always felt more grown up sitting in that chair,</li>
            <li> I love Bay Rum.</li>
            <li> Per the listed ingredients, Gabel&#x27;s is mostly denatured alcohol, WATER, some type of sugar and then Bay Oil.  </li>
            <li> One more note:  </li>
            <li> I have been using Gabel&#x27;s Bay Rum for many years now; there is just nothing else like it.  </li>
            <li> It feels good going on a freshly shaved face meaning it will not bite you.  </li>
            <li> This feels better on the face, and is easier to use.  </li>
            <li> huge bottle..sets nicely on the skin...</li>
            <li> I had finished a bottle of Pinaud&#x27;s and now think it was much better than the Gabels.</li>
            <li> Love this shave lotion.</li>
            <li> This bay rum smells better than the rest</li>
            <li> but today&#x27;s barber shops are more like a woman&#x27;s salon and don&#x27;t know what Bay Rum is..</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of Bay Rum.</li>
            <li> but for much more than on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Also great for putting on a warm towel old fashioned style.</li>
            <li> All and all OK, but will not buy again.</li>
            <li> this is the genuine stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for aftershave.  </li>
            <li> I love this bay rum scent.  </li>
            <li> I love Bay Rum and have since I was a kid.</li>
            <li> remember my barber using many years ago.</li>
            <li> Make sure you shake the bottle before use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very innocuous and good right after shaving.</li>
            <li> Of course everyone prefers their own unique smell.</li>
            <li> If you want bay rum aftershave  without all the fussy additives and at a great price then I highly recommend gabels bay rum.</li>
            <li> Also good for a pick-me up on a hot day.</li>
            <li> while i was saddened the scent fades after a tiny bit the fact that it&#x27;s not overpowering or burns offsets, a very good product.</li>
            <li> Great old school scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s barely available in stores any more, so</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use most fragrances, because of chemical allergies, but this seems to be free of &amp;#34;chemical pollutants.&amp;#34; Will order again.</li>
            <li> Good price, very speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> I am searching for a clean refreshing feeling with the scent of telic powder.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, there it was and I am happy to have found it.  </li>
            <li> initially strong.....</li>
            <li> The scent is authentic and the price is right!</li>
            <li> A nice, light, clove smelling aftershave that is suitable for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for the working man, who has to go to the office or job site everyday and doesn&#x27;t want the smell to be too strong.</li>
            <li> liked it so much</li>
            <li> A light comfortable aftershave.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t hurt that this stuff is CHEAP.</li>
            <li> Still, if the product is still available when I&#x27;ve gone through 16 oz.</li>
            <li> The fact that no animal testing is performed with Gabel&#x27;s is also important to me as well as others.</li>
            <li> Everything went as planned and the product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> great value, and a trip back in time....</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful everyday use aftershave.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a bottle of this bay rum and am extremely happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this Bay Rum so that I could enjoy that old time Barber Shop feeling and fragrance after a good shave.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT IS AS DESCRIBED, SELLER WAS VERY EASY TO DEAL WITH AND VERY RESPONSIVE TO QUESTIONS.</li>
            <li> After Shave Lotion Made with Original Bay Rum Oils from the Virgin Islands</li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;s just the perfect amount of fragrance - not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> It stings at first when you splash it on your face but then immediately feels refreshing.      </li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Pretty potent, but I like that.</li>
            <li> The fragrance level is just right for me since I don&#x27;t use strong over powering fragrances.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of bay rum, and this is just as good, and at a better price.</li>
            <li> But for personal use, Gabels is a good choice.</li>
            <li> Gabels Bay Rum is too sweet like sugar to please me.</li>
            <li> I was using another bay rum aftershave (Honey Bee Gardens) which I found to be too sweet.  </li>
            <li> A good purchase, and I plan on getting the gallon size next.</li>
            <li> and  you should try it if you are looking for quality, without  the clove smell...a true bay rum smell....</li>
            <li> However, I have tried many bay rum products and really like this as it does not try to hide or mix the bay rum smell.</li>
            <li> Most effective for a soothing afershave,and a body lotion for any scrapes or dry skin.</li>
            <li> IN VERY QUICK ORDER.WOULD DO BUSINESS WITH HIM AGAIN;-).</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and this has a great value.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle, wonderful, not overpowering, fragrance for which I get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> Give it a try and you will become a loyal fan.</li>
            <li> fades quickly even though I now do what the bottle says and coat my face, neck, shoulders and chest with the stuff.</li>
            <li> LIke most other after shaves in my opinion but this one burns the right amount which is nice.</li>
            <li> Modern, get Gabels !!</li>
            <li> When it arrived the first thing I did was have a clean shave and put it on.</li>
            <li> A great value - why would you spend far more money for mucl less product that is of inferior qulity?</li>
            <li> I was looking for the classic bay rum \\&quot;barbershop smell\\&quot; and wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to be exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Service was amazing, as product arrived only two days after I placed order, traveling from California to Massachusetts!</li>
            <li> Love the smell old skool barber smell</li>
            <li> This after shave is refreshing and contains natural ingredients, so it does not affect people with fragrence allergies.  </li>
            <li> If you like the Old School Barber shop smell, you will love this Bay rum</li>
            <li> This is now a favorite with a soft scent and coolness upon the skin.</li>
            <li> The smell alone is worth the purchase ...</li>
            <li> Husband Charles says this product is worth the search for it.  </li>
            <li> I believe their formula most closely resembles the old formulae found in barber shops of years past,regardless of what their competitors may say...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Stings like hell, worth every second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not fancy, just honest daily bay rum.</li>
            <li> Nice different smell.</li>
            <li> This aftershave has a subtle scent, and it&#x27;s the most appealing, most soothing aftershave</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s right...</li>
            <li> While I have \\&quot;finer\\&quot; bay rums that I reserve for special occasions, this one is superb for frequent everyday use, particularly in the summer months.</li>
            <li> While this stuff smells pretty good coming out of the plastic bottle, it has absolutely NO staying power whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> Better than Old Spice my first aftershave when I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> The scent is definitely not over powering, and is suitable for a work environment.</li>
            <li> If people come in close proximity to you they will smell a light, but complimenting smell of lovely spice, cinnamon, and bay oil scents which seem to work very well with male skin</li>
            <li> It is different and unique and smells so much better than many of the other aftershave products available today.  </li>
            <li> The haircut was always a pleasure and when the barber was done he take that warm lather to the back of my neck and finish with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> good price value for a typical Barber shop product</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy, just wish the fragrant smell would last a bit longer.</li>
            <li> Scent is kinda strong when you first put it on, but it does lessen considerably.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of Gabels Bay Rum VERY much..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin, &#x27;cause my complexion has never been better.    </li>
            <li> I first bought this bay rum while working in California.  </li>
            <li> This is great for daily use when you&#x27;re not going out or needing something to smell all day long.  </li>
            <li> My only thought that would make this better, would be the addition of witch hazel.  </li>
            <li> Man I miss those days, at least I have that great fragrance once again to remember those by gone days of yesteryear.</li>
            <li> If you put your contacts on first the fragrance won&#x27;t get on your eyes.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> and I definitely will order more when the first order is nearing depletion..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; barber shop bay rum scent (Stephan&#x27;s, Pinaud, etc...), the Gabels has more of a bay oil scent mixed with clove.</li>
            <li> I love the smell though, brings back my childhood and hanging with my Dad...</li>
            <li> It has a clean and refreshing smell, and does not sting or burn like some other products.</li>
            <li> Not overpowering or perfumy just right and very inexpensive</li>
            <li> /&gt;Was introduced to this great product by a Nice Gillette Super Speed, has a little less additives then Pinaud and a little more pain&lt;</li>
            <li> It comes in a plastic bottle, so if you intend it as a nice gift, you might try one of the other brands that use a fancy glass bottle.  </li>
            <li> it arived wednesday afternoon at four oclock, i could not wait i went in and took a good hot shower and then aplied the bay rum, the sudden rush of scent sent me back in time to</li>
            <li> , i will be buying more in the future thanks.</li>
            <li> I love the &#x27;old timey&#x27; scent of Bay Rum but would not waste my money on this brand again.</li>
            <li> Order a bottle and enjoy wearing a distinctive scent that few will recognize,but many will admire.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an affordable bay rum aftershave with great skin toning properties, and reasonably long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> When you splash it on, the aftershave is somewhat astringent but not markedly so, and the fragrance is more on the fresh/spicy side.</li>
            <li> Nice aftershave for the skin; not useful as a cologne.</li>
            <li> The smell is def bay rum, however it doesn&#x27;t stick around long, which is why I say its good for daily use.  </li>
            <li> Same bottle is still going strong after five years.</li>
            <li> of bay rum, I&#x27;ll almost certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought two large bottles from this company and use it every day..</li>
            <li> I just wish the bottle wasn&#x27;t so large</li>
            <li> my skin&#x27;s nice and soft after, neither dry nor oily.</li>
            <li> he explains it very well too.</li>
            <li> My father really likes it as well.</li>
            <li> The Gabels product is very satisfactory, pehaps not quite the quality of St. John&#x27;s Bay Rum.</li>
            <li> and I really, really like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;A very manly scent.</li>
            <li> when the package arrived it had a distinct bay rum aroma, but the bottle was sealed and as far as I can tell had not leaked.</li>
            <li> I did not expect as much from an inexpensive Bay Rum.</li>
            <li> After Shave Lotion does have a very man pleasing scent.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be crippled for the whole day.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what happens</li>
            <li> I really like the smell</li>
            <li> Bay Rum.. when a man wants to feel like a real man..</li>
            <li> thanks john</li>
            <li> think that every bay rum aftershave I have tried is better than this swill.  </li>
            <li> and I must say I really like the way it feels and smells.</li>
            <li> Too much water and alcohol.  </li>
            <li> The price difference and common sense make it a good and serviceable choice.</li>
            <li> Sure enough I immediately started to receive compliments on the smell and how much it reminded people of an old fashioned barbershop--exactly what I wanted to hear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found Pinaud Clubman to be better and especially like some of the higher end Bay Rums - but for the money still a solid purchase</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like, but it has a very authentic Natural Bay rum fragrance and you can&#x27;t beat the amount for the price.</li>
            <li> the scent is better than average.  </li>
            <li> and my skin is pretty sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Not an expensive Bay rum like most of them, but was surprised how much I liked the scent and after shave wake up with this.</li>
            <li> I also have tried the Stephan&#x27;s brand, and that fragrance is recognizable, along with the old stand-by Clubman Pinaud after shave.</li>
            <li> live on St. John island if that makes any difference!</li>
            <li> A classic.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use witch hazel for my after shave, but having caught a whiff of this stuff at a classic barber shop, I had to buy a bottle of this liquid.</li>
            <li> I will be a steady customer of Gabels Bay Rum</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended -- this is my aftershave for life.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly&#x27;</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> dont waste your time with other bay rums that claim to be great...</li>
            <li> Smells good when it goes on, but the Rum spreads so thinly</li>
            <li> And despite a very modest price, it proved to be of high quality.</li>
            <li> I think Pinaud&#x27;s version of Bay Rum is a little nicer in my humble opinion, but this is pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great everyday aftershave that costs so little</li>
            <li> This stuff is mostly alcohol, very little bay rum scent.</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the reviews, I found that the fragrance lasted all day, although it certainly mellowed and became more subtle as the day wore on.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I have tried every new product sold, so believe me when I say Gabel&#x27;s Bay Rum does not clog pores, leave an oily feel or film, nor does it promote acne.  </li>
            <li> It has a light clove, slightly spicey fragrance.</li>
            <li> It smells just slightly different than what I usually sniff at the barbershop, but it&#x27;s the same good stuff.</li>
            <li> It has a rich and fairly long lasting scent...</li>
            <li> Be careful when you pour it into you hand because it comes out of the bottle real fast.  </li>
            <li> girlfriend said that it smells like an old man</li>
            <li> Unmistakeable masculine scent 4)</li>
            <li> I will buy the Humco product on line directly online from them.  </li>
            <li> Cannot really review the product as it arrived all beat up, torn and leaking inside three different mailing packages.</li>
            <li> even tho i,am 80 years old</li>
            <li> all the people comment on my OLD</li>
            <li> wow...</li>
            <li> and my eyes are sensitive to it, but it happened and I want to put this out there to warn contact wearers.</li>
            <li> gabels bay rum is old school</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly worth trying, I only wish I could get it locally.</li>
            <li> This historical aftershave lotion defines classic barber shop masculine scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very strong, but strong enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very low burn and has a nice (but subtle) bay rum scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Like almost all bay rums, the fragrance is not strong for hours but fades to a subtle scent, which makes it great for today&#x27;s workplace.</li>
            <li> But then again, it&#x27;s about half the price and quite adequate.</li>
            <li> I have used lots of different bay rums, this one is great.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to anyone who likes bay rum.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d figure an average of 4 stars on reviews would mean a good product?</li>
            <li> It is made from pure bay leaf crushed oils, and feels soft and soothing on the skin.</li>
            <li> This does tighten the skin up and leaves my face feeling soft, not dry.  </li>
            <li> or my skin would get super dried out.     </li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband because he has a very sensitive skin and has to shave on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> Has less alcohol than many aftershaves, so less sting.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much and have used it for several years; however the last 2 times I ordered from you the bottles were not sealed properly and about one third had leaked out in the delivery process.</li>
            <li> So far have purchased 6 different kinds.</li>
            <li> but I think the fragrance floats around and gets into your eyes a little bit, and if you put on your contacts it traps it right in your eye and BURNS.  </li>
            <li> It has the right scent, and isn&#x27;t too harsh on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I was fooled at first because of the slight medicine smell on the nose of the fragrance, don&#x27;t let it fool you.</li>
            <li> buy a large container and pour a little in the spa!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As the scent is very subtle, if you want a strong Bay Rum scent about you you&#x27;ll need to throw on some cologne.     </li>
            <li> Those who complain about the scent not remaining long enough should stick to cologne.</li>
            <li> Smell does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> Not bad but not great (from my perspective).  </li>
            <li> It is not available where we live.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many other different bay rums in the past but not liked them.  </li>
            <li> And it not too overpowering as long as you know how to apply.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;A haircut is not complete until you get the bay rum&amp;#34; Then he would simulate slapping hands with Bay Rum after shave on them on your neck.</li>
            <li> It fades quickly, and then lingers very subtly on the skin for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Back in the late 1940&#x27;s and early 1950&#x27;s every barbershop splashed Bay Rum on a man or boy after cutting his hair..and it made us feel more like a man..</li>
            <li> I only purchased it because the other was not offered.</li>
            <li> I found the scent to be far to weak and what little there was completely disappeared with in minutes.</li>
            <li> The smell takes me back to when I was a wee little lad and getting my hair cut.</li>
            <li> Great after shave, terrible bottle.</li>
            <li> Minimal stinging.</li>
            <li> This is everything that I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> However, if you wear contacts read carefully.      </li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> I splash it on as soon as I step out of shower while still wet.  </li>
            <li> Not really.</li>
            <li> so I do get a slight Home Alone effect, but it is minor comparatively speaking.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Also has very little essential oils.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t feel a need to use any other brand.</li>
            <li> The Bay Rum that I usually use had the following ingredients:  Bay Oil, Ethyl Alcohol 50% by volume, fragrances, and Bitrex as a denaturant.  </li>
            <li> I tried other rum oil after shaves and each case</li>
            <li> Ihave always like bay rum after shave especially  Gabels, I have other brands in the past</li>
            <li> other seemed to capture the old-school barbershop scent as Gabels does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It may be due to being a regional thing.</li>
            <li> Within seconds the small is just flat gone.  </li>
            <li> I checked out the cost of buying 2, but the saving on shipping was not worth doing.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely not worth anything,</li>
            <li> I think they should slow that down with a smaller opening in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> It is not very strong smelling and wears off so don&#x27;t worry about it bothering others.</li>
            <li> much less the price.</li>
            <li> It was also less that what I was paying.</li>
            <li> If you are into heavy aftershave \\&quot;colognes\\&quot; then don&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li> Heavy scent masking 2)</li>
            <li> Fragrance gone after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Lasts maybe a few hours, then re-apply.</li>
            <li> Discovered this a few years ago.</li>
            <li> An everyday aftershave for work and for just going out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on this unless you like clove alcohol aftershave.</li>
            <li> even using the booster seat didn&#x27;t make feel less of a man even though I was just a small kid.</li>
            <li> Put your contacts on FIRST before you use this stuff, because otherwise it will burn your eyes so bad for like an hour</li>
            <li> It is not overwhelming in smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of aftershaves, but usually had to use some sort of lotion after</li>
            <li> When I use it after shaving it STINGS my skin for several seconds and is extreemly uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The Bay Rum that I usually use is by Humco, Texarkana, TX 75501.  </li>
            <li> Not overwhelming in smell but lasts a while.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice smell of Bay Rum.  It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like, but it has a very authentic Natural Bay rum fragrance and you can&#x27;t beat the amount for the price.</li>
            <li> Such a great product! Nuff said.</li>
            <li> no problems, got what I paid for...good service</li>
            <li> This is good after shave.  I am a trationalist when it comes to shaving and aftershaves.  This one brougth back memories of days gone by.  Good stuff but keep in mind it is aftershave and not cologne.</li>
            <li> My barber uses this at his shop, he turned me on to Gabels Bay Rum. This historical aftershave lotion defines classic barber shop masculine scent. It is the perfect compliment/finish to your straight razor or safety razor shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are one of those mega-chain store types that shaves with a triple edged expensive disposable blade that your wife buys you, this product is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much I was compelled to seek out the manufacturer. I found out they have been a family owned business since 1932. Now, as a Bay Rum enthusiast, I have tried them all (inc. St. Johns), and for the price and ingredients this one cannot be beat. It is made from pure bay leaf crushed oils, and feels soft and soothing on the skin. I was fooled at first because of the slight medicine smell on the nose of the fragrance, don&#x27;t let it fool you. Once you place it on your skin, it feels amazing and smells exceptional, it soothes the skin so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not overpowering, it is tastefully subtle. If you are into heavy aftershave \\&quot;colognes\\&quot; then don&#x27;t use this. This is perfect for the working man, who has to go to the office or job site everyday and doesn&#x27;t want the smell to be too strong. It fades quickly, and then lingers very subtly on the skin for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend said that it smells like an old man, I take this as the ultimate compliment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the \\&quot;Jimichonga\\&quot; review he explains it very well too.</li>
            <li> Good price.  Nice scent.</li>
            <li> This is a great after shave lotion.  It has the right scent, and isn&#x27;t too harsh on your skin.  To me, it smells like the lotion once used in barber shops.    It comes in a plastic bottle, so if you intend it as a nice gift, you might try one of the other brands that use a fancy glass bottle.  But for personal use, Gabels is a good choice.</li>
            <li> I use it daily. My most favorite aftershave. My father really likes it as well. A light comfortable aftershave. The fragrance level is just right for me since I don&#x27;t use strong over powering fragrances.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase.  I first bought this bay rum while working in California.  It is different and unique and smells so much better than many of the other aftershave products available today.  And for a fantastic price!  You cannot miss trying this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipper did a great job securing this for transit and arrived safe and sound.</li>
            <li> This is assuredly not a long-lasting cologne for date night, but for a great way to end a shave, it can&#x27;t be beat. It has a clean and refreshing smell, and does not sting or burn like some other products. And the price cannot be beat. Also good for a pick-me up on a hot day. All in all, a terrific product for it&#x27;s intended use.  &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> I have been a bay rum fan since I started shaving but in recent years have had difficulty locating it. I used to buy the Clubman version- which has a lot of alcohol in it and has a corresponding bite. The Gabels&#x27; lotion version does not bite and still has that wonderful crisp smell of bay rum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like almost all bay rums, the fragrance is not strong for hours but fades to a subtle scent, which makes it great for today&#x27;s workplace. If you want a longer, stronger smell choose a cologne rather then a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, Gabels&#x27; lotion is great for day-to-day use....</li>
            <li> better than aqua velva  it&#x27;s an interesting scent. it is cheaper on some barber supply websites, but I like it.</li>
            <li> I was GREATLY disappointed in this product. I am searching for a clean refreshing feeling with the scent of telic powder. I do not recommend this product IF you are looking for that clean scent and feel you experienced after the barber finished your haircut and neckline trim. I would have considered returning this but it is after all a personal product so in the trash it went. The feeling is oily and the scent is like a sage and very strong, like the spice that is stuck on a ham before baking it.     Jim Jones  Rochester NY</li>
            <li> GABELS Bay Rum After Shave Lotion Made with Original Bay Rum Oils from the Virgin Islands 16oz/1pt ... http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVIVYW/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title     I bought and am enjoying using the Gabels Bay Rum. I&#x27;ve compared it with to St. John&#x27;s and Royall Bay Rum, and Gabels ties with Royall for second place. The Gabels product is very satisfactory, pehaps not quite the quality of St. John&#x27;s Bay Rum. But then again, it&#x27;s about half the price and quite adequate. The price difference and common sense make it a good and serviceable choice.</li>
            <li> This is great for daily use when you&#x27;re not going out or needing something to smell all day long.  It does have alcohol so I do get a slight Home Alone effect, but it is minor comparatively speaking.  The smell is def bay rum, however it doesn&#x27;t stick around long, which is why I say its good for daily use.  This does tighten the skin up and leaves my face feeling soft, not dry.  My only thought that would make this better, would be the addition of witch hazel.  I add 4 tablespoons of witch hazel to help with some razor bumps i get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great, smells great, price is right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying various Bay Rum products as I have recently been bitten by it&#x27;s allure. This product in it&#x27;s unattractive bottle is actually very good! It&#x27;s not very strong, but strong enough. It does not burn after a shave. I splash my entire body with it and I really, really like it.</li>
            <li> it arived wednesday afternoon at four oclock, i could not wait i went in and took a good hot shower and then aplied the bay rum, the sudden rush of scent sent me back in time to when my grandfather tought me how to use a straight razor, it felt good , smelt good, and made me feel good, i will be buying more in the future thanks.</li>
            <li> This product is alcohol based and does not soothe the skin.  It may as well be a bottle of perfume, it did not do anything good for my skin after shaving.</li>
            <li> The aftershave was everything I hoped for and more. I was looking for the classic bay rum \\&quot;barbershop smell\\&quot; and wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to be exactly what I wanted.  When it arrived the first thing I did was have a clean shave and put it on. Sure enough I immediately started to receive compliments on the smell and how much it reminded people of an old fashioned barbershop--exactly what I wanted to hear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an affordable bay rum aftershave with great skin toning properties, and reasonably long lasting scent. The scent is definitely not over powering, and is suitable for a work environment. If people come in close proximity to you they will smell a light, but complimenting smell of lovely spice, cinnamon, and bay oil scents which seem to work very well with male skin chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very manly scent.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have been looking for something that reminded me of the olden days, &amp; this smell does it for me.  It was a great &amp; fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Look no further, this is the nicest traditional bay rum I have ever owned. Give it a try and you will become a loyal fan.</li>
            <li> A classic. Nothing fancy here, dollar for dollar just an honest aftershave that leaves your face feeling great and you smelling like a real man. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many I have ordered so far.&lt;br /&gt;This is my standard. Great After Shave. Great price.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel a need to use any other brand.</li>
            <li> MORE BAD NEWS UNHAPPY WIFE DOES NOT LIKE CLOVE SMELL AT ALL.</li>
            <li> Purchase this product if you want the following from an aftershave: 1)Soothing relief from blade abrasion 2) Pleasant and understated fragrance 3) Unmistakeable masculine scent 4) Greaseless absorption to the skin.    Do not purchase this product if you want the following from an aftershave: 1) Heavy scent masking 2) Trendy-flavored edgy hipness 3) Oily sheened florid facial complexion 4) Branded product self-esteem 5) Fewer dollars in your pocket.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.......smells just like the stuff the barber used to use as a kid and that I used to use in the service.  Good value, attractive bottle and made of good safe plastic.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the scent that MY barber used when I had my hair cut and neck shaved as a lad many, many years ago so I bought this product. After receiving it I&#x27;m still looking. Gabels Bay Rum is too sweet like sugar to please me. I want island spice not plantation sugar cane. The good part is the fragrance (smell?) fades quickly even though I now do what the bottle says and coat my face, neck, shoulders and chest with the stuff. Maybe in a couple months I&#x27;ll run out and just have to buy something else.</li>
            <li> Good price, very speedy delivery. It is not overwhelming in smell. Minimal stinging. I would recommend this and will purchase more when the time comes.</li>
            <li> Love the smell old skool barber smell</li>
            <li> This after shave is refreshing and contains natural ingredients, so it does not affect people with fragrence allergies.  It feels good all over after a shower and is never overbearing.  I highly reccomend this.</li>
            <li> Has less alcohol than many aftershaves, so less sting. Also has very little essential oils. Fragrance gone after a few minutes. Nice aftershave for the skin; not useful as a cologne.</li>
            <li> Smells like the Barber Shop when I was a kid...went with my father or grand daddy to get a haircut and I remember the smell of bay rum, pinauds and cigarettes while the news or sports was on TV and the \\&quot;grown ups\\&quot; were talking about politics or whatever...get it, this is good...</li>
            <li> It will probably take me a while to use the entire bottle. It&#x27;s just like I expected as far as quality and scent. Just like my barber uses!</li>
            <li> They say that we best remember aromas.  Well, this aroma takes me back.  It&#x27;s a nice, not overpowering aroma.</li>
            <li> This aftershave has a subtle scent, and it&#x27;s the most appealing, most soothing aftershave I&#x27;ve ever used. And the value is unbeatable. I only shave once a week, so a bottle lasts me several years. I&#x27;ll never use another aftershave.  UPDATE: Same bottle is still going strong after five years. Still has the same scent. This is one of the best products of any kind, ever. Period.</li>
            <li> The smell takes me back to when I was a wee little lad and getting my hair cut. It was always a pleasant experience for me since I didn&#x27;t mind going to the barber. I always felt more grown up sitting in that chair, even using the booster seat didn&#x27;t make feel less of a man even though I was just a small kid. The haircut was always a pleasure and when the barber was done he take that warm lather to the back of my neck and finish with a straight razor. After words he put some talc on my neck and then splash my head with some bay rum. Man I miss those days, at least I have that great fragrance once again to remember those by gone days of yesteryear.</li>
            <li> I learned of Gabel&#x27;s Bay Rum After Shave from my barber, George. He has been applying it on me after shaving my neck and sides. I finally asked him what it was and, after he told me, I went on line and found it through Amazon. It has a subtle, wonderful, not overpowering, fragrance for which I get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this aftershave for a year now. It&#x27;s very low burn and has a nice (but subtle) bay rum scent. As the scent is very subtle, if you want a strong Bay Rum scent about you you&#x27;ll need to throw on some cologne.     I&#x27;ve used a lot of aftershaves, but usually had to use some sort of lotion after or my skin would get super dried out.     Not with this -- my skin&#x27;s nice and soft after, neither dry nor oily. I highly recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin, &#x27;cause my complexion has never been better.    It also doesn&#x27;t hurt that this stuff is CHEAP. I&#x27;m using the same bottle I got a year ago, finally nearing the bottom.     Highly recommended -- this is my aftershave for life.</li>
            <li> If you like the Old School Barber shop smell, you will love this Bay rum After shave lotion. I have tried other brands and this has a great value.</li>
            <li> I love Bay Rum. This product is priced well and smells great. However I cannot use it as an aftershave as listed. When I use it after shaving it STINGS my skin for several seconds and is extreemly uncomfortable. If I haven&#x27;t shaved there is no problem with the stinging.</li>
            <li> The scent reminds me of clove and nutmeg.  It&#x27;s pleasant but it lingers a lot longer than I would like.  I think I noticed it a good 10 hours after I put it on.  It does make my face feel great after a shave but I also think the bay oil is causing me to break out. I&#x27;ll probably stop using it. I should also mention that it took 9 days to get a shipping confirmation which said it was already delivered. It was then delivered 4 days after that.</li>
            <li> Terrible Bay Rum after shave lotion, and the shipping charge was $8.99.  The lotion in my bottle had almost no scent.  The Gabel&#x27;s ingredient label was as follows:  SD Alcohol 40, Water, Sucrose Octacetate, Bay Oil, FD&amp;C Yellow #5.  The Bay Rum that I usually use had the following ingredients:  Bay Oil, Ethyl Alcohol 50% by volume, fragrances, and Bitrex as a denaturant.  Per the listed ingredients, Gabel&#x27;s is mostly denatured alcohol, WATER, some type of sugar and then Bay Oil.  The Bay Rum that I usually use is by Humco, Texarkana, TX 75501.  I used to buy it at my local CVS Pharmacy, but they stopped carrying it.  I will buy the Humco product on line directly online from them.  The only draw back to the Humco product is the bottle it comes in.  The bottle is the same brown plastic bottle that is used for rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> I was using another bay rum aftershave (Honey Bee Gardens) which I found to be too sweet.  Gabel&#x27;s Bay Rum appealed to me initially because of the price and the quantity of aftershave. After reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try. When you splash it on, the aftershave is somewhat astringent but not markedly so, and the fragrance is more on the fresh/spicy side. Unlike some of the reviews, I found that the fragrance lasted all day, although it certainly mellowed and became more subtle as the day wore on. Even at night I could still smell just a hint of spice. A good purchase, and I plan on getting the gallon size next.</li>
            <li> Cannot really review the product as it arrived all beat up, torn and leaking inside three different mailing packages. Someone had tried a home patch job with scotch tape on one of the bottles. I refused service and wrote to the company requesting a credit on my credit card. As of today I have not heard from them as to the credit. Will keep an eye on my next statement.</li>
            <li> Great bay rum aroma for those of us who are not taken in by what we are told is fashionable today. Certainly a fine value, even with the shipping charge--which was MORE than the cost of the product!  I checked out the cost of buying 2, but the saving on shipping was not worth doing.  Still, if the product is still available when I&#x27;ve gone through 16 oz. of bay rum, I&#x27;ll almost certainly buy it again. One more note:  when the package arrived it had a distinct bay rum aroma, but the bottle was sealed and as far as I can tell had not leaked.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband because he has a very sensitive skin and has to shave on a daily basis.  This works great for him! No more irritated skin! and the scent is very nice and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Excellent value. Well used after a shower or even better in consonance with a good close shave. Feels great and smells very nice especially in anticipation of the workday. A great value - why would you spend far more money for mucl less product that is of inferior qulity?</li>
            <li> Great old school scent.</li>
            <li> even tho i,am 80 years old i still do voluteer work for the national park service. i wear a pre civilwar uniform, representing COMPANY I. 3RD ARTILLERY. at fort point. all the people comment on my OLD TIMIE shave lotion. also my wife likes also!! so all in all a good product!!</li>
            <li> Not bad but not great (from my perspective).  Bay Rum aftershave is very much an individual thing.  Great bang for your buck and the scent is better than average.  I found Pinaud Clubman to be better and especially like some of the higher end Bay Rums - but for the money still a solid purchase</li>
            <li> So nice to be able to splash this on every morning!  It&#x27;s barely available in stores any more, so it&#x27;s nice that I can get it here.</li>
            <li> good price value for a typical Barber shop product</li>
            <li> Good price on this bay rum.  Has a pleasant smell and a nice feel when applying after a shave.  I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or negative reactions to this and my skin is pretty sensitive.  Overall I&#x27;m happy, just wish the fragrant smell would last a bit longer.</li>
            <li> I did not expect as much from an inexpensive Bay Rum. This is now a favorite with a soft scent and coolness upon the skin. Those who complain about the scent not remaining long enough should stick to cologne. Aftershave for men is not meant to cover scent, but to be pleasant and therapeutic for a freshly shaved face. The fact that no animal testing is performed with Gabel&#x27;s is also important to me as well as others. Gabel&#x27;s Bay Rum will remain in my household.</li>
            <li> This is everything that I expected it to be.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gabel&#x27;s Bay Rum for many years now; there is just nothing else like it.  I tried other rum oil after shaves and each case I was disappointed.  They all burned like alcohol on an open wound and they all lacked that just from the barbers shop smell.  I have sensitive skin, so I have tried every new product sold, so believe me when I say Gabel&#x27;s Bay Rum does not clog pores, leave an oily feel or film, nor does it promote acne.  Short of have a prescription shaving product, Gabel&#x27;s Bay Rum after shave and Neutrogena Skin Clearing Shave Gel are the best products going.</li>
            <li> Went to several beauty supply stores and received blank stares when inquiring about this product. Finally dawned on me to check Amazon. Sure enough, there it was and I am happy to have found it.  The Bay Rum is a great after shave that feels great and smells great too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like getting a shave at the barber every morning. This is the only bay rum product I&#x27;ve tried myself. It smells just slightly different than what I usually sniff at the barbershop, but it&#x27;s the same good stuff. A great throwback scent.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT IS AS DESCRIBED, SELLER WAS VERY EASY TO DEAL WITH AND VERY RESPONSIVE TO QUESTIONS. PRODUCT WAS SHIPPED AND RECEIVED  IN VERY QUICK ORDER.WOULD DO BUSINESS WITH HIM AGAIN;-).</li>
            <li> Service was amazing, as product arrived only two days after I placed order, traveling from California to Massachusetts! And despite a very modest price, it proved to be of high quality. I can&#x27;t use most fragrances, because of chemical allergies, but this seems to be free of &amp;#34;chemical pollutants.&amp;#34; Will order again.</li>
            <li> Having tried the range of bay rums, I am convinced that for cost, ease of use, aroma GABELS Bay Rum is the best buy available.</li>
            <li> Refreshing after shave that serves as an excellent astringent. . .a pleasant aroma and I feel quite refreshed after using it.  I recommend it highly&#x27;</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite after shave! The scent is pleasant and he says it reminds him of when he used to go to the barber shop with his father.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. Not quite the &#x27;traditional&#x27; bay rum smell I prefer, but this stuff has grown on me. Literally, maybe. I just about bathe in it after a shower and the scent stays very subtle until I sweat. and then it&#x27;s just the perfect amount of fragrance - not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> GABELS Bay Rum After Shave Lotion does have a very man pleasing scent. It feels good going on a freshly shaved face meaning it will not bite you.  I just wish the aroma would last longer without having to drown myself in it.</li>
            <li> while i was saddened the scent fades after a tiny bit the fact that it&#x27;s not overpowering or burns offsets, a very good product.</li>
            <li> The smell alone is worth the purchase ... if you like the scent of cloves.  I prefer to use witch hazel for my after shave, but having caught a whiff of this stuff at a classic barber shop, I had to buy a bottle of this liquid.</li>
            <li> Ihave always like bay rum after shave especially  Gabels, I have other brands in the past but  like this one thebest</li>
            <li> Just need to say that there was not the slightest problem with this order. Everything went as planned and the product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I bought this bay rhum based on the reviews I read on the Amazon site.  Either Gabels is stuffing the reviews or someone doesn&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about.  While this stuff smells pretty good coming out of the plastic bottle, it has absolutely NO staying power whatsoever.  Within seconds the small is just flat gone.  This is definitely not worth anything, much less the price.</li>
            <li> This is very good bay rum. I use it for the face, bug bites, itches just about anything lol</li>
            <li> I have been using Pharmacy Bay rum for decades,  This feels better on the face, and is easier to use.  It was also less that what I was paying.</li>
            <li> Not an expensive Bay rum like most of them, but was surprised how much I liked the scent and after shave wake up with this.</li>
            <li> I found the scent to be far to weak and what little there was completely disappeared with in minutes. I love the &#x27;old timey&#x27; scent of Bay Rum but would not waste my money on this brand again.</li>
            <li> wow...nice fragrance... huge bottle..sets nicely on the skin... over about an hour it smells  great on the skin... initially strong.....but i am happy with it.....and  you should try it if you are looking for quality, without  the clove smell...a true bay rum smell....dont waste your time with other bay rums that claim to be great...this one is without the clove smell......that is my taste anyways.........</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I bought for the price and the # of OZ. of the bottle. I love the smell of good bay rum but this is not it.  It doesn&#x27;t last and doesn&#x27;t have that zing when you splash it on.  I had finished a bottle of Pinaud&#x27;s and now think it was much better than the Gabels. I&#x27;m going to have to spend some money and get something else.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a great addition to a nice shave set you might have or a double edge razor/straight edge, and has a great smell.  It stings at first when you splash it on your face but then immediately feels refreshing.      However, if you wear contacts read carefully.      Put your contacts on FIRST before you use this stuff, because otherwise it will burn your eyes so bad for like an hour and you&#x27;ll be crippled for the whole day.  I don&#x27;t really know what happens but I think the fragrance floats around and gets into your eyes a little bit, and if you put on your contacts it traps it right in your eye and BURNS.  I did this twice and couldn&#x27;t figure out what was going on until now.  If you put your contacts on first the fragrance won&#x27;t get on your eyes.  I don&#x27;t even know if this is scientifically correct or maybe I have an allergy and my eyes are sensitive to it, but it happened and I want to put this out there to warn contact wearers.</li>
            <li> Finally decided to try this.  I really like the smell</li>
            <li> Like the smell. A spicy, man smell. Smell does not last long at all. Makes for a good body splash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of bay rum, and this is just as good, and at a better price. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> the quintessential Bay Rum product.&lt;br /&gt;None other seemed to capture the old-school barbershop scent as Gabels does.&lt;br /&gt;A great value, and a trip back in time....</li>
            <li> Husband Charles says this product is worth the search for it.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love this shave lotion.</li>
            <li> This bay rum smells better than the rest and It seems I&#x27;ve tried them all. It&#x27;s made from Virgin Island bay rum oils and feels great after a shave.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of Gabels Bay Rum VERY much.. It&#x27;s certainly worth trying, I only wish I could get it locally.</li>
            <li> Tried em all and probably the best Bay Rum splash out there, period!</li>
            <li> Better than Old Spice my first aftershave when I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> Very good aftershave !ðŸ˜€ smells great</li>
            <li> Works well. LIke most other after shaves in my opinion but this one burns the right amount which is nice. May buy again only depending on the price</li>
            <li> Back in the late 1940&#x27;s and early 1950&#x27;s every barbershop splashed Bay Rum on a man or boy after cutting his hair..and it made us feel more like a man.. but today&#x27;s barber shops are more like a woman&#x27;s salon and don&#x27;t know what Bay Rum is.. I bought two large bottles from this company and use it every day.. and I definitely will order more when the first order is nearing depletion..&lt;br /&gt;WOW !.. Bay Rum.. when a man wants to feel like a real man..</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of Bay Rum. First experienced it at a mens salon. They sold it there but for much more than on Amazon. A little goes a long way. Also great for putting on a warm towel old fashioned style.</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected. A bit on the odorous side, and not in a favorable way. It does refresh the skin after a shave. I have not smelled this fragrance in a Barber Shop, as others have stated. It may be due to being a regional thing. I also have tried the Stephan&#x27;s brand, and that fragrance is recognizable, along with the old stand-by Clubman Pinaud after shave. All and all OK, but will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Bay Rum so that I could enjoy that old time Barber Shop feeling and fragrance after a good shave. I was not disappointed. This is a great Bay Rum and a good value. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading alot of reviews on different bay rums I&#x27;d like to try. So far have purchased 6 different kinds. The Gabels bay rum has a great scent. It has a light clove, slightly spicey fragrance. I&#x27;ve been looking for the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; barber shop bay rum scent (Stephan&#x27;s, Pinaud, etc...), the Gabels has more of a bay oil scent mixed with clove. The scent is not overpowering, and is very pleasant. Lasts maybe a few hours, then re-apply. Great product.</li>
            <li> Most effective for a soothing afershave,and a body lotion for any scrapes or dry skin.The scent is pleasant,not too strong,and &amp;#34;mellows&amp;#34;quickly,leaving no stickiness or candy smell. I believe their formula most closely resembles the old formulae found in barber shops of years past,regardless of what their competitors may say...this is the genuine stuff! Searched and bought several Bay Rum preparations,this is best,regardless of price or fancy containers.Order a bottle and enjoy wearing a distinctive scent that few will recognize,but many will admire.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be wasting your money on this brand.  If you like bay rum,  you&#x27;ll like this.  It has a rich and fairly long lasting scent... I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for aftershave.  Not overpowering or perfumy just right and very inexpensive plus you get a lot that lasts awhile.</li>
            <li> I have used lots of different bay rums, this one is great.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to anyone who likes bay rum.</li>
            <li> This was no where close to the Bay Rum my husband is used to. Product just did not meet his expectations.</li>
            <li> I  slpash it on just because it smells good ! my dad used it my great grandpa use to use virgin island bay rum . gabels bay rum is old school and I have been asked what am I wearing I tell gabels bay rum through amazon .com. thanks john</li>
            <li> This stuff is mostly alcohol, very little bay rum scent. I just wish the bottle wasn&#x27;t so large so I wouldn&#x27;t feel as bad about tossing the bottle in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that every bay rum aftershave I have tried is better than this swill.  I am unimpressed.</li>
            <li> very happy with the speed of serves and quality of the product sent, as I ordered</li>
            <li> I love this bay rum scent.  I splash it on as soon as I step out of shower while still wet.  I layer it with bay rum soap, and th scent stays with me all day.  Folks always tell me, you smell soo great!!!  And it not too overpowering as long as you know how to apply.</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; generous amount in bottle. i even gave some to my son &amp; a friend to try. Why not all of us smell &amp;#34;Old School&amp;#34;. Ha ha. A barber friend once told me...&amp;#34;A haircut is not complete until you get the bay rum&amp;#34; Then he would simulate slapping hands with Bay Rum after shave on them on your neck. brother henry.</li>
            <li> This Bay Rum has a nice aroma.  Not over powering and it lasts a couple of hours.  Be careful when you pour it into you hand because it comes out of the bottle real fast.  I think they should slow that down with a smaller opening in the bottle.  That is why I gave it four stars instead of two.  The Bay Rum lotion feels good on my skin and smells good too.  Try it!</li>
            <li> I by this product for my husband.  It is not available where we live.  We have purchased it several times.</li>
            <li> I have been using Pinaud Bay Rum since the 20&#x27;s, that&#x27;s right...the 20&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was introduced to this great product by a Nice Gillette Super Speed, has a little less additives then Pinaud and a little more pain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stings like hell, worth every second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not for Metros or Wussies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get Modern, get Gabels !!</li>
            <li> I have been using Gabels Bay Rum for years now and I must say I really like the way it feels and smells. As I have a beard I do not shave so I use it as a body splash. Wow! I walk out the door going to work smelling and feeling like a million bucks. ~Dave</li>
            <li> I asked my barber what it was that he put on mu neck after shaving it and he told me Bay Rum.  I love the smell of this stuff!!</li>
            <li> An inexpensive (OK, real cheap) aftershave, the sort of thing barbers buy by the gallon. It&#x27;s got an old-fashioned scent (it&#x27;s 50 years since I saw a bay rum-scented hairdressing in an Australian pharmacy) that is not overpowering but lasts for an hour or so. By &#x27;not overpowering&#x27; I mean my wife is not stage-gagging if she comes into the bathroom after I&#x27;ve shaved, which she does with a couple of my EDTs.  It&#x27;s a great everyday aftershave that costs so little you can throw it over youself with abandon. I like it.</li>
            <li> Too much water and alcohol.  Smells good when it goes on, but the Rum spreads so thinly, you don&#x27;t know you&#x27;re wearing anything.</li>
            <li> Feels refreshing good  barbershop style aftershave. Not overwhelming in smell but lasts a while. Not fancy, just honest daily bay rum.</li>
            <li> Has a pleasant bay rum scent. I still prefer Dominican Bay Rum, but would purchase again. Generous amount for price.</li>
            <li> I love Bay Rum and have since I was a kid. My dad wore it and now I do. This is good stuff. Pretty potent, but I like that. Even better, my wife likes it also!</li>
            <li> I like the product very much and have used it for several years; however the last 2 times I ordered from you the bottles were not sealed properly and about one third had leaked out in the delivery process. Will not order again anything thru you if  this going to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Harris&lt;br /&gt;harris1301@gmail.com</li>
            <li> Just as I remember it.  Nice different smell.</li>
            <li> Good scent, I only wished the scent would last longer after application,  A god value for the price.  I would reorder.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get &amp;#34;Burts Bees&amp;#34; bay rum aftershave anymore, this fit the bill perfectly.  Buy it, buy it, buy it.</li>
            <li> Of course everyone prefers their own unique smell. However, I have tried many bay rum products and really like this as it does not try to hide or mix the bay rum smell. If you want bay rum aftershave  without all the fussy additives and at a great price then I highly recommend gabels bay rum. buy a large container and pour a little in the spa!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live on St. John island if that makes any difference!</li>
            <li> It is not the Bay Rum of yesterday. I only purchased it because the other was not offered.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful everyday use aftershave. While I have \\&quot;finer\\&quot; bay rums that I reserve for special occasions, this one is superb for frequent everyday use, particularly in the summer months. The scent is authentic and the price is right!</li>
            <li> Discovered this a few years ago. I think it is the closest to what&lt;br /&gt;I remember my barber using many years ago. Great scent and not&lt;br /&gt;violently alcoholic - does not burn skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves a nice pleasant scent that my wife loves. Does not last long&lt;br /&gt;but I did not expect it to.</li>
            <li> Great after shave, terrible bottle. Since I purchased this to wear, I can hide the ugly bottle and still like the contents. So 5 stars for the after shave, and don&#x27;t ask me to rate your bottle, it&#x27;s terrible.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a bottle of this bay rum and am extremely happy with it.  I have tried many other different bay rums in the past but not liked them.  Some are too flowery, too weak, too whatever.  This brand has an excellent aroma.  I only wished now that I had bought the gallon bottle.  I will be a steady customer of Gabels Bay Rum After Shave Lotion for life.</li>
            <li> Got this because my Dad used to use it. I love the smell though, brings back my childhood and hanging with my Dad... so I&#x27;ll always buy it. Scent is kinda strong when you first put it on, but it does lessen considerably. You won&#x27;t regret getting this!</li>
            <li> Very nice spice scent and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> A nice, light, clove smelling aftershave that is suitable for sensitive skin. Can also apply to shoulders and upper arms. It is not very strong smelling and wears off so don&#x27;t worry about it bothering others. It won&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very innocuous and good right after shaving. Make sure you shake the bottle before use. An everyday aftershave for work and for just going out. I think Pinaud&#x27;s version of Bay Rum is a little nicer in my humble opinion, but this is pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d figure an average of 4 stars on reviews would mean a good product? Not really. Good Bay Rum has a hint of cloves. This stuff is what you get if you soak cloves in alcohol, add yellow color, strain, then bottle it. I am really disappointed. No point in returning as it is not sold thru Amazon. Don&#x27;t waste your time on this unless you like clove alcohol aftershave.</li>
            <li> My dad used this after shave and I have followed the family tradition by wearing it myself. Always on my bathroom shelf.</li>
