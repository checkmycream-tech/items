            <li>This is a great conditioner and it won&#x27;t leave a greasy residue on your hair.  </li>
            <li>All you need is about a nickel size of this for medium length hair leave in while washing up body, comb or brush through in shower, rinse and great results.</li>
            <li>and it was a great deal.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>

            <li>Outstanding!</li>

            <li>Use with Bumble and Bumble Super Rich Shampoo for best results.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff...</li>
            <li>I get alot of compliments on it :)</li>
            <li>At the time I&#x27;d been using predominantly drug store and more affordable salon Brands (i.e. Biolage and Regis).  </li>
            <li>and I thought the results were better than what I&#x27;d been getting from my more affordable hair care regime.  </li>
            <li>I do think the pair leave my hair softer than many drugstore and salon brands.  </li>
            <li>I love Bumble and Bumble products but never received my conditioner ordering from Fragrance.net.  </li>
            <li>all I truly wanted the most was my product.    </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I figured it was from Amazon so they wouldn&#x27;t allow a vendor to sell something that wasn&#x27;t the authentic product.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this conditioner.</li>
            <li>love this product and glad i could find it at amazon</li>
            <li>I love this product since my hair is porous.</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many products</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that gets tangled easily.  </li>
            <li>This is the best stuff I have ever used for my hair and being a dude with long hair, it rocks!</li>
            <li>If you have dry hair, this is the best conditioner I have ever used!</li>
            <li>My in-going hope was that it would do a good job at removing the residue of styling products from my hair, while leaving my hair feeling soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>But would suggest folks go to Sephora and pay $59 + free shipping (Ordered it almost a year ago</li>
            <li>I would recommend this conditioner to others who like gentle, but effective conditioners.</li>
            <li>It was the first time I&#x27;d tried a more specialty hair care brand</li>
            <li>Because of this, I require a pretty potent conditioner to do the job.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shopped their store in real life and they are 100% legit and sell authentic products.</li>
            <li>To be fair, it&#x27;s the only B&amp;B product I truly like...</li>
            <li>This is the best conditioner for my long fuzzy hair, I have hightlights, and my hair tends to be brittle, this conditioner smoothens it out and gives a weight to my big curls</li>
            <li>I have been using this consistently for years and would not change!  </li>
            <li>But my hair doesn&#x27;t look as soft, healthy and shiny as it does with the shampoo and conditioner regimens I&#x27;ve already been using (DevaCurl No-Po and DevaCurl</li>
            <li>It has a light scent and it is great for those sensitive to other conditioners.  </li>
            <li>Hey, I&#x27;m an avid and loyal Amazon Prime customer, but a deal like this, you can&#x27;t pass up,</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>right through.&lt;br /&gt;seller</li>
            <li>shipped right away.</li>
            <li>If your hair is thinner and naturally less dry than mine, this may be perfect</li>
            <li>Thanks, B&amp;B!</li>
            <li>I recently bought a bottle from the salon and was able to compare the difference.</li>
            <li>when I wear my hair wavy/curly and Davines Oi Shampoo and Conditioner on days I wear my hair straight).  </li>
            <li>Amazon should really look into this...</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>It definately makes my hair softer and helps the curls form much nicer.</li>
            <li>Leaving hair very luxurious.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and buying it on Amazon makes it really easy to get ahold of even when I am not near a salon that carries it.    </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft, yet clean and easy to style--not weighted down or greasy.  </li>
            <li>But it may work better for other hair</li>
            <li>, for what it&#x27;s worth, I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon since I received it as a gift, so I cannot say if the current seller is selling the real deal.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle enough to use everyday and leaves my hair very healthy no build up.</li>
            <li>So when I received the Bumble and Bumble Gentle Shampoo and Super Rich Conditioner as gifts, I was curious whether it would bring me back to the brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money, and lasts a long time when you buy the large, value bottle.</li>
            <li>Great for long thick hair</li>
            <li>I thought this combo was good, but not great.  </li>
            <li>Was pleasantly surprised at how quickly my product was shipped to me and would definitely buy from here again!</li>
            <li>The price of this conditioner is higher than other store brands,but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I use this conditioner along with the Gentle Shampoo and my hair is light and fluffy, bouncy and combs</li>
            <li>However, I expected more in the way of extra softness and moisture from bot the shampoo and the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>though not this specific product) for the first time after learning about it from a college roommate.  </li>
            <li>keeps her hair soft and all that.    </li>
            <li>I will admit my hair is often so naturally parched</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, manageble, shiny.</li>
            <li>Despite wearing my hair long, this conditioner really keeps it soft and tangle-free.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, for my thick, dry and somewhat coarse hair this regimen is good, but not the bestI&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I do think after using the Bumble and Bumble Gentle Shampoo my hair felt very clean and there were no traces of residue left behind.  </li>
            <li>We recently moved from a house with soft water, to one without.</li>
            <li>I have long, long, delicate, fine, straight hair and a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>The gentle shampoo by Bumble and Bumble pairs with it extremely well, as does the thickening shampoo</li>
            <li>Very easily damaged if I use the wrong product.  </li>
            <li>Buying the big pump bottle is an economical way to get what is generally a pretty expensive hair product.</li>

            <li> Sorry Amazon, doesn&#x27;t happen often, but Sephora&#x27;s cleaned your clock on this one...</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>

            <li> This conditioner is the perfect conditioner!  I have very fine hair that gets tangled easily.  Despite wearing my hair long, this conditioner really keeps it soft and tangle-free.  The gentle shampoo by Bumble and Bumble pairs with it extremely well, as does the thickening shampoo (but this shampoo dries out your hair if used every day).  Take note: if you order it on the Bumble and Bumble website, you don&#x27;t pay shipping for orders over $50.  I highly recommend this conditioner.  Worth the money, and lasts a long time when you buy the large, value bottle.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s expensive, but this stuff is totally worth it.  Got my haircut back in December before Christmas it&#x27;s now mid March.. My hair is still in great shape... very little split ends if any.  I can&#x27;t go back.  I love this stuff... They need to make a body lotion that smells like it too!  I get alot of compliments on it :)</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been using it forever...keeps her hair soft and all that.    Buying the big pump bottle is an economical way to get what is generally a pretty expensive hair product.</li>
            <li> About 14 years ago in college I tried Bumble and Bumble (though not this specific product) for the first time after learning about it from a college roommate.  At the time I&#x27;d been using predominantly drug store and more affordable salon Brands (i.e. Biolage and Regis).  It was the first time I&#x27;d tried a more specialty hair care brand and I thought the results were better than what I&#x27;d been getting from my more affordable hair care regime.  I&#x27;m not sure why, but since then I&#x27;ve moved on to other salon brands.  So when I received the Bumble and Bumble Gentle Shampoo and Super Rich Conditioner as gifts, I was curious whether it would bring me back to the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying it on my hair I thought this combo was good, but not great.  My in-going hope was that it would do a good job at removing the residue of styling products from my hair, while leaving my hair feeling soft and healthy.  I do think after using the Bumble and Bumble Gentle Shampoo my hair felt very clean and there were no traces of residue left behind.  However, I expected more in the way of extra softness and moisture from bot the shampoo and the conditioner.  I do think the pair leave my hair softer than many drugstore and salon brands.  But my hair doesn&#x27;t look as soft, healthy and shiny as it does with the shampoo and conditioner regimens I&#x27;ve already been using (DevaCurl No-Po and DevaCurl One Condition when I wear my hair wavy/curly and Davines Oi Shampoo and Conditioner on days I wear my hair straight).  It is worth noting though that my hair is thick, somewhat coarse, and very dry.  Because of this, I require a pretty potent conditioner to do the job.  If your hair is thinner and naturally less dry than mine, this may be perfect so you get the moisture you need without overconditioning your hair.  I will admit my hair is often so naturally parched I didn&#x27;t know such a thing was possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, for my thick, dry and somewhat coarse hair this regimen is good, but not the bestI&#x27;ve tried.  But it may work better for other hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon since I received it as a gift, so I cannot say if the current seller is selling the real deal.  However, I can say that at the time of my review the Seller is Blue Mercury.  I&#x27;ve shopped their store in real life and they are 100% legit and sell authentic products.</li>
            <li> Ordered the 33 oz. and the smell is totally off. I am VERY disappointed. Amazon should really look into this...</li>
            <li> I love Bumble and Bumble products but never received my conditioner ordering from Fragrance.net.  I finally emailed them after 3 weeks and they refunded my money the very next day, but all I truly wanted the most was my product.    5 stars for bumble and bumble, no stars for fragrance.net supplier.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner and it won&#x27;t leave a greasy residue on your hair.  For me, its worh every penny.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and I use this as a leave in product, after using it as a rinse out conditioner.  It definately makes my hair softer and helps the curls form much nicer.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is gentle enough to use everyday and leaves my hair very healthy no build up.</li>
            <li> All you need is about a nickel size of this for medium length hair leave in while washing up body, comb or brush through in shower, rinse and great results. This is BEST conditioner I&#x27;ve found after 20 years of trying every great name, even Jonathon&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have fine but fairly thick short hair, and have been looking for a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair. Found one! Thanks, B&amp;B! To be fair, it&#x27;s the only B&amp;B product I truly like...But would suggest folks go to Sephora and pay $59 + free shipping (Ordered it almost a year ago and it&#x27;s the same price now). Hey, I&#x27;m an avid and loyal Amazon Prime customer, but a deal like this, you can&#x27;t pass up, right? Sorry Amazon, doesn&#x27;t happen often, but Sephora&#x27;s cleaned your clock on this one...Think Seattle vs. Denver. You&#x27;re Denver.</li>
            <li> Good hair product selling for a bargain price, coupled with buying it on prime and it was a great deal.</li>
            <li> What a great conditioner, rich and creamy. Leaving hair very luxurious.</li>
            <li> I have been using this consistently for years and would not change!  I tried using other products but always come back to this.  Outstanding!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Came as described, well packaged.</li>
            <li> I bought this in 2010. I realize that was two years ago and something was just strange about it. I couldn&#x27;t put my finger on it. I figured it was from Amazon so they wouldn&#x27;t allow a vendor to sell something that wasn&#x27;t the authentic product. I was wrong. I recently bought a bottle from the salon and was able to compare the difference. Whoever was scamming everyone was using handsoap (white) I want to say softsoap in the shampoo container. I haven&#x27;t figured out what was in the conditioner but it is definitely a fake.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and buying it on Amazon makes it really easy to get ahold of even when I am not near a salon that carries it.    Was pleasantly surprised at how quickly my product was shipped to me and would definitely buy from here again!</li>
            <li> I have long, long, delicate, fine, straight hair and a lot of it.  Very easily damaged if I use the wrong product.  also very easily made greasy and weight down if I use the wrong product.  I use this conditioner along with the Gentle Shampoo and my hair is light and fluffy, bouncy and combs right through.&lt;br /&gt;seller shipped right away.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 33.8 oz container and compared it to the 8 oz. bottle I bought at a salon for my daughter. Same smell, same consistency, same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a Redken man. I buy this for my 18 month old daughter and use just a small amount of it every night. We recently moved from a house with soft water, to one without. This definetly makes up for the change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  It leaves my hair very soft, yet clean and easy to style--not weighted down or greasy.  Use with Bumble and Bumble Super Rich Shampoo for best results.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner. If you have dry, or color treated hair this is for you. A little goes a long way so its great to have to for a while.</li>
            <li> love this product and glad i could find it at amazon</li>
            <li> I love this product since my hair is porous. My hair is soft, manageble, shiny. I have tried many, many products but I would suggest getting a 8oz and try it by using the entire bottle. Then you will be to see if the product works for you.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner for my long fuzzy hair, I have hightlights, and my hair tends to be brittle, this conditioner smoothens it out and gives a weight to my big curls I can style my hair any way I want it! Perfect!</li>
            <li> I just wan to let everyone know, I&#x27;ve been buying this stuff for year from Sephora for 60 bucks! They&#x27;re ripping you off trying to charge you 80!</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair, this is the best conditioner I have ever used! I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive though.</li>
            <li> This conditioner conditions my hair without leaving it feeling oily.  It has a light scent and it is great for those sensitive to other conditioners.  The price of this conditioner is higher than other store brands,but it is worth it.  I would recommend this conditioner to others who like gentle, but effective conditioners.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product, what more could I ask.</li>
            <li> Great for long thick hair</li>
            <li> Great conditioner!  Works great!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff I have ever used for my hair and being a dude with long hair, it rocks!</li>
