            <li>If you are natural, this crème conditioner is great to detangle, soften, and also smells wonderful.</li>

            <li>I think this comes pretty close to being perfect.</li>

            <li>Mommy most have in hair collection for their child life</li>
            <li>Now, I am waiting to see what it looks like when her hair dries :)</li>
            <li>Daughter love the stuff.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to find something that works!</li>
            <li>Just used happy so far a lot fuzz removed too</li>
            <li>She is biracial (black/white) and has fine hair but curly and her hair matts so easily.  </li>
            <li>I can not tell you how many products I have tried on my toddlers hair without success.</li>
            <li>Stumbled across it at my local dollar general store and I am so happy I did.</li>
            <li>I am not going to say there were no tangles, but only 3 or 4 that were pretty easy to comb through and no matting!</li>
            <li>Smells great and adds long lasting moisture and texture to my sons curly hair.</li>
            <li>This is the first leave-in conditioner that does not draw up/ shorten her hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves my daughters hair soft and frizz free</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make her hair to sticky or leave it crispy dry like most products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Next, a good rinse and towel dry.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>My daughter is Hispanic and has very curly hair (spiral curls).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I felt it was alittle better then other products i tried</li>
            <li>I just used this product for the first time after her bath and WOW!</li>
            <li>I love that this conditioner is a super thick cream and not a thinner lotion.</li>
            <li>Livens the curl and bounce - and I&#x27;m an adult!</li>
            <li>Gives hair a natural look</li>
            <li>It is not the right product for me, but may be for other people.</li>
            <li>My daughter can wear her hair down with out it becoming dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Work&#x27;s well so far for my 2 girls who are mixed.</li>
            <li>Not great and not terrible.  </li>
            <li>Awesome product and less expensive than other similar products!</li>
            <li>Afterwards, I put this product in, braided it into a long braid down her back with a band on the end, brushed her edges smooth, and put her to bed.</li>
            <li>Like anothet reviewer I also can&#x27;t across this product at my local Dollar General.</li>
            <li>so I would say the amount to use as a leave-in conditioner would have to be very small or you would get build-up quickly.</li>

            <li> I tried other products with mixed success (Sprouts curl calmer, a few different Shea Moisture products).</li>
            <li> Her hair is extremely long with tight tight curls and full.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 2 and has curly but long hair.</li>
            <li> It was very long and her hair maintained it&#x27;s length!</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish is that it made her hair a little shinier.</li>
            <li> All I have to do is apply a bit of the conditioner to her wet hair (either after her bath</li>
            <li> ; like I noticed with other products.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless I have had a horrible time finding a good (affordable) hair product for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Other products kept her curls tame</li>
            <li> Makes my son&#x27;s otherwise crazy hair very manageable.</li>
            <li> how well it works after few months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> Did make her hair soft and tamed the fizz, i wasnt crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> It seriously took me less than 5 minutes to comb her hair.</li>
            <li> Combing her hair has always been at least a 20 minute job, even with conditioner and leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Way too thick.</li>
            <li> She hated Mixed Chick product, which smelled like bad medicine and left her hair stiff.</li>
            <li> I used a lot and its very thick</li>
            <li> Her hair gets so bad its takes about 45mins to an hour to comb out.</li>
            <li> Order the gel and got something else, highly disappointed</li>

            <li> I purchased this product after reading the reviews thinking it was gonna be a miracle to have finally found something for my daughter&#x27;s hair that worked. Her hair is extremely long with tight tight curls and full. Her hair gets so bad its takes about 45mins to an hour to comb out. I purchased this along with the detangling spray. I felt that it didnt work the way i hoped it would. Did make her hair soft and tamed the fizz, i wasnt crazy about the smell. I felt it was alittle better then other products i tried so i gave it four stars.</li>
            <li> love this stuff..LOVE thank you...</li>
            <li> Work&#x27;s well so far for my 2 girls who are mixed. Will come back to update review when I see how well it works after few months.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Smells great and adds long lasting moisture and texture to my sons curly hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for kids but for adults. If you are natural, this crème conditioner is great to detangle, soften, and also smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Order the gel and got something else, highly disappointed</li>
            <li> I have been searching for better hair product for my girls hair. I really like this.</li>
            <li> Just used happy so far a lot fuzz removed too</li>
            <li> This is a very personal experience so the number of stars just reflects the fact that I can&#x27;t use this product. It is not the right product for me, but may be for other people. I should have enquired more before buying the product. I don&#x27;t like scented products, especially with coconut. But the biggest problem is that my daughter had an allergic reaction with it (skin rash on her neck, scalp, and forehead).</li>
            <li> My daughter is 2 and has curly but long hair. This is the first leave-in conditioner that does not draw up/ shorten her hair. Other products kept her curls tame but I noticed that they tended to almost shrink the length of her hair. This conditioner tames her hair and it maintains the same length. Last night, I washed her hair twice, conditioned it and combed it out while conditioner was in it. Next, a good rinse and towel dry. Afterwards, I put this product in, braided it into a long braid down her back with a band on the end, brushed her edges smooth, and put her to bed. This morning, the braid didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;shrink up&amp;#34; like I noticed with other products. It was very long and her hair maintained it&#x27;s length! So far, very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Wroks great on my hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and less expensive than other similar products! Makes my son&#x27;s otherwise crazy hair very manageable.</li>
            <li> My Hair loves it. I LOVE IT PLEASE NEVER DISBAND THIS PRODUCT. Stumbled across it at my local dollar general store and I am so happy I did.</li>
            <li> My daughter can wear her hair down with out it becoming dry and frizzy.  It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy. Gives hair a natural look</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this conditioner. My daughter is Hispanic and has very curly hair (spiral curls). I tried other products with mixed success (Sprouts curl calmer, a few different Shea Moisture products). This one is my favorite. All I have to do is apply a bit of the conditioner to her wet hair (either after her bath or I spritz it with water to re-wet it) then comb it through. Once her hair dries, she has beautiful, well-defined curls that are springy and not crunchy. I love that this conditioner is a super thick cream and not a thinner lotion. I also love that there are no parabens!</li>
            <li> The BEST !!!! Most get for all children of race. Mommy most have in hair collection for their child life</li>
            <li> Great. I use on my own hair and my nephew&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is a lifesaver! Leaves my daughters hair soft and frizz free</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Livens the curl and bounce - and I&#x27;m an adult!</li>
            <li> Not great and not terrible.  I don&#x27;t even think this does anything for your hair</li>
            <li> This conditioner worked wonderfully on my daughter&#x27;s very curl hair. It made brushing out tangles and knots very easy. I used a lot and its very thick so I would say the amount to use as a leave-in conditioner would have to be very small or you would get build-up quickly. This also smells great. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Like anothet reviewer I also can&#x27;t across this product at my local Dollar General. Both me and (of course) my daughter are biracial. She actually is like quad-racial because my husband is biracial. Nevertheless I have had a horrible time finding a good (affordable) hair product for my daughter. I think this comes pretty close to being perfect. It doesn&#x27;t make her hair to sticky or leave it crispy dry like most products I&#x27;ve tried. This is a good in between and smells pretty good. The only thing I wish is that it made her hair a little shinier.</li>
            <li> Way too thick. Did not rub into hair evenly. Too goopy</li>
            <li> I can not tell you how many products I have tried on my toddlers hair without success. She is biracial (black/white) and has fine hair but curly and her hair matts so easily.  Combing her hair has always been at least a 20 minute job, even with conditioner and leave in conditioner. I just used this product for the first time after her bath and WOW! I am not going to say there were no tangles, but only 3 or 4 that were pretty easy to comb through and no matting! It seriously took me less than 5 minutes to comb her hair. I am so excited to find something that works! Now, I am waiting to see what it looks like when her hair dries :)</li>
            <li> Daughter love the stuff. She hated Mixed Chick product, which smelled like bad medicine and left her hair stiff.</li>
