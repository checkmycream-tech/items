            <li>--there are a couple of products I&#x27;ve gotten great results with, and gave them up with reluctance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, when Anavita offered their Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream to review, I was happy to oblige.</li>
            <li>We welcome any questions you may have about our products.</li>
            <li>As a company based in Tennessee, USA, we take great pride in our skin cream.</li>

            <li>I needed a good night cream</li>

            <li>I use rose water in the morning to remove and apply my day cream.</li>
            <li>I loved how my dyhydrated skin now feels better</li>
            <li>I honestly cannot say I see any results at all</li>
            <li>received a sample to share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>It kind of reminds me of the smell of bubble gum which I didn&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
            <li>I always have my eye out for effective skin care products, and this one works well for me.</li>
            <li>It is convenient to use as it is effective for night and day application.  </li>
            <li>All opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>have to be honest.</li>
            <li>I received this for an honest opinion.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an effective moisturizer though.</li>
            <li>But after it absorbs, the skin feels nice.</li>
            <li>No complaints at all, just a really nice, moisturizing cream with benefits.</li>
            <li>So I am loving the  Anavita</li>
            <li>Its nice and creamy and feels so nutritious on my skin... like its doing something.</li>
            <li>I received this product in exchange for an honest review...</li>
            <li>all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>but there are times when I get warm during the day and</li>
            <li>My opinions however, are all honest.</li>
            <li>This is 100% my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>When I received the Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream I liked the packaging.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>my own unbiased opinions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For now, I am thrilled that my skin looks healthier and feels smoother since I have started using it.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this!!</li>
            <li>but I am excited that I am  seeing great results in just a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>The silver packaging is nice and makes it very easy for me to find this in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li>I feel like this moisturizer is my new best friend!</li>
            <li>Moving right along, when I saw the opportunity to review the beautiful Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream I thought why not jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The moisturizer in this cream is just amazing if nothing else you will be completely impressed on how soft your face feels.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant odor and went on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really late in posting my review of this wonderful product, but a wonderful product it is!  </li>
            <li>My face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy after using it, just super moisturized and happy.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Love how it absorbs into my skin &amp; makes my face look healthy!</li>
            <li>My skin was probably better off with it, but there are better choices for this price range that have made my face exceptional.</li>
            <li>It is light, smells good, and doesn&#x27;t make my face oily.</li>
            <li>It has replaced my old moisturizer and the anti-aging aspect is a great bonus!</li>
            <li>This cream is so smooth and feels so good on me.  </li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised and VERY impressed with this product, just had to write a review, you&#x27;ve earned it -</li>
            <li>The cream smells lovely, and has a nice texture.</li>
            <li>It does however, take most people 2 to even 4 weeks before they start seeing any kind of change.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t  expect miracles but this is by far the best cream to date</li>
            <li>It is also really easy to use!</li>
            <li>They want their customers to look their best, and we help them achieve that with effective, simple skin care</li>
            <li>It smells great from the jar but when applied to my face, it smells a bit too fragrant for the first couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly, was easily absorbed, and it felt good!  </li>
            <li>My mother love it very much, She said: it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I was very fortunate to come across Anavita&#x27;s Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream.</li>
            <li>It doesn’t have a strong scent, but what is there is nice.</li>
            <li>More smoother and radiant looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>for the price of this cream I feel it´s an ok moisturizer...</li>
            <li>The texture is really interesting.</li>
            <li>I was forcibly pushed into Club 40 this year.</li>
            <li>Love this cream.</li>
            <li>I love this Anti wrinkle Cream.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.</li>

            <li>My skin looks better using this than before, which I have never said about a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>What I love about this cream is that it seems to heal my skin rather then “cover up” the issues for a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as you can tell by the name it’s meant to diminish the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>not that I have many wrinkles to deal with.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know that there is a noticeable improvement; but my skin feels better.  </li>
            <li>I love most</li>
            <li>Ok, now they have my attention.</li>
            <li>While some experience rapid results, others find improvement more gradual.</li>
            <li>Well it took me years to get those wrinkles so its going to take more than over night to get rid of them.</li>
            <li>While some experience rapid results, others find improvement more gradual.</li>

            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>found myself wanting more of this cream and applying it regularly since I have seen some results, very happy so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Achieves better results than serums &amp; creams with Vitamin C &amp; Retinol&lt;</li>
            <li>After one week my skin felt firmer, my tone evened out, and my cheeks had more color.  </li>
            <li>Also, I absolutely love the shiny packaging of this cream.</li>
            <li>I am glad I got to try this cream.</li>
            <li>That seems to be a bit better now.</li>
            <li>and it seams most of the people gave this cream</li>
            <li>and NO I won&#x27;t order more of this</li>
            <li>Smells lovely.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a difference in the appearance of my face already, so I&#x27;m sure after continuing to use it for awhile</li>
            <li>I will continue to see even more results.</li>
            <li>It takes time to let the face creams do there job, so I will update this product again in another 4 weeks. :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this product for anyone needing the perfect moistirizer.</li>

            <li>I have not yet seen any improvement with lines but may need to give it more time</li>
            <li>I just began using this cream and love it already.  </li>
            <li>and I have tried  many.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice light fraqrance, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Love this wrinkle cream, I doubt that it has made any difference</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t afford botox treatments and this is the next best thing.  </li>
            <li>sure if it&#x27;s from using this</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like having to take extra steps in my skin care routine and all I have to do now is wash and apply this wonderful moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Congrats on making such a wonderful skin care product!</li>

            <li>I also loved that it had a light, creamy texture that absorbed well into my skin without feeling like it had a lot of residue.</li>
            <li>I just wish there was more in the jar because it goes very quickly.</li>

            <li>: I received a free product to review but all opinions expressed are truthful.</li>

            <li>No skin breakouts ,goes on easily yet is a cream ,can be used day or night and no oily residue.</li>
            <li>My make-up goes on over it easily.  </li>
            <li>I have the type of skin that breaks out easily.</li>
            <li>I wear it under my makeup and it helps my makeup go on easily.  </li>
            <li>First, the product that I am using has to smell nice.</li>
            <li>It was nice, and the wrinkles under my eyes lessened because I put this anti-wrinkle cream on first.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen a change on my face in regards to wrinkles or fine lines.</li>
            <li>Still waiting for reduced fine lines.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smoother and I think it has helped soften some fine lines I have started to see around and under my eyes.</li>

            <li>It hasn&#x27;t removed all my fine lines or wrinkles yet</li>

            <li>This cream goes on smoothly with no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Non-irritating cream helps against free radical damage</li>
            <li>I have ordered 2 different creams,  both had great reviews but for me they did not work one</li>
            <li>did get this free to review</li>
            <li>And it is no greasy or heavy, smells wonderful too.</li>
            <li>areas!&lt;br /&gt;It is light and can be worn under makeup.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent that is rather pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was optimistic, as it made my skin feel silky smooth when I put it on.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need as much because it goes on really nicely.</li>
            <li>I tried out the Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream cream, which was given to me to try out for free.</li>
            <li>When applying this concoction it went on smooth and evenly.</li>
            <li>I mentioned before, the state that the cream leaves my face in is important as well.</li>
            <li>It went on smooth and did not leave my skin sticky or cakey at all.</li>
            <li>and it has a light scent to it</li>
            <li>It is light but fruity.</li>
            <li>I received this product free for my review purposes and all opinions are 100%</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it two days and my skin is SO smooth.</li>
            <li>The best thing is that the cream is paraben free, sulfate free, phthalate free and not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a few weeks I noticed a softness to my skin.</li>
            <li>I honestly think there is a marked difference in my skin for the better.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>Once I get the clear by my skin not breaking out in hives or severe redness I am good to go.</li>
            <li>Overall Anavita really stands up to it&#x27;s competitors with this wonderful beauty product.</li>
            <li>, I have tried more than my fair share of facial creams.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>The price is beyond reasonable for the product&#x27;s quality, and I&#x27;ve used many inferior creams that cost a lot more.  </li>
            <li>The light flowers fragrance is very fresh and relaxing.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with finding the right moisturizer for my face for many years.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>My favorite thing to do with this product is putting it on right before I put on my makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to put on, and I just make it a habit to put it on after I shower in the evening, as well as in the morning after I wash my face and get ready to put my makeup on.  </li>
            <li>I used this for a week before I realized it was doing significant damage to my skin.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer caused me to break out in cysts that lasted over a month, and caused significant residual scarring.</li>
            <li>but I do believe that this would be wonderful in harsh summer and winter months when the skin has been exposed to the elements!</li>
            <li>Hence I will never recommend a product that I do not think is worth the price!</li>
            <li>So there is no way you would know if this is unused or original.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this moisturizing wrinkle cream for face and neck.  </li>
            <li>Upon opening the jar of Anavita I immediately noticed the creamy rich texture, not runny.</li>
            <li>so I’m excited to see what happens.  </li>
            <li>Anavita Moisturizing Anti -Wrinkle Cream is creamy, rich and not oily.  </li>
            <li>and so far I am very pleased with the results</li>
            <li>The foundation goes on much smoother and more evenly without settling into the fine lines.</li>
            <li>clean feeling will have to wait and see if it helps wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It goes on light and absorbs really quickly.</li>
            <li>It is light and absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>I apply this on clean skin, and basically massage it into my skin using upward motions.</li>
            <li>Even though I did receive this product in exchange for my honest review, I really do love this product and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Nice but could not order more, so changed to a different product.  </li>
            <li>BUT when you put it on it is smooth and absorbs in to your skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>I find it easy to use as it goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and is absorbed into my skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is so highly moisturizer that you cannot even begin to touch it with a regular moisture lotion and it has been great to put on after exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and I wake up every morning touching my face and smiling!  </li>
            <li>My own natural skin had a matt-finish!</li>
            <li>For a woman who is 37, it is very important to pay much attention to my skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased this cream via a special promotion.  </li>
            <li>received the product sooner than it was expected, that was great.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer does have a light fragrance to it but nothing that was too powerful.</li>
            <li>My skin feels good and seems to have enough moisture.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin nicely and leaves no heavy feeling at all.</li>
            <li>It feels so nice and soft now.</li>
            <li>I wrote a full review on my blog:  </li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it, doesn&#x27;t take much and goes on evenly.  </li>
            <li>While it says full results in 8-12 weeks, I don&#x27;t want to wait two months to leave a review.</li>
            <li>because if it works this good this fast then it can only get better with time.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 more jars it works very well.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t have many yet anyhow.</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed how soft my skin felt upon application and it is really a nice product.  </li>
            <li>I immediately noticed how soft my skin felt upon application and it is really a nice product.  </li>
            <li>But this Anavita cream actually soaks this up, which is surprising because I have oily</li>
            <li>I tried the cream on the back of my hand and immediately loved the smell.</li>
            <li>It is soft and looks pretty good.</li>
            <li>So far pretty  good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, absorbs quickly, and wow, the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li>Not only is the cream is rich, it has a nice light scent.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, and it doesn&#x27;t make it super oily by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>and I just love how it leaves my skin so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>and I love how smooth and soft my skin is now.  </li>
            <li>but luckily she lives 2 blocks from me -</li>
            <li>but it does dry/absorb quickly.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best creams I have tried in the last ten years.  </li>
            <li>The creme is super absorbent with no greasyness.  </li>
            <li>cream has a light citrus fragrance appealing to both men and women, but no heavy perfume smell.</li>
            <li>So thankful for such a great facial product, that I know is trustworthy in the ingredients, and huge kudos, no animal testing!  </li>
            <li>, she is a skin care &amp;#34;freak&amp;#34; lol and always uses the most expensive products I will be buying her more</li>
            <li>Is pretty moisturizer and light.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that it absorbs easily, leaving my soft and make-up is easily applied within minutes.</li>
            <li>It has some great ingredients in it, no parabens or harmful drying ingredients, and it can produce visible results in 4 weeks or less.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and although this cream was good at the beginning but then after a while it started giving me breakouts.</li>
            <li>woman needs more than just an ordinary moisturizer; she needs anti-oxidants and collagen promoters in order to restore good skin conditions.</li>
            <li>For example, if you are using another brand of wrinkle cream on your face at night and wanted to use Anavita during the day, the night product could prevent Anavita from absorbing easily.</li>
            <li>I would say that this is very comparable to those higher priced beauty counter creams, for a much better price.</li>
            <li>I use it under my eyes &amp; nose first then cheeks, brow, eyelids(it helps prime for eyeshadow too!)</li>
            <li>I am on a constant quest to finding great skin care products as I have noticed some new wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent but is pleasant overall.</li>
            <li>Notice that dry skin will appear more wrinkled than moisturized skin, but what Anavita does is that it help promote healthy skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and I can put my makeup on right</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perfect for fine lines and wrinkles, this moisturizer is gentle on skin</li>
            <li>I see a marked improvement in my skin - more even tone, more luminous, very much younger looking - fine wrinkles have disappeared.    </li>
            <li>I just got this a few weeks ago, and it feels great on my face.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve been looking for an amazing cream look no further, I swear this eliminated three steps form my beauty routine!</li>
            <li>After just a few days of use I already noticed a difference in my skin - it is feeling softer and smoother and has a nice healthy glow to it.</li>
            <li>, you kind of wish you had the wrinkles back.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, you may be ok.</li>
            <li>I loved this so much that I ordered it a second time (rare for me).</li>
            <li>It’s quite nice actually!</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been pleased with the product and the results.</li>
            <li>I received the below mentioned complimentary product for the purpose of this review.</li>
            <li>The cream inside has a white color and smells really nice.</li>
            <li>I have mixed feelings about this nice product.</li>
            <li>I can also see that my laugh lines are minimized.</li>
            <li>I was provided a complimentary sample.</li>
            <li>We strive to be better and at the same time appreciate who we are and enjoy our life journey.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want to place the Anavita cream over another product since Anavita may not be absorbed as well as it should be.&lt;br /&gt;-Sometimes</li>
            <li>The first visible effects should be seen within four weeks with full impact visible in twelve weeks (sometimes even sooner).</li>
            <li>This is not an overnight success you will need to use to get results for a period of time.</li>
            <li>The first visible effects should be seen within four weeks with full impact visible in twelve weeks (sometimes even sooner).</li>
            <li>This is not an overnight success you will need to use to get results for a period of time.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very mild, pleasant and hardly noticeable.  </li>
            <li>, so I&#x27;m already trying to do what I can to help my skin not to wrinkle too much and try and mainly keep it healthy.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to like this stuff and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>As of right now I don’t have wrinkles (knocks on wood)</li>
            <li>My right arm is now noticeably stronger.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and looks more vibrant and my smile lines appear to have diminished!</li>
            <li>, that is out the way, I have had quite a positive experience with this product!</li>
            <li>I just got this product and haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it that long, but so far it seems to be a great moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>It does make my face feel smooth and soft and seems not to show those fine lines under my eyes as much.</li>
            <li>Obviously, if you use it two times a day, it will work more quickly than the once a day regimen I’m on.</li>
            <li>Great winter moisturizer because it is thick but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>find that it works well without being too greasy and it absorbs so quickly, and even though I think it feels and works like much more expensive brands, its nice to know that you can get great facial products without them costing you too much money.</li>
            <li>I can see this feeling so soothing after being out in the sun all day or especially for me, since I do not spend a great deal of time in the sun, after a day in the harsh winter winds, as that is what my skin is bothered by the most.</li>
            <li>As a 43 year old woman, I am in danger of becoming wrinkled like the leg of an elephant.</li>
            <li>Your skin will benefit and look years younger from our high quality moisturizer that is paraben free, sulfate free, phthalate free and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>The product did arrive on time and in good conditions i have been using it for more than 45 days with no results, actually I have very few fine lines</li>
            <li>can really feel a difference in my face when I smile or laugh.</li>
            <li>The cream was light and fluffy which honestly reminded me of a whipped icing you find on cakes.</li>
            <li>it is a great idea to keep up the maintenance, and we can prevent prior the wrinkles prior to our aging progress get well under way.</li>
            <li>it is a great idea to keep up the maintenance, and we can prevent prior the wrinkles prior to our aging progress get well under way.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve actually seen some minor results, which were WAY more than I anticipated if I&#x27;m being completely honest.</li>
            <li>I very highly recommend this product for anyone looking to improve the appearance of their skin!</li>
            <li>This thick and creamy white cream, has a light pleasant fragrance, and was easy to apply, my skin stayed moisturized for hours after use and feels smoother.</li>
            <li>a little thick for my liking, so it takes more work than I&#x27;m used to in order to get it spread around, but all in all great product!</li>
            <li>It is absorbed very well by it</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about the Anativa Moisturizing cream is the scent.</li>
            <li>This is the first cream I&#x27;ve ever used that does not irritate my skin nor cause me to break out.  </li>
            <li>I will most definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li>I love that this product gives me just enough moisture for my skin.</li>
            <li>Skin definitely looks better.</li>
            <li>This cream is absorbed readily into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily film or slippery feel.</li>
            <li>is that this moisturizing cream leaves my skin soft and smooth to touch.</li>
            <li>my face is smoother after first application.</li>
            <li>I am very frugal but consider this worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>use a pore cleansing product called Indian Healing clay, first I cleansed my face twice a week at night</li>
            <li>leaves my skin ultra soft and smooth immediately after use.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with this product.  </li>
            <li>I would love to get rid of them, but I know there is no magic, it is all about moisturizing, using sunscreen, and eating healthy</li>
            <li>have to use Persagel all over my face, regardless of what I put on first, or I can&#x27;t put makeup on.</li>
            <li>Anavita&#x27;s non-irritating cream is well-suited for all skin types with a tested history of safe and gentle action by a long list of satisfied users.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pretty faithful with my use.  </li>
            <li>I love trying different beauty products</li>
            <li>The cream is a bit rich/thick for my face, but I put it on my neck, and it seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I have a few dry spots and in the winter they get nothing but dryer and dryer this moisturizing anti wrinkle cream is going to be perfect.  </li>
            <li>Great product in a small jar!</li>
            <li>But my skin looks good even if I need a stiff drink.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for several weeks and notice a pretty good reduction in the deep wrinkles on my decollatage, neck and forehead.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream because it keeps my face hydrated, soft and smooth on my oily face.</li>
            <li>said it had same components as this one does and used it for at least 8 months (perfect image) and</li>
            <li>Nice face cream thick and smooth .applies</li>
            <li>I still have plenty of product left to last me for a good while, and because I have loved the results of this on my neck, I am going to be alternating this with my current facial anti wrinkle cream, and reap some of the benefits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good for nighttime,because a little heavy,but it works!</li>
            <li>The jar is pretty large at 1.7 fl oz.  </li>
            <li>Proven to stimulate the synthesis of collagen which makes your skin appear years younger &amp; more vibrant</li>
            <li>my skin is starting to become more vibrant as well as tighter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;t come is an easy to open jar.</li>
            <li>Foundations and powders tend to cling to dry patches and make them more noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Thus, there&#x27;s no need to buy a separate moisturizing cream specifically for a certain time of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am seeing results without using a large amount of the product.  </li>
            <li>and I really wanted to give it a try and couldn&#x27;t wait to see some positive</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly and evenly with absolutely no clumping and absorbs quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Fine line&#x27;s on my forehead, and fine lines under my eyes are my trouble area&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have visible wrinkles yet except for a very tiny fine line that I noticed between my eyebrows couple of months ago.</li>
            <li>Sometimes something very good has negative aspects to it that are really just personal preferences</li>
            <li>and now I have not broken out at all.</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it let the skin.</li>
            <li>Michigan winter has started all ready</li>
            <li>Very creamy but absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>I have been using this in combo with my vitamin c serum and hyaluronic acid serum after I run my dermal roller and achieving some very noticeable results.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper, and they work for me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>For my wife and she really likes it.</li>
            <li>You can really tell the difference when you apply foundation over it.</li>
            <li>She and I both would absolutely recommend Anativa Moisturizing Cream.</li>
            <li>I really like this&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This cream works very well.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell amazing, but it is so lush and leaves your face feeling SO soft.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.  </li>
            <li>My face is really itchy now.  </li>
            <li>I then massaged in the cream using gentle upward strokes.</li>
            <li>I have some lines under my chin, and frown line above my nose, and light crows feet.</li>
            <li>and I really like the effect it has on my skin.</li>
            <li>It seems a lot softer and looks so much smoother.</li>
            <li>and honestly it is really working.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I am a male, my skin is light brown and oily around my nose.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I am  very</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It seems to have a matte finish after applying which I really like.  </li>
            <li>I buy this for one of my nail clients who has very wrinkled skin,  she LOVES it.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just the application of the product which leaves so much to be desired.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>really like the consistency of this cream.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly by gently rubbing</li>
            <li>I really like using it as a primer for my concealer.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this cream and WILL be purchasing it again in the future!</li>
            <li>Works well fast shipping A+++</li>
            <li>and sometimes I get really oily.</li>
            <li>I find that this really depends on what products I am using.</li>
            <li>It feels very luxurious on her skin.</li>
            <li>but it won&#x27;t really bother you when you apply it to your skin.</li>
            <li>As of yet, I haven&#x27;t really seen any difference, but I guess it can take up to twelve weeks to notice a change.  </li>
            <li>Then massage in the cream using gentle upward</li>
            <li>This cream really works.</li>
            <li>It is really gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>The Anavita cream is also nice because it can eliminate several steps in your daily regimen by serving as a day cream, night cream, wrinkle cream and makeup</li>
            <li>I did pass this product on to my mother who LOVES rich thick creams, her skin is far drier than my own.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday and it has quickly become my new favorite face cream.</li>
            <li>The cream and white and rich and does not have any overpowering smell,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Our skin care products are never tested on animals and only feature formulations with high quality ingredients free of sulfates, phthalates, parabens, and petroleum</li>
            <li>I try to help her with this as much as possible and I like to keep her up to date on all the new creams that could help with her wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li>can tell you that I don&#x27;t usually get that kind of timeline for a product review for my blog, and really, even if I did I couldn&#x27;t always take that time</li>
            <li>Second, while it is important that a product not leave my face dry, it is equally as important that it not leave my skin oily!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a slight peppermint scent and smells really light and fresh.</li>
            <li>Her skin feels much softer too and has a smoother appearance and more even tone with a lot less redness.</li>
            <li>high ratings received it for free and didn&#x27;t use it for a long time.</li>
            <li>lightly pat dry</li>
            <li>She still has some deep fine lines around her lips but they seem to be diminishing and normally  she has issues with oiliness in some areas and dryness in others and that has completely worked itself out.</li>
            <li>I can always steal it back later! :)</li>
            <li>I usually just wear a bit of blush and using this cream first made the blush work better.  </li>
            <li>First thing I want to say, you are going to find a LOT of people online doing the same review, but I want to give you the straight facts!</li>
            <li>I am so surprised that after just a few days use I&#x27;m already seeing reduced visibility of fine lines and wrinkles, most noticeably on my upper lip line.</li>
            <li>Although I have only used this for a couple of weeks, it makes my skin feel smooth and the fine lines seem to be a bit less.</li>
            <li>Not sure I i would use it in the summer, but it&#x27;s great to combat the dry skin I get in the winter.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>High quality product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this cream.  </li>
            <li>Now it is very important to mention that a few pimples appear under my chin</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly suggest this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to my readers.</li>
            <li>and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really smell it in mine, but if your skin is sensitive when it comes to fragrance that might cause an issue for you.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it works really well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important that a cream that comes in a jar, not in a tube, be thick enough so we don&#x27;t have to dip our finger twice to avoid contamination, mostly if we keep our cosmetics in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I washed my face with my normal cleanser that I have been using for years.</li>
            <li>This is a thick, luxurious cream, exactly what I love to use at night.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream on my face for a few weeks and love it.</li>
            <li>It has a nice delicate scent and does not feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long the results will last, but I&#x27;m probably going to purchase more.  </li>
            <li>I used the Anavita cream for 6 weeks and my skin is more firm and silky.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m pleased with the results, my skin seems smoother and less blotchy.  </li>
            <li>Feels velvety and thick great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>The only issue for me is the price, it didn&#x27;t work any better or seem fancier than the major brands at the big box stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed fine lines are starting to &amp;#34;fill&amp;#34; my eyes look brighter, my skin smoother, and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week!</li>
            <li>I got to use the new Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream for Face, Neck &amp; Body, through Brandbacker to try out and give my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid and Matrixyl are two helpful ingredients for plumping your skin and promoting the production of new collagen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>were I live</li>
            <li>My skin is quite sensitive and it hasn´t reacted one bit, so far one month and I´m really keen on my skincare</li>
            <li>The manufacturer/business owner is very helpful and has sent multiple informational emails that I&#x27;ve found very helpful.  </li>
            <li>I loved the fact that it does not leave my skin greasy, it is absorbed quickly, and it works well for day, night, base under makeup and for reducing the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The cream is white but smooths very easily into my skin and has a silky feel when applying, has a slight scent to it nothing over powering.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and tend to break out often, even though I&#x27;m now in my 40s.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and it caused no problems for me.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and looks luminous with each use.</li>
            <li>The jar arrived a little banged up but other then that the cream feels so good on my face.</li>
            <li>I just pat a small amount on my face - cheek area and forehead mostly.</li>
            <li>The fine lines between my eyebrows are also less visible, which is a plus in my book.</li>
            <li>I apply it after a shower and occasionally I&#x27;ll use a skin tighter first</li>
            <li>After I finish my first jar, I will definitely re-purchase this product.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it was similar to Strivectin, which just goes on your skin and &amp;#34;sits there,&amp;#34; almost like a coating.</li>
            <li>Not hard on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Not hard on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The smell is faint yet clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and super dry skin during winter, and ever since I have been using this cream, my skin is not peeling off</li>
            <li>When I did this awhile after application my face got very hot and my skin was taut and very dry.</li>
            <li>Although it works on normal, dry, oily, and sensitive skin it is gentle, no irritating cream.</li>
            <li>I like the creamy texture that&#x27;s neither heavy nor sticky and it goes on easy.</li>
            <li>Within the past 3 weeks I have noticed that my skin on my neck is more visibly tighter, and my skin has never felt so soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Having a product that not only helps fight aging but accentuates the positive in my skin is a must.</li>
            <li>It looked plumper than usual, and pretty quickly in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is supposed to firm skin, work on fine lines, wrinkles, etc.</li>
            <li>It says you will get visible results in just 4 weeks but after just a few days my skin already felt softer and my dry spots were a whole lot better.  </li>
            <li>am using it on my neck, chest and certain areas of my face that need extra hydration.</li>
            <li>Works great, its a little too thick for my taste though.</li>
            <li>Occasionally, I use aa HA serum in the eye area before applying this cream -- just for little more plumping.</li>
            <li>There are many out there; but it is hard to beat Anavita&#x27;s price and quality.</li>
            <li>After a month and a half, it is too early to tell if there has been any significant change.</li>
            <li>also wanted to add in that I have dry sensitive skin, and certain products can negatively react to my skin very easily.</li>
            <li>It is thicker than I expected but it is light enough to wear in the daytime because it isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
            <li>TOOK A WEEK TO CLEAR IT UP.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and often find that moisturizers and creams will irritate my skin, but I have had zero problems with the Anavita cream.</li>
            <li>Please don’t put near your eyes</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this so far for about a week, and am noticing a bit of a difference near my eyes and even my forehead.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend this to those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My mom is in her early 50&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I don’t really have wrinkles, but I could definitely see how it would work because of how well it replenishes my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky and no heavy.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this cream and use it everyday.</li>
            <li>just apply it to the areas with wrinkles and prepare to be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Not oily and makes my face feel so soft, using on my neck also.  </li>
            <li>Tried it - really did not see a big difference</li>
            <li>In fact, after using it several days, I really like the way my skin feels in the mornings when I wake up.</li>
            <li>As a former Ford model....im very picky about what I use on my face</li>
            <li>Not heavy creamy, which I do not like.  </li>
            <li>and so far I like it.</li>
            <li>Wow... what have I got to lose besides wrinkles!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin plump and really soft.</li>
            <li>I wear it as a night-time moisturizer; and after having put it on the night before, and waking-up, my face feels completely hydrated and dewy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin feels really soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>am 25 years old now, going on 26.</li>
            <li>I am so planning on being that 60 year old that looks 30.  </li>
            <li>Developed an allergic rash after about one week.</li>
            <li>It smooths the look of wrinkles and feels soft.</li>
            <li>I only use this product before bedtime and it works very well.</li>
            <li>While I have only been using it for a few weeks now, I have already noticed that my skin is smother and has a more even surface.  </li>
            <li>A few of the tiny lines are fading but they said the first visible effects should be seen within four weeks with full impact visible in twelve weeks (sometimes even sooner).</li>
            <li>A few of the tiny lines are fading but they said the first visible effects should be seen within four weeks with full impact visible in twelve weeks (sometimes even sooner).</li>
            <li>so if you´re about 25 to 32 without big skin issues this is a moisturizer that will do the job without irritating and for a good value but</li>
            <li>It is thick more like a tub of butter.</li>
            <li>This cream is the perfect consistency – not too thick or too thin.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, after reading good reviews I bought this cream</li>
            <li>So far after a short time skin is not greasy and fine lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one that is even interested in surgery or crazy things like that, so products like this are really something that I love to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The high end products seem to be the only ones that don&#x27;t cause me any issues.</li>
            <li>If you compare the ingredients to other high end creams, you are really getting a lot for your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you compare the ingredients to other high end creams, you are really getting a lot for your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am not sure why, or what ingredient caused this, but definitely a HUGE mistake.</li>
            <li>It has a creamy slightly fluffy texture which is a bit like melted butter but cool on the skin when applied.&lt;br</li>
            <li>What else is nice is you only have to use just a tiny dab here and there, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have few fine lines around my eyes, and a deep line around my mouth.</li>
            <li>next morning I decided to start the day off with the beginning of the new me.</li>
            <li>Well, not the new me, but the younger looking me.</li>
            <li>Too bad because I liked the lightness of the cream and nicely it absorbed.</li>
            <li>the wind has made some red patches on my skin last winter this winter the Anavita moisturizing Anti Wrinkle Cream has really help improve the softness of my face and neck.</li>
            <li>so you definitely need more than a pea size portion to cover your face, I would say that you need at least 3 to 4 times that</li>
            <li>but  not only did Anavita not break me out, but left my skin feeling very rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>what this cream does it makes skin instantly feel softer and it really improved the deep wrinkles i had on my neck and smoothed out my skin texture and leaves it with a radiant appearance.</li>
            <li>Anytime I am using any form of facial cream there are a few things that are really important to me.</li>
            <li>I use it at night, it quickly absorbs and my skin feels nourished without a heavy or greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this has been terrific for me.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive facial skin</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and it&#x27;s not left with a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I’m not sure if you can tell by this picture just how rich and creamy this moisturizer is.</li>
            <li>It is recommended for normal, dry, oily, and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product for a few weeks, but it is definitely one of the better facial creams I&#x27;ve used over the years.  </li>
            <li>This surprised me because the cream is so rich and thick</li>
            <li>So I am wondering if this cream couldn&#x27;t fix such a small fine line whiten 3 months</li>
            <li>It is not the type of cream I would generally use</li>
            <li>general</li>
            <li>You will quickly reduce fine lines and deep wrinkles, firming and replenishing your skin to look noticeably younger, without needing expensive procedures like Botox or dermal</li>
            <li>As far as the latter, my dermatologist said that my skin barrier wasn&#x27;t working as it should.</li>
            <li>(sometimes even sooner).You will quickly reduce the look of fine lines and deep wrinkles, firming and replenishing your skin to look noticeably younger, without needing expensive procedures like Botox or dermal fillers.</li>
            <li>I am in my early seventies and will continue to use Anavita, waiting for my second order to arrive.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it 2 weeks so far</li>
            <li>but  2 times, recently,  I had to show my ID for my age and the people were surprised about my age.</li>
            <li>(sometimes even sooner).&lt;br /&gt;You will quickly reduce the look of fine lines and deep wrinkles, firming and replenishing your skin to look noticeably younger, without needing expensive procedures like Botox or dermal fillers.</li>
            <li>It is thick and creamy but absorbs well and does not leave your skin with a tacky feeling, but it is not overly light where you don&#x27;t feel like you have anything on.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to my readers.e Anavita cream to dry the skin.</li>
            <li>I like it but didn&#x27;t really notice a difference other than it moisturizes your face.</li>
            <li>Beats the other high priced anti aging brands which I have  used!  </li>
            <li>Thick, creamy, and rich</li>
            <li>/&gt;-The cream is thick and rich.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it tingled a little bit</li>
            <li>And the many small surface bumps I have across my lower face are much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I did have a few pimples that came out when I first started using it</li>
            <li>but it absorbed faster than my usual one.</li>
            <li>have a full out daily skincare routine, and for the past 3 weeks I have been using this twice daily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-You should notice a moisturizing effect within the first few days of use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-You should notice a moisturizing effect within the first few days of use.</li>
            <li>The formula is rich thick cream is free of unnecessary chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really feel any tingling or even slight change in my face as I do with Retinol...</li>
            <li>However, this product easily absorbs and I&#x27;ve not experienced any oily &amp;#34;breakthrough&amp;#34; when used before applying makeup.  </li>
            <li>I am anxious to see how it looks after a few more months of using this.</li>
            <li>It is super concentrated and thick, what makes it last forever.</li>
            <li>So when trying new products I have be very careful and pick a test spot out on my skin.</li>

            <li> I use rose water in the morning to remove and apply my day cream.</li>
            <li> I loved how my dyhydrated skin now feels better</li>
            <li> I honestly cannot say I see any results at all</li>
            <li> received a sample to share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> It kind of reminds me of the smell of bubble gum which I didn&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
            <li> I always have my eye out for effective skin care products, and this one works well for me.</li>
            <li> It is convenient to use as it is effective for night and day application.  </li>
            <li> All opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> have to be honest.</li>
            <li> I received this for an honest opinion.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an effective moisturizer though.</li>
            <li> But after it absorbs, the skin feels nice.</li>
            <li> No complaints at all, just a really nice, moisturizing cream with benefits.</li>
            <li> So I am loving the  Anavita</li>
            <li> Its nice and creamy and feels so nutritious on my skin... like its doing something.</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for an honest review...</li>
            <li> all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> but there are times when I get warm during the day and</li>
            <li> My opinions however, are all honest.</li>
            <li> This is 100% my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> When I received the Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream I liked the packaging.</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> my own unbiased opinions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For now, I am thrilled that my skin looks healthier and feels smoother since I have started using it.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this!!</li>
            <li> but I am excited that I am  seeing great results in just a couple of weeks.</li>

            <li> I feel like this moisturizer is my new best friend!</li>
            <li> Moving right along, when I saw the opportunity to review the beautiful Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream I thought why not jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The moisturizer in this cream is just amazing if nothing else you will be completely impressed on how soft your face feels.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant odor and went on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really late in posting my review of this wonderful product, but a wonderful product it is!  </li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy after using it, just super moisturized and happy.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love how it absorbs into my skin &amp; makes my face look healthy!</li>
            <li> My skin was probably better off with it, but there are better choices for this price range that have made my face exceptional.</li>
            <li> It is light, smells good, and doesn&#x27;t make my face oily.</li>
            <li> It has replaced my old moisturizer and the anti-aging aspect is a great bonus!</li>
            <li> This cream is so smooth and feels so good on me.  </li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised and VERY impressed with this product, just had to write a review, you&#x27;ve earned it -</li>
            <li> The cream smells lovely, and has a nice texture.</li>
            <li> It does however, take most people 2 to even 4 weeks before they start seeing any kind of change.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t  expect miracles but this is by far the best cream to date</li>
            <li> It is also really easy to use!</li>
            <li> They want their customers to look their best, and we help them achieve that with effective, simple skin care</li>
            <li> It smells great from the jar but when applied to my face, it smells a bit too fragrant for the first couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> It went on smoothly, was easily absorbed, and it felt good!  </li>
            <li> My mother love it very much, She said: it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I was very fortunate to come across Anavita&#x27;s Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream.</li>
            <li> It doesn’t have a strong scent, but what is there is nice.</li>
            <li> More smoother and radiant looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> for the price of this cream I feel it´s an ok moisturizer...</li>
            <li> The texture is really interesting.</li>
            <li> I was forcibly pushed into Club 40 this year.</li>
            <li> Love this cream.</li>
            <li> I love this Anti wrinkle Cream.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with all that it does and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  </li>
            <li> And my skin is glowing :)</li>
            <li> so she can buy more</li>
            <li> Wanted to love it.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better using this than before, which I have never said about a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> What I love about this cream is that it seems to heal my skin rather then “cover up” the issues for a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as you can tell by the name it’s meant to diminish the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> not that I have many wrinkles to deal with.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know that there is a noticeable improvement; but my skin feels better.  </li>
            <li> I love most</li>
            <li> Ok, now they have my attention.</li>
            <li> While some experience rapid results, others find improvement more gradual.</li>
            <li> Well it took me years to get those wrinkles so its going to take more than over night to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> While some experience rapid results, others find improvement more gradual.</li>
            <li> Well it took me years to get those wrinkles so its going to take more than over night to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> found myself wanting more of this cream and applying it regularly since I have seen some results, very happy so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Achieves better results than serums &amp; creams with Vitamin C &amp; Retinol&lt;</li>
            <li> After one week my skin felt firmer, my tone evened out, and my cheeks had more color.  </li>
            <li> Also, I absolutely love the shiny packaging of this cream.</li>
            <li> I am glad I got to try this cream.</li>
            <li> That seems to be a bit better now.</li>
            <li> and it seams most of the people gave this cream</li>
            <li> and NO I won&#x27;t order more of this</li>
            <li> Smells lovely.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in the appearance of my face already, so I&#x27;m sure after continuing to use it for awhile</li>
            <li> I will continue to see even more results.</li>
            <li> It takes time to let the face creams do there job, so I will update this product again in another 4 weeks. :)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this product for anyone needing the perfect moistirizer.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Will be buying again :-)</li>
            <li> I have not yet seen any improvement with lines but may need to give it more time</li>
            <li> I just began using this cream and love it already.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried  many.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice light fraqrance, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Love this wrinkle cream, I doubt that it has made any difference</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford botox treatments and this is the next best thing.  </li>
            <li> sure if it&#x27;s from using this</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like having to take extra steps in my skin care routine and all I have to do now is wash and apply this wonderful moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Congrats on making such a wonderful skin care product!</li>
            <li> The color of my skin has improved also, looking more even.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>

            <li> I have been using many products throughout my life</li>
            <li> It will take more time to know for sure</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about looking our best while pursuing the life path that gives us personal satisfaction.</li>

            <li> I love it because it can be used for more than a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell.</li>
            <li> Complexion better, lines somewhat reduced.</li>
            <li> Skin Care embodies Live the Beautiful Life(TM).</li>
            <li> It is very rich and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> This is a very rich moisturizer without a oily or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> It also feels great on my skin and has a nice barely there smell that isn&#x27;t overwhelming or anything that would bother people who can&#x27;t stand smelly products.</li>
            <li> Wow...so far so good!</li>
            <li> This cream is paraben free and safe for all skin types, even suitable for men and women.</li>
            <li> It was clean and the label looks nice on the silver bottle.</li>

            <li> so I can&#x27;t give a recommendation for long term effects of the product, but I am extremely impressed with this product as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I was impressed with this jar, it seems so crisp and clinical that I almost feel like it is something I might find at a high end med-spa.</li>
            <li> I also loved that it had a light, creamy texture that absorbed well into my skin without feeling like it had a lot of residue.</li>
            <li> I just wish there was more in the jar because it goes very quickly.</li>
            <li> so if you have dry skin this is an awesome way to go.  </li>

            <li> I love that the Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream is cruelty free and safe for all skin types.</li>
            <li> I love the consistency of it and how smoothly it goes on.</li>
            <li> I figured that I needed something a bit more advanced to take care of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did make face smooth but the Earth Science products are way cheaper and work better.</li>
            <li> : I received a free product to review but all opinions expressed are truthful.</li>
            <li> but It really feels good on the face and neck line...</li>

            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t spread easily</li>

            <li> No skin breakouts ,goes on easily yet is a cream ,can be used day or night and no oily residue.</li>

            <li> I wear it under my makeup and it helps my makeup go on easily.  </li>
            <li> First, the product that I am using has to smell nice.</li>
            <li> It was nice, and the wrinkles under my eyes lessened because I put this anti-wrinkle cream on first.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a change on my face in regards to wrinkles or fine lines.</li>
            <li> Still waiting for reduced fine lines.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother and I think it has helped soften some fine lines I have started to see around and under my eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream claimed that it will help reduce fine lines.</li>

            <li> Looking for a Moisturizing Cream to help combat those fine lines and wrinkles?</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t removed all my fine lines or wrinkles yet</li>
            <li> but I do think that with time, it will reduce fine line lines.</li>

            <li> It has a light scent and the cream glides on smoothly.</li>

            <li> Wears smoothly under foundation</li>
            <li> This cream goes on smoothly with no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Non-irritating cream helps against free radical damage</li>
            <li> I have ordered 2 different creams,  both had great reviews but for me they did not work one</li>
            <li> did get this free to review</li>
            <li> And it is no greasy or heavy, smells wonderful too.</li>
            <li> areas!&lt;br /&gt;It is light and can be worn under makeup.</li>
            <li> It has a light scent that is rather pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was optimistic, as it made my skin feel silky smooth when I put it on.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need as much because it goes on really nicely.</li>
            <li> I tried out the Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream cream, which was given to me to try out for free.</li>
            <li> When applying this concoction it went on smooth and evenly.</li>
            <li> I mentioned before, the state that the cream leaves my face in is important as well.</li>
            <li> It went on smooth and did not leave my skin sticky or cakey at all.</li>
            <li> and it has a light scent to it</li>
            <li> It is light but fruity.</li>
            <li> I received this product free for my review purposes and all opinions are 100%</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it two days and my skin is SO smooth.</li>
            <li> The best thing is that the cream is paraben free, sulfate free, phthalate free and not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a few weeks I noticed a softness to my skin.</li>
            <li> I honestly think there is a marked difference in my skin for the better.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> Once I get the clear by my skin not breaking out in hives or severe redness I am good to go.</li>
            <li> Overall Anavita really stands up to it&#x27;s competitors with this wonderful beauty product.</li>
            <li> , I have tried more than my fair share of facial creams.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> The price is beyond reasonable for the product&#x27;s quality, and I&#x27;ve used many inferior creams that cost a lot more.  </li>
            <li> The light flowers fragrance is very fresh and relaxing.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with finding the right moisturizer for my face for many years.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> My favorite thing to do with this product is putting it on right before I put on my makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to put on, and I just make it a habit to put it on after I shower in the evening, as well as in the morning after I wash my face and get ready to put my makeup on.  </li>
            <li> I used this for a week before I realized it was doing significant damage to my skin.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer caused me to break out in cysts that lasted over a month, and caused significant residual scarring.</li>
            <li> but I do believe that this would be wonderful in harsh summer and winter months when the skin has been exposed to the elements!</li>
            <li> Hence I will never recommend a product that I do not think is worth the price!</li>
            <li> So there is no way you would know if this is unused or original.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this moisturizing wrinkle cream for face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Upon opening the jar of Anavita I immediately noticed the creamy rich texture, not runny.</li>
            <li> so I’m excited to see what happens.  </li>
            <li> Anavita Moisturizing Anti -Wrinkle Cream is creamy, rich and not oily.  </li>
            <li> and so far I am very pleased with the results</li>
            <li> The foundation goes on much smoother and more evenly without settling into the fine lines.</li>
            <li> clean feeling will have to wait and see if it helps wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It goes on light and absorbs really quickly.</li>
            <li> It is light and absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> I apply this on clean skin, and basically massage it into my skin using upward motions.</li>
            <li> Even though I did receive this product in exchange for my honest review, I really do love this product and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Nice but could not order more, so changed to a different product.  </li>
            <li> BUT when you put it on it is smooth and absorbs in to your skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> I find it easy to use as it goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and is absorbed into my skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is so highly moisturizer that you cannot even begin to touch it with a regular moisture lotion and it has been great to put on after exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and I wake up every morning touching my face and smiling!  </li>
            <li> My own natural skin had a matt-finish!</li>
            <li> For a woman who is 37, it is very important to pay much attention to my skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream via a special promotion.  </li>
            <li> received the product sooner than it was expected, that was great.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer does have a light fragrance to it but nothing that was too powerful.</li>
            <li> My skin feels good and seems to have enough moisture.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin nicely and leaves no heavy feeling at all.</li>
            <li> It feels so nice and soft now.</li>
            <li> I wrote a full review on my blog:  </li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it, doesn&#x27;t take much and goes on evenly.  </li>
            <li> While it says full results in 8-12 weeks, I don&#x27;t want to wait two months to leave a review.</li>
            <li> because if it works this good this fast then it can only get better with time.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 more jars it works very well.</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t have many yet anyhow.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed how soft my skin felt upon application and it is really a nice product.  </li>
            <li> I immediately noticed how soft my skin felt upon application and it is really a nice product.  </li>
            <li> But this Anavita cream actually soaks this up, which is surprising because I have oily</li>
            <li> I tried the cream on the back of my hand and immediately loved the smell.</li>
            <li> It is soft and looks pretty good.</li>
            <li> So far pretty  good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, absorbs quickly, and wow, the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li> Not only is the cream is rich, it has a nice light scent.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and it doesn&#x27;t make it super oily by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> and I just love how it leaves my skin so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> and I love how smooth and soft my skin is now.  </li>
            <li> but luckily she lives 2 blocks from me -</li>
            <li> but it does dry/absorb quickly.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best creams I have tried in the last ten years.  </li>
            <li> The creme is super absorbent with no greasyness.  </li>
            <li> cream has a light citrus fragrance appealing to both men and women, but no heavy perfume smell.</li>
            <li> So thankful for such a great facial product, that I know is trustworthy in the ingredients, and huge kudos, no animal testing!  </li>
            <li> , she is a skin care &amp;#34;freak&amp;#34; lol and always uses the most expensive products I will be buying her more</li>
            <li> Is pretty moisturizer and light.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that it absorbs easily, leaving my soft and make-up is easily applied within minutes.</li>
            <li> It has some great ingredients in it, no parabens or harmful drying ingredients, and it can produce visible results in 4 weeks or less.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and although this cream was good at the beginning but then after a while it started giving me breakouts.</li>
            <li> woman needs more than just an ordinary moisturizer; she needs anti-oxidants and collagen promoters in order to restore good skin conditions.</li>
            <li> For example, if you are using another brand of wrinkle cream on your face at night and wanted to use Anavita during the day, the night product could prevent Anavita from absorbing easily.</li>
            <li> I would say that this is very comparable to those higher priced beauty counter creams, for a much better price.</li>
            <li> I use it under my eyes &amp; nose first then cheeks, brow, eyelids(it helps prime for eyeshadow too!)</li>
            <li> I am on a constant quest to finding great skin care products as I have noticed some new wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent but is pleasant overall.</li>
            <li> Notice that dry skin will appear more wrinkled than moisturized skin, but what Anavita does is that it help promote healthy skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and I can put my makeup on right</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perfect for fine lines and wrinkles, this moisturizer is gentle on skin</li>
            <li> I see a marked improvement in my skin - more even tone, more luminous, very much younger looking - fine wrinkles have disappeared.    </li>
            <li> I just got this a few weeks ago, and it feels great on my face.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been looking for an amazing cream look no further, I swear this eliminated three steps form my beauty routine!</li>
            <li> After just a few days of use I already noticed a difference in my skin - it is feeling softer and smoother and has a nice healthy glow to it.</li>
            <li> , you kind of wish you had the wrinkles back.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, you may be ok.</li>
            <li> I loved this so much that I ordered it a second time (rare for me).</li>
            <li> It’s quite nice actually!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been pleased with the product and the results.</li>
            <li> I received the below mentioned complimentary product for the purpose of this review.</li>
            <li> The cream inside has a white color and smells really nice.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this nice product.</li>
            <li> I can also see that my laugh lines are minimized.</li>
            <li> I was provided a complimentary sample.</li>
            <li> We strive to be better and at the same time appreciate who we are and enjoy our life journey.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to place the Anavita cream over another product since Anavita may not be absorbed as well as it should be.&lt;br /&gt;-Sometimes</li>
            <li> The first visible effects should be seen within four weeks with full impact visible in twelve weeks (sometimes even sooner).</li>
            <li> This is not an overnight success you will need to use to get results for a period of time.</li>
            <li> The first visible effects should be seen within four weeks with full impact visible in twelve weeks (sometimes even sooner).</li>
            <li> This is not an overnight success you will need to use to get results for a period of time.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very mild, pleasant and hardly noticeable.  </li>
            <li> , so I&#x27;m already trying to do what I can to help my skin not to wrinkle too much and try and mainly keep it healthy.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to like this stuff and the price was right.  </li>
            <li> As of right now I don’t have wrinkles (knocks on wood)</li>
            <li> My right arm is now noticeably stronger.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and looks more vibrant and my smile lines appear to have diminished!</li>
            <li> , that is out the way, I have had quite a positive experience with this product!</li>
            <li> I just got this product and haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it that long, but so far it seems to be a great moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> It does make my face feel smooth and soft and seems not to show those fine lines under my eyes as much.</li>
            <li> Obviously, if you use it two times a day, it will work more quickly than the once a day regimen I’m on.</li>
            <li> Great winter moisturizer because it is thick but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> find that it works well without being too greasy and it absorbs so quickly, and even though I think it feels and works like much more expensive brands, its nice to know that you can get great facial products without them costing you too much money.</li>
            <li> I can see this feeling so soothing after being out in the sun all day or especially for me, since I do not spend a great deal of time in the sun, after a day in the harsh winter winds, as that is what my skin is bothered by the most.</li>
            <li> As a 43 year old woman, I am in danger of becoming wrinkled like the leg of an elephant.</li>
            <li> Your skin will benefit and look years younger from our high quality moisturizer that is paraben free, sulfate free, phthalate free and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> The product did arrive on time and in good conditions i have been using it for more than 45 days with no results, actually I have very few fine lines</li>
            <li> can really feel a difference in my face when I smile or laugh.</li>
            <li> The cream was light and fluffy which honestly reminded me of a whipped icing you find on cakes.</li>
            <li> it is a great idea to keep up the maintenance, and we can prevent prior the wrinkles prior to our aging progress get well under way.</li>
            <li> it is a great idea to keep up the maintenance, and we can prevent prior the wrinkles prior to our aging progress get well under way.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve actually seen some minor results, which were WAY more than I anticipated if I&#x27;m being completely honest.</li>
            <li> I very highly recommend this product for anyone looking to improve the appearance of their skin!</li>
            <li> This thick and creamy white cream, has a light pleasant fragrance, and was easy to apply, my skin stayed moisturized for hours after use and feels smoother.</li>
            <li> a little thick for my liking, so it takes more work than I&#x27;m used to in order to get it spread around, but all in all great product!</li>
            <li> It is absorbed very well by it</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about the Anativa Moisturizing cream is the scent.</li>
            <li> This is the first cream I&#x27;ve ever used that does not irritate my skin nor cause me to break out.  </li>
            <li> I will most definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I love that this product gives me just enough moisture for my skin.</li>
            <li> Skin definitely looks better.</li>
            <li> This cream is absorbed readily into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily film or slippery feel.</li>
            <li> is that this moisturizing cream leaves my skin soft and smooth to touch.</li>
            <li> my face is smoother after first application.</li>
            <li> I am very frugal but consider this worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> use a pore cleansing product called Indian Healing clay, first I cleansed my face twice a week at night</li>
            <li> leaves my skin ultra soft and smooth immediately after use.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with this product.  </li>
            <li> I would love to get rid of them, but I know there is no magic, it is all about moisturizing, using sunscreen, and eating healthy</li>
            <li> have to use Persagel all over my face, regardless of what I put on first, or I can&#x27;t put makeup on.</li>
            <li> Anavita&#x27;s non-irritating cream is well-suited for all skin types with a tested history of safe and gentle action by a long list of satisfied users.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pretty faithful with my use.  </li>
            <li> I love trying different beauty products</li>
            <li> The cream is a bit rich/thick for my face, but I put it on my neck, and it seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I have a few dry spots and in the winter they get nothing but dryer and dryer this moisturizing anti wrinkle cream is going to be perfect.  </li>
            <li> Great product in a small jar!</li>
            <li> But my skin looks good even if I need a stiff drink.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several weeks and notice a pretty good reduction in the deep wrinkles on my decollatage, neck and forehead.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream because it keeps my face hydrated, soft and smooth on my oily face.</li>
            <li> said it had same components as this one does and used it for at least 8 months (perfect image) and</li>
            <li> Nice face cream thick and smooth .applies</li>
            <li> I still have plenty of product left to last me for a good while, and because I have loved the results of this on my neck, I am going to be alternating this with my current facial anti wrinkle cream, and reap some of the benefits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good for nighttime,because a little heavy,but it works!</li>
            <li> The jar is pretty large at 1.7 fl oz.  </li>
            <li> Proven to stimulate the synthesis of collagen which makes your skin appear years younger &amp; more vibrant</li>
            <li> my skin is starting to become more vibrant as well as tighter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;t come is an easy to open jar.</li>
            <li> Foundations and powders tend to cling to dry patches and make them more noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Thus, there&#x27;s no need to buy a separate moisturizing cream specifically for a certain time of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am seeing results without using a large amount of the product.  </li>
            <li> and I really wanted to give it a try and couldn&#x27;t wait to see some positive</li>
            <li> It applies smoothly and evenly with absolutely no clumping and absorbs quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Fine line&#x27;s on my forehead, and fine lines under my eyes are my trouble area&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have visible wrinkles yet except for a very tiny fine line that I noticed between my eyebrows couple of months ago.</li>
            <li> Sometimes something very good has negative aspects to it that are really just personal preferences</li>
            <li> and now I have not broken out at all.</li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it let the skin.</li>
            <li> Michigan winter has started all ready</li>
            <li> Very creamy but absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> I have been using this in combo with my vitamin c serum and hyaluronic acid serum after I run my dermal roller and achieving some very noticeable results.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper, and they work for me.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> For my wife and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> You can really tell the difference when you apply foundation over it.</li>
            <li> She and I both would absolutely recommend Anativa Moisturizing Cream.</li>
            <li> I really like this&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This cream works very well.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell amazing, but it is so lush and leaves your face feeling SO soft.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream.  </li>
            <li> My face is really itchy now.  </li>
            <li> I then massaged in the cream using gentle upward strokes.</li>
            <li> I have some lines under my chin, and frown line above my nose, and light crows feet.</li>
            <li> and I really like the effect it has on my skin.</li>
            <li> It seems a lot softer and looks so much smoother.</li>
            <li> and honestly it is really working.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I am a male, my skin is light brown and oily around my nose.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I am  very</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It seems to have a matte finish after applying which I really like.  </li>
            <li> I buy this for one of my nail clients who has very wrinkled skin,  she LOVES it.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just the application of the product which leaves so much to be desired.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> really like the consistency of this cream.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly by gently rubbing</li>
            <li> I really like using it as a primer for my concealer.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this cream and WILL be purchasing it again in the future!</li>
            <li> Works well fast shipping A+++</li>
            <li> and sometimes I get really oily.</li>
            <li> I find that this really depends on what products I am using.</li>
            <li> It feels very luxurious on her skin.</li>
            <li> but it won&#x27;t really bother you when you apply it to your skin.</li>
            <li> As of yet, I haven&#x27;t really seen any difference, but I guess it can take up to twelve weeks to notice a change.  </li>
            <li> Then massage in the cream using gentle upward</li>
            <li> This cream really works.</li>
            <li> It is really gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> The Anavita cream is also nice because it can eliminate several steps in your daily regimen by serving as a day cream, night cream, wrinkle cream and makeup</li>
            <li> I did pass this product on to my mother who LOVES rich thick creams, her skin is far drier than my own.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and it has quickly become my new favorite face cream.</li>
            <li> The cream and white and rich and does not have any overpowering smell,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Our skin care products are never tested on animals and only feature formulations with high quality ingredients free of sulfates, phthalates, parabens, and petroleum</li>
            <li> I try to help her with this as much as possible and I like to keep her up to date on all the new creams that could help with her wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li> can tell you that I don&#x27;t usually get that kind of timeline for a product review for my blog, and really, even if I did I couldn&#x27;t always take that time</li>
            <li> Second, while it is important that a product not leave my face dry, it is equally as important that it not leave my skin oily!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a slight peppermint scent and smells really light and fresh.</li>
            <li> Her skin feels much softer too and has a smoother appearance and more even tone with a lot less redness.</li>
            <li> high ratings received it for free and didn&#x27;t use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> lightly pat dry</li>
            <li> She still has some deep fine lines around her lips but they seem to be diminishing and normally  she has issues with oiliness in some areas and dryness in others and that has completely worked itself out.</li>
            <li> I can always steal it back later! :)</li>
            <li> I usually just wear a bit of blush and using this cream first made the blush work better.  </li>
            <li> First thing I want to say, you are going to find a LOT of people online doing the same review, but I want to give you the straight facts!</li>
            <li> I am so surprised that after just a few days use I&#x27;m already seeing reduced visibility of fine lines and wrinkles, most noticeably on my upper lip line.</li>
            <li> Although I have only used this for a couple of weeks, it makes my skin feel smooth and the fine lines seem to be a bit less.</li>
            <li> Not sure I i would use it in the summer, but it&#x27;s great to combat the dry skin I get in the winter.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> High quality product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this cream.  </li>
            <li> Now it is very important to mention that a few pimples appear under my chin</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly suggest this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to my readers.</li>
            <li> and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really smell it in mine, but if your skin is sensitive when it comes to fragrance that might cause an issue for you.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it works really well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important that a cream that comes in a jar, not in a tube, be thick enough so we don&#x27;t have to dip our finger twice to avoid contamination, mostly if we keep our cosmetics in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I washed my face with my normal cleanser that I have been using for years.</li>
            <li> This is a thick, luxurious cream, exactly what I love to use at night.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream on my face for a few weeks and love it.</li>
            <li> It has a nice delicate scent and does not feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long the results will last, but I&#x27;m probably going to purchase more.  </li>
            <li> I used the Anavita cream for 6 weeks and my skin is more firm and silky.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m pleased with the results, my skin seems smoother and less blotchy.  </li>
            <li> Feels velvety and thick great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> The only issue for me is the price, it didn&#x27;t work any better or seem fancier than the major brands at the big box stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed fine lines are starting to &amp;#34;fill&amp;#34; my eyes look brighter, my skin smoother, and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week!</li>
            <li> I got to use the new Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream for Face, Neck &amp; Body, through Brandbacker to try out and give my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid and Matrixyl are two helpful ingredients for plumping your skin and promoting the production of new collagen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> were I live</li>
            <li> My skin is quite sensitive and it hasn´t reacted one bit, so far one month and I´m really keen on my skincare</li>
            <li> The manufacturer/business owner is very helpful and has sent multiple informational emails that I&#x27;ve found very helpful.  </li>
            <li> I loved the fact that it does not leave my skin greasy, it is absorbed quickly, and it works well for day, night, base under makeup and for reducing the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The cream is white but smooths very easily into my skin and has a silky feel when applying, has a slight scent to it nothing over powering.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and tend to break out often, even though I&#x27;m now in my 40s.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and it caused no problems for me.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and looks luminous with each use.</li>
            <li> The jar arrived a little banged up but other then that the cream feels so good on my face.</li>
            <li> I just pat a small amount on my face - cheek area and forehead mostly.</li>
            <li> The fine lines between my eyebrows are also less visible, which is a plus in my book.</li>
            <li> I apply it after a shower and occasionally I&#x27;ll use a skin tighter first</li>
            <li> After I finish my first jar, I will definitely re-purchase this product.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was similar to Strivectin, which just goes on your skin and &amp;#34;sits there,&amp;#34; almost like a coating.</li>
            <li> Not hard on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Not hard on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The smell is faint yet clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and super dry skin during winter, and ever since I have been using this cream, my skin is not peeling off</li>
            <li> When I did this awhile after application my face got very hot and my skin was taut and very dry.</li>
            <li> Although it works on normal, dry, oily, and sensitive skin it is gentle, no irritating cream.</li>
            <li> I like the creamy texture that&#x27;s neither heavy nor sticky and it goes on easy.</li>
            <li> Within the past 3 weeks I have noticed that my skin on my neck is more visibly tighter, and my skin has never felt so soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Having a product that not only helps fight aging but accentuates the positive in my skin is a must.</li>
            <li> It looked plumper than usual, and pretty quickly in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is supposed to firm skin, work on fine lines, wrinkles, etc.</li>
            <li> It says you will get visible results in just 4 weeks but after just a few days my skin already felt softer and my dry spots were a whole lot better.  </li>
            <li> am using it on my neck, chest and certain areas of my face that need extra hydration.</li>
            <li> Works great, its a little too thick for my taste though.</li>
            <li> Occasionally, I use aa HA serum in the eye area before applying this cream -- just for little more plumping.</li>
            <li> There are many out there; but it is hard to beat Anavita&#x27;s price and quality.</li>
            <li> After a month and a half, it is too early to tell if there has been any significant change.</li>
            <li> also wanted to add in that I have dry sensitive skin, and certain products can negatively react to my skin very easily.</li>
            <li> It is thicker than I expected but it is light enough to wear in the daytime because it isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
            <li> TOOK A WEEK TO CLEAR IT UP.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and often find that moisturizers and creams will irritate my skin, but I have had zero problems with the Anavita cream.</li>
            <li> Please don’t put near your eyes</li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this so far for about a week, and am noticing a bit of a difference near my eyes and even my forehead.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this to those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My mom is in her early 50&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I don’t really have wrinkles, but I could definitely see how it would work because of how well it replenishes my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s silky and no heavy.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this cream and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> just apply it to the areas with wrinkles and prepare to be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Not oily and makes my face feel so soft, using on my neck also.  </li>
            <li> Tried it - really did not see a big difference</li>
            <li> In fact, after using it several days, I really like the way my skin feels in the mornings when I wake up.</li>
            <li> As a former Ford model....im very picky about what I use on my face</li>
            <li> Not heavy creamy, which I do not like.  </li>
            <li> and so far I like it.</li>
            <li> Wow... what have I got to lose besides wrinkles!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin plump and really soft.</li>
            <li> I wear it as a night-time moisturizer; and after having put it on the night before, and waking-up, my face feels completely hydrated and dewy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin feels really soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> am 25 years old now, going on 26.</li>
            <li> I am so planning on being that 60 year old that looks 30.  </li>
            <li> Developed an allergic rash after about one week.</li>
            <li> It smooths the look of wrinkles and feels soft.</li>
            <li> I only use this product before bedtime and it works very well.</li>
            <li> While I have only been using it for a few weeks now, I have already noticed that my skin is smother and has a more even surface.  </li>
            <li> A few of the tiny lines are fading but they said the first visible effects should be seen within four weeks with full impact visible in twelve weeks (sometimes even sooner).</li>
            <li> A few of the tiny lines are fading but they said the first visible effects should be seen within four weeks with full impact visible in twelve weeks (sometimes even sooner).</li>
            <li> so if you´re about 25 to 32 without big skin issues this is a moisturizer that will do the job without irritating and for a good value but</li>
            <li> It is thick more like a tub of butter.</li>
            <li> This cream is the perfect consistency – not too thick or too thin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after reading good reviews I bought this cream</li>
            <li> So far after a short time skin is not greasy and fine lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one that is even interested in surgery or crazy things like that, so products like this are really something that I love to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The high end products seem to be the only ones that don&#x27;t cause me any issues.</li>
            <li> If you compare the ingredients to other high end creams, you are really getting a lot for your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you compare the ingredients to other high end creams, you are really getting a lot for your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am not sure why, or what ingredient caused this, but definitely a HUGE mistake.</li>
            <li> It has a creamy slightly fluffy texture which is a bit like melted butter but cool on the skin when applied.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What else is nice is you only have to use just a tiny dab here and there, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have few fine lines around my eyes, and a deep line around my mouth.</li>
            <li> next morning I decided to start the day off with the beginning of the new me.</li>
            <li> Well, not the new me, but the younger looking me.</li>
            <li> Too bad because I liked the lightness of the cream and nicely it absorbed.</li>
            <li> the wind has made some red patches on my skin last winter this winter the Anavita moisturizing Anti Wrinkle Cream has really help improve the softness of my face and neck.</li>
            <li> so you definitely need more than a pea size portion to cover your face, I would say that you need at least 3 to 4 times that</li>
            <li> but  not only did Anavita not break me out, but left my skin feeling very rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> what this cream does it makes skin instantly feel softer and it really improved the deep wrinkles i had on my neck and smoothed out my skin texture and leaves it with a radiant appearance.</li>
            <li> Anytime I am using any form of facial cream there are a few things that are really important to me.</li>
            <li> I use it at night, it quickly absorbs and my skin feels nourished without a heavy or greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this has been terrific for me.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive facial skin</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and it&#x27;s not left with a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I’m not sure if you can tell by this picture just how rich and creamy this moisturizer is.</li>
            <li> It is recommended for normal, dry, oily, and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a few weeks, but it is definitely one of the better facial creams I&#x27;ve used over the years.  </li>
            <li> This surprised me because the cream is so rich and thick</li>
            <li> So I am wondering if this cream couldn&#x27;t fix such a small fine line whiten 3 months</li>
            <li> It is not the type of cream I would generally use</li>
            <li> general</li>
            <li> You will quickly reduce fine lines and deep wrinkles, firming and replenishing your skin to look noticeably younger, without needing expensive procedures like Botox or dermal</li>
            <li> As far as the latter, my dermatologist said that my skin barrier wasn&#x27;t working as it should.</li>
            <li> (sometimes even sooner).You will quickly reduce the look of fine lines and deep wrinkles, firming and replenishing your skin to look noticeably younger, without needing expensive procedures like Botox or dermal fillers.</li>
            <li> I am in my early seventies and will continue to use Anavita, waiting for my second order to arrive.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it 2 weeks so far</li>
            <li> but  2 times, recently,  I had to show my ID for my age and the people were surprised about my age.</li>
            <li> (sometimes even sooner).&lt;br /&gt;You will quickly reduce the look of fine lines and deep wrinkles, firming and replenishing your skin to look noticeably younger, without needing expensive procedures like Botox or dermal fillers.</li>
            <li> It is thick and creamy but absorbs well and does not leave your skin with a tacky feeling, but it is not overly light where you don&#x27;t feel like you have anything on.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to my readers.e Anavita cream to dry the skin.</li>
            <li> I like it but didn&#x27;t really notice a difference other than it moisturizes your face.</li>
            <li> Beats the other high priced anti aging brands which I have  used!  </li>
            <li> Thick, creamy, and rich</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The cream is thick and rich.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it tingled a little bit</li>
            <li> And the many small surface bumps I have across my lower face are much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I did have a few pimples that came out when I first started using it</li>
            <li> but it absorbed faster than my usual one.</li>
            <li> have a full out daily skincare routine, and for the past 3 weeks I have been using this twice daily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-You should notice a moisturizing effect within the first few days of use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-You should notice a moisturizing effect within the first few days of use.</li>
            <li> The formula is rich thick cream is free of unnecessary chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really feel any tingling or even slight change in my face as I do with Retinol...</li>
            <li> However, this product easily absorbs and I&#x27;ve not experienced any oily &amp;#34;breakthrough&amp;#34; when used before applying makeup.  </li>
            <li> I am anxious to see how it looks after a few more months of using this.</li>
            <li> It is super concentrated and thick, what makes it last forever.</li>
            <li> So when trying new products I have be very careful and pick a test spot out on my skin.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this cream it was so thick I could barely massage it into my skin.</li>
            <li> have been using it everyday (twice a day) for the past few weeks and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> It feels more like Shea butter than the thin feeling of other night creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This cream is very creamy and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> but maybe it has not been a long enough time yet as there are deep wrinkles and laxity.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see younger skin</li>
            <li> This cream is a little thicker than my normal moisturizer</li>
            <li> When my skin is very dry, finnicky, or tight, I use this at night and it’s back to normal the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Helps all aging concerns...but can usually get much cheaper on ebay.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough to notice difference in any wrinkles.</li>
            <li> well as they wrote to me, saying I have not had this long enough to give it a glowing review, I think I have, I have not seen any difference</li>
            <li> This first thing I noticed about the cream is how thick it was.</li>
            <li> so I would say my review is pretty objective, unbiased and serious...</li>
            <li> I am 26 years old, and I always have had the belief in taking care of my skin now, and reaping the benefits 20 years down the road.</li>
            <li> My face feels soft and hydrated without feeling weighed down or greasy.</li>
            <li> (so it doesn&#x27;t last very long...).</li>
            <li> once again it is more of a soft clinical smell but not in a bad way.</li>
            <li> I’d recommend this for any skin type, especially for dry</li>
            <li> In fact it is quite nourishing to my skin especially since I suffer from dry skin</li>
            <li> It works very well and absorbs rather quickly, it is very thick and heavy feeling at first, but absorbs well.</li>
            <li> It works very well and absorbs rather quickly, it is very thick and heavy feeling at first, but absorbs well.</li>
            <li> It applies easily - not too light or thick.  </li>
            <li> It is still a little too early to know how well it will work.</li>
            <li> It doesn’t have an amazing smell, but it isn’t a bad smell either.</li>
            <li> smells weird and feel like a cheap lotion, I won&#x27;t use it on my face</li>
            <li> There is an ingredient that I cannot use after long searching for anti wrinkle</li>
            <li> and I believe it did work on some of the minor lines I had in my face.</li>
            <li> Minor Results are still RESULTS</li>
            <li> Minor Results are still RESULTS</li>
            <li> After using this product now for a few weeks, I notice a marked difference in the skin tone in my neck and face,  my skin is firmer and tighter and I have noticeably fewer lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been few days that I have been using this product and so far, my skin has no breakout.</li>
            <li> one is thick and gets into your skin fast, does not have that flower smell</li>
            <li> And thick sometimes clogs pore and no one wants that problem.</li>
            <li> This anti- wrinkle cream is thick but it absorbs onto your face really well</li>
            <li> I had a little trouble reading the directions, as they were small, but easy to follow.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s really weird is after I put the Persagel on, my face was so smooth and dry, like I had powder on it.</li>
            <li> and the next day I noticed my skin felt dry and rough.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Wrinkles less apparent</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed a softness to her skin and it took such a small amount to cover her entire face that I can tell this jar would last a long time.</li>
            <li> They say, “If other people don’t comment on your improved appearance within thirty days, we’ll give you your money back!”  </li>
            <li> I stopped using all other products and only your cream.</li>
            <li> you can use other products when using the Anavita cream, but we would suggest using them at different times of day.</li>
            <li> Also the cream is too thick, it hardly runs through your skin and all it did is open my pores tremendously.  </li>
            <li> I haven’t been using it very long yet</li>
            <li> I found this moisturizer to dry my face out, I had to buy another moisturizer to supplement this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> this moisturizer leaves my skin a bit dry a bit too soon...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and have a dry skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend it if you have a dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, but my chin gets extremely dry.</li>
            <li> still having dry skin despite of the price tht I had paid.</li>
            <li> But then I noticed after using it for a couple of weeks that my skin is incredibly dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li> its not greasy nor doesn&#x27;t leave any dry cream residue on skin</li>
            <li> Sometimes I get dry</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> It moisturizes the dry patches and makeup goes on without any issue.  </li>
            <li> Goodbye To Wrinkled, Sagging, Dry Skin</li>
            <li> Another example is castor oil cleansing may cause the Anavita cream to dry the skin.</li>
            <li> when I apply it on my face, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, sticky or dry.</li>
            <li> been using it for a few days now and my skin is so much smooth ( looks and touch ) and doesn&#x27;t look so tired.</li>
            <li> After only using a few days I see a big difference.  </li>
            <li> Following paralysis  on the left side of my face,  I use Anavita at 3 places  there to diminish the ugliness  of the  areas  where paralysis  produced lasting effects.  </li>
            <li> I live in the north country and winter is hard on my skin.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasing, generic scent, not perfumey, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> and she has been a little down on herslef because she doesn&#x27;t look as young as she used to.</li>
            <li> After using it for a week, I noticed that my chin wasn’t as dry as it was before!</li>
            <li> So if you have wrinkles and dry skin, it would probably absorb in seconds!</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin around my eyes, but Anavita has saved the day!  </li>
            <li> but it typically takes several weeks to see a visible difference</li>
            <li> It just takes a little, I think this jar will last a long time!</li>
            <li> I don’t have deep wrinkles, but it’s made for any skin type, so I’ll comment on what this does for my small wrinkles and the overall texture/condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> I then softly towel dried my face and applied the Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream as directed by placing a pearl-sized dollop ( a little goes a long way ) on a finger and dab the cream around my face and neck.</li>
            <li> So many products that you see out there on the market, tell you they will help with wrinkles, however with the alcohol, they dry your skin out so bad</li>
            <li> according to Anavita when you can say goodbye to wrinkled, sagging, dry skin in just a few short weeks.</li>
            <li> It was a little heavy to use prior to putting on makeup; however, this may be a personal “thing” as I do not normally like to apply moisturizer before I put on my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In addition, when you get near the bottom of it, the jar is designed in such a way that a lot of the cream is hidden in creases near the bottom of the jar, making it difficult to get it all out.  </li>
            <li> All it took was a little scoop to go over my entire face.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this cream for a little over a week.</li>
            <li> I Love how my skin isn&#x27;t reacting badly or breaking out to Anavita.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times.</li>
            <li> noticeable effects (except a few red pimples) when used as directed.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s not a total waste, I am using it as a hand</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too pasty and rough; would not recommend.</li>
            <li> The Anavita cream is neither greasy nor has it been harsh on my skin, even for using it daily and liberally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw results in a few days and feel the lines diminish quite a bit after several weeks.  </li>
            <li> it shows that they really stand behind it.</li>
            <li> In Just A Few Short Weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice base for foundation makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several other anti wrinkle creams for much longer periods and never experienced the results I&#x27;ve seen with this in just a few days of use.</li>
            <li> I used it for about 8-9 days and it was starting to cause little breakouts and making razor rash worse, normally I don&#x27;t have these problems.  </li>
            <li> It’s very thick, so a tiny, tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The consistency is so smooth and luxurious and I am obsessed!</li>
            <li> This jar seems to last a long time since it&#x27;s so thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> Sending my youngest child off to college, starting a new school year as a teacher, and the joys of a root canal gone wrong.  </li>
            <li> I used it for a few weeks and it did help with the line next to my mouth, making it appear less visible.</li>
            <li> but may work for other ppl.</li>
            <li> Peptides and lots of other goodies in this cream.  </li>
            <li> That has been a blessing considering the extremely stressful month I have had.  </li>
            <li> No breakouts or allergic reactions which I have had with other neck wrinkle  and firming products.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day, and did not use any other moisturizing creams to see how it works.</li>
            <li> With other moisturizers I sometimes find myself using a couple of layers of product to get the moisture level that I want</li>
            <li> the shiny chrome finish feels extremely slippery in my hands.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer recommended suspending use of any other skin products while using this one, as other products might reduce the skin&#x27;s absorption of the Anavita.  </li>
            <li> I have forgotten to use it a couple of times but other than those times</li>
            <li> I have now used it for a few weeks and my chin isn’t dry at all.</li>
            <li> and my skin has a few dry patches around my mouth and nose.  </li>
            <li> I personally have had an issue with dryness lately.</li>
            <li> dark spots because of sun damage and pores are vanishing gradually.</li>
            <li> Says tingles, didnt seem to do much for being so expensive</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t break me out, and the couple of dark spots I had from sun-exposure have started to diminish.</li>
            <li> I love that you can use it morning, night and as a makeup base.</li>
            <li> I have highly sensitive skin and it reacts quickly to irritating chemicals.</li>
            <li> favorite use for this product is as a makeup base.  </li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight like it would with other moisturizers that were anti wrinkle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I even bring this down onto my d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;e, again using the upward massaging motions.</li>
            <li> Now, I never have to check my face in the mirror and pat down the excess oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cold right now</li>
            <li> I sometimes have issue with other creams feeling heavy on the skin and rubbing off on my pillow case when I go to bed at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cream is very thick and difficult to smooth on your face.  </li>
            <li> If we are being honest, there is nothing worse than putting a product on your face that you are going to have to smell all day and it smells bad.</li>
            <li> My forehead wrinkles were slightly less pronounced and the wrinkles under my eyes looked smoother.</li>
            <li> My wrinkles are alot less noticeable and My face seems alot smoother.</li>
            <li> Not expecting miracle but was expecting some slight difference.</li>
            <li> , I was almost worried it would cause me to break out because it is slightly oily</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing that I am disappointed about is that the first time I received the product it was with a plastic seal around the jar but the last time that I received the cream it didn&#x27;t have that.</li>
            <li> This cream is so thick and heavy, it will last you 2 weeks</li>
            <li> She has started seeing lines get less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I did receive a SLIGHT discount for my review</li>
            <li> I have used it every day for a month now and have seen a slight improvement in my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I can see less wrinkles on my face after a few days of using it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it a little over 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I just have to have patience.it a little over 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I have just been using this a little while</li>
            <li> I see some difference but not much more than if I use some of my other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I used this at night with a little bit of Retin A.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s one of those -little</li>
            <li> a very small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a little over a week</li>
            <li> I was told this would probably make me get wrinkles younger or worse than typical people.</li>
            <li> Her skin feels smoother and the lines seems to diminish a little everyday.</li>
            <li> My jar is almost empty so, time for a reorder!!!</li>
            <li> My forehead gets dry and extremely itchy, and I am prone to fungal infections behind my ears and on my neck.</li>
            <li> Creamy moisturizer that absorbs into your skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy.  </li>
            <li> I put it on a few times a day.</li>
            <li> After massaging it into my skin it didn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> I was using moisturizer to help with this issue, but it didn’t seem to work longer than a few hours.</li>
            <li> It doesn’t leave my skin feeling heavy or sticky</li>
            <li> just started using this  a few days ago</li>
            <li> nights).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a heavy cream</li>
            <li> I dislike heavy lotions and creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using the product for a couple of days, my face broke out with a few pimples, I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> It takes a few minutes to soak in but when it does you will start seeing and feeling the results in just a few uses.  </li>
            <li> No results seen after using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I feel hydrated without any heavy feeling or grease.</li>
            <li> No strong scent either.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t heavy like some moisturizers I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> This sinks into the skin within a few seconds without leaving any residue behind.  </li>
            <li> The cream is a little bit thick</li>
            <li> I &#x27;m pretty disappointed because the reviews sold me on this cream.</li>
            <li> So thick that I admit I was worried it would feel heavy on my mom&#x27;s skin or make her pores feel clogged</li>
            <li> I have been using this anti-wrinkle on my creases for the past two weeks.</li>
            <li> Moreover, I don&#x27;t have any problems of using this moisturizing cream together with the usual make-up products I use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Results just don&#x27;t happen overnight, give it a few weeks an see the results!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cream liberally under my eyes, cheeks and forehead for the past month-ish</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like a heavy moisturizer and with Anavita I found what I had been wanting for years!</li>
            <li> Of course, this will not happen in few days, so be patient!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather small compared to what I&#x27;m used to and</li>
            <li> so I can compare to past purchases.  </li>
            <li> Have you noticed that expensive brands they generally do not do it?</li>
            <li> I have the bad sun damaged skin to show for it too, along with the normal aging.  </li>
            <li> cream is very thick and has a slight peppermint/vanilla type of smell.</li>
            <li> cream is very thick and has a slight peppermint/vanilla type of smell.</li>
            <li> A Little too thick!</li>
            <li> Finally, near the end, the cream gets drier and even thicker, making it almost impossible to use.  </li>
            <li> I am not here to blow smoke up your butt, and I could personally care less if I give a company a bad review</li>
            <li> Hard to apply evenly..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing without feeling in the least bit greasy.</li>
            <li> This cream is thick but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Thick and ineffective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really thick.</li>
            <li> Though thick, it feels lightweight.</li>
            <li> The cream is thick and emollient.</li>
            <li> It is thick so</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel thick or greasy on my skin.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer looks like it might be too thick and greasy.  </li>
            <li> Very expensive for what it actually delivers, I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> The impact may be subtle at first.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The impact may be subtle at first.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am one of the few who can&#x27;t use this.  </li>
            <li> I was sad to see it go because there are times during harsh winter months</li>
            <li> I hate admitting it, but I am not the young cluck-a-doodle I use to be.</li>
            <li> Very thick and hydrating.  </li>
            <li> This cream is very thick.</li>
            <li> just used for a few days and am sold on this product!!!  </li>
            <li> I hate several step rituals and this is just twice a day...</li>
            <li> I am maybe dehydrated, over tired..</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any redness or breaking out</li>
            <li> Though I hate to admit it, since I hit my 30s, the potential development of wrinkles has moved to the forefront and that means anti-wrinkle cream has as well.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised that this didn&#x27;t contain any nasty ingredients.  </li>
            <li> The jar was very heavy and seemed to be a very expensive looking product.</li>
            <li> it’s just weird.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical on &amp;#34;wrinkle&amp;#34; cream because of the &amp;#34;overnight&amp;#34; results.</li>
            <li> Mediocre.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s smell is a bit weird.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have noticed signs of aging this year.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have it on for 5 minutes and it made my face itch like crazy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product 2 1/2 weeks now and was afraid to leave this review so soon after purchase.</li>
            <li> Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Aging Wrinkle Cream reminds me of the cold cream</li>
            <li> I was afraid that it was going to be oily when I opened it up.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using it, the weird flakey dryness under my eyes has disappeared!    </li>
            <li> It was not and is still not an unpleasant tingling.  </li>
            <li> It gets so bad that my skin get itchy and flaky.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in product....</li>
            <li> So I would say it was not what I was expecting :((((</li>
            <li> and I hate anything that feels greasy or irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> anti wrinkle cream, moisturizer, day cream, night cream, makeup base</li>
            <li> , you no longer have to buy a collection of products to fight the signs of aging since Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream serves as a moisturizer, day cream, night cream, and makeup base.</li>
            <li> I wear makeup before apply the cream in the morning, because it works like makeup base.</li>
            <li> it made my face feel awful.</li>
            <li> and I am so disappointed, this cream does not absorb at all!!  </li>
            <li> MY FACE AND NECK BROKE OUT IN A HORRIBLE RASH.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like it but didn&#x27;t really notice a difference other than it moisturizes your face.</li>
            <li> I found this moisturizer to dry my face out, I had to buy another moisturizer to supplement this moisturizer. I haven&#x27;t seen a change on my face in regards to wrinkles or fine lines. I &#x27;m pretty disappointed because the reviews sold me on this cream.</li>
            <li> Anavita says you can have more beautiful, smoother skin in just 2 to 4 weeks and see continuing improvement for 12 weeks. So I am putting it to the test, been using it for about three weeks now and I have noticed a big chance in the way my face looks. More smoother and radiant looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer anti aging cream can be used on all skin types. Although it works on normal, dry, oily, and sensitive skin it is gentle, no irritating cream. Watching the things I do put on my face, because I do not want to break out and get blotches. You will quickly reduce fine lines and deep wrinkles, firming and replenishing your skin to look noticeably younger, without needing expensive procedures like Botox or dermal fillers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;t come is an easy to open jar. The consistency is on the thicker side. The cream is white but smooths very easily into my skin and has a silky feel when applying, has a slight scent to it nothing over powering. This is great because it is a day and night cream moisturizer so there’s no need to use two of them.</li>
            <li> Not only did it work well, but it wasn&#x27;t greasy at all. There was no remaining residue on my skin, nor was it sticky while drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for fine lines and wrinkles, this moisturizer is gentle on skin so it is good for all skin types. I didn&#x27;t have any breakout issues using it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this cream! It has a very pleasant scent and makes my skin both look and feel great. It isn&#x27;t greasy and is very easy to use. I put in on once in the morning and once in the evening after washing my face. After just a few days of use I already noticed a difference in my skin - it is feeling softer and smoother and has a nice healthy glow to it. I have sensitive skin and often find that moisturizers and creams will irritate my skin, but I have had zero problems with the Anavita cream. It&#x27;s a great product for any skin type and you will love the results!</li>
            <li> I loved this cream! I received this cream for review and I am writing my honest opinion on it. I have used this cream for a month now and I have loved it! It has brought a glow to my face and smoothed out my scars I had from having pimples when I was younger. I did have a few pimples that came out when I first started using it but they went away by the second week and now I have not broken out at all. This cream is a little thicker than my normal moisturizer but it absorbed faster than my usual one. I also loved the scent of this cream. I can&#x27;t quite explain what the scent is but I do like it. I even recommended this cream to my mom to try it. Not all skin will react in the same way so it may not have the same results for you but for me it improved the quality of my skin and for that reason I will give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I was hyped and decided to try it.  It´s a good moisturizer....not the best....All the claims about Matrixyl I´m no dermatologist but it´s the second time I try something with it and I don´t really feel any tingling or even slight change in my face as I do with Retinol...I´m a certified makeup artist and have worked for big brands so I´m used to try high-end products like La Prairie (which is CACA by the way) or not so expensive like Shiseido who actually invests in their formulas or Sisley which is more expensive but TOP....for the price of this cream I feel it´s an ok moisturizer...I don´t like greesy feeling but I do like the rubbery feel of well moisturized skin, wether I combine it with my Vit C serum, Retinol or alone this moisturizer leaves my skin a bit dry a bit too soon...My skin is quite sensitive and it hasn´t reacted one bit, so far one month and I´m really keen on my skincare so I would say my review is pretty objective, unbiased and serious...so if you´re about 25 to 32 without big skin issues this is a moisturizer that will do the job without irritating and for a good value but don´t expect any radical changes.</li>
            <li> Creamy moisturizer that absorbs into your skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy.  I have used it twice a day for 2weeks and skin is softer.  Still waiting for reduced fine lines.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Helps all aging concerns...but can usually get much cheaper on ebay.</li>
            <li> My mother love it very much, She said: it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I am hooked after 4 weeks of using this. Smells great too! I put it on a few times a day.</li>
            <li> This works really well. Can already tell a difference in the firmness of my skin!</li>
            <li> great thickness to it for the winter, loving this cream</li>
            <li> I needed a good night cream and I found it. I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and have a dry skin. I live in the north country and winter is hard on my skin. This cream is thick but not greasy. The light flowers fragrance is very fresh and relaxing. I like to have my skin protected even at night because the heat in the house dehydrates my skin, so I really like the way it let the skin. It is absorbed very well by it and I apply the cream on my neck too. I use rose water in the morning to remove and apply my day cream. The texture is really interesting. It&#x27;s important that a cream that comes in a jar, not in a tube, be thick enough so we don&#x27;t have to dip our finger twice to avoid contamination, mostly if we keep our cosmetics in the bathroom. I recommend it if you have a dry skin.</li>
            <li> Although I have only used this for a couple of weeks, it makes my skin feel smooth and the fine lines seem to be a bit less. I will continue to use it and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> *I did receive this product free to review but all the opinion are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt; I was forcibly pushed into Club 40 this year. Just wait you younger people it will sneak up on you faster than you think. I don’t think in my brain that I am 40 it’s just weird. Moving right along, when I saw the opportunity to review the beautiful Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream I thought why not jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;I received it a couple weeks ago and have been using it every since. It comes in this beautiful container. I’m not sure if you can tell by this picture just how rich and creamy this moisturizer is. It is thick more like a tub of butter. I love the consistency of it and how smoothly it goes on. The moisturizer does have a light fragrance to it but nothing that was too powerful. I haven’t been using it very long yet but I can say that is makes my face feel amazing. My skin feels smoother and I think it has helped soften some fine lines I have started to see around and under my eyes. I was a contact wearer from the time I was 12 until I was around 33. I have to take out my contacts every night and put them in again every morning. I was told this would probably make me get wrinkles younger or worse than typical people. I hope that having the laser eye surgery and not wearing them since I was 33 will help reverse that along with good products like this one.</li>
            <li> This first thing I noticed about the cream is how thick it was. All it took was a little scoop to go over my entire face. After massaging it into my skin it didn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily. I love that you can use it morning, night and as a makeup base. The best thing is that the cream is paraben free, sulfate free, phthalate free and not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a few weeks I noticed a softness to my skin. My forehead wrinkles were slightly less pronounced and the wrinkles under my eyes looked smoother. I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin looks like after 12 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Please don’t put near your eyes your eyes will water I did and it made my eyes a bit watery.  I loved how my dyhydrated skin now feels better and my skin feels softer as a result of Anavita however I haven’t noticed my wrinkles going away, then again the conversation on my Facebook wall my friends say I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles but I know they are there. I Love how my skin isn&#x27;t reacting badly or breaking out to Anavita. Michigan winter has started all ready and I wait for my daughter to get on and off the bus the wind has made some red patches on my skin last winter this winter the Anavita moisturizing Anti Wrinkle Cream has really help improve the softness of my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Love this cream. The packaging is designed very nicely - metal container. It has a light scent and the cream glides on smoothly. My skin feels hydrated and not greasy or oily like the cream my doctor prescribed for me. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times. I like it so far. Very creamy but absorbs fast. Definitely makes my skin dewy. Not sure I i would use it in the summer, but it&#x27;s great to combat the dry skin I get in the winter.</li>
            <li> I love this Anti wrinkle Cream. The jar arrived a little banged up but other then that the cream feels so good on my face. Looking forward to see results within 4 to 12 weeks like it says on the description.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and texture of this cream!  I use it at night and my skin feels so amazing in the morning.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff. I have been using this in combo with my vitamin c serum and hyaluronic acid serum after I run my dermal roller and achieving some very noticeable results. So I can&#x27;t say that this alone has been the only thing. I do believe that I have found my combination that works great for my skin. I use OZ, Obagi and this.</li>
            <li> I got to use the new Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream for Face, Neck &amp; Body, through Brandbacker to try out and give my opinion.  I hadn&#x27;t ever heard of the company before, but doing some research, there were a lot of people impressed with their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just turned 40, so I&#x27;m already trying to do what I can to help my skin not to wrinkle too much and try and mainly keep it healthy.  I&#x27;m not one that is even interested in surgery or crazy things like that, so products like this are really something that I love to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product contains Hyaluronic Acid, Matrixyl and Argireline which are proven to help with your skin.  It also is labeled to not contain drying alcohol - which, I think is great!  So many products that you see out there on the market, tell you they will help with wrinkles, however with the alcohol, they dry your skin out so bad, you kind of wish you had the wrinkles back. :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this so far for about a week, and am noticing a bit of a difference near my eyes and even my forehead.  It&#x27;s very easy to put on, and I just make it a habit to put it on after I shower in the evening, as well as in the morning after I wash my face and get ready to put my makeup on.  I&#x27;m very happy with all that it does and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like this cream. It is light, smells good, and doesn&#x27;t make my face oily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know this cream is actually doing what was stated it would do.  I honestly cannot say I see any results at all but maybe it has not been a long enough time yet as there are deep wrinkles and laxity.  I&#x27;m discouraged - any tips?</li>
            <li> Works great, and I don&#x27;t even breakout.</li>
            <li> Thick and ineffective. Does not soak into the skin and leaves a greasy, shiny residue which needs&lt;br /&gt;to be blotted with a towel to remove.&lt;br /&gt;It also clogs my pours, which causes blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;No noticeable effects (except a few red pimples) when used as directed. So it&#x27;s not a total waste, I am using it as a hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try CeraVe AM/PM facial moisturizers instead. Much cheaper, and they work for me.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  It works great.  I just wish there was more in the jar because it goes very quickly.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Highly recommended! My face feels better each day! And my skin is glowing :)</li>
            <li> This is a great product I bought it for my mother and she loves it and has already asked where I bought it so she can buy more, she is a skin care &amp;#34;freak&amp;#34; lol and always uses the most expensive products I will be buying her more</li>
            <li> Works great, its a little too thick for my taste though.</li>
            <li> Good quality product.</li>
            <li> I honestly think there is a marked difference in my skin for the better.  I will continue to use this product.  And the seller has been great, with emails offering support should I have a problem.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, you may be ok. There is an ingredient that I cannot use after long searching for anti wrinkle cream.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have it on for 5 minutes and it made my face itch like crazy. So now I am back on Avon after know what the ingredient was that was causing the problem. I may look again.</li>
            <li> For my wife and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> This cream is not like Revival Cream.  It does not take care of my skin and leaves a greasy residue.  Sorry&lt;br /&gt;RJBELL</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this stuff and the price was right.  It&#x27;s marketed well and has a lot of good reviews.  I used it for about 8-9 days and it was starting to cause little breakouts and making razor rash worse, normally I don&#x27;t have these problems.  The high end products seem to be the only ones that don&#x27;t cause me any issues. I don&#x27;t recommend this to those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Have used product for 2 weeks. My skin feels good and seems to have enough moisture. Haven&#x27;t noticed a lot of change yet as I was using good products beforehand. Will definitely use for 3 months to see results before deciding to continue . Would recommend that some one try this product. Have used with a vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> Wanted to love it. Geat ingredients. It lasts roughtly two to three weeks.</li>
            <li> Simply wonderful for my skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thicker than expected, too early to say how my skin will react.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about the Anativa Moisturizing cream is the scent. It has a slight peppermint scent and smells really light and fresh. It&#x27;s also really thick. So thick that I admit I was worried it would feel heavy on my mom&#x27;s skin or make her pores feel clogged but I&#x27;m happy to say that it didn&#x27;t. It absorbs into the skin nicely and leaves no heavy feeling at all. I immediately noticed a softness to her skin and it took such a small amount to cover her entire face that I can tell this jar would last a long time. I&#x27;ve been using this on her for about a two weeks now and I am starting to see a difference. She still has some deep fine lines around her lips but they seem to be diminishing and normally  she has issues with oiliness in some areas and dryness in others and that has completely worked itself out. Her skin feels much softer too and has a smoother appearance and more even tone with a lot less redness. You can really tell the difference when you apply foundation over it. The foundation goes on much smoother and more evenly without settling into the fine lines. I can only hope that the results keep coming. I am happy with how nice her skin feels and the benefits I can already see. My mom is in her early 50&#x27;s and she has been a little down on herslef because she doesn&#x27;t look as young as she used to. I try to help her with this as much as possible and I like to keep her up to date on all the new creams that could help with her wrinkles and fine lines. We don&#x27;t believe in surgery so It&#x27;s like a fun challenge to find the best. My mother is always beautiful in my eyes but I want her to feel beautiful to herself no matter what. I would definently say this is one of the best we have used. She and I both would absolutely recommend Anativa Moisturizing Cream. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. So happy with this purchase. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Purchased for review... Feels great.</li>
            <li> clean feeling will have to wait and see if it helps wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month.  So far I&#x27;m pleased with the results, my skin seems smoother and less blotchy.  I do have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve not had any irritation with this either.</li>
            <li> I loved this so much that I ordered it a second time (rare for me). It&#x27;s moisturizing without feeling in the least bit greasy. My skin looks better using this than before, which I have never said about a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I used this for a week before I realized it was doing significant damage to my skin. This moisturizer caused me to break out in cysts that lasted over a month, and caused significant residual scarring. I am not sure why, or what ingredient caused this, but definitely a HUGE mistake.</li>
            <li> I personally have had an issue with dryness lately. I have combination skin, but my chin gets extremely dry. It gets so bad that my skin get itchy and flaky. I was using moisturizer to help with this issue, but it didn’t seem to work longer than a few hours. I figured that I needed something a bit more advanced to take care of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream seemed to do the trick! After using it for a week, I noticed that my chin wasn’t as dry as it was before! I have now used it for a few weeks and my chin isn’t dry at all. In fact, my entire face looks refreshed! It feels so nice and soft now. This cream is the perfect consistency – not too thick or too thin. I take a nickel size amount and rub it all over my face each morning. I have even skipped days and my skin stay moisturized. What I love about this cream is that it seems to heal my skin rather then “cover up” the issues for a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as you can tell by the name it’s meant to diminish the appearance of wrinkles. I don’t really have wrinkles, but I could definitely see how it would work because of how well it replenishes my skin. It doesn’t have an amazing smell, but it isn’t a bad smell either. It’s quite nice actually! It doesn’t leave my skin feeling heavy or sticky either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am really impressed with this cream. It has replaced my old moisturizer and the anti-aging aspect is a great bonus! I’d recommend this for any skin type, especially for dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample to share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> It worked! Today is the 30th day and my face looks incredible. I keep getting compliments, buy it it works!</li>
            <li> smells weird and feel like a cheap lotion, I won&#x27;t use it on my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product 2 1/2 weeks now and was afraid to leave this review so soon after purchase. So far I&#x27;ve been pleased with the product and the results. I&#x27;m always skeptical on &amp;#34;wrinkle&amp;#34; cream because of the &amp;#34;overnight&amp;#34; results. How can something work &amp;#34;overnight&amp;#34;  to fix a problem that took years to get in that condition? Yes, I have seen change in my skin and yes, I will say it does do the job.... Maybe not &amp;#34;overnight&amp;#34; but I have results in 2 1/2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Smells great and makes my skin feel silky smooth. High quality product. Definitely recommend this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> This cream is so smooth and feels so good on me.  I use it morning and night, and at 71 my friends say how beautiful my skin is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you .</li>
            <li> The product had a wonderful smell that I noticed as soon as I opened it up. It kind of reminds me of the smell of bubble gum which I didn&#x27;t mind at all. It made it that much more pleasant to use. It worked well keeping my face moisturized and I believe it did work on some of the minor lines I had in my face.</li>
            <li> I took this to remove wrinkles around eyes and forehead, did nothing. I even used it twice a day sometimes. It did make face smooth but the Earth Science products are way cheaper and work better.</li>
            <li> Best product that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I can definitely see a change. My wrinkles are alot less noticeable and My face seems alot smoother.</li>
            <li> just started using this  a few days ago</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in product....can&#x27;t see any difference after a month of using as directed. Not expecting miracle but was expecting some slight difference.</li>
            <li> I was selected to try and this cream for testing purposes in return for my unbiased opinion. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a week now and love it! I have oily skin, and it doesn&#x27;t make it super oily by the end of the day. This surprised me because the cream is so rich and thick, I thought my face would be greasier than a pizza by days end. That is not the case! Not only is the cream is rich, it has a nice light scent. I definitely feel like it&#x27;s smoothing my skin, not that I have many wrinkles to deal with. But I&#x27;m all about preventative measures!</li>
            <li> I really like this&lt;br /&gt;I can feel my skin improve&lt;br /&gt;Wrinkles less apparent</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and it has quickly become my new favorite face cream. It&#x27;s silky and no heavy. Feels great on my face.</li>
            <li> This cream works very well.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I will ordered again.</li>
            <li> It is the best cream I have used yet!!!!!!</li>
            <li> felt amazed when I read the reviews. doesnt reach my expectation. still having dry skin despite of the price tht I had paid. but may work for other ppl.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cream!  I have very sensitive skin and tend to break out often, even though I&#x27;m now in my 40s.  This is the first cream I&#x27;ve ever used that does not irritate my skin nor cause me to break out.  I have been using it for 3 months now and I just love how it leaves my skin so smooth and soft.  I will most definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I am on a constant quest to finding great skin care products as I have noticed some new wrinkles around my eyes. I have been using this anti-wrinkle on my creases for the past two weeks. I have a struggles with oily skin and this product doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy on my face (I use it after washing my makeup off with sulfur soap). I love that this product gives me just enough moisture for my skin. Though thick, it feels lightweight. I am yet to notice any difference in wrinkles/fine lines but it typically takes several weeks to see a visible difference so I plan on giving this cream 1 - 2 months before I come to a verdict. If this product does what it promised, then it will be a must-have!</li>
            <li> Only use once a day for two weeks. Skin definitely looks better.</li>
            <li> This cream is the cadillac of anti wrinkle creams. Not only does it smell amazing, but it is so lush and leaves your face feeling SO soft. I really enjoy this cream and use it everyday. I have sensitive skin, and I wake up every morning touching my face and smiling!  Since I&#x27;ve been using it, the weird flakey dryness under my eyes has disappeared!    I wrote a full review on my blog:  (...)    I was sent this product to review, but my opinions are my own!</li>
            <li> I am a man.  Following paralysis  on the left side of my face,  I use Anavita at 3 places  there to diminish the ugliness  of the  areas  where paralysis  produced lasting effects.  Very satisfied with the results..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now used the entire container of this product. It&#x27;s very nice, and I saw no issues with clogged pores or breakouts which is always a plus in my book! The only issue for me is the price, it didn&#x27;t work any better or seem fancier than the major brands at the big box stores.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream via a special promotion.  It is very rich and moisturizing.  I have very sensitive skin, and it caused no problems for me.  I&#x27;ve just started using it and am anticipating it being helpful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizing cream but I haven&#x27;t seen the anti-wrinkle effects after one month of use (mornings and nights).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a heavy cream so I would only use it in winter. Also it doesn&#x27;t spread easily so you definitely need more than a pea size portion to cover your face, I would say that you need at least 3 to 4 times that (so it doesn&#x27;t last very long...). Very expensive for what it actually delivers, I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> this product did nothing for me,,,,,</li>
            <li> We received the product today. The packaging was great. The cream is thick and emollient. This is suited as a night cream. Love it!</li>
            <li> So far so good. My skin looks and feels refreshed, smoother and it does not leave an oily layer on the skin. I have only used it for 5 days and I Love It!  I will recommend it, and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Mediocre. That&#x27;s all there is to say. My skin was probably better off with it, but there are better choices for this price range that have made my face exceptional. This one did not clog my pores and I didnt have any breakouts while on it. The smell was pleasant. The results after 2 months were just &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream.  It has a pleasing, generic scent, not perfumey, and a little goes a long way.  Absorbs quickly.  While I have only been using it for a few weeks now, I have already noticed that my skin is smother and has a more even surface.  And the many small surface bumps I have across my lower face are much less noticeable.  Wrinkles are still there, but it might take a miracle to have them gone, since I am 66!!  Can&#x27;t wait to see what 6 mos. of use will do!  Highly recommend this cream.  I have very sensitive skin, and this has been terrific for me.</li>
            <li> I always have my eye out for effective skin care products, and this one works well for me. Occasionally, I use aa HA serum in the eye area before applying this cream -- just for little more plumping. This cream is absorbed readily into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily film or slippery feel.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I have been suffering for several years with atopic dermatitus. My forehead gets dry and extremely itchy, and I am prone to fungal infections behind my ears and on my neck. As far as the latter, my dermatologist said that my skin barrier wasn&#x27;t working as it should. I recently went through allergy patch testing and now know what hair care products that I&#x27;m allergic to.I avoid those products to which I am allergic, and use this cream. I don&#x27;t know if this cream has any long-lasting effects, but it does everything it promises and does it well. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot ... just apply it to the areas with wrinkles and prepare to be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizing, but it&#x27;s smell is a bit weird.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am one of the few who can&#x27;t use this.  I started using it and the next day I noticed my skin felt dry and rough.  I used it for 2 more days and had to stop because my cheeks turned bright red and I broke out in a rash on my face.  My face is really itchy now.  I haven&#x27;t used it for 2 days and the rash is still there.  How do I get my money back?</li>
            <li> My age is 71 years; so my wrinkles are deep.  It is a good moisturizer.  Don&#x27;t know that there is a noticeable improvement; but my skin feels better.  I will buy it again.  It is convenient to use as it is effective for night and day application.  It leaves a nice base for foundation makeup.</li>
            <li> Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream is heaven sent to me to combat my skin problems like oiliness and break outs since it is non-greasy. Moreover, I don&#x27;t have any problems of using this moisturizing cream together with the usual make-up products I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another best thing about this product is that I can use it as day and night moisturizer. Thus, there&#x27;s no need to buy a separate moisturizing cream specifically for a certain time of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love most is that this moisturizing cream leaves my skin soft and smooth to touch. My sister whom I shared the product with notice the same thing plus I can see a youthful glow in her skin. My nieces also notice the improvement of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream claimed that it will help reduce fine lines. Since I&#x27;ve used it for two weeks only, I couldn&#x27;t attest to this claim. Hopefully in four weeks I can see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received the below mentioned complimentary product for the purpose of this review. All opinions are 100% my own. I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was recently sent a jar of Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream to review. Like all women my age, wrinkles are starting to form. I sometimes look into the mirror and think who is that over the hill middle age woman who is standing in my bathroom looking at herself in my mirror? Where is the young-looking smooth skin woman I once was?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well according to Anavita when you can say goodbye to wrinkled, sagging, dry skin in just a few short weeks.You can have more beautiful, smoother skin in just 2 to 4 weeks and see continuing improvement for 12 weeks (sometimes even sooner).You will quickly reduce the look of fine lines and deep wrinkles, firming and replenishing your skin to look noticeably younger, without needing expensive procedures like Botox or dermal fillers. Ok, now they have my attention. I want these lines and wrinkles to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning I decided to start the day off with the beginning of the new me. Well, not the new me, but the younger looking me. I washed my face with my normal cleanser that I have been using for years. I then softly towel dried my face and applied the Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream as directed by placing a pearl-sized dollop ( a little goes a long way ) on a finger and dab the cream around my face and neck.I then massaged in the cream using gentle upward strokes. It has a pleasant odor and went on smoothly. It wasn&#x27;t heavy like some moisturizers I have tried in the past. Which is a plus I dislike heavy lotions and creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day I simply repeated the process of cleaning my face and massaging the Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream on to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to be honest. I have been using it a little over 3 weeks and my face feels wonderful. It&#x27;s very smooth and soft. However I am just now beginning to noticing a visible effect. A few of the tiny lines are fading but they said the first visible effects should be seen within four weeks with full impact visible in twelve weeks (sometimes even sooner). While some experience rapid results, others find improvement more gradual. Well it took me years to get those wrinkles so its going to take more than over night to get rid of them. I just have to have patience.it a little over 3 weeks and my face feels wonderful. It&#x27;s very smooth and soft. However I am just now beginning to noticing a visible effect.

I just have to have patience.</li>
            <li> Did not like the feeling when applying it.  Also I thought it made my skin feel drier.  Returned it.</li>
            <li> One of the best I have used.  Beats the other high priced anti aging brands which I have  used!  Love it.  I am in my early seventies and will continue to use Anavita, waiting for my second order to arrive.  I have some lines under my chin, and frown line above my nose, and light crows feet. I have used the cream for a month now and whoa and behold they have diminished a lot.  I am waiting for my second order to arrive any day now!  I wish the cream came in a larger size.  Results just don&#x27;t happen overnight, give it a few weeks an see the results!  I put it on in the morning and again at bedtime.  I am  a believer in this product.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. I recevied this to review and I really like the effect it has on my skin.</li>
            <li> So far after a short time skin is not greasy and fine lines less noticeable. Wears smoothly under foundation</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too pasty and rough; would not recommend.</li>
            <li> my face is smoother after first application.</li>
            <li> smells great! a little thick for my liking, so it takes more work than I&#x27;m used to in order to get it spread around, but all in all great product!</li>
            <li> been using it for a few days now and my skin is so much smooth ( looks and touch ) and doesn&#x27;t look so tired.</li>
            <li> I started using this just over a week ago.  I love the texture of the cream, it goes on clean, not sticky or oily.  I have noticed that it absorbs easily, leaving my soft and make-up is easily applied within minutes. I&#x27;m starting to use it on my neck now and am looking forward to continued use!  Denise Gowler</li>
            <li> I love it, doesn&#x27;t take much and goes on evenly.  Not oily and makes my face feel so soft, using on my neck also.  I hate several step rituals and this is just twice a day...wash and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product sooner than it was expected, that was great.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed using this product!  Having oily skin, I&#x27;ve always been reluctant to use a moisturizer except at night.  However, this product easily absorbs and I&#x27;ve not experienced any oily &amp;#34;breakthrough&amp;#34; when used before applying makeup.  I look forward to continued use!</li>
            <li> This is a very rich moisturizer without a oily or greasy feeling. It absorbs quickly and I can put my makeup on right away.&lt;br /&gt;I like the simplicity of using one product for night and day. I am looking forward to seeing the results after longer usage.</li>
            <li> I have just been using this a little while but I have already noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin. It seems a lot softer and looks so much smoother. I am anxious to see how it looks after a few more months of using this. It just takes a little, I think this jar will last a long time! I received this for an honest opinion. I love this!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be moisturizing enough.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo18NQGUOCPRD1O]]I will be doing an ongoing review of Anavita Facial Creme! Here is a google hangout explaining my experience using the creme! I will return in 30 days to report my impressions of the product.</li>
            <li> After using the product for a couple of days, my face broke out with a few pimples, I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! I have many expensive products in my cabinet but I am excited that I am  seeing great results in just a couple of weeks. Fine lines are improving and product is not greasy so I a can immediately apply makeup after using it.</li>
            <li> This cream goes on smoothly with no greasy feeling. The smell is nice too!</li>
            <li> Tried it - really did not see a big difference</li>
            <li> -----------------------&lt;br /&gt;QUICK REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------&lt;br /&gt;This Peptide Cream Contains 3 Clinically Tested Ingredients: Hyaluronic Acid, 5% Argireline, Matrixyl For Superior Anti Aging Effects believe it or not, if you don&#x27;t google them. The formula is rich thick cream is free of unnecessary chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cream liberally under my eyes, cheeks and forehead for the past month-ish and I&#x27;ve actually seen some minor results, which were WAY more than I anticipated if I&#x27;m being completely honest. I have very sensitive facial skin and I hate anything that feels greasy or irritates my skin. The Anavita cream is neither greasy nor has it been harsh on my skin, even for using it daily and liberally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found myself wanting more of this cream and applying it regularly since I have seen some results, very happy so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------&lt;br /&gt;- Aqua&lt;br /&gt;- Cetearyl Alcohol&lt;br /&gt;- Glyceryl Stearate&lt;br /&gt;- PEG-100 Stearate&lt;br /&gt;- Stearic Acid&lt;br /&gt;- Acetyl Hexapeptide-3 (Argireline)&lt;br /&gt;- Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4 (Matrixyl)&lt;br /&gt;- Dimethicone&lt;br /&gt;- Sodium Hyaluronate&lt;br /&gt;- Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;- Phenoxyethanol&lt;br /&gt;- Caprylyl Glycol&lt;br /&gt;- Potassium Sorbate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------&lt;br /&gt;- Proven to stimulate the synthesis of collagen which makes your skin appear years younger &amp; more vibrant&lt;br /&gt;- Firms tissue structure that cause expression lines around the eyes, mouth &amp; forehead&lt;br /&gt;- Evens skin tone&lt;br /&gt;- Multiple uses: anti wrinkle cream, moisturizer, day cream, night cream, makeup base&lt;br /&gt;- Absorbs easily leaving a moisturized, not oily feeling with a light fragrance&lt;br /&gt;- Non-irritating cream helps against free radical damage&lt;br /&gt;- Achieves better results than serums &amp; creams with Vitamin C &amp; Retinol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------&lt;br /&gt;- Satisfaction 100% GUARANTEED&lt;br /&gt;- Not Greasy&lt;br /&gt;- Minor Results are still RESULTS&lt;br /&gt;- Not hard on my sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;- Priced reasonably&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------&lt;br /&gt;- None so far&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest with no bias.-&lt;br /&gt;- Satisfaction 100% GUARANTEED&lt;br /&gt;- Not Greasy&lt;br /&gt;- Minor Results are still RESULTS&lt;br /&gt;- Not hard on my sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;- Priced reasonably&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------&lt;br /&gt;- None so far&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest with no bias.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about four weeks and I love how smooth and soft my skin is now.  It goes on creamy and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or clumpy after it dries/absorbs into my skin.  I would definitely recommend giving this product a try!</li>
            <li> A Little too thick! Hard to apply evenly..</li>
            <li> After one week my skin felt firmer, my tone evened out, and my cheeks had more color.  This cream is a wonderful moisturer without feeling greasy.  Best of all, it saves time.  I use it as a moisturizer morning and night, and it&#x27;s an excellent foundation for makeup.  I am very frugal but consider this worth every penny.  Thumbs and cheeks up!</li>
            <li> I have ordered 2 different creams,  both had great reviews but for me they did not work one said it had same components as this one does and used it for at least 8 months (perfect image) and the second I used it like 2 months (Insta Natural).&lt;br /&gt;This one is thick and gets into your skin fast, does not have that flower smell (I do not like it at all) like the one from prefect image  and honestly it is really working.&lt;br /&gt;My dark spots because of sun damage and pores are vanishing gradually. I am a male, my skin is light brown and oily around my nose.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the morning and at night.&lt;br /&gt;I use a pore cleansing product called Indian Healing clay, first I cleansed my face twice a week at night now it is only once.&lt;br /&gt;It is been only 3 weeks and I am  very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Quality product at a very good price.&lt;br /&gt;Something that I value a lot is that ingredients are listed. Have you noticed that expensive brands they generally do not do it?</li>
            <li> Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Aging Wrinkle Cream reminds me of the cold cream my mother and grandmother used when I was a kid. Thick, creamy, and rich, I was almost worried it would cause me to break out because it is slightly oily but  not only did Anavita not break me out, but left my skin feeling very rejuvenated. Now I do not believe I would use this cream every day or night but I do believe that this would be wonderful in harsh summer and winter months when the skin has been exposed to the elements! I can see this feeling so soothing after being out in the sun all day or especially for me, since I do not spend a great deal of time in the sun, after a day in the harsh winter winds, as that is what my skin is bothered by the most. Also, I absolutely love the shiny packaging of this cream. I am glad I got to try this cream. It is not the type of cream I would generally use but I see the benefits of having a cream like this in my skin care collection! If you love rich, creamy, moisturizers give if a try!&lt;br /&gt;I did get this free to review but if I didn&#x27;t like it I would either not review it at all or let the company know the review was not favorable and allow them to decide if they wanted it published or not. Hence I will never recommend a product that I do not think is worth the price! I did pass this product on to my mother who LOVES rich thick creams, her skin is far drier than my own. She LOVES it! I was sad to see it go because there are times during harsh winter months I will need it but luckily she lives 2 blocks from me - I can always steal it back later! :)</li>
            <li> The Anavita Anti-Wrinkle Cream came in a jar. It has a second seal inside to prevent the cream from accidentally spilling during shipping. The cream inside has a white color and smells really nice. It has a creamy slightly fluffy texture which is a bit like melted butter but cool on the skin when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream can be applied in the morning and evening to cleansed face but or me, I only apply it in the evening before I go to bed. I dab a dot on several spots on my cleansed face to make it easier to spread the cream evenly. It goes on light and absorbs really quickly. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and doesn&#x27;t cause me any clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I noticed was that that the cream is a bit too fragrant when applied on the skin. It smells great from the jar but when applied to my face, it smells a bit too fragrant for the first couple of minutes. The fragrance does mellow after a couple of minutes so it&#x27;s tolerable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does say that it takes 4 weeks to see results and I&#x27;ve just been using this for almost a week. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet so I can&#x27;t comment on the anti-wrinkle effect. I do like that it&#x27;s an effective moisturizer though.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizure. It is thicker than I expected but it is light enough to wear in the daytime because it isn&#x27;t greasy at all. It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent but is pleasant overall.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this cream it was so thick I could barely massage it into my skin. That seems to be a bit better now. Don&#x27;t like that it feels sticky but it does dry/absorb quickly. No greasy feeling. Haven&#x27;t used long enough to notice difference in any wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Feels and smells great.</li>
            <li> While it says full results in 8-12 weeks, I don&#x27;t want to wait two months to leave a review. I like the thicker feeling of this cream. It feels more like Shea butter than the thin feeling of other night creams I&#x27;ve tried. It also feels great on my skin and has a nice barely there smell that isn&#x27;t overwhelming or anything that would bother people who can&#x27;t stand smelly products. I will definitely keep on using this twice a day.</li>
            <li> What can I expect?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer lists that it will take 2-4 weeks to start noticing a change, and that 12 weeks will show &amp;#34;continuing improvement for 12 weeks (sometimes even sooner).&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you that I don&#x27;t usually get that kind of timeline for a product review for my blog, and really, even if I did I couldn&#x27;t always take that time.. I have a lot of reviews to do! I want to give each product a good test, and won&#x27;t report until I have a good idea of an opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually started to notice an improvement in my skin within a day or 2 of using this! I am maybe dehydrated, over tired.. I don&#x27;t know, but I am always this way.. and the cream improved my skin tone. It looked plumper than usual, and pretty quickly in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall- I am very pleased with the way my skin looks with this product!</li>
            <li> I can see less wrinkles on my face after a few days of using it.  And it is no greasy or heavy, smells wonderful too.</li>
            <li> The cream is a little bit thick but it&#x27;s very moisturizing. I use at bedtime on my face. It moisturizes&lt;br /&gt;and pampers my skin without any oily residue.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this nice product. I like it and I don&#x27;t like it. Sometimes something very good has negative aspects to it that are really just personal preferences and I think that is the cause of my ambience with the Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautifully package, the product is a bit dense and &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; feeling on my fingertips and when applied to my face. And thick sometimes clogs pore and no one wants that problem. But after it absorbs, the skin feels nice. In fact, after using it several days, I really like the way my skin feels in the mornings when I wake up. It is soft and looks pretty good. And no clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can recommend this product because I see it as beneficial and probably a good anti-wrinkle cream because it aids in protecting the skin and moisturizing it.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and although this cream was good at the beginning but then after a while it started giving me breakouts. Any how I didn&#x27;t want to give up since it was claimed this cream has Matrixyl and I really wanted to give it a try and couldn&#x27;t wait to see some positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for almost 3 month, 2-3 times per day. I don&#x27;t have visible wrinkles yet except for a very tiny fine line that I noticed between my eyebrows couple of months ago. however I don&#x27;t see any changes to it. So I am wondering if this cream couldn&#x27;t fix such a small fine line whiten 3 months how it is going to help with deep wrinkles and lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that I am disappointed about is that the first time I received the product it was with a plastic seal around the jar but the last time that I received the cream it didn&#x27;t have that. So basically this cream jar doesn&#x27;t have a box neither plastic seal. So there is no way you would know if this is unused or original. I have stopped using this cream and I think it is overrated and it seams most of the people gave this cream high ratings received it for free and didn&#x27;t use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> well as they wrote to me, saying I have not had this long enough to give it a glowing review, I think I have, I have not seen any difference and NO I won&#x27;t order more of this I am using it on my feet for now. it made my face feel awful.</li>
            <li> I am so surprised that after just a few days use I&#x27;m already seeing reduced visibility of fine lines and wrinkles, most noticeably on my upper lip line. I&#x27;ve used several other anti wrinkle creams for much longer periods and never experienced the results I&#x27;ve seen with this in just a few days of use. Pleasantly surprised and VERY impressed with this product, just had to write a review, you&#x27;ve earned it - I am delighted!</li>
            <li> Wow...so far so good! Smells lovely.  feelsLuxurious.  just used for a few days and am sold on this product!!!  As a former Ford model....im very picky about what I use on my face and I love Anavita!</li>
            <li> I just got this product and haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it that long, but so far it seems to be a great moisturizing cream. I also like the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy. I don&#x27;t like moisturizers that are greasy! What else is nice is you only have to use just a tiny dab here and there, a little goes a long way. It does make my face feel smooth and soft and seems not to show those fine lines under my eyes as much. I have noticed a difference in the appearance of my face already, so I&#x27;m sure after continuing to use it for awhile I will continue to see even more results. So far so good and I give it 5 stars because if it works this good this fast then it can only get better with time. It takes time to let the face creams do there job, so I will update this product again in another 4 weeks. :)</li>
            <li> I don’t have deep wrinkles, but it’s made for any skin type, so I’ll comment on what this does for my small wrinkles and the overall texture/condition of my skin. This is a thick, luxurious cream, exactly what I love to use at night. But you can also wear it in the day or under makeup. It’s very thick, so a tiny, tiny bit goes a long way. It has some great ingredients in it, no parabens or harmful drying ingredients, and it can produce visible results in 4 weeks or less. Obviously, if you use it two times a day, it will work more quickly than the once a day regimen I’m on. But what it has done for my skin is great. When my skin is very dry, finnicky, or tight, I use this at night and it’s back to normal the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This leaves my skin ultra soft and smooth immediately after use. It doesn’t have a strong scent, but what is there is nice. The silver packaging is nice and makes it very easy for me to find this in my bathroom cabinet. No complaints at all, just a really nice, moisturizing cream with benefits. Love it.</li>
            <li> I like this product. No skin breakouts ,goes on easily yet is a cream ,can be used day or night and no oily residue. I wear it under tinted sunscreen .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t day how it would be under foundation.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see younger skin so I will give only 4 .  Would recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with finding the right moisturizer for my face for many years.&lt;br /&gt;My forehead would look ashy, my nose would feel oily, andy cheeks and chin would break out.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it everyday (twice a day) for the past few weeks and absolutely love it! It has even improved my acne prone areas!&lt;br /&gt;It is light and can be worn under makeup. It has a light scent that is rather pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I can really feel a difference in my face when I smile or laugh. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight like it would with other moisturizers that were anti wrinkle.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product for anyone needing the perfect moistirizer.</li>
            <li> Great winter moisturizer because it is thick but absorbs quickly. Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it. Notice the difference after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this!! Will be buying again :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a few weeks, but it is definitely one of the better facial creams I&#x27;ve used over the years.  It applies smoothly and evenly with absolutely no clumping and absorbs quickly into the skin.  The fragrance is very mild, pleasant and hardly noticeable.  My skin feels soft and looks more vibrant and my smile lines appear to have diminished!</li>
            <li> Anavita AntiWrinkle skin cream is probably the closest thing I have ever found to having everything you need.  I love that it is so highly moisturizer that you cannot even begin to touch it with a regular moisture lotion and it has been great to put on after exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;I find that it works well without being too greasy and it absorbs so quickly, and even though I think it feels and works like much more expensive brands, its nice to know that you can get great facial products without them costing you too much money. This cream is paraben free and safe for all skin types, even suitable for men and women.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after reading good reviews I bought this cream and I am so disappointed, this cream does not absorb at all!!  Also the cream is too thick, it hardly runs through your skin and all it did is open my pores tremendously.  I do not recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have only used it 2 weeks so far but my skin seems tighter.  I have not yet seen any improvement with lines but may need to give it more time</li>
            <li> Great product in a small jar!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks and love it! I love the texture and thickness !</li>
            <li> This cream is so thick and heavy, it will last you 2 weeks max  if you use it as directed. Based on this, the cream is overpriced.</li>
            <li> I just began using this cream and love it already.  The consistency is very good.  It applies easily - not too light or thick.  It seems to have a matte finish after applying which I really like.  I usually just wear a bit of blush and using this cream first made the blush work better.  This one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> I see some difference but not much more than if I use some of my other moisturizers. It was a good price.</li>
            <li> Wow...in 2 weeks the wrinkles around my eyes R almost gone! Yes,yes,YES !!! Thank you ANAVITA.</li>
            <li> Nice face cream thick and smooth .applies well and absorbs well. No strong scent either.I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best creams I have tried in the last ten years.  I have started to use products with Matrixyl because I feel that is the very best ingredient out there.  There are many out there; but it is hard to beat Anavita&#x27;s price and quality.</li>
            <li> It moisturize and have my skin a nice glow but did absolutely nothing for fine line and wrinkles. Will be once again looking for another product.</li>
            <li> I am 63, and have some wrinkles.  This stuff is the best I have ever tried and I have tried  many.  After only using a few days I see a big difference.  I  will be looking forward to increased benefits with longer use!</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome! I have been using it for several weeks and notice a pretty good reduction in the deep wrinkles on my decollatage, neck and forehead. I can also see that my laugh lines are minimized. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It has lived up to it&#x27;s claims.  I saw results in a few days and feel the lines diminish quite a bit after several weeks.  Will definetly buy again.</li>
            <li> Results are starting to become visable with every use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream on my face for a few weeks and love it. This thick and creamy white cream, has a light pleasant fragrance, and was easy to apply, my skin stayed moisturized for hours after use and feels smoother. Anavita is a great multi purpose cream, it can be used as: a moisturizer, day cream, night cream, and/or makeup base.</li>
            <li> The product did arrive on time and in good conditions i have been using it for more than 45 days with no results, actually I have very few fine lines but they are excatly the same as they were 45 days ago  Now it is very important to mention that a few pimples appear under my chin So I would say it was not what I was expecting :((((</li>
            <li> Peptides and lots of other goodies in this cream.  Very thick and hydrating.  I buy this for one of my nail clients who has very wrinkled skin,  she LOVES it.  She has started seeing lines get less noticeable.  It has a nice light fraqrance, not overpowering.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love how it absorbs into my skin &amp; makes my face look healthy! And radiant too!!!  Definitely will order again</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with this product.  This cream is very thick and difficult to smooth on your face.  In addition, when you get near the bottom of it, the jar is designed in such a way that a lot of the cream is hidden in creases near the bottom of the jar, making it difficult to get it all out.  Finally, near the end, the cream gets drier and even thicker, making it almost impossible to use.  I gave the product two stars, because it does seem to moisturize fairly well, it&#x27;s just the application of the product which leaves so much to be desired.  I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Love this wrinkle cream, I doubt that it has made any difference but It really feels good on the face and neck line...I will be purchasing again in the future...</li>
            <li> I bought 2 more jars it works very well.</li>
            <li> I was optimistic, as it made my skin feel silky smooth when I put it on.  But then I noticed after using it for a couple of weeks that my skin is incredibly dry and flaky.  Yuck.  Back to Hope in a Jar I go!</li>
            <li> RETURNED THIS PRODUCT. MY FACE AND NECK BROKE OUT IN A HORRIBLE RASH. TOOK A WEEK TO CLEAR IT UP. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.</li>
            <li> Great gift for the mother in law</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this moisturizing wrinkle cream for face and neck.  The creme is super absorbent with no greasyness.  It has a great light feeling on your face and neck.  I can&#x27;t afford botox treatments and this is the next best thing.  I apply it in the morning and evening.  Just apply to my face in a upward motion.  Should see results in about 2-4 weeks.  I can&#x27;t wait.  I am definitely going to keep using.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer: it&#x27;s non-greasy and leaves my face feeling slightly tighter and softer after use. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product a short time, but I can already tell a difference. Great value!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream for almost 2 weeks and I really like it. I just pat a small amount on my face - cheek area and forehead mostly. And blend in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the consistency of this cream. It is a lot thicker than some others I have tried. You don&#x27;t need as much because it goes on really nicely. It is not greasy or liquidy at all. It goes on smoothly by gently rubbing on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream has a light citrus fragrance appealing to both men and women, but no heavy perfume smell. The Anavita cream is also nice because it can eliminate several steps in your daily regimen by serving as a day cream, night cream, wrinkle cream and makeup base!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it&#x27;s from using this but  2 times, recently,  I had to show my ID for my age and the people were surprised about my age. I am 46 and I think they thought I was a lot younger. So I am loving the  Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this and buy again for myself.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I don&#x27;t like having to take extra steps in my skin care routine and all I have to do now is wash and apply this wonderful moisturizer. It feels amazing to the skin. I also don&#x27;t like a heavy moisturizer and with Anavita I found what I had been wanting for years! Congrats on making such a wonderful skin care product!</li>
            <li> I just got this a few weeks ago, and it feels great on my face.  I have noticed a difference already.</li>
            <li> Everything is going great.  I am seeing results without using a large amount of the product.  My skin is looking younger around my eyes.  That has been a blessing considering the extremely stressful month I have had.  Sending my youngest child off to college, starting a new school year as a teacher, and the joys of a root canal gone wrong.  But my skin looks good even if I need a stiff drink.</li>
            <li> its not greasy nor doesn&#x27;t leave any dry cream residue on skin what this cream does it makes skin instantly feel softer and it really improved the deep wrinkles i had on my neck and smoothed out my skin texture and leaves it with a radiant appearance.</li>
            <li> I purchased Anavita anti wrinkle cream about 4 weeks ago and have been using it every day and night since it arrived.  I find it easy to use as it goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and is absorbed into my skin quickly.  I grew up on a farm during a time when sun screen wasn&#x27;t thought of and was in the sun a lot!  I have the bad sun damaged skin to show for it too, along with the normal aging.  After using this product now for a few weeks, I notice a marked difference in the skin tone in my neck and face,  my skin is firmer and tighter and I have noticeably fewer lines and wrinkles.  The color of my skin has improved also, looking more even.  The crows feet around my eyes have diminished as well.  I am VERY happy with the results!</li>
            <li> It seems to work. I use it everyday and I notice the wrinkling is disappearing from my neck.  No breakouts or allergic reactions which I have had with other neck wrinkle  and firming products.</li>
            <li> Have only used this cream for 3 days now, but I already see a difference in my skin tone.  It is light and absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  Very nice!    UPDATE:  After about 4 weeks, this has become my favorite face cream ever!   I see a marked improvement in my skin - more even tone, more luminous, very much younger looking - fine wrinkles have disappeared.    I am about 3/4 way through the jar, and I use it twice a day on face and neck - sometimes also on hands.       I very highly recommend this product for anyone looking to improve the appearance of their skin!</li>
            <li> I am 26 years old, and I always have had the belief in taking care of my skin now, and reaping the benefits 20 years down the road. Thankfully I don&#x27;t have any signs of wrinkles yet at this age, and I like to think that using products such as this on my skin helps me keep my youthful appearance. As this is for your face and neck, I have been strictly using it on my neck since that is one area that I always seem to neglect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a full out daily skincare routine, and for the past 3 weeks I have been using this twice daily. Once before bed and again in the morning. The cream smells lovely, and has a nice texture. I apply this on clean skin, and basically massage it into my skin using upward motions. The idea of the upward motions is to go against gravity. I even bring this down onto my d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;e, again using the upward massaging motions. Within the past 3 weeks I have noticed that my skin on my neck is more visibly tighter, and my skin has never felt so soft and supple. I still have plenty of product left to last me for a good while, and because I have loved the results of this on my neck, I am going to be alternating this with my current facial anti wrinkle cream, and reap some of the benefits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to add in that I have dry sensitive skin, and certain products can negatively react to my skin very easily. I have experienced no irritation at all while using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Not heavy creamy, which I do not like.  Consistency is between serum and cream.  Feels like it is really good for your face and feels firmer after applying.  Have purchased before and will re-order.</li>
            <li> I use at night with c oil works well together</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have noticed signs of aging this year. I have been looking for beauty products to help prevent any further aging signs. I was very fortunate to come across Anavita&#x27;s Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream. The cream came packaged well. I was really impressed with the overall appearance of the jar of cream. The jar was very heavy and seemed to be a very expensive looking product. I like that the cream had a protective cover when you open the lid. This cream is very thick. I like that this can be used in the morning and at night. It can also be used under makeup. This jar seems to last a long time since it&#x27;s so thick and creamy. I love the texture of it. It feels wonderful on my face. I also use it on my neck. I apply the cream on m y neck in an upward motion to help prevent &amp;#34;the granny neck&amp;#34;. My skin feels very soft and it&#x27;s not left with a greasy feeling. Even though I did receive this product in exchange for my honest review, I really do love this product and would definitely recommend it. Even without the signs of aging, this cream feels wonderful on your face. I really like using it as a primer for my concealer. I love this anti-wrinkle cream!</li>
            <li> Love the way this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I tried out the Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream cream, which was given to me to try out for free. It is supposed to firm skin, work on fine lines, wrinkles, etc. I don&#x27;t have any deep lines yet. I&#x27;m just now getting the beginnings of aging skin issues. I have a tiny line next to my mouth and tiny furrows between my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does this cream work? It&#x27;s not too shabby. I used it for a few weeks and it did help with the line next to my mouth, making it appear less visible. The fine lines between my eyebrows are also less visible, which is a plus in my book.</li>
            <li> AMAZING stuff! My face is looking younger and clearer! My manager even asked me what I was doing different after using it for about 10 days! She said I have a &amp;#34;glowing youthful&amp;#34; look! Its nice and creamy and feels so nutritious on my skin... like its doing something. Had reservations but now I&#x27;m sold! I WILL buy again!</li>
            <li> I was impressed with this jar, it seems so crisp and clinical that I almost feel like it is something I might find at a high end med-spa. The cream and white and rich and does not have any overpowering smell, once again it is more of a soft clinical smell but not in a bad way. I used this at night with a little bit of Retin A. It is thick and creamy but absorbs well and does not leave your skin with a tacky feeling, but it is not overly light where you don&#x27;t feel like you have anything on. My face feels soft and hydrated without feeling weighed down or greasy. I have not experienced any redness or breaking out and so far I like it. I can&#x27;t say that I have seen a big reduction in wrinkles but I really don&#x27;t have many yet anyhow.</li>
            <li> Oh boy where do I start.. I feel like this moisturizer is my new best friend! I apply it after a shower and occasionally I&#x27;ll use a skin tighter first but when I do it always always always bring out the underlying scent of said toner(which I love) It is smooth, creamy, easy to apply. I use it under my eyes &amp; nose first then cheeks, brow, eyelids(it helps prime for eyeshadow too!) I just love it! If you&#x27;ve been looking for an amazing cream look no further, I swear this eliminated three steps form my beauty routine! I&#x27;ve noticed fine lines are starting to &amp;#34;fill&amp;#34; my eyes look brighter, my skin smoother, and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week! I did receive a SLIGHT discount for my review but it did not change my opinion at all I really enjoy this cream and WILL be purchasing it again in the future! (Though I do believe this jar will last me 6 months it&#x27;s one of those -little goes a long way products) :D</li>
            <li> I use this moisturizer each morning and night.  It is thick so a very small amount goes a long way.  It doesn&#x27;t feel thick or greasy on my skin.  I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Well, I would like to tell you all about this product, but my husband appropriated it from my cabinet.  He&#x27;s not giving it back.  Enough said.</li>
            <li> Says tingles, didnt seem to do much for being so expensive</li>
            <li> Upon opening the jar of Anavita I immediately noticed the creamy rich texture, not runny. The smell is faint yet clean and refreshing. When applying this concoction it went on smooth and evenly. I have highly sensitive skin and it reacts quickly to irritating chemicals. So when trying new products I have be very careful and pick a test spot out on my skin. Once I get the clear by my skin not breaking out in hives or severe redness I am good to go. Anavita does not irritate my skin at all. In fact it is quite nourishing to my skin especially since I suffer from dry skin and I am not getting any younger. Having a product that not only helps fight aging but accentuates the positive in my skin is a must. With this product I have noticed my fine lines seem to blur and balance form in my skin tone. My skin feels very soft and looks luminous with each use. I just love how it is four products in one, that saves me time and money. Overall Anavita really stands up to it&#x27;s competitors with this wonderful beauty product. - See more at: http://www.frugalmomandwife.com/2015/01/anavita-moisturizing-anti-wrinkle-cream.html</li>
            <li> I love that this cream guarantees results. They say, “If other people don’t comment on your improved appearance within thirty days, we’ll give you your money back!”  Wow... what have I got to lose besides wrinkles!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cream is very creamy and a little goes a long way.  The jar is pretty large at 1.7 fl oz.  It has a nice delicate scent and does not feel greasy.  They say it takes 2 to 4 weeks for visible results so I’m excited to see what happens.  I’ve been using it for about a week now and so far I really like it. I received this product in exchange for an honest review...all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Works well fast shipping A+++</li>
            <li> This product is just as advertised. I have been using it for two weeks and I can already see a good improvement.</li>
            <li> I like its consistency and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to cover the face and neck. After a month and a half, it is too early to tell if there has been any significant change.</li>
            <li> I am sure I have said this before and I am saying it again, I have tried more than my fair share of facial creams. Though I hate to admit it, since I hit my 30s, the potential development of wrinkles has moved to the forefront and that means anti-wrinkle cream has as well. Anytime I am using any form of facial cream there are a few things that are really important to me. First, the product that I am using has to smell nice. Second, while it is important that a product not leave my face dry, it is equally as important that it not leave my skin oily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anavita has a very pleasant scent. If we are being honest, there is nothing worse than putting a product on your face that you are going to have to smell all day and it smells bad. I don’t know about you but there are times when I get warm during the day and that means I am going to smell the cream on my face. With Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream I don’t have to worry because it smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned before, the state that the cream leaves my face in is important as well. When it comes to my nose and t-zone, things can go one of two ways. Sometimes I get dry and sometimes I get really oily. I find that this really depends on what products I am using. With Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream I did not have any problems. The cream was light and fluffy which honestly reminded me of a whipped icing you find on cakes. It went on smooth and did not leave my skin sticky or cakey at all. It was a little heavy to use prior to putting on makeup; however, this may be a personal “thing” as I do not normally like to apply moisturizer before I put on my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I enjoy the product and look forward to continued use!</li>
            <li> For a woman who is 37, it is very important to pay much attention to my skin. I have few fine lines around my eyes, and a deep line around my mouth. I would love to get rid of them, but I know there is no magic, it is all about moisturizing, using sunscreen, and eating healthy food.&lt;br /&gt;A good moisturizer is the one with good ingredients that fits to your skin needs. A 30+ woman needs more than just an ordinary moisturizer; she needs anti-oxidants and collagen promoters in order to restore good skin conditions. Hyaluronic acid and Matrixyl are two helpful ingredients for plumping your skin and promoting the production of new collagen.&lt;br /&gt;I received Anavita Anti-wrinkle cream for review, and I used it for three weeks, during which I noticed that my skin is well moisturized. I used it twice a day, and did not use any other moisturizing creams to see how it works. I loved the fact that it does not leave my skin greasy, it is absorbed quickly, and it works well for day, night, base under makeup and for reducing the appearance of wrinkles. Notice that dry skin will appear more wrinkled than moisturized skin, but what Anavita does is that it help promote healthy skin. Of course, this will not happen in few days, so be patient!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and more often than not I purchased moisturizers that weren&#x27;t compatible with my type of skin. Until I decided to try Anavita I always ended up with products that made my T-zone shiny by noon. Now, I never have to check my face in the mirror and pat down the excess oil. It didn&#x27;t break me out, and the couple of dark spots I had from sun-exposure have started to diminish. My overall complexion is brighter, and I already got a couple of compliments on my skin. After I finish my first jar, I will definitely re-purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer! Leaves my skin plump and really soft. Feels velvety and thick great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have bought, used, and thrown-out, many moisturizing anti-wrinkle creams before, but this one by Anavita, is a keeper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with the results from this cream. I wear it as a night-time moisturizer; and after having put it on the night before, and waking-up, my face feels completely hydrated and dewy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a quality anti-wrinkle cream, without the high-end price. So thankful for such a great facial product, that I know is trustworthy in the ingredients, and huge kudos, no animal testing!  Buy yours today...start seeing the difference tomorrow!</li>
            <li> Nice but could not order more, so changed to a different product.  Internet only had $5 sample for sale.  Insufficient supply to see results.</li>
            <li> I was going to write to tell you I have stopped using your product. I stopped using all other products and only your cream. When I did this awhile after application my face got very hot and my skin was taut and very dry. I washed it off  and redness and tightness was gone. I tried it several times with the same results. What are your recommendations?</li>
            <li> I got this item for my mom and she loves it. First, it smells wonderful. It feels very luxurious on her skin. She uses it every morning when she wakes up and at night before she falls asleep. Her skin feels smoother and the lines seems to diminish a little everyday. Since my mom is super happy about this product I highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I notice some fast results, I am impressed with this cream didn&#x27;t expect it to work this fast. My skin feels really soft and moisturized.  This anti- wrinkle cream is thick but it absorbs onto your face really well and it has a light scent to it but it won&#x27;t really bother you when you apply it to your skin. I really like this cream because it keeps my face hydrated, soft and smooth on my oily face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a little over a week so I can&#x27;t give a recommendation for long term effects of the product, but I am extremely impressed with this product as a moisturizer.  This product claims to work well as a day cream, night cream, wrinkle cream, and makeup base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I do wish that it had an SPF in it for day use, but I have been using my regular SPF in conjunction with this cream without any issues.  (Maybe Anavita will consider making an SPF in the future?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use it at night, it quickly absorbs and my skin feels nourished without a heavy or greasy feel.  I sometimes have issue with other creams feeling heavy on the skin and rubbing off on my pillow case when I go to bed at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite use for this product is as a makeup base.  I have extremely dry skin and I wear makeup on a daily basis.  It&#x27;s really cold right now were I live and my skin has a few dry patches around my mouth and nose.  Foundations and powders tend to cling to dry patches and make them more noticeable.  This sinks into the skin within a few seconds without leaving any residue behind.  It moisturizes the dry patches and makeup goes on without any issue.  With other moisturizers I sometimes find myself using a couple of layers of product to get the moisture level that I want and  they sometimes start to ball up with I&#x27;m applying makeup over them.  This doesn&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always do my research when it comes to skincare ingredients and I was pleasantly surprised that this didn&#x27;t contain any nasty ingredients.  The only ingredient that might cause issues for some people is the orange fragrance.  I can&#x27;t really smell it in mine, but if your skin is sensitive when it comes to fragrance that might cause an issue for you.  (I do have fragrance sensitivity though and it didn&#x27;t cause any issues for me, but just a heads up.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3 Key ingredients in this are-&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid- works to help the skin retain moisture&lt;br /&gt;Matrixyl- A peptide that stimulates collagen synthesis and skin repair&lt;br /&gt;Argireline- Helps to relax the skin/muscle to prevent wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line-  I highly suggest this product.  I immediately noticed how soft my skin felt upon application and it is really a nice product.  If you compare the ingredients to other high end creams, you are really getting a lot for your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a jar of this product at no cost from Anavita.  My opinions however, are all honest.rixyl- A peptide that stimulates collagen synthesis and skin repair&lt;br /&gt;Argireline- Helps to relax the skin/muscle to prevent wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line-  I highly suggest this product.

            <li> Anavita Moisturizing Anti -Wrinkle Cream is creamy, rich and not oily.  It went on smoothly, was easily absorbed, and it felt good!  My make-up goes on over it easily.  It is a good thing!</li>
            <li> I am giving it four stars because it feels good on.  As of yet, I haven&#x27;t really seen any difference, but I guess it can take up to twelve weeks to notice a change.  I will update this review at the end of the twelve weeks and let you know if there is any difference!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Anavita Cream for about 5 weeks.  The cream lasted about 5 weeks and so far I am very pleased with the results</li>
            <li> First thing I want to say, you are going to find a LOT of people online doing the same review, but I want to give you the straight facts! I am not here to blow smoke up your butt, and I could personally care less if I give a company a bad review and they don&#x27;t review with me again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, that is out the way, I have had quite a positive experience with this product! Now, by no means is it a miracle product. In fact I didn&#x27;t start noticing anything until about the 3rd day and that was using it twice a day. I am currently going on a week and already seeing results. It does however, take most people 2 to even 4 weeks before they start seeing any kind of change. So keep that in mind when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 25 years old now, going on 26. I hate admitting it, but I am not the young cluck-a-doodle I use to be. My biggest problem area&#x27;s? Fine line&#x27;s on my forehead, and fine lines under my eyes are my trouble area&#x27;s.  I have noticed now my skin is starting to become more vibrant as well as tighter. My favorite thing to do with this product is putting it on right before I put on my makeup. Now, I don&#x27;t know if this is something that is recommended, but it has worked for me. I can&#x27;t wait to see what my result&#x27;s will be after 2-4 weeks. Find out what works for you rather it&#x27;s 2 times a day or 4 times a day, keep using it eventually you will see some sort of results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I did receive this as a complementary product, however this not distort or change my mind in any shape or form. This is 100% my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I love a great wrinkle cream.  I am so planning on being that 60 year old that looks 30.  As of right now I don’t have wrinkles (knocks on wood) but I do want to prevent them from happening and this is a great cream to have on hand.  This was a thicker cream so if you have dry skin this is an awesome way to go.  It takes a few minutes to soak in but when it does you will start seeing and feeling the results in just a few uses.  The moisturizer in this cream is just amazing if nothing else you will be completely impressed on how soft your face feels.&lt;br /&gt;  I have a few dry spots and in the winter they get nothing but dryer and dryer this moisturizing anti wrinkle cream is going to be perfect.  It says you will get visible results in just 4 weeks but after just a few days my skin already felt softer and my dry spots were a whole lot better.  They also have a 100% money back guarantee.  I love when companies guarantee there product it shows that they really stand behind it.</li>
            <li> My mom lved it. But she finished it in a mionth.</li>
            <li> Developed an allergic rash after about one week. Too bad because I liked the lightness of the cream and nicely it absorbed.</li>
            <li> Love this cream!!!! It is super concentrated and thick, what makes it last forever. I have sensitive and super dry skin during winter, and ever since I have been using this cream, my skin is not peeling off and it is well moisturized. I highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This cream is rich and goes on easily. It has a scent, too. At first, I thought it was similar to Strivectin, which just goes on your skin and &amp;#34;sits there,&amp;#34; almost like a coating. But this Anavita cream actually soaks this up, which is surprising because I have oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to use Persagel all over my face, regardless of what I put on first, or I can&#x27;t put makeup on. What&#x27;s really weird is after I put the Persagel on, my face was so smooth and dry, like I had powder on it. It was nice, and the wrinkles under my eyes lessened because I put this anti-wrinkle cream on first. My own natural skin had a matt-finish! Of course, I love that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using it on my neck, chest and certain areas of my face that need extra hydration. It smooths the look of wrinkles and feels soft. It does take about a minute or two to totally soak up, but again, I&#x27;m oily. So if you have wrinkles and dry skin, it would probably absorb in seconds!</li>
            <li> I like my face cream on the heavier side for the protection it affords against the elements. I was on MD forte face creams for many years before they became ridiculously expensive. I then moved onto their cheaper replacement Vivite that, too, soon turned into a gold mine for its maker. So I was always on the look out for alternatives that worked yet didn&#x27;t rob me blind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on Anavita for several weeks now. So far so good. I like the creamy texture that&#x27;s neither heavy nor sticky and it goes on easy. And it retains moisture well. My final verdict will come when I&#x27;ve used up the entire jar. However, the jar design leaves something to be desired for. It&#x27;s rather small compared to what I&#x27;m used to and the shiny chrome finish feels extremely slippery in my hands. Mine also came with a sticker across the top of the lid that I struggled to peel off. When it did, the glue stayed. So the lid sticks to my vanity and I have to yank it off twice a day when I use the product. My right arm is now noticeably stronger.</li>
            <li> No results seen after using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this cream for a little over a week. It is still a little too early to know how well it will work. It does have a pleasant feel and aroma. It seems to penetrate well into the skin without a sense of oiliness. I have been using many products throughout my life and I have a good feeling abouth this product. It will take more time to know for sure but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Noticed a difference within 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really late in posting my review of this wonderful product, but a wonderful product it is!  The manufacturer recommended suspending use of any other skin products while using this one, as other products might reduce the skin&#x27;s absorption of the Anavita.  I followed the recommendation with some trepidation--there are a couple of products I&#x27;ve gotten great results with, and gave them up with reluctance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No worries.  This stuff is great!  I have really dry skin around my eyes, but Anavita has saved the day!  It&#x27;s not greasy, absorbs quickly, and wow, the results are amazing.  After using twice a day for a month, my lines and wrinkles have diminished, and my skin looks and feels like silk.  I&#x27;ve dispensed with foundation, and use color cosmetics only.  I don&#x27;t know how long the results will last, but I&#x27;m probably going to purchase more.  The price is beyond reasonable for the product&#x27;s quality, and I&#x27;ve used many inferior creams that cost a lot more.  Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample received for review.</li>
            <li> As a 43 year old woman, I am in danger of becoming wrinkled like the leg of an elephant. But, not without a fight! So, when Anavita offered their Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream to review, I was happy to oblige. When I received the Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream I liked the packaging. It was clean and the label looks nice on the silver bottle. I had a little trouble reading the directions, as they were small, but easy to follow. I tried the cream on the back of my hand and immediately loved the smell. It is light but fruity. I also loved that it had a light, creamy texture that absorbed well into my skin without feeling like it had a lot of residue. I love that the Anavita Moisturizing Anti-Wrinkle Cream is cruelty free and safe for all skin types. I have the type of skin that breaks out easily. I like that I did not break out after the 2 weeks that I used it. I also noticed a difference in my skin. My pores are minimizing and redness has been reduced. Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Works well to hydrate and decrease appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> After using many name brand creams this cream beats them all! It goes on creamy and is not oily. Feels good on my skin and I like the fact that is is a day and night cream.  My jar is almost empty so, time for a reorder!!!</li>

It serves as a day cream, night cream, wrinkle cream and makeup base.&lt;br /&gt;-In general you can use other products when using the Anavita cream, but we would suggest using them at different times of day. You don&#x27;t want to place the Anavita cream over another product since Anavita may not be absorbed as well as it should be.&lt;br /&gt;-Sometimes another product will be incompatible with Anavita. For example, if you are using another brand of wrinkle cream on your face at night and wanted to use Anavita during the day, the night product could prevent Anavita from absorbing easily. Another example is castor oil cleansing may cause the Anavita cream to dry the skin. After stopping with an incompatible product, we would suggest waiting up to two weeks for it to leave your system before starting again with Anavita.&lt;br /&gt;-You should notice a moisturizing effect within the first few days of use.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and already see a noticeable difference.  The manufacturer/business owner is very helpful and has sent multiple informational emails that I&#x27;ve found very helpful.  I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering again.</li>

            <li> Purchased as a gift and was told it was great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of skincare products. I&#x27;ve worked for several cosmetics companies. I bought this not expecting to be impressed. I&#x27;ve used it two days and my skin is SO smooth. My makeup goes on like a dream. I feel hydrated without any heavy feeling or grease. This stuff is amazing. Can&#x27;t wait to follow up and see how my skin looks in a month and later. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I feel the diference in my face now. I used the Anavita cream for 6 weeks and my skin is more firm and silky.  I recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I was afraid that it was going to be oily when I opened it up.  It&#x27;s thick and pleasant smelling and I&#x27;m happy to say it&#x27;s not oily.  The first time I used it, it tingled a little bit and I went back and read the directions and realized that it might do that.  It was not and is still not an unpleasant tingling.  I use this on my neck and face twice a day.  I have forgotten to use it a couple of times but other than those times I&#x27;ve been pretty faithful with my use.  My BFF&#x27;s tell me that it&#x27;s already working which is why I wanted to go ahead and post my review.  If it is, that&#x27;s impressive as it&#x27;s not been 4 weeks yet.</li>
            <li> I love trying different beauty products so I can compare to past purchases.  I would say that this is very comparable to those higher priced beauty counter creams, for a much better price.</li>
            <li> This cream really works. You are going to notice visible results in just 4 weeks, and continuing improvement for 12 weeks. This cream you can use it in your face, neck and body. I like to use the anti-wrinkle cream twice a day. I absolutely love the smell. Is pretty moisturizer and light. I wear makeup before apply the cream in the morning, because it works like makeup base. It absorbs in seconds. I have oily skin and it doesn’t feel greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;@MakeupByOne</li>
            <li> I have used it every day for a month now and have seen a slight improvement in my wrinkles. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> So far pretty  good.  Complexion better, lines somewhat reduced. Am 60 so can&#x27;t  expect miracles but this is by far the best cream to date and I have tried them all.</li>
            <li> The cream is a bit rich/thick for my face, but I put it on my neck, and it seems to work pretty well. The lines on my neck seem to be a bit fainter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been few days that I have been using this product and so far, my skin has no breakout. I like the smell and texture of this anti-wrinkle cream. The smell is not over-powering when I apply it on my face. I can tell that my skin is softer and smoother after using it for days. It is really gentle on my skin. The lines are still there but, unnoticeable. The texture is creamy and I like that when I apply it on my face, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, sticky or dry. I only use this product before bedtime and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I have big hope about this cream! Good for nighttime,because a little heavy,but it works! If you order,you&#x27;ll get all instructions! Very good service!</li>
            <li> This cream has ticker texture, but I like it. Using it at night for my face and apply it on neck and decolletage in morning.</li>
            <li> Let me just tell you this stuff feels amazing. The consistency is so smooth and luxurious and I am obsessed! My face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy after using it, just super moisturized and happy.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer looks like it might be too thick and greasy.  BUT when you put it on it is smooth and absorbs in to your skin quickly.  I wear it under my makeup and it helps my makeup go on easily.  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good cream, but don&#x27;t expect any wrinkles to disappear.</li>
