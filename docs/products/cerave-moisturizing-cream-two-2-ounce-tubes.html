            <li>B004WC2H8A First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream 2 oz]].</li>
            <li>This stuff really works, and was recommended by my Dermatologist!  </li>
            <li>The rescue putty mostly for when the skin is severely cracked as it can be put on in a thick layer that just stays put, and the FAB cream mostly at night when absorption is not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It will be tough to find a suitable replacement.</li>

            <li>It is really helping during this dry winter.</li>

            <li> My boys both have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I used CeraVe products because my dermatologist recommended them for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It also makes my hands softer/less dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: I do like the product; however, my skin started to react (e.g. redness, dry patches) to the moisturizer after a while.</li>
            <li> and I hadn&#x27;t had a single pimple in 6 months.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this cream for my very dry hands, which I&#x27;ve always had.  </li>
            <li> My skin was very dry when I started using this product.  </li>
            <li> I have very, very dry skin</li>
            <li> and it really hydrates my dry skin without irritating.  </li>
            <li> which only contains beeswax, raw honey and olive oil as well as [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t leave my hands oily like the other creams I&#x27;ve tried (and I eventually stop using them).  </li>
            <li> It also is fragrance-free and tolerated extremely well by my skin.</li>
            <li> I use the large jar at home and have found it difficult to find the 2 ounce tubes in store.</li>
            <li> Just put on a little, spread it over your hands and wait for it to cooly evaporate leaving a protective healing layer on your hands.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> helpful as i cannot locate the small 2 ounce size at the store - but need it to carry in purse and to work</li>
            <li> Like having the small travel tubes.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin around my eyes, and nothing--from expensive skin serums to prescription medicine--has helped moisturize the skin around my eyes like this product.</li>
            <li> It improved quickly but now, after using it for a month, I have the worst case of acne ever</li>
            <li> other products I use in addition to CeraVe are: [[ASIN:B00AZZ5WR6</li>
            <li> I had eczema that was very irritating.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of difficulty with chapping and splitting during cold weather, and must pay attention to always wearing gloves outdoors as well as at home when doing anything at the sink (even the smallest task).  </li>

            <li> helpful as i cannot locate the small 2 ounce size at the store - but need it to carry in purse and to work</li>
            <li> My peditrician recommended this lotion for my daughters eczema. I love it and seems to be helping her. This is the perfect size for travel.</li>
            <li> I started using this cream in the winter when the skin on my hands was splitting. Really helps keep them hydrated.</li>
            <li> Love this cream! Non greasy but very moisturizing.  These tubes are great for purse/ travel, but one pound tubs are much cheaper.  I am a nurse &amp; am washing my hands constantly - this cream is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel like new.  I use it every day and it has become my go to lotion.  :)</li>
            <li> My boys both have dry skin. Cerave was recommended by their dermatologist. I now not only use it on them after their shower/bath, but I use it on myself as well. Not sticky at all and I can get dressed within minutes. I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference for all of us. Buy it - you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Members of the family suffer from itchy dry skin - which is really problematic.  Tried all types of lotion, and came across this.  This is excellent.  Give it a try, if it works - great.  If not, keep searching.</li>
            <li> I used CeraVe products because my dermatologist recommended them for my dry skin. I use both the lotion (for my body) and the moisturizing cream for my hands. The two once size is perfect for airline travel, too.</li>
            <li> My husband has a skin condition on his hands and uses various prescription creams in addition to CeraVe. Of all the moisturizing creams he&#x27;s used, and the count is numerous, this is by far the best. The small tubes are perfect for stuffing in his suitcase when he&#x27;s on the road. At home he uses the big tub. This is a great moisturizing cream - not greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I love this cream - it is softer than most and yet more effective than lotions.  The tube is great for ease of use and for on the go people.  (Flight friendly!)  If you have sensitive skin or simply dry skin - this is the best product out there.  I learned about it from online research and have been a fan of it for years now!</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer, but makes skin shiny.&lt;br /&gt;  Otherwise, it works well and is not too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s perfect for wearing just at night.</li>
            <li> I had eczema that was very irritating. My dermatologist suggested that I try CeraVe and it cleared it up almost overnight. I suggested it to my daughter who has suffered from eczema since childhood and whose two year old had it too. She is amazed at how fast it has cleared up the baby&#x27;s rash. I strongly reccommend this product.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this cream for my very dry hands, which I&#x27;ve always had.  This one doesn&#x27;t leave my hands oily like the other creams I&#x27;ve tried (and I eventually stop using them).  It also makes my hands softer/less dry.</li>
            <li> My skin was very dry when I started using this product.  It improved quickly but now, after using it for a month, I have the worst case of acne ever and I hadn&#x27;t had a single pimple in 6 months.  I strongly warn those with acne-prone skin against using this product!</li>
            <li> Cerave cream is a great cream for under my eyes. I have dry skin around my eyes, and nothing--from expensive skin serums to prescription medicine--has helped moisturize the skin around my eyes like this product. However, I cannot give it 5 stars because I wish it had more antioxidants, like vitamin C and vitamin E to help fight wrinkles more effectively. So I usually cocktail this with a wonderful antioxidant serum to give the skin around my eyes that benefit. Also, this product, while helping to moisturize, it hasnt 100% cured my eczema under my eye. There is no itchiness or rash, but a lingering redness persists. Nothing seems to get rid of it, but Cerave does make it feel better. It&#x27;s a superb product by all means, but it&#x27;s not a miracle.</li>
            <li> CeraVe cream was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  My entire family uses this cream for our eczema, psoriasis and simply to moisturize our body.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  I do prefer the jar but these are convenient to carry with me in my purse.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I use the large jar at home and have found it difficult to find the 2 ounce tubes in store. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best moisturizers I have ever used....great for extremely dry hands, use it before I go to sleep.  Like having the small travel tubes.</li>
            <li> I kept hearing derms say this was the next best choice to their expensive products so I tried it. I still use oil during the winter under it, but It has worked really well. I keep a tube in my purse, and I make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Cerave, soaks right into the skin. Never leaves the skin sticky after appling.  I have  been an Aveeno user for years. Aveeno is great for the hands but Cerave is wonderful for the whole body</li>
            <li> This cream was suggested to me by my dermatologist.  She provided a sample, and I was so impressed that I ordered more through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Just started using this and it really hydrates my dry skin without irritating.  I also love that this is packaged in two tubes instead of the jar.</li>
            <li> I have to disagree with the reviewer who said he/she got acne from using this product.  The product is \\&quot;non-comedogenic\\&quot; which means it will not cause problems like acne.  I also have a tendency to get acne, but after I started using this product on my face, I was able to STOP using two prescription acne medications that I had previously been taking.  So, in my case it did not cause acne but actually seems to prevent it.  I agree with another reviewer who said the 2-oz. tubes are great for when you are traveling.  I have just ordered a 16-0z. jar of the cream to use when I&#x27;m at home.</li>
            <li> Caveat: Different skin, different results. This review is based on my experience. I have normal skin with no major issues but some sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I think this is a very nice cream. I kept this in my office as well as my travel bag. I used it mostly for my hands but also on my face when necessary. It went on smooth and absorbed rather quickly. My skin felt very nice afterwards. It is fragrance-free which is nice for those of us with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I do not like that it contains certain ingredients such as parabens and alcohols (Hazard score: 5 on ewg.org/skindeep). My skin is sensitive to some of these ingredients which is why I have to switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I do like the product; however, my skin started to react (e.g. redness, dry patches) to the moisturizer after a while. It will be tough to find a suitable replacement.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist highly recommends CeraVe creme for the treatment of my psoriasis.  It is really helping during this dry winter.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different lotions, but this is the first one that worked for me. It was on the recomendation of a dermatologist and he was right.  On my hands its great and my legs no longer itch like crazy.  Its good on my feet as well.  I bought these 2 tubes so that I could keep one in my purse, and one in my desk drawer and I bought a big tub of it for the bathroom after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;This really works great, I can finally stop buying stuff that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> CeraVe Moisturizing Cream is one of my go-to creams when the eczema on my fingers flares up. I find that while a combination of products is best to keep the dry, thick and cracked skin under control, CeraVe has the advantage that it absorbs instantly. That&#x27;s great for using it on my hands because it enables me to continue my daily activities without having to wait for it to absorb. It also is fragrance-free and tolerated extremely well by my skin. I use it several times a day and can say that it has helped my skin tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other products I use in addition to CeraVe are: [[ASIN:B00AZZ5WR6 Worker B - Rescue Putty - 1.75 oz.]] which only contains beeswax, raw honey and olive oil as well as [[ASIN:B004WC2H8A First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream 2 oz]]. The rescue putty mostly for when the skin is severely cracked as it can be put on in a thick layer that just stays put, and the FAB cream mostly at night when absorption is not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But CeraVe is my go-to cream during the day and it is another product I have on subscription with Amazon to ensure that I don&#x27;t run out accidentally.</li>
            <li> This cream was recommended by my dermatologist&#x27;s office.  I have a lot of difficulty with chapping and splitting during cold weather, and must pay attention to always wearing gloves outdoors as well as at home when doing anything at the sink (even the smallest task).  I found this cream to be helpful and have been using it most of the time for a couple of months.  A good, albeit expensive, product - one of the best I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> great price for two tubes, this stuff works wonders especially if you have dry skin. recommended by dermatologists, defnitely work a try.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, and was recommended by my Dermatologist!  It lasts several washings before needing reapplied.  Good hand cream.</li>
            <li> Cerave works fast and attacks windy dryness without any greasy residue feeling. Just put on a little, spread it over your hands and wait for it to cooly evaporate leaving a protective healing layer on your hands.</li>
            <li> I just Love, Love CeraVe.  It is a great product.  I have very, very dry skin and this is the only lotion that works for me.  It makes my skin smooth hydrates well.  The two ounce tubes are perfect for traveling.  I have used them many times.  Please don&#x27;t discontinue this size product.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream I have ever use on my skin.  It goes on smooth &amp; dries fast without stickiness.  I love this cream.  I use it everyday.</li>
