            <li>Amazon is a great place to purchase Clarisonic refills - I have not come across a better deal in a retail store or through another online retailer that has twin packs for $28.  </li>
            <li>This is a great replacement pack for the clarisonic and the price was much better than else</li>

            <li>love this!</li>
            <li>I love my Clarisonic!</li>

            <li>I use this with my Clarisonic MIA and it works amazing.</li>
            <li>Love the Clarisonic; these brush heads were a good price for the two of them.  </li>
            <li>The brush heads themselves weren&#x27;t in any kind of box or sealed packaging and didn&#x27;t have any sealed wrapper on them.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice product</li>
            <li>This was a good value also over most retailers I have found.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to find the name brand brush head refills for the Clarisonic at such at great price.</li>
            <li>My Clarisonic dual brush head pack came nicely packaged and compact so the brush head was intact.  </li>
            <li>Pretty Good!</li>
            <li>This is perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin and the sensitive heads are perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>Clarisonic is one of the best beauty brands I have found so far.</li>
            <li>Brushes are perfect arrived in box and are exactly like the original.</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>I love my clarisonic, and this is the best brushes for my sensitive skin, great price, Dept. stores much higher.</li>
            <li>Thank You for the great offer, very much appreciated!</li>
            <li>so I replaced them and they work fine!</li>
            <li>I think they are authentic.</li>
            <li>One brush OK</li>
            <li>Just as you would get in the store but at a much better price.  </li>
            <li>most retail want 25$ for just one brush can&#x27;t beat this 2 for almost the price of one.</li>
            <li>and I felt like I broke out more with it.</li>
            <li>I love clarisonic</li>
            <li>and i Love Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>well, I DO honestly love my clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>AND THESE WERE MORE MONEY.</li>
            <li>and you might be able to find these cheaper.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would be able to find one yet alone two brush heads for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad because I really do love using my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I just love them.</li>
            <li>Wish I&#x27;d read the reviews better before I bought these.  </li>
            <li>I do believe they are authentic, but I think they could be rejects for quality reasons.  </li>
            <li>The plastic covers do say Clairsonic across the top, but I have purchased authentic ones before that just had a squiggly line across the top (another reviewer mentioned this and thought they weren&#x27;t authentic).  </li>
            <li>top things off</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more soon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not seen a better price, sale or otherwise, anywhere.</li>
            <li>I purchased a Clarisonic many months ago and started seeing the signs that I needed to replace the heads.</li>
            <li>I love my Clarisonic</li>
            <li>and I love it...</li>
            <li>I love Clarisonic, but do not buy from Discount Accessories and More.</li>
            <li>Either way all of them looked and feel authentic.</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of the two pack.</li>
            <li>I love these and will buy them again</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better to go to the store where you know what your getting.</li>
            <li>I love the clarisonic product</li>
            <li>This product is okay.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better brushes.</li>
            <li>I love my clarisonic and having a clean brush makes the tool even better!  </li>
            <li>Easy to operate and use.</li>
            <li>so I justify the brush head replacement cost easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Clarasonic for many years and these are the brush heads that work best for me on an everyday basis.</li>
            <li>is that the heads do not come off of the handheld easily.  </li>
            <li>First of all, they did not arrive in any kind of manufacturer&#x27;s box or packaging.</li>
            <li>They came promptly, packaged correctly, brand new, and at a good price.</li>
            <li>I just use with some Cetaphil mild cleanser (which I LOVE</li>
            <li>They do fit my Clairsonic Mia and seem to work fine, so I will use them.  </li>
            <li>I found the brush head comfortable and did not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>The sensitive brush heads seem most comfortable but effective for my skin.</li>
            <li>Cheap Knock off</li>
            <li>DOES make  all the difference in how clear and bright my skin is.</li>
            <li>heads fit my device well as if I ordered from website--</li>
            <li>Summary box, brush, cover, fit, durability, color and quality says it is like the one in sephora.</li>
            <li>These are not OEM products but cheap knockoffs.  </li>
            <li>They are genuine.</li>
            <li>I love my Mia and these replacement heads are just right.  </li>
            <li>course&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt looks like the original product at all&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li>This item, if original, gets 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel a difference from the original brush I received and the sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>I clean my brushes once a week by brushing over the bristles with rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball</li>
            <li>I found using the soft brush daily is perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li>Once I&#x27;m done cleansing my face, it just feels so clean.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use a different brush head as the sensitive is perfect.</li>
            <li>This was when I poured boiling water over it, which I have always done to clean my brush heads, and have never had a problem before.</li>
            <li>I love my clarisonic  and ordering from amazon makes it much easier to replace my brushes.</li>
            <li>I love my clarisonic and these are much cheaper here than at the store.</li>
            <li>The product itself is fantastic, I use it daily, and the brush heads are crucial to the product, so this is awesome.</li>
            <li>They get my face super clean without any irritation or scratching.  </li>
            <li>You get a fresh cover with each brush which is important to me.  </li>
            <li>but I doubt the generic ones are as good.  </li>
            <li>Really enjoy my Clarisonic Mia, and that these &amp;#34;refills&amp;#34; are available on Amazon for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>shipment arrived quickly but it arrived damaged.  </li>
            <li>The service was quick.  </li>
            <li>Couldve been packaged better to ensure items are new.</li>
            <li>Great price, half as what I used to pay.  </li>
            <li>Regular use most nightly gives your complexion a clean and smooth finish.</li>
            <li>I believe that Clarisonic recommends replacing brush heads every 3 months or so, if you clean &amp; take care of your brushes (make sure you take them off the Clarisonic device to clean under the head) they will last a lot longer.  </li>
            <li>Great price...MUCH better pricing than ULTA which is a few blocks from my house!!!</li>
            <li>I recently have been to an aesthetician who is amazing</li>
            <li>then ordered the sensitive kind and immediately felt a difference - have to say my skin is much happier.</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>I like the sensitive brush heads better</li>
            <li>it does not irritate even the most sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>sure how it&#x27;s suppose to be geared toward sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Love my Clarisonic and these brushes for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>These are very much worth there</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t come in white boxes as specified, but were packaged safely and were clean.</li>
            <li>The brush heads will come in what looks like an original box, but they aren&#x27;t the real thing.</li>
            <li>The product came on time, and priced right.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are priced right.</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>I keep using it right now.</li>
            <li>I have tried both the Sensitive ones and the Normal ones and honestly can&#x27;t say I can tell a difference.  </li>
            <li>Apparently I have to say more...</li>
            <li>These are great for sensitive skin and you really can&#x27;t beat the price because they are double that in the store.</li>
            <li>liked it, the price is very favorable, will come back, would recommend to friends</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe I just got lucky, but these seem just like the real thing (because perhaps they are?).</li>
            <li>The Dermstore ships quickly and the product arrives as advertised, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This is a great product for facial cleansing I use it with the clarisonic facial wash.  </li>
            <li>I like the sensitive brushes as they are easy on your skin but still do a stellar cleaning job.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>, I like it very much</li>
            <li>These brush heads are exactly what I need.  </li>
            <li>most likely</li>
            <li>this is the first time i&#x27;ve ordered from this seller.  </li>
            <li>third - the bristles themselves are already frayed at the top.  </li>
            <li>I did check to make sure it was compatible with my device, but obviously it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This is the  first time I haven&#x27;t brought brush heads from a store that carries Clarisonic items.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to any woman that wants a fresh look.</li>
            <li>However, i will always shop Amazon.com because they save me so much money!</li>
            <li>I WILL BE PURCHASING MORE IN THE FUTURE.</li>
            <li>They are exact to the ones that came with your clarisonic.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t you can always come back here- thumbs up my review and just buy these. :)</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>Pretty sure the ones I received were counterfeit or generic.</li>
            <li>Packaging looked real but the brush heads didn&#x27;t feel right.</li>
            <li>I find if you wash your brush head with baby shampoo, it comes out very clean; however, I do like to replace occasionally.</li>
            <li>I especially like the sensitive brush heads which do a great job of cleaning but do not rough up my skin</li>
            <li>but when I received my first replacement brush heads they felt much softer than the first time.</li>
            <li>The brushes felt stiffer than my old brush but it also meant my brush is old and i, getting a better cleansing experience with these brushes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the same exact brushes that came with the original product.</li>
            <li>You can buy these in a major department store or online from one of the major shopping channels but you will pay a lot more for them.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, they were much cheaper here than in local stores</li>
            <li>at which point, I noticed the bristles were feeling very abrasive on my face.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>HER FACE THANKS THEM.</li>
            <li>The price was really competitive and Prime shipping is a no brainer.</li>
            <li>It took me forever to try to put the brush head on the Clarisonic, and whenever I try to take off the plastic cover, the whole brush head comes off with it.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS ORDER.</li>
            <li>THANKS.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfy with it.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are NOT THE REAL THING.</li>
            <li>Very scratchy from the get go</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend shopping here for this item!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not worth the $5 difference in price to buy directly from Clarsonic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In addition, the color of the brush, unlike genuine Clarisonic brushes, does not match the white Clarisonic Mia 2 --</li>
            <li>I really like the clarisonic mia.</li>
            <li>and I know this is real.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tossing them straight in the trash.</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This time I got 2 brushes that were knock off&#x27;s not the real Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>I give up, i will shop elsewhere, to much aggravation.</li>
            <li>Bristles too soft compared to genuine sensitive brush heads made by Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>but I can honestly say using the Clarisonic a few times a week</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Clarisonic for several years, and this pair of sensitive brushes are just comfortable and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Obviously in the original packaging, so no worries.</li>
            <li>I was worried that this product would be different than the original brush since they were so inexpensive.</li>
            <li>These are the same product but only at a more reasonable price</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without my Clarisonic!</li>
            <li>and I love the low, low price!!  </li>
            <li>The bristles are clean, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been used, but it definitely isn&#x27;t first quality like the ones you purchase at other locations.  </li>
            <li>value and would highly recommend to anyone that uses a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Packaging allowed one of the boxes to get a little banged up, but otherwise ok.  </li>
            <li>I have had this for a few weeks and at first it was fine.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and gentle, did not irritate my skin at all while doing their work well.  </li>
            <li>These are genuine clarisonic brushes minus the box.  </li>
            <li>This brush works on my really sensitive skin and really has helped minimize my breakouts.</li>
            <li>It works very well on my sensitive skin, keeps breakouts away.</li>
            <li>Many reviewers are saying that these are not genuine Clarisonic products...</li>
            <li>it does a good job orf cleaning the skin with out being irritating.</li>
            <li>But they are much easier on the skin than the deep clean and regular.</li>
            <li>The packaging was very slight so that made it even better.</li>
            <li>She loves her Clarisonic and needed new heads.</li>
            <li>Brand New.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and use the Mia once a day at night</li>
            <li>bought his product for my daughters who have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The first order I received only 1 brush that was taken from a twin pack which was what the ad showed a picture of.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t done a comparison between a brand new non-sensitive brush head and a brand new sensitive brush head, but I think I will stick with sensitive from now on.</li>
            <li>it is feels very soft and sensitive against my face.</li>
            <li>I noticed immediately that my skin feels free from debris, tight-</li>
            <li>The typical Clarisonic brush head has shorter, more coarse brush texture, even for the sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how that&#x27;s possible; maybe there is some soft tip that got worn away from so much</li>
            <li>and my skin stays clear.</li>
            <li>They do not feel as effective and more annoying</li>
            <li>I am a fan of these sensitive brush heads.</li>
            <li>I have relatively sensitive skin</li>
            <li>completely unacceptable.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and these work</li>
            <li>The Clarisonic.com website offers a discount program if you sign up for auto-refills, but despite that discount it&#x27;s still cheaper to purchase the refills at this time from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Clarisonic Mia and I prefer to use the sensitive brush head with the unit.</li>
            <li>They work well on sensitive</li>
            <li>Not only are they different sizes, the cap did not even fit on the knock-off from Amazon, but the bristles were noticeably different.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and got the sensitive head pack, which happens to be the cheapest one.</li>
            <li>i do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The Clarisonic Brush Head Sensitive 2-pack</li>
            <li>so I prefer the sensitive skin brush heads.</li>
            <li>and she suggested me switching to the sensitive brush option for my clarisonic.</li>
            <li>The sensitive brush heads work</li>
            <li>I bought these on here because they were cheaper than purchasing from Sephora or directly from Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I would recommend purchasing directly from Clarisonic or Sephora and not wasting money on these.</li>
            <li>The Clarisonic has changed my skin, I can really tell a difference if I don&#x27;t use it for several days.  </li>
            <li>Using Clarisonic, buy dual brush to save your money.&lt;br /&gt;Suitable if you have sensitive skin or using one in the morning</li>
            <li>I have been using the brush heads for sensitive skin exclusively.</li>
            <li>Feels a little softer than the other brush heads which is nice on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The regular brush heads irritated my skin and caused breakouts, but these sensitive ones have been gentle enough and work well.</li>
            <li>I received my sensitive brush head a week ago and already my skin is starting to clear up!</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase these brush heads as long as the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Really, they are not soft at all.  </li>
            <li>These were actually cheaper than the normal heads</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>This item was exactly what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>, you want them to be able to move quickly back and forth which they can&#x27;t do if you press the brush into skin too hard.  </li>
            <li>The plastic is different on these than the real Clarisonic brush heads, and the middle part melts and falls out of the outer part when cleaning.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted for my mia 2 sensitive clarisonic replacement brushes for less than any where else.</li>
            <li>My original brush heads lasted for a few months, so I was expecting the same thing with these.  </li>
            <li>first - the packaging consisted of two loose, individual brushheads with their caps (the clear plastic ones with the holes that expose the bristles) just floating in a folded piece of white paper.  </li>
            <li>They feel so soft, yet I still get my deep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>order directly from Clarisonic in the future</li>
            <li>I ordered a 2 pack of the Sensitive, and they arrived, packed individually in a brown envelope.  </li>
            <li>I use the deep pore set on auto delivery and I noticed a markedly difference in the texture of the brushes.</li>
            <li>These heads look extremely similar to the clarisonic brand, however they do not perform nearly as well.</li>
            <li>I ordered from 2 different vendors, expecting 2 Clarisonic Sensitive Brushes.  </li>
            <li>Why pay full price at Sephora when you can get the same thing and save a few dollars.</li>
            <li>I actually notice a different in my skin now that I am using a brand new brush.</li>
            <li>If you have alligator skin or you plan no using these on something other than your face, go for it, otherwise, buy the real thing.</li>
            <li>but, not dry-</li>
            <li>The brush length is too long and soft.</li>
            <li>The only downside (with all the Clarisonic brush heads) is that if you live in a humid climate, you have to take the brush head off after each use to let the device dry out.</li>
            <li>These go on and off easily without me being concerned that the machine will get broken.  </li>

            <li> Amazon is a great place to purchase Clarisonic refills - I have not come across a better deal in a retail store or through another online retailer that has twin packs for $28.  </li>
            <li> This is a great replacement pack for the clarisonic and the price was much better than else</li>

            <li> I use this with my Clarisonic MIA and it works amazing.</li>
            <li> Love the Clarisonic; these brush heads were a good price for the two of them.  </li>
            <li> The brush heads themselves weren&#x27;t in any kind of box or sealed packaging and didn&#x27;t have any sealed wrapper on them.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice product</li>
            <li> This was a good value also over most retailers I have found.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find the name brand brush head refills for the Clarisonic at such at great price.</li>
            <li> My Clarisonic dual brush head pack came nicely packaged and compact so the brush head was intact.  </li>
            <li> Pretty Good!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and the sensitive heads are perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> Clarisonic is one of the best beauty brands I have found so far.</li>
            <li> Brushes are perfect arrived in box and are exactly like the original.</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> I love my clarisonic, and this is the best brushes for my sensitive skin, great price, Dept. stores much higher.</li>
            <li> Thank You for the great offer, very much appreciated!</li>
            <li> so I replaced them and they work fine!</li>
            <li> I think they are authentic.</li>
            <li> One brush OK</li>
            <li> Just as you would get in the store but at a much better price.  </li>
            <li> most retail want 25$ for just one brush can&#x27;t beat this 2 for almost the price of one.</li>
            <li> and I felt like I broke out more with it.</li>
            <li> I love clarisonic</li>
            <li> and i Love Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> well, I DO honestly love my clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> AND THESE WERE MORE MONEY.</li>
            <li> and you might be able to find these cheaper.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would be able to find one yet alone two brush heads for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad because I really do love using my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I just love them.</li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d read the reviews better before I bought these.  </li>
            <li> I do believe they are authentic, but I think they could be rejects for quality reasons.  </li>
            <li> The plastic covers do say Clairsonic across the top, but I have purchased authentic ones before that just had a squiggly line across the top (another reviewer mentioned this and thought they weren&#x27;t authentic).  </li>
            <li> top things off</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more soon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not seen a better price, sale or otherwise, anywhere.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Clarisonic many months ago and started seeing the signs that I needed to replace the heads.</li>
            <li> I love my Clarisonic</li>
            <li> and I love it...</li>
            <li> I love Clarisonic, but do not buy from Discount Accessories and More.</li>
            <li> Either way all of them looked and feel authentic.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of the two pack.</li>
            <li> I love these and will buy them again</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better to go to the store where you know what your getting.</li>
            <li> I love the clarisonic product</li>
            <li> This product is okay.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better brushes.</li>
            <li> I love my clarisonic and having a clean brush makes the tool even better!  </li>
            <li> Easy to operate and use.</li>
            <li> so I justify the brush head replacement cost easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Clarasonic for many years and these are the brush heads that work best for me on an everyday basis.</li>
            <li> is that the heads do not come off of the handheld easily.  </li>
            <li> First of all, they did not arrive in any kind of manufacturer&#x27;s box or packaging.</li>
            <li> They came promptly, packaged correctly, brand new, and at a good price.</li>
            <li> I just use with some Cetaphil mild cleanser (which I LOVE</li>
            <li> They do fit my Clairsonic Mia and seem to work fine, so I will use them.  </li>
            <li> I found the brush head comfortable and did not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> The sensitive brush heads seem most comfortable but effective for my skin.</li>
            <li> Cheap Knock off</li>
            <li> DOES make  all the difference in how clear and bright my skin is.</li>
            <li> heads fit my device well as if I ordered from website--</li>
            <li> Summary box, brush, cover, fit, durability, color and quality says it is like the one in sephora.</li>
            <li> These are not OEM products but cheap knockoffs.  </li>
            <li> They are genuine.</li>
            <li> I love my Mia and these replacement heads are just right.  </li>
            <li> course&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt looks like the original product at all&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li> This item, if original, gets 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel a difference from the original brush I received and the sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> I clean my brushes once a week by brushing over the bristles with rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball</li>
            <li> I found using the soft brush daily is perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;m done cleansing my face, it just feels so clean.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use a different brush head as the sensitive is perfect.</li>
            <li> This was when I poured boiling water over it, which I have always done to clean my brush heads, and have never had a problem before.</li>
            <li> I love my clarisonic  and ordering from amazon makes it much easier to replace my brushes.</li>
            <li> I love my clarisonic and these are much cheaper here than at the store.</li>
            <li> The product itself is fantastic, I use it daily, and the brush heads are crucial to the product, so this is awesome.</li>
            <li> They get my face super clean without any irritation or scratching.  </li>
            <li> You get a fresh cover with each brush which is important to me.  </li>
            <li> but I doubt the generic ones are as good.  </li>
            <li> Really enjoy my Clarisonic Mia, and that these &amp;#34;refills&amp;#34; are available on Amazon for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> shipment arrived quickly but it arrived damaged.  </li>
            <li> The service was quick.  </li>
            <li> Couldve been packaged better to ensure items are new.</li>
            <li> Great price, half as what I used to pay.  </li>
            <li> Regular use most nightly gives your complexion a clean and smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I believe that Clarisonic recommends replacing brush heads every 3 months or so, if you clean &amp; take care of your brushes (make sure you take them off the Clarisonic device to clean under the head) they will last a lot longer.  </li>
            <li> Great price...MUCH better pricing than ULTA which is a few blocks from my house!!!</li>
            <li> I recently have been to an aesthetician who is amazing</li>
            <li> then ordered the sensitive kind and immediately felt a difference - have to say my skin is much happier.</li>
            <li> WELL WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> I like the sensitive brush heads better</li>
            <li> it does not irritate even the most sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> sure how it&#x27;s suppose to be geared toward sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love my Clarisonic and these brushes for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> These are very much worth there</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t come in white boxes as specified, but were packaged safely and were clean.</li>
            <li> The brush heads will come in what looks like an original box, but they aren&#x27;t the real thing.</li>
            <li> The product came on time, and priced right.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are priced right.</li>
            <li> Just right.</li>
            <li> I keep using it right now.</li>
            <li> I have tried both the Sensitive ones and the Normal ones and honestly can&#x27;t say I can tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> Apparently I have to say more...</li>
            <li> These are great for sensitive skin and you really can&#x27;t beat the price because they are double that in the store.</li>
            <li> liked it, the price is very favorable, will come back, would recommend to friends</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I just got lucky, but these seem just like the real thing (because perhaps they are?).</li>
            <li> The Dermstore ships quickly and the product arrives as advertised, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for facial cleansing I use it with the clarisonic facial wash.  </li>
            <li> I like the sensitive brushes as they are easy on your skin but still do a stellar cleaning job.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> , I like it very much</li>
            <li> These brush heads are exactly what I need.  </li>
            <li> most likely</li>
            <li> this is the first time i&#x27;ve ordered from this seller.  </li>
            <li> third - the bristles themselves are already frayed at the top.  </li>
            <li> I did check to make sure it was compatible with my device, but obviously it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is the  first time I haven&#x27;t brought brush heads from a store that carries Clarisonic items.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any woman that wants a fresh look.</li>
            <li> However, i will always shop Amazon.com because they save me so much money!</li>
            <li> I WILL BE PURCHASING MORE IN THE FUTURE.</li>
            <li> They are exact to the ones that came with your clarisonic.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t you can always come back here- thumbs up my review and just buy these. :)</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> Pretty sure the ones I received were counterfeit or generic.</li>
            <li> Packaging looked real but the brush heads didn&#x27;t feel right.</li>
            <li> I find if you wash your brush head with baby shampoo, it comes out very clean; however, I do like to replace occasionally.</li>
            <li> I especially like the sensitive brush heads which do a great job of cleaning but do not rough up my skin</li>
            <li> but when I received my first replacement brush heads they felt much softer than the first time.</li>
            <li> The brushes felt stiffer than my old brush but it also meant my brush is old and i, getting a better cleansing experience with these brushes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the same exact brushes that came with the original product.</li>
            <li> You can buy these in a major department store or online from one of the major shopping channels but you will pay a lot more for them.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, they were much cheaper here than in local stores</li>
            <li> at which point, I noticed the bristles were feeling very abrasive on my face.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> HER FACE THANKS THEM.</li>
            <li> The price was really competitive and Prime shipping is a no brainer.</li>
            <li> It took me forever to try to put the brush head on the Clarisonic, and whenever I try to take off the plastic cover, the whole brush head comes off with it.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS ORDER.</li>
            <li> THANKS.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfy with it.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are NOT THE REAL THING.</li>
            <li> Very scratchy from the get go</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend shopping here for this item!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not worth the $5 difference in price to buy directly from Clarsonic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In addition, the color of the brush, unlike genuine Clarisonic brushes, does not match the white Clarisonic Mia 2 --</li>
            <li> I really like the clarisonic mia.</li>
            <li> and I know this is real.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tossing them straight in the trash.</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This time I got 2 brushes that were knock off&#x27;s not the real Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> I give up, i will shop elsewhere, to much aggravation.</li>
            <li> Bristles too soft compared to genuine sensitive brush heads made by Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> but I can honestly say using the Clarisonic a few times a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clarisonic for several years, and this pair of sensitive brushes are just comfortable and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Obviously in the original packaging, so no worries.</li>
            <li> I was worried that this product would be different than the original brush since they were so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> These are the same product but only at a more reasonable price</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without my Clarisonic!</li>
            <li> and I love the low, low price!!  </li>
            <li> The bristles are clean, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been used, but it definitely isn&#x27;t first quality like the ones you purchase at other locations.  </li>
            <li> value and would highly recommend to anyone that uses a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Packaging allowed one of the boxes to get a little banged up, but otherwise ok.  </li>
            <li> I have had this for a few weeks and at first it was fine.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and gentle, did not irritate my skin at all while doing their work well.  </li>
            <li> These are genuine clarisonic brushes minus the box.  </li>
            <li> This brush works on my really sensitive skin and really has helped minimize my breakouts.</li>
            <li> It works very well on my sensitive skin, keeps breakouts away.</li>
            <li> Many reviewers are saying that these are not genuine Clarisonic products...</li>
            <li> it does a good job orf cleaning the skin with out being irritating.</li>
            <li> But they are much easier on the skin than the deep clean and regular.</li>
            <li> The packaging was very slight so that made it even better.</li>
            <li> She loves her Clarisonic and needed new heads.</li>
            <li> Brand New.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and use the Mia once a day at night</li>
            <li> bought his product for my daughters who have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The first order I received only 1 brush that was taken from a twin pack which was what the ad showed a picture of.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t done a comparison between a brand new non-sensitive brush head and a brand new sensitive brush head, but I think I will stick with sensitive from now on.</li>
            <li> it is feels very soft and sensitive against my face.</li>
            <li> I noticed immediately that my skin feels free from debris, tight-</li>
            <li> The typical Clarisonic brush head has shorter, more coarse brush texture, even for the sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how that&#x27;s possible; maybe there is some soft tip that got worn away from so much</li>
            <li> and my skin stays clear.</li>
            <li> They do not feel as effective and more annoying</li>
            <li> I am a fan of these sensitive brush heads.</li>
            <li> I have relatively sensitive skin</li>
            <li> completely unacceptable.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and these work</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic.com website offers a discount program if you sign up for auto-refills, but despite that discount it&#x27;s still cheaper to purchase the refills at this time from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Clarisonic Mia and I prefer to use the sensitive brush head with the unit.</li>
            <li> They work well on sensitive</li>
            <li> Not only are they different sizes, the cap did not even fit on the knock-off from Amazon, but the bristles were noticeably different.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and got the sensitive head pack, which happens to be the cheapest one.</li>
            <li> i do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic Brush Head Sensitive 2-pack</li>
            <li> so I prefer the sensitive skin brush heads.</li>
            <li> and she suggested me switching to the sensitive brush option for my clarisonic.</li>
            <li> The sensitive brush heads work</li>
            <li> I bought these on here because they were cheaper than purchasing from Sephora or directly from Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I would recommend purchasing directly from Clarisonic or Sephora and not wasting money on these.</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic has changed my skin, I can really tell a difference if I don&#x27;t use it for several days.  </li>
            <li> Using Clarisonic, buy dual brush to save your money.&lt;br /&gt;Suitable if you have sensitive skin or using one in the morning</li>
            <li> I have been using the brush heads for sensitive skin exclusively.</li>
            <li> Feels a little softer than the other brush heads which is nice on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The regular brush heads irritated my skin and caused breakouts, but these sensitive ones have been gentle enough and work well.</li>
            <li> I received my sensitive brush head a week ago and already my skin is starting to clear up!</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase these brush heads as long as the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Really, they are not soft at all.  </li>
            <li> These were actually cheaper than the normal heads</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> This item was exactly what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> , you want them to be able to move quickly back and forth which they can&#x27;t do if you press the brush into skin too hard.  </li>
            <li> The plastic is different on these than the real Clarisonic brush heads, and the middle part melts and falls out of the outer part when cleaning.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted for my mia 2 sensitive clarisonic replacement brushes for less than any where else.</li>
            <li> My original brush heads lasted for a few months, so I was expecting the same thing with these.  </li>
            <li> first - the packaging consisted of two loose, individual brushheads with their caps (the clear plastic ones with the holes that expose the bristles) just floating in a folded piece of white paper.  </li>
            <li> They feel so soft, yet I still get my deep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> order directly from Clarisonic in the future</li>
            <li> I ordered a 2 pack of the Sensitive, and they arrived, packed individually in a brown envelope.  </li>
            <li> I use the deep pore set on auto delivery and I noticed a markedly difference in the texture of the brushes.</li>
            <li> These heads look extremely similar to the clarisonic brand, however they do not perform nearly as well.</li>
            <li> I ordered from 2 different vendors, expecting 2 Clarisonic Sensitive Brushes.  </li>
            <li> Why pay full price at Sephora when you can get the same thing and save a few dollars.</li>
            <li> I actually notice a different in my skin now that I am using a brand new brush.</li>
            <li> If you have alligator skin or you plan no using these on something other than your face, go for it, otherwise, buy the real thing.</li>
            <li> but, not dry-</li>
            <li> The brush length is too long and soft.</li>
            <li> The only downside (with all the Clarisonic brush heads) is that if you live in a humid climate, you have to take the brush head off after each use to let the device dry out.</li>
            <li> These go on and off easily without me being concerned that the machine will get broken.  </li>
            <li> would recommend the sensitive for anyone with areas of dry skin because the normal and acne would be too harsh.</li>
            <li> These brushes do NOT fit properly on my Clarisonic brush and feel completely different, more stiff, than the sensitive brush heads I have purchased in the past from Sephora.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I order the wrong style or not, but they don&#x27;t work as good as brushes  had before.</li>
            <li> Two brushes inside box with no apparent damage to the box.</li>
            <li> I discovered that the regular brush head was too rough on my face and left my skin feeling red and irritated.</li>
            <li> The gray brush head (normal) was too harsh for my face.</li>
            <li> After much internet search through other websites, Amazon offered hands down cheaper ones.  </li>
            <li> my skin doesnt get as dry as when I use the regular brush heads</li>
            <li> i like the sensitive brush head as it is not as harsh as the regular head</li>
            <li> In just 3 days, my face has broken out, I can&#x27;t use the brush for more than a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I changed the one out and replaced with the other one that came and again, the same thing, a sour smell developed after 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> These were described and sold as Clarisonic replacement heads, clearly these are not a genuine product.  </li>
            <li> I never noticed they were rough until I forgot to change the brush head after several weeks,</li>
            <li> , the second brush had the plastic cover jammed onto the brush, damaging the bristles.</li>
            <li> Very poor product that is either a used / refurbished product or a cheap knock off.  </li>
            <li> I would give five stars, but I don&#x27;t think that this is an authentic clarisonic brush head; as it&#x27;s very difficult removing the head from the system.</li>
            <li> since when is it acceptable to ship hygienic beauty/cosmetic products LOOSE?</li>
            <li> These are not very gentle.</li>
            <li> They were just loose in the envelope.  </li>
            <li> but if you order them and realize they are cheap knockoffs you will have to pay for the freight back to them...what a bad joke.</li>
            <li> Not too rough on your skin.  </li>
            <li> They were the same brushes my sister bought me for my birthday but ever since I bought them, I have had trouble with them wanting to fall off my brush.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> They work, but again that was not what I ordered or expected.  </li>
            <li> when i picked up each of the loose brushheads, they came apart and are not fitting back into their sockets.  </li>
            <li> the past I have always used the regular, non-sensitive brush heads.</li>
            <li> The bristles are all spread out (like it&#x27;s been smashed) and overall, the brush has a fuzzy look to it rather than having small tufts of individual bristles, like it usually does.  </li>
            <li> the shower maybe every other day or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they are being made differently....</li>
            <li> but my dog ate my other brushes</li>
            <li> Remember you don&#x27;t need to push hard on your face when using the brush - it should just barely touch your skin so that you don&#x27;t push the bristles down</li>
            <li> and it was a little to rough</li>
            <li> She has used them and they seem to be the real thing or at least made well enough to not explode or do anything weird.</li>
            <li> The bristles are rough on the skin compared to the real Clarisonic brush head and lastly there is a way to spot a fake by looking closely at the back side of the replacement brush head and these are DEFINITELY fake.</li>
            <li> in all, I feel like I got totally ripped off from this, especially since I mistakenly ordered 2 boxes, leaving me with 4 totally useless brush heads.</li>
            <li> Beware, despite a legit-looking box (I compared it to the previous box I kept)</li>
            <li> It feels a little harsher on my skin</li>
            <li> I found them to be inferior to the ones I had purchased from other retailers in the past.</li>
            <li> After about 4 weeks, the brush head started to smell very sour.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not too hard or rough.</li>
            <li> This cleansing &amp; cleaning brush takes all dead skin cells away leaving your face glowing.</li>
            <li> but I like the firm feeling of the brush heads.</li>
            <li> I use my brush everyday.  </li>
            <li> I love my Clairsonic Mia, but hated buying replacement heads at $25 EACH.  </li>
            <li> I get two for way less of the usual price of one, which is what?</li>
            <li> I like this product because I, obviously, use Clarisonic for one and the other, the brush heads can be quite expensive.  </li>
            <li> Very odd.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than in the stores, same quality!</li>
            <li> They last for 2-3 months, so it makes replacement easier and less expensive.</li>
            <li> but the brush head is not too hard and harsh on my face.</li>
            <li> Not genuine product!  </li>
            <li> the fake brushes actually have nothing written on the cover.</li>
            <li> seriously?  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical after reading some of the reviews, but decided to give them a shot.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money; the inside of the brush head doesn&#x27;t match up with my clarisonic and renders it useless.</li>
            <li> Usually, the Clarisonic is very quiet while it vibrates, but with these brush heads, they shake violently with the vibrations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I chalked my breakout to other factors and just stopped using my Clarisonic cold turkey.</li>
            <li> I wrote his name inside his head with a sharpie so it wouldn&#x27;t accidentally get confused with mine.  </li>
            <li> These brush heads do not seem legitimate and I am unhappy with this waste of money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not fit the brush and because I was afraid to damage my Clarisonic brush</li>
            <li> However, after using my clarisonic with these new brushes, I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Nothing about it looked fake and had to go to sephora to compare it.  </li>
            <li> Wish the replacement heads weren&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> But it was too rough on my skin and caused me to breakout with horrible (painful) cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how badly I needed to replace the one I have until these arrived.</li>
            <li> AWFUL</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am a fan of these sensitive brush heads. They feel so soft, yet I still get my deep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I have always used the regular, non-sensitive brush heads. I never noticed they were rough until I forgot to change the brush head after several weeks, at which point, I noticed the bristles were feeling very abrasive on my face. I don&#x27;t know how that&#x27;s possible; maybe there is some soft tip that got worn away from so much use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then ordered the sensitive kind and immediately felt a difference - have to say my skin is much happier. I haven&#x27;t done a comparison between a brand new non-sensitive brush head and a brand new sensitive brush head, but I think I will stick with sensitive from now on.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and gentle, did not irritate my skin at all while doing their work well.  Great price, half as what I used to pay.  I think they are authentic. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Really enjoy my Clarisonic Mia, and that these &amp;#34;refills&amp;#34; are available on Amazon for a reasonable price.  Great gift idea.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are exactly what I need.  They came promptly, packaged correctly, brand new, and at a good price.</li>
            <li> Great deal for these brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clarisonic for several years, and this pair of sensitive brushes are just comfortable and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> These are genuine clarisonic brushes minus the box.  What a great savings.  One brush arrived squashed from shipping but fluffed up.</li>
            <li> I purchased these twin Calrisonic brushes which said (White Box) in the description.  They came wrapped together in butcher type paper and without the box as advertized.  The brushes were to be a stocking stuffer for my daughter in law at Christmas, but this makes them appear used.  I can&#x27;t give them like this.  Amazon will hear about it.</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads at a good price.  They fit perfectly and worked as they should.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my wife. She loves her Clarisonic and needed new heads. Fortunately, they were much cheaper here than in local stores so I picked up like four of them. They didn&#x27;t come in white boxes as specified, but were packaged safely and were clean. She has used them and they seem to be the real thing or at least made well enough to not explode or do anything weird.</li>
            <li> I love my Clarisonic brush and these heads worked great.  I have tried both the Sensitive ones and the Normal ones and honestly can&#x27;t say I can tell a difference.  I have relatively sensitive skin so if I can&#x27;t tell the difference, most likely you can&#x27;t either.  These were actually cheaper than the normal heads so I went with these this time.</li>
            <li> This is a gift for my sister along with the clarisonic machine I ordered for her birthday. She told me that she loved it!</li>
            <li> The clarisonic brush head replacements fit the unit perfectly and were a good value. Thank you very much. Well done.</li>
            <li> I had a good purchasing experience with this seller.  However, after using my clarisonic with these new brushes, I was very disappointed.  My original brush heads lasted for a few months, so I was expecting the same thing with these.  After about 4 weeks, the brush head started to smell very sour.  I changed the one out and replaced with the other one that came and again, the same thing, a sour smell developed after 4 weeks.  I will not buy from this seller again as I do not think the brush quality is the same as what you get from Clarisonic, QVC and Sephora.</li>
            <li> Two brushes inside box with no apparent damage to the box. One brush OK, the second brush had the plastic cover jammed onto the brush, damaging the bristles. It would appear this happened at the factory. Seller bears no responsibility, it was a factory QA problem</li>
            <li> I love my Mia and these replacement heads are just right.  Not too rough on your skin.  I only use it once a day.</li>
            <li> Brush heads didn&#x27;t come in any type of manufacturer packaging.  They were just wrapped in wax paper and placed inside a padded envelope.  Very odd.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using the clarisonic mia for quite some time now and have ordered my fair share of replacement brushheads.  this is the first time i&#x27;ve ordered from this seller.  shipment arrived quickly but it arrived damaged.  first - the packaging consisted of two loose, individual brushheads with their caps (the clear plastic ones with the holes that expose the bristles) just floating in a folded piece of white paper.  seriously?  since when is it acceptable to ship hygienic beauty/cosmetic products LOOSE? without any protective covering (wrapping, plastic, a box, SOMETHING) around the item itself?  second - when i picked up each of the loose brushheads, they came apart and are not fitting back into their sockets.  third - the bristles themselves are already frayed at the top.  completely unacceptable.  will be returning this product immediately.</li>
            <li> I thought this brush head was just like what I had and it is not. It does not spin properly on my Clarisonic device.  I did check to make sure it was compatible with my device, but obviously it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I bought an extra head for my teenager.  I didn&#x27;t want him using mine... ick!  These go on and off easily without me being concerned that the machine will get broken.  I wrote his name inside his head with a sharpie so it wouldn&#x27;t accidentally get confused with mine.  Obviously in the original packaging, so no worries.</li>
            <li> I use a Clarisonic about once a week to help cleanse my skin. These are a great brush head for my skin type and great price!</li>
            <li> This pair of replacement brushes are identical to my wife&#x27;s originals.  Obviously, there is a 150% savings rather than purchasing them on the clarisonic website.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE WONDERFUL. MY WIFE JUST LOVES THEM. SHE USES THEM DAILY. VERY NICE PRICE. WELL WORTH IT. HER FACE THANKS THEM.</li>
            <li> Just as you would get in the store but at a much better price.  These are not too rough, but not too too soft either.  If you have a skin condition outside of just sensitive skin (rosacea, let&#x27;s say) this might be too rough for you.  But they are much easier on the skin than the deep clean and regular.</li>
            <li> Love the Clarisonic; these brush heads were a good price for the two of them.  I have sensitive skin and these work well, no red marks.</li>
            <li> Amazon is the best place to get these refills. I just wish they came in packs of 3 as I try to get them for my daughter and granddaughter when I buy. If you don&#x27;t have one of these machines, they&#x27;re great, get one.</li>
            <li> This is the best price I have found on these brushes.I like my clarisonic but didn&#x27;t like the prices on the brushes most retail want 25$ for just one brush can&#x27;t beat this 2 for almost the price of one.</li>
            <li> This brush works on my really sensitive skin and really has helped minimize my breakouts. I tried the acne one and it was a little to rough and I felt like I broke out more with it. I will only buy these brushes from now on.</li>
            <li> I like the sensitive brush heads better my skin doesnt get as dry as when I use the regular brush heads</li>
            <li> bristle looks separated and course&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt looks like the original product at all&lt;br /&gt;will order directly from Clarisonic in the future</li>
            <li> Work just like the ones that are shipped with the Clarisonic cleaning system&lt;br /&gt;Just wish price was a lot lower, seems the way these companies make money post sale of initial product&lt;br /&gt;OK otherwise</li>
            <li> I love my clarisonic and having a clean brush makes the tool even better!  I use my clarisonic every day and this bundle saves me a fortune! I change my brush head every 3 months and it works fantastically!</li>
            <li> Price:  Amazon is a great place to purchase Clarisonic refills - I have not come across a better deal in a retail store or through another online retailer that has twin packs for $28.  The Clarisonic.com website offers a discount program if you sign up for auto-refills, but despite that discount it&#x27;s still cheaper to purchase the refills at this time from Amazon.  Brush Care &amp; how often to purchase:  I believe that Clarisonic recommends replacing brush heads every 3 months or so, if you clean &amp; take care of your brushes (make sure you take them off the Clarisonic device to clean under the head) they will last a lot longer.  Remember you don&#x27;t need to push hard on your face when using the brush - it should just barely touch your skin so that you don&#x27;t push the bristles down, you want them to be able to move quickly back and forth which they can&#x27;t do if you press the brush into skin too hard.  I clean my brushes once a week by brushing over the bristles with rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball and that&#x27;s seemed to work well for me.</li>
            <li> Not genuine product!  Bristles too soft compared to genuine sensitive brush heads made by Clarisonic.  Packaging looked real but the brush heads didn&#x27;t feel right.</li>
            <li> These  are the best and I love the low, low price!!  Great value!!  They work perfectly on my Clarisonic Mia</li>
            <li> The regular brush heads irritated my skin and caused breakouts, but these sensitive ones have been gentle enough and work well. The only downside (with all the Clarisonic brush heads) is that if you live in a humid climate, you have to take the brush head off after each use to let the device dry out. Otherwise, the metal connectors will rust.</li>
            <li> I like the sensitive brushes as they are easy on your skin but still do a stellar cleaning job. The price was really competitive and Prime shipping is a no brainer.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Clarisonic Mia and I prefer to use the sensitive brush head with the unit. I found the brush head comfortable and did not irritate my skin. The gray brush head (normal) was too harsh for my face. Works well with my facial cleansers and has helped my skin&#x27;s overall condition.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted for my mia 2 sensitive clarisonic replacement brushes for less than any where else. Brushes are perfect arrived in box and are exactly like the original.</li>
            <li> Very good price. At $32.50a 2-pack they are almost $12 cheaper than the best price anywhere else .</li>
            <li> I was worried that this product would be different than the original brush since they were so inexpensive. Have no fear! They&#x27;re the same exact brushes that came with the original product. I was told to change brushes every 3 months so I will definitely be returning for future purchases.</li>
            <li> Work well, excellent price</li>
            <li> Very poor product that is either a used / refurbished product or a cheap knock off.  Either way these are [b]NOT FROM CLAIRSONIC.</li>
            <li> I love my clarisonic  and ordering from amazon makes it much easier to replace my brushes. The sensitive brush heads seem most comfortable but effective for my skin.</li>
            <li> Love not having to go to the mall to pick these up! The packaging was very slight so that made it even better.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are a great product.  They work well on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase these for my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> This is the  first time I haven&#x27;t brought brush heads from a store that carries Clarisonic items. These brushes do NOT fit properly on my Clarisonic brush and feel completely different, more stiff, than the sensitive brush heads I have purchased in the past from Sephora. It took me forever to try to put the brush head on the Clarisonic, and whenever I try to take off the plastic cover, the whole brush head comes off with it. These brush heads do not seem legitimate and I am unhappy with this waste of money.</li>
            <li> This cleansing &amp; cleaning brush takes all dead skin cells away leaving your face glowing. I would recommend this to any woman that wants a fresh look. I found using the soft brush daily is perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love clarisonic and i Love Amazon.com.I saved 15 bucks on these brushes by buying through you.Although the description says white box,they were not in any box.Couldve been packaged better to ensure items are new.However, i will always shop Amazon.com because they save me so much money!</li>
            <li> I love my Clarisonic and this was the best deal and most excellent service I have found for ordering replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have a Clarisonic Mia, and these replacement heads are great.  I actually purchased the two pack and put one in her stocking for Christmas!</li>
            <li> perfect!  It&#x27;s exactly what I expected.  Packaged, quality product.  Apparently I have to say more...well, I DO honestly love my clarisonic.  It has practically eliminated my breakouts.</li>
            <li> This is a great replacement pack for the clarisonic and the price was much better than else where. My daughter is very happy with these.</li>
            <li> Why pay full price at Sephora when you can get the same thing and save a few dollars. I will be buying all my Clarisonic heads through here in the future. Great deal!!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re currently processing your review and we will email you at 327484636@qq.com as soon as this is complete.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it, the price is very favorable, will come back, would recommend to friends, I like it very much</li>
            <li> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS ORDER. I LOOKED EVERYWHERE AND THESE WERE MORE MONEY. I WILL BE PURCHASING MORE IN THE FUTURE. THANKS.</li>
            <li> However, both brushes in the twin pack, once attached to my Mia 2, do not vibrate/move/clean like they are supposed to.  I will be returning this order.</li>
            <li> If you do- these work. They are exact to the ones that came with your clarisonic. That being said- I think you should look out on groupon or nomorerack and you might be able to find these cheaper. If you can&#x27;t you can always come back here- thumbs up my review and just buy these. :)</li>
            <li> It is very good.And the price is very attractive.I will buy it again after these two was used.I am very satisfy with it.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are NOT THE REAL THING. Here&#x27;s how you can tell:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The brush length is too long and soft. The typical Clarisonic brush head has shorter, more coarse brush texture, even for the sensitive skin kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. When you put these on the Clarisonic, they rattle around when the Clarisonic is turned on. Usually, the Clarisonic is very quiet while it vibrates, but with these brush heads, they shake violently with the vibrations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. If you try to put this brush head in a Clarisonic brush head case (one that came off a brush head actually sold at the Clarisonic counter at Ulta), it refuses to snap in securely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I feel like I got totally ripped off from this, especially since I mistakenly ordered 2 boxes, leaving me with 4 totally useless brush heads.</li>
            <li> These were described and sold as Clarisonic replacement heads, clearly these are not a genuine product.  I had to go out and purchase the actual clarisonic heads at the store, took them home and compared them with these that were purchased from Amazon.  Not only are they different sizes, the cap did not even fit on the knock-off from Amazon, but the bristles were noticeably different. I would not recommend these brushes at all.</li>
            <li> The product came on time, and priced right. It was a birthday present for the girl friend. She&#x27;s checking it out to see if it is as good as people say.</li>
            <li> Feels a little softer than the other brush heads which is nice on my sensitive skin. Easy to operate and use.</li>
            <li> First of all, they did not arrive in any kind of manufacturer&#x27;s box or packaging. The bristles are rough on the skin compared to the real Clarisonic brush head and lastly there is a way to spot a fake by looking closely at the back side of the replacement brush head and these are DEFINITELY fake.</li>
            <li> These are not very gentle. Very scratchy from the get go</li>
            <li> This is a knock-off brand. The brush heads destroyed my skin. I finally went to Nordstrom to buy a different head (the actual brand ) and they don&#x27;t even look the same (this brand&#x27;s bristles are taller). AWFUL</li>
            <li> my daughter and wife loves it</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t buy knock-offs. Although expensive, nothing will work better with the Clarisonic</li>
            <li> I have a Clarisonic and obviously need to replace the brushes periodically.  This was a great price and attached to my cleaner without a problem.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than in the stores, same quality! Will purchase again! Thank You for the great offer, very much appreciated!</li>
            <li> I find if you wash your brush head with baby shampoo, it comes out very clean; however, I do like to replace occasionally.</li>
            <li> I ordered the &amp;#34;Clarasonic Dual Brush Head Pack&amp;#34; but only received one brush head.  When the second brush head is received, I will revise this low rating.</li>
            <li> If I ordered this, it was years ago</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without my Clarisonic! Amazon has the best prices of anyone, and it doesn&#x27;t take a week for my orders to reach me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would be able to find one yet alone two brush heads for the price I paid. I get two for way less of the usual price of one, which is what? About $25? I would give five stars, but I don&#x27;t think that this is an authentic clarisonic brush head; as it&#x27;s very difficult removing the head from the system. It functions just the same as the regular brush head. I have sensitive skin and got the sensitive head pack, which happens to be the cheapest one. Definitely repurchasing!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I recently ordered the deep pore brush as a replacement for this one because it was cheaper. But it was too rough on my skin and caused me to breakout with horrible (painful) cystic acne. I chalked my breakout to other factors and just stopped using my Clarisonic cold turkey. Then I researched brush head reviews and found that I was not the only one who had a reaction to the deep pore brush. I received my sensitive brush head a week ago and already my skin is starting to clear up! I&#x27;m so glad because I really do love using my Clarisonic. I will continue to purchase these brush heads as long as the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Many reviewers are saying that these are not genuine Clarisonic products...&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I just got lucky, but these seem just like the real thing (because perhaps they are?). I got these for my girlfriend (by her request), and she seems very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> love this! i do have sensitive skin and i use this about 2 or 3 times per week. I haven&#x27;t had a breakout in 2 months</li>
            <li> These brushes are great!  The price for this item was amazing...much lower than I have seen anywhere else.  I would highly recommend shopping here for this item!</li>
            <li> I love my Clarisonic! These brush heads are priced right.</li>
            <li> Fit and worked perfectly on my mia</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes now for over a year. I just love them. They&#x27;re not too hard or rough. Just right. Once I&#x27;m done cleansing my face, it just feels so clean. Also, sluffing off the day and exfoliating, makes my pores look smaller.</li>
            <li> These brushes are not what I thought they were. I only bought them because they were cheaper here than at ULTA. They were the same brushes my sister bought me for my birthday but ever since I bought them, I have had trouble with them wanting to fall off my brush.</li>
            <li> Cheap Knock off, I would not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the $5 difference in price to buy directly from Clarsonic.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for the Clarisonic Mia. I have very sensitive skin and use the Mia once a day at night and it&#x27;s a dream for your skin. I noticed immediately that my skin feels free from debris, tight- but, not dry- and my skin stays clear. I wouldn&#x27;t use a different brush head as the sensitive is perfect.</li>
            <li> bought his product for my daughters who have very sensitive skin. it does a good job orf cleaning the skin with out being irritating.</li>
            <li> Great deal considering and fit perfectly and worked fantastically</li>
            <li> If you have downloaded music this is an awesome product. Now I can listen to my music no commercials etc. If you drive several hours a day this is the product fir you.</li>
            <li> I love my clarisonic, and was very happy to find replacement heads at a good price.  The service was quick.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I LOVE my Clarisonic and when it was time to change out the brush head, I ordered these,  They are perfect!</li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d read the reviews better before I bought these.  I ordered a 2 pack of the Sensitive, and they arrived, packed individually in a brown envelope.  The brush heads themselves weren&#x27;t in any kind of box or sealed packaging and didn&#x27;t have any sealed wrapper on them.  They were just loose in the envelope.  I do believe they are authentic, but I think they could be rejects for quality reasons.  The bristles are all spread out (like it&#x27;s been smashed) and overall, the brush has a fuzzy look to it rather than having small tufts of individual bristles, like it usually does.  The bristles are clean, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been used, but it definitely isn&#x27;t first quality like the ones you purchase at other locations.  The plastic covers do say Clairsonic across the top, but I have purchased authentic ones before that just had a squiggly line across the top (another reviewer mentioned this and thought they weren&#x27;t authentic).  They do fit my Clairsonic Mia and seem to work fine, so I will use them.  I guess you get what you pay for, but next time, I&#x27;ll probably get them elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to everyone and anyone. I love my clarisonic and these are much cheaper here than at the store. This is perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This item, if original, gets 5 stars. The Clarisonic Brush Head Sensitive 2-pack I received from seller b-glowing is COUNTERFEIT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not fit the brush and because I was afraid to damage my Clarisonic brush I didn&#x27;t want to make it fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the color of the brush, unlike genuine Clarisonic brushes, does not match the white Clarisonic Mia 2 -- another giveaway it&#x27;s a fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To top things off, when I took the second brush out of the box, a piece of a bracket fell out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B-glowing sells counterfeit brushes. Beware, despite a legit-looking box (I compared it to the previous box I kept), it&#x27;s a knockoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had this problem with prior purchases of twin pack Mia 2 replacement heads until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b-glowing seller link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/seller/at-a-glance.html?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;seller&#x3D;A2N1A581RPHNSW</li>
            <li> I order one set of brush head, one set means 2 head brushes.&lt;br /&gt;you just sent me one brush, I email you for another one.&lt;br /&gt;its been 3 months already......  still no contact from you !</li>
            <li> Great price...MUCH better pricing than ULTA which is a few blocks from my house!!! I didn&#x27;t realize how badly I needed to replace the one I have until these arrived. I will be ordering more soon so I can keep extra on hand!</li>
            <li> i like the sensitive brush head as it is not as harsh as the regular head yet it still cleans your face well.  it does not irritate even the most sensitive skin.  love my clarisonic!</li>
            <li> This product is an excellent value if you have a Clarisonic. I&#x27;ve not seen a better price, sale or otherwise, anywhere.</li>
            <li> I know this seems like a frivolous item for your skin care regime but I can honestly say using the Clarisonic a few times a week DOES make  all the difference in how clear and bright my skin is. I have fair, freckled skin with some sun damage so I prefer the sensitive skin brush heads. I just use with some Cetaphil mild cleanser (which I LOVE too)in the shower maybe every other day or so. I do rinse the brush well and dab on a towel each time, but after about a 2-3 months I do notice the brush head getting a bit stinky from being in the shower so I switch it out. I do not go to the \\&quot;spa\\&quot; regularly or get facials so I justify the brush head replacement cost easily. Plus Cetaphil is an inexpensive cleanser.</li>
            <li> Pretty Good! It is a nice product and I really like it! I keep using it right now. I made a good choice!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel a difference from the original brush I received and the sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how it&#x27;s suppose to be geared toward sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Any one who doesn&#x27;t have a clarisonic should definitely get one. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it. I definitely recommend getting this pack. I switch my brush out every couple of months if not once a month.</li>
            <li> These brushes are terrific at a terrific price.  Fit the Clarisonic perfectly.  Skip the stores and the website; buy these instead.</li>
            <li> This item was exactly what I expected it to be. The quality is great and I plan on ordering it again.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads came in record timing. I purchased a Clarisonic many months ago and started seeing the signs that I needed to replace the heads. I now know I will need to replace them every 3 months. Great purchase and great delivery!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they are being made differently....It feels a little harsher on my skin then prior brush heads....but I still love my Clarisonic!</li>
            <li> What a great brush...I recently have been to an aesthetician who is amazing and she suggested me switching to the sensitive brush option for my clarisonic. Anyway, she was right, and this brush is phenomenally awesome. Love love love!</li>
            <li> Brand New. Sealed Box. Arrived sooner than expected. I actually notice a different in my skin now that I am using a brand new brush.</li>
            <li> These are great for sensitive skin and you really can&#x27;t beat the price because they are double that in the store.</li>
            <li> Love my Clarisonic and these brushes for my sensitive skin.  This was a good value also over most retailers I have found.</li>
            <li> Best price I found for these on Amazon.  I really like the clarisonic mia. The sensitive brush heads work well w/ my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Clarasonic for many years and these are the brush heads that work best for me on an everyday basis.</li>
            <li> I bought these on here because they were cheaper than purchasing from Sephora or directly from Clarisonic. I found them to be inferior to the ones I had purchased from other retailers in the past. I would recommend purchasing directly from Clarisonic or Sephora and not wasting money on these.</li>
            <li> These brushes get the job done. They are a fraction of the cost but the basically the same quality.</li>
            <li> Packaging allowed one of the boxes to get a little banged up, but otherwise ok.  Good price for 2 pack.</li>
            <li> heads fit my device well as if I ordered from website-- but i saved a lot of money. would recommend the sensitive for anyone with areas of dry skin because the normal and acne would be too harsh. especially during winter.</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic has changed my skin, I can really tell a difference if I don&#x27;t use it for several days.  Using the brush once a day feels like a spa treatment! I have acne prone skin and the sensitive heads are perfect for me.  The Dermstore ships quickly and the product arrives as advertised, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love my Clarisonic but you have to change out the heads or you start to break out. This was the fix I needed.</li>
            <li> I received it as a present last year and I love it...but when I received my first replacement brush heads they felt much softer than the first time. I use the deep pore set on auto delivery and I noticed a markedly difference in the texture of the brushes. I don&#x27;t know if this helps but I like the firm feeling of the brush heads.</li>
            <li> I love Clarisonic, but do not buy from Discount Accessories and More. The brush heads will come in what looks like an original box, but they aren&#x27;t the real thing. The plastic is different on these than the real Clarisonic brush heads, and the middle part melts and falls out of the outer part when cleaning. This was when I poured boiling water over it, which I have always done to clean my brush heads, and have never had a problem before.</li>
            <li> Nothing about it looked fake and had to go to sephora to compare it.  The brushes felt stiffer than my old brush but it also meant my brush is old and i, getting a better cleansing experience with these brushes. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now and I know this is real. Nothing is falling out or out of shape. The cover says it is clarisonic. I read somewhere the fake brushes actually have nothing written on the cover. Summary box, brush, cover, fit, durability, color and quality says it is like the one in sephora. I ordered 4 boxes from the various sellers with prime shipping and some had a ziplock plastic on each brush. The one in sephora was not in a ziplock.  Either way all of them looked and feel authentic.</li>
            <li> Clarisonic is one of the best beauty brands I have found so far. I would recommend this product to any women.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for exfoliating one&#x27;s face. These are very much worth there value and would highly recommend to anyone that uses a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I love my clarisonic, and this is the best brushes for my sensitive skin, great price, Dept. stores much higher.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very wonderful</li>
            <li> These are not OEM products but cheap knockoffs.  Not only that but if you order them and realize they are cheap knockoffs you will have to pay for the freight back to them...what a bad joke.</li>
            <li> Using Clarisonic, buy dual brush to save your money.&lt;br /&gt;Suitable if you have sensitive skin or using one in the morning</li>
            <li> this product is cheaper than buying it from the stores.  I use my brush everyday.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I received this item in the condition described and in a timely manner. Great product and efficient seller. The double-pack is the way to go for replacement brush heads. They last for 2-3 months, so it makes replacement easier and less expensive.</li>
            <li> Waste of money; the inside of the brush head doesn&#x27;t match up with my clarisonic and renders it useless. No oscillating, nothing. These replacement heads came in a battered clarisonic box but I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s a total scam. Buyer beware!!</li>
            <li> The product itself is fantastic, I use it daily, and the brush heads are crucial to the product, so this is awesome.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure the ones I received were counterfeit or generic. It still in the clarisonic box. Will only but from the clarisonic website or from sephora from now on.</li>
            <li> The brushes are perfect for my clarisonic.  They get my face super clean without any irritation or scratching.  You get a fresh cover with each brush which is important to me.  I love the convenience of the two pack.</li>
            <li> You can buy these in a major department store or online from one of the major shopping channels but you will pay a lot more for them. These are the same product but only at a more reasonable price</li>
            <li> This is a great product for facial cleansing I use it with the clarisonic facial wash.  Regular use most nightly gives your complexion a clean and smooth finish.</li>
            <li> These come wrap in plastic with no box and no writing.  They have fewer bristles than the clarisonic version you get from stores that sell the unit, and they hurt!  Really, they are not soft at all.  In just 3 days, my face has broken out, I can&#x27;t use the brush for more than a few seconds. I&#x27;m tossing them straight in the trash. If you have alligator skin or you plan no using these on something other than your face, go for it, otherwise, buy the real thing.</li>
            <li> Wish the replacement heads weren&#x27;t so expensive but I doubt the generic ones are as good.  I will probably try the rip-offs in the future.</li>
            <li> Great product. Skin glows !!</li>
            <li> I especially like the sensitive brush heads which do a great job of cleaning but do not rough up my skin</li>
            <li> I have been using the Mia Clarisonic for several years now. I discovered that the regular brush head was too rough on my face and left my skin feeling red and irritated. I have been using the brush heads for sensitive skin exclusively.</li>
            <li> Love the Clarisonic &amp; the brushes! Recommend them to anyone who purchases the Clarisonic. I use my Clarisonic twice a day.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find the name brand brush head refills for the Clarisonic at such at great price.</li>
            <li> I like this product because I, obviously, use Clarisonic for one and the other, the brush heads can be quite expensive.  After much internet search through other websites, Amazon offered hands down cheaper ones.  My Clarisonic dual brush head pack came nicely packaged and compact so the brush head was intact.  I was happy and satisfied purchasing and receiving my product and so I plan to continue my order through Amazon and with its manufacturer.</li>
            <li> These heads look extremely similar to the clarisonic brand, however they do not perform nearly as well. They do not feel as effective and more annoying is that the heads do not come off of the handheld easily.  I am concerned I&#x27;m going to break it when removing the heads from the device. I definitely will not purchase these again!!</li>
            <li> I have had this for a few weeks and at first it was fine.  But the brush started hurting my face, which does not make sense because it is for \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; skin.  Also, the brush is beginning to yellow, which would did not happen to my actual Clarisonic brush that I bought from the company.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than buying from Clarisonic. It works very well on my sensitive skin, keeps breakouts away. I love these and will buy them again</li>
            <li> Got to be carefull who it is you are buying from with these products.  The ones I got were not brand name and were not indiviually sealed.  For me with this type of product it&#x27;s better to go to the store where you know what your getting.</li>
            <li> I love the clarisonic product but my dog ate my other brushes so I replaced them and they work fine!</li>
            <li> This product is okay.  I&#x27;ve had better brushes. I&#x27;m not sure if I order the wrong style or not, but they don&#x27;t work as good as brushes  had before.</li>
            <li> Fits and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> These were a great deal.  I love my Clairsonic Mia, but hated buying replacement heads at $25 EACH.  These are great.  I was a little skeptical after reading some of the reviews, but decided to give them a shot.  I received a twin pack of Clairsonic brush heads just as described.  They are genuine.</li>
            <li> I use this with my Clarisonic MIA and it works amazing. it is feels very soft and sensitive against my face. highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I ordered from 2 different vendors, expecting 2 Clarisonic Sensitive Brushes.  The first order I received only 1 brush that was taken from a twin pack which was what the ad showed a picture of.  I sent it back and asked for a return.  Then I ordered from the second company.  This time I got 2 brushes that were knock off&#x27;s not the real Clarisonic.  They work, but again that was not what I ordered or expected.  I give up, i will shop elsewhere, to much aggravation.</li>
            <li> I feel like my face is getting cleaned but the brush head is not too hard and harsh on my face. I would recommend this.</li>
