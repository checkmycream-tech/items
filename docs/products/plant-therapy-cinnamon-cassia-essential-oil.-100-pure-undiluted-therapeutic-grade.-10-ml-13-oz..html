            <li>:)  I successfully held oral thrush (side effect of prednisone) at bay whilst waiting for my doc to return from vacation by rinsing with 2 drops of cinnamon and 2 drops of tea tree oils TID.</li>

            <li>Love Plant therapy!</li>
            <li>Im crafty-I can make it better!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Great strong scent for my candles and soaps.</li>
            <li>The dropper that is already built into the bottle is very handy because it makes it easy to measure.</li>
            <li>I used this product for my pinecones for a nice spicy scent for my home.</li>
            <li>Product good for many things.  </li>
            <li>Used to create my own lip plumper</li>
            <li>I liked the container it came in.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a nice quality oil..</li>
            <li>was thrilled to have a chance to get this at a discount for my honest review</li>
            <li>It reinfused my previously-cinnamon-smelling pine cones so effectively that my husband noticed it.</li>
            <li>Adds a nice aroma to the room you put this in.  </li>
            <li>This oil diffuses perfectly, smells great and helps with my headaches when mixed with peppermint.</li>
            <li>But it still smells nice &amp; I can see using it to scent the house.</li>
            <li>I bought it to make my own Lip plumper which I did</li>
            <li>It smells nice</li>
            <li>Bought this oil to make my own anti-bacterial cleaning spray (water and vinegar and oils..</li>
            <li>I use it to make my own germ-fighting blend.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and works as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>I used it to make my own Thieves oil blend--and it was just what I needed.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own since</li>
            <li>It also crystalized all around the cap effectively clogging the dropper.</li>
            <li>I purchased this oil to add a nice cinnamon smell to my family room.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I thought I might make my own spicey cologne.  </li>
            <li>I used it in my Scentsy warmer and it created a nice scent in my kitchen.  </li>
            <li>While this may be good for cleaning, it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;Ceylon&amp;#34; cinnamon - which is better for your health than cassia.  </li>
            <li>I was making my own thieves blend and needed cinnamon.  </li>
            <li>make my own lotion from coconut oil and almond oil</li>
            <li>Shipper had it nicely wrapped in a bubble wrap bag so</li>
            <li>Handy oil for balm mixtures.</li>
            <li>I sprinkle this on my brown carpets so my house smells nice</li>
            <li>The oil is highly aromatic and works wonderfully for my homemade soaps..  </li>
            <li>Received product as described, it is of high quality and the scent is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, great quality.</li>
            <li>This is good, aromatic, strong flavored oil.  </li>
            <li>, it is very strong if burnt with a candle warmer.</li>
            <li>Very strong.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t yet tried it, but am sure I will love it when I do!</li>
            <li>Very nice and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I think you could make a wonderful, all natural mouthwash with the peppermint oil, or a blend of whatever you like, too.  </li>
            <li>It will add the smell of fresh baked cookies and makes a great gift.</li>
            <li>Plant Therapy even puts the name of the fragrance on top of the bottle - nice touch.</li>
            <li>The cinnamon bark was warm, spicy and pungent, nothing overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work amazing in an aromatherapy diffuser.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong and authentic!</li>
            <li>Nice strong scent but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>This oil is nice and strong, with a lingering scent even when it&#x27;s not being warmed.</li>
            <li>but I am new to oils but these seem good for non edible uses and you cant beat the price!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this smell and have gotten tons of complements.</li>
            <li>the price per larger unit used to be excellent.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it is therapeutic grade.  </li>
            <li>If you like the smell of cinnamon add a couple drops to some cheap lipgloss for a nice, tingly, lip venom effect.  </li>
            <li>Love this oil.</li>
            <li>Really potent.</li>
            <li>I have been 100% pleased with the oils.</li>
            <li>I mix it with lemon and let it simmer on my stove top and it makes my place smell</li>
            <li>smell is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love the cinnamon smell.  </li>
            <li>I love Cinnamon 100%.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for great product.</li>
            <li>I think an electric heater works better than a flame for these oils.</li>
            <li>I got this oil and used a Q-Tip to some run around the outlet plate and around where we saw them the most.</li>
            <li>I like to combine it with my vanilla perfume because many men and women like the scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to use as a deodorant but don&#x27;t use it straight because it can burn the skin.</li>
            <li>However I thought it would be more of a cinnamon smell</li>
            <li>Very affordable and seems to be of great quality.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>The scent is great, but the color and consistency isn&#x27;t good for my planned use of the essential oil.</li>
            <li>Love the smell in my diffuser.</li>
            <li>Ok scent.</li>
            <li>Ok strength.</li>
            <li>Ok, ok ok....</li>
            <li>I love this aroma.</li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m content with the scent could be better.</li>
            <li>I already added more scents  from this company to my wish list on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try more.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product and recommend for purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this and use it in my burner every day.</li>
            <li>They smell is okay for this.</li>
            <li>and I was looking for something stronger with more of a cinnamon scent.</li>
            <li>I wanted to add it to my scented wax warmer for more of a cinnamon scent</li>
            <li>The rest were sealed appropriately.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t an overwhelming scent and does not have a &amp;#34;fake fragrance&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>I love Plant Therapy oils.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THE SCENT THO.</li>
            <li>Love this scent.</li>
            <li>I want to love this oil, but of all the oils I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon, this one just missed the mark.</li>
            <li>We have gas heat and when the heat runs, it makes our home smell lovely.  </li>
            <li>I love using this scent in our home during the fall season.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely Love this oil.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful company to buy essential oils from!</li>
            <li>(you could also drop a couple drops into your favorite lip gloss).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments and literally given out some homemade shea butter / cinnamon oil lip salve as gifts (I use Now brand shea butter).</li>
            <li>..not sure.</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>So I recently found this awesome lip plumper made by Bite Cosmetics.</li>
            <li>but I want to LOVE it.</li>
            <li>still love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love to put it on my feet.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>The.product is great and service was fast..</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more of this brand of oils in future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have more food.</li>
            <li>Love the product :)</li>
            <li>I love cinnamon and put in almost everything I eat.</li>
            <li>gloss,,,I find so many uses for it.  </li>
            <li>It is very fragrant and hopefully would work to help keep bacteria and viruses away!!!!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I tried Cinnamon Oil , and very happy because it is so much easier and convenient compared to Cinnamon Powder.</li>
            <li>It smells kind of sweet to me, which I love.</li>
            <li>( these products are so good you don&#x27;t need very much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got such a strong and wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>The aroma is warm, sweet, and spicy with no synthetic or chemical-y undertones.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells pretty good</li>
            <li>But, a lot of people claim that cinnamon is good for us, so I am willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Very good product, I would definitely order this again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure, smells amazing (but strong!)</li>
            <li>Received in perfect, expected condition.</li>
            <li>Wonderful smell and made a great lip plumper balm mixed with coconut oil.i am going to make pumpkin cinnamon soap next weekend.</li>
            <li>But, for the paltry price, it&#x27;s pretty nice stuff. :)</li>
            <li>This has a nice fresh cinnamon scent with an undertone of a woodsey scent.</li>
            <li>Good price, fast shipping, no complaints.</li>
            <li>It smells good, but it did absolutely nothing to my lips..</li>
            <li>This oil is strong and very sweet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may be a wonderful product for other uses, but not moles.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, but that is a personal observation, I love the smell of cinnamon.</li>
            <li>, it makes it easy to just get a drop at a time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too strong and I can&#x27;t use it for my scalp.  </li>
            <li>I used this to make scented soy candles and while the candles has a strong cinnamon smell when you put it up to your nose, it is practically odorless when it burns.</li>
            <li>I decided to taste it just to see how strong it was</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s so strong</li>
            <li>Not as strong as it used to be.</li>
            <li>This is strong, strong stuff.  </li>
            <li>The aroma is strong, but the diffuser keeps it from being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I add the scent to my Scentsy warmer because I feel the scents are no longer as strong as they once were.</li>
            <li>Strong stuff.</li>
            <li>This is highly strong oil, do not put it on skin undiluted, it will burn you.</li>
            <li>This stuff is STRONG.</li>
            <li>Strong I like it ...</li>
            <li>It is not as strong a scent as I would have preferred.</li>
            <li>Not too strong after stung either.</li>
            <li>Strong cinnamony scent that fills the room.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any comparison but this seems like an excellent product to me, has the right smell and taste and the dispensing dropper works properly.</li>
            <li>if it is true bark oil it should have more aroma than this has.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fragrance when it&#x27;s first opened is really nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong and doesn&#x27;t take much to give a lovely scent to homemade lotions and scrubs.</li>
            <li>Its very strong but its good for your lips to get pumper or bigger....</li>
            <li>It does smell a bit stronger than the doterra oil, but since I use it blended as a muscle rub, its works fine.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fine.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this EO very much!</li>
            <li>Very potent High quality</li>
            <li>So strong and rich.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a couple of seconds, I&#x27;d realized I should be a Bluth, because I&#x27;d made a huge mistake.</li>
            <li>Eh, seems cheap.  </li>
            <li>I ave been using Plant Therapy products for a few months now and have been quite impressed.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fantastic).  </li>
            <li>I like a clean strong cinnamon scent.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to worry about light affecting</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to use sparingly so as not to overpower others when mixing.</li>
            <li>However, if you are even the slightest bit sensitive (skin wise), don&#x27;t get it on your skin...</li>
            <li>They had a certain particular scent, and smelled great</li>
            <li>Put it on my pine cones and never smelt it again, added more and still no smell of Cinnamon after 10 min unless it was right under your nose.</li>
            <li>when they burned, This oil smells exactly like them, and i&#x27;m sure this must be what they used.</li>
            <li>so it isn&#x27;t full strength, and I also enjoy the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The scent of this oil is extremely rich and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>This small purchase turned out to be one of my best purchases of the year.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, I use it when making my chapsticks a couple of drops goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I still think it worked, because dudes love funny chicks and the situation was nothing if not</li>
            <li>This oil has a rich, intoxicating cinnamon scent.</li>
            <li>Smells good and works just as good as any other cinnamon oil I purchased, but at a much lower price.</li>
            <li>The aftertaste is clean and sweet.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special, but nothing to rave about.</li>
            <li>This is fresh, nice and spicy and true to taste, can highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The smell was great, but be careful.  </li>
            <li>This cinnamon bark oil smells nothing like the holiday-type sweet smell I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>The Cinnamon Bark essential oil smells good.  </li>
            <li>Will make your wildest dreams come true</li>
            <li>Yoda says,&amp;#34;ummgh essential oil good no?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>for me the smell is to sweet.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t intend it for consumption, but wanted the true scent of cinnamon which is not always the case with scents intended for aroma.  </li>
            <li>It is good, but too much obviously becomes overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Good quality essential oil.</li>
            <li>This definitely smells good -- just like cinnamon, as I&#x27;d expect.  </li>
            <li>This is a really good cinnamon essential oil.</li>
            <li>It has a nice aroma, but the intensity fades very quickly and doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>The peppermint, vanilla, and lemon were all fine (I dip the corners of the index cards we are working on in them), but the cinnamon bark doesn&#x27;t smell very much like cinnamon to me.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when it came in, I popped the lid off straight away, and put some of the deliciously smelling essential oil directly on my lips.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>The cinnamon smell did not overpower and dissipated fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>This product most definitely smells like cinnamon and has become a staple for most of my blends.  </li>
            <li>also - and this is the main reason I love this - use it as a lip plumper.</li>
            <li>Luckily, the pain subsided after about 20 seconds, at which point I acknowledged I am truly an idiot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was just what I wanted, and quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>Just as described and quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>Smells great but not very strong.</li>
            <li>P&amp;T is a  essential oil that lasts a long time and the aroma is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I checked local stores, higher prices and not so good.</li>
            <li>I found some instructions online and followed them perfectly; however, the smell just didn&#x27;t last that long.  </li>
            <li>Gee, thanks!!</li>
            <li>and it is the perfect strength ... not too &#x27;hot&#x27; nor too weak or sweet smelling.  </li>
            <li>really a few drop in my steam infuser works great.</li>
            <li>Put a few drops in my diffuser and immediately my room smelled great.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how essential oils can flow throughout your body in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li>Looking for a more natural fragrance for the Holidays?  </li>
            <li>Reminds me of fresh cinnamon rolls in the morning.</li>
            <li>MY GRAND DAUGHTER HAS SENSITIVE SKIN AND BROKE OUT WHEN I TOUCHED HER WITH THE CINNAMON ON MY FINGERTIPS.  </li>
            <li>I ultimately poured the whole bottle in the warmer and got a good day out of it.</li>
            <li>I bought the Cinnamon Oil to add a fresh scent to the inside of my refrigerator.</li>
            <li>Instead of the hubbs coming home to a delicious smelling wife, he walked in on me feverishly trying to tend to the bright red welt on my neck &amp; wrists with a wet washcloth.</li>
            <li>when used PROPERLY, a little in the right places, it smells great.  </li>
            <li>Excellent and my clients actually prefer the taste as it&#x27;s smoother than any other Cinnamon Bark.</li>
            <li>The shipping is always quick, and the customer service is stellar.</li>
            <li>and I know the oil is good for lip plumping when diluted with some beeswax or other oil.  </li>
            <li>because why break the bank if you don&#x27;t have to, right?</li>
            <li>I accidentally spilled a drop on my media cabinet and did not notice right away.  </li>
            <li>The oil is very strong and I only use 5 drops and I can taste it.  </li>
            <li>A few drops in a spray bottle with water or alcohol keep the ants out and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Usually it&#x27;s too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Luckily, good old Amazon came thru for me &amp; the Cinnamon Bark Essential Oil came in record time.</li>
            <li>Right from the bottle the cinnamon smell was powerful and there was no need to have to use to much in my body scrub.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipper and just as described and boy</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced too!</li>
            <li>The smell is not to my personal liking, I think I was expecting more of a cinnamon pinecone smell - my fault for thinking that.</li>
            <li>I was making some homemade air/linen freshener, and this gave my mixture exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>First test it out on yourself though</li>
            <li>I love all of Plant Therapy&#x27;s essential oils.</li>
            <li>I am a massage therapist, and love to theme the scents in my room to the season (as much as possible), So this is one that I used for the Holidays!!  </li>
            <li>Over priced, cent does not last for more than a couple of days.</li>
            <li>This item was exactly what I ordered - wanted to add to shampoo as an aid to stop hair loss - hope it works.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t intended for consumption, I didn&#x27;t realize that at first.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Bought this for use with dryer balls and to give sheets and such some scent, keep the bugs away and to be enjoyed when they&#x27;re gotten out of the closet.  </li>
            <li>Cinnamon has a tan color and is &amp;#34;gloppy.&amp;#34;  Peppermint oil comes out clear and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li>does this stuff get hot when skin is contacted</li>
            <li>My head felt SOOO hot</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be reminded of Holiday decor, more than likely.</li>
            <li>This essential oil is being used for scientific research, and the purity level is definitely fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy more as necessary!</li>
            <li>Learning about using essential oils and since I love cinnamon anyway, decided to add this to the the beginnings of a collection.  </li>
            <li>If I buy it again in the future, and have a better experience, I will update my review.</li>
            <li>Overall, satisfied.</li>
            <li>Be warned, it does lightly burn for a couple of minutes, when put in direct contact with your skin.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product to scent pinecones for winter decor and it did the job exactly as I hoped it would.</li>
            <li>LOVE the smell of the cinnamon bark essential oil.</li>
            <li>This is the first.</li>
            <li>, It must have been like eating hot wings or something\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It is potent enough to feel like it is burning my skin, if I forget to wash and, touch my face.</li>
            <li>I ordered three different oils and I love all of them.</li>
            <li>I plan to order more essential oils from your store.</li>
            <li>Overall good product, I&#x27;ll likely order from them again.</li>
            <li>I love this oil so much that this is my second order.</li>
            <li>As good as the more expensive brand I used to buy.  </li>
            <li>I am new to essential oils so right now I&#x27;m basically picking through the products and seeing what I&#x27;ll work with the most.</li>
            <li>But this particular cinnamon essential oil smells more like the hot cinnamon.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t leave the top off too long, it won&#x27;t get clogged.  </li>
            <li>Nice dark bottle</li>
            <li>This is a decent value, but it smells more like cinnamon gum or something than like actually cinnamon.</li>
            <li>excellant quality, very strong so be careful!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to get one drop at a time due to the way the plastic undercap is made.</li>
            <li>certainly would not order again</li>
            <li>Most essential oils are loaded with alcohol to the point that you can smell the alcohol more than you can the actual oil, but in the case of this product, you definitely are getting a very pure cinnamon product.</li>
            <li>Be careful as the scent is powerful and could easily become overwelming.</li>
            <li>I have used other companies in the past for my oils and was very impressed with this one!</li>
            <li>Cinnamon is so aromatic and has really helped in calming my cravings whether it be for certain foods or alcohol.</li>
            <li>Given the very affordable price, I&#x27;d be willing to buy it again to see if it was just a problem with my particular bottle.</li>
            <li>At the very least, not until you&#x27;ve diluted it greatly.  </li>
            <li>This is great and you only need a little.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting something a little more different, but this is still enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>I only have to use a few drops to get a great cinnamon flavor.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It seems to work very well for that...</li>
            <li>After using testers everywhere - whole foods,&lt;br /&gt;holistic pharmacies, sprouts, etc.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I use this in my oil diffuser and really like it, the cinnamon smell really makes my mouth water too.</li>
            <li>but this one lasts the whole run.</li>
            <li>also very pungent (it&#x27;s cinnamon of course)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this brand before and really like it.</li>
            <li>This was very well packed and arrived in lightening speed.</li>
            <li>Bought it to scent pine cones for Christmas, had to use the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t smell like cinnamon.  </li>
            <li>The bark part really gave an off smell.</li>
            <li>but it did not add much.</li>
            <li>Smelled straight from the bottle</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you like cinnamon!</li>
            <li>The problem is that I went through the container SOOO fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and I really like it...</li>
            <li>Too fast this time.</li>
            <li>The price was so reasonable.</li>
            <li>I really like the drip tip too</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>reduced my urine infection and the size of my prostrate when I had it with warm water for about a week everyday</li>
            <li>I feel much better about using a 100% natural essential oil than any chemical scents.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quite nice, reminiscent to the candy &#x27;Red Hots&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It smells like Hot Tamales - you know, that hideous, bright red cinnamon flavored chewy candy that is a mess for your teeth?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other well known brands paying almost 3xs more.</li>
            <li>I use the Cinnamon Bark Essential Oil to drop droplets onto my wood stove while it is burning to put a clean fragrance into the air.</li>
            <li>It is VERY STRONG and you should start with just a few drops.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m slowly try&#x27;n more of the plant therapy products which I&#x27;m finding they are equal to or a better quality...</li>
            <li>It was a better quality than I expected!!</li>
            <li>I find myself looking forward to my new dental hygiene routine every day, and my teeth have gotten so much whiter in just one week.</li>
            <li>Just be careful to not get on skin as it irritates it and since its an oil it doesn&#x27;t wash off easily.</li>
            <li>I ordered this essential oil to flavor the coconut oil I&#x27;m using for daily oil pulling/swishing, and I love the way it tastes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is really a high quality oil.</li>
            <li>and is extremely high quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this vendor.</li>
            <li>I use this to spice up toothpicks and make rooms smell a little better.</li>
            <li>and I was very and pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>just make sure if you use it on the skin to mixed it with oil especially if you have sensitive skin,because it will burn if you don&#x27;t .</li>
            <li>Both dark colored bottles(sweet orange) came carefully sealed in bubble wrap, which was good.</li>
            <li>I actually burned too much of it the first time around, and had to air the place out.</li>
            <li>I put a few drops in my steam mop and now my house smells like the holidays. :)</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, but very weak and quickly dissipates.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong, and smells like how Big Red gum tastes!</li>
            <li>I use it for homemade toothpaste and it makes the baking soda base much more pleasant.</li>
            <li>you would get from a brand new cinnamon broom.</li>
            <li>I bought this to go with my new diffuser.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe in spending huge amounts of money on oils since there&#x27;s not actually any as therapeutic grade, but there is definitely low quality oil, and this is it.  </li>
            <li>The only &#x27;very minor&#x27; issue is that when I attempt to add a few drops to a mixture, you don&#x27;t have as much droplet control (rather quick), as I&#x27;m more familiar with when using other brands.</li>
            <li>It is very strong, you only ned a little bit.</li>
            <li>This Cinnamon EO reminds me of a small gift shop in the mountains that I went to many years ago.</li>
            <li>and it tasted like a red hot cinnamon candy with no burning.</li>
            <li>This Cinnamon Bark Essential Oil smells heavenly - exactly as the seller described it.</li>
            <li>First time buying essential oils</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased other oils from our local health food store, but they&#x27;re not as potent.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Careful with getting it full strength on your skin - I just wash with soap and water immediately</li>
            <li>I wish it was less expensive but the product is excellent and the package was well packed.</li>
            <li>This oil is very strong and a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li>It is very strong and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>The smell is not quite strong enough, nor lasting enough.</li>
            <li>The cinnamon oil is definitely 100% pure.</li>
            <li>It is rated so well, and I have a hard time believing what was shipped to me is what everyone seems so pleased with.</li>
            <li>I started with peppermint and moved onto other strong scents to use when studying different concepts in order to trigger their brains when they encountered the scent again.  </li>
            <li>, you don&#x27;t want to ruin a nice color lipgloss with too much and you don&#x27;t want any unfortunate allergic reactions.</li>
            <li>I use this for scented oil on pine cones, in potpourri and a  couple of drips on the molding near the litter box.</li>
            <li>18 July 2015 amendment: I will not be ordering more from this company, at least not through Amazon.</li>
            <li>No issues using it on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The cinnamon bark essential oil works very well in my aroma diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that the oil was truly undiluted.</li>
            <li>I dripped this on some old potpourri in my master bedroom--</li>
            <li>so I went looking for a natural remedy.</li>
            <li>Do NOT get this near your eyes, lips, etc.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised the strength .  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I mixed too much with my coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I have NEVER gone through a bottle of essential oils so fast.</li>
            <li>&quot; So I threw on the Young Guns soundtrack</li>
            <li>I use it nearly every day.</li>
            <li>Im going to find some lip gloss base to dilute it for the perfect plumper.</li>
            <li>The first time I did this, I added too much and had extremely red, dry lips for a week.</li>
            <li>Strong cinnamon taste, but very little smell.</li>
            <li>However, it was cheap enough that I may try other oils from this company.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it for hair care and for making a mouth rinse mixed with peppermint and rosemary oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will find other uses for this other than diffuser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little on the sweet side for me</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil has a rather distinctive and (for me) slightly unpleasant taste, but the cinnamon masked it nicely--it tastes great.</li>
            <li>Product is exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any color left on the sheets, but there&#x27;s certainly color left on the wool dryer balls.  </li>
            <li>Hard to believe you can get such a pure, potent oil for such a low price.</li>
            <li>but this is what stimulates your hair folicules to grow back thanks to this oil my hair grows back every time the condition returns</li>
            <li>The scent is strong so a few drops will go a long way.</li>
            <li>Since I had not washed my hands but rather wiped, every spot I had directly touched on my face was red and slightly raised; it was not painful on my face (thank goodness), but my head felt like I was the human torch for about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Tried this oil, it is ok, but has strange odor besides the cinnamon, not the same pure cinnamon smell that the brooms originally had.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have used it for over a while now, the smell is really bad, has a chemical cinnamon smell, would not buy again.</li>
            <li>It makes it feel a little warming and also really helps with sore muscles if I&#x27;ve recently done an intense workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not that this stuff smells bad or anything, but I expected it to smell more like ground cinnamon or cinnamon sticks, but it has more of a &amp;#34;red hot&amp;#34; candy smell.</li>
            <li>Please beware though if you apply it directly to skin it will burn and skin will turn red.  </li>
            <li>So far I have used this in multiple purposes, and it does its job.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honestly only using it so far in my diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps this is what real cinnamon smells like, but it was more like tea being drunk by an individual in a nursing home.  </li>
            <li>Cinnamon bark essential oil is pure and can work well to help people calm down through smell and create other helps as well.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s exactly what it smells like under the odd cinnamon smell.  </li>
            <li>Other than that I really like this oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands of oils and none of them seem to be as strong as this one.</li>
            <li>it does burn a little at first</li>
            <li>in fact plump my lips, but with mascara running down my cheeks, the whole look was ruined.</li>
            <li>and we only had to use half as much as we did of the grapefruit scent.  </li>
            <li>I put a few drops in a large glass of water, and sip on it throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I also dab a tiny amount on the base of an incandescent light bulb as a home fragrance - this typically lasts 24-36 hours and makes a warm, inviting smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower the house.  </li>

            <li> Truly love this oil!</li>
            <li> Love Plant therapy!</li>
            <li> Im crafty-I can make it better!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> Great strong scent for my candles and soaps.</li>
            <li> The dropper that is already built into the bottle is very handy because it makes it easy to measure.</li>
            <li> I used this product for my pinecones for a nice spicy scent for my home.</li>
            <li> Product good for many things.  </li>
            <li> Used to create my own lip plumper</li>
            <li> I liked the container it came in.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a nice quality oil..</li>
            <li> was thrilled to have a chance to get this at a discount for my honest review</li>
            <li> It reinfused my previously-cinnamon-smelling pine cones so effectively that my husband noticed it.</li>
            <li> Adds a nice aroma to the room you put this in.  </li>
            <li> This oil diffuses perfectly, smells great and helps with my headaches when mixed with peppermint.</li>
            <li> But it still smells nice &amp; I can see using it to scent the house.</li>
            <li> I bought it to make my own Lip plumper which I did</li>
            <li> It smells nice</li>
            <li> Bought this oil to make my own anti-bacterial cleaning spray (water and vinegar and oils..</li>
            <li> I use it to make my own germ-fighting blend.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and works as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> I used it to make my own Thieves oil blend--and it was just what I needed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own since</li>
            <li> It also crystalized all around the cap effectively clogging the dropper.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil to add a nice cinnamon smell to my family room.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I thought I might make my own spicey cologne.  </li>
            <li> I used it in my Scentsy warmer and it created a nice scent in my kitchen.  </li>
            <li> While this may be good for cleaning, it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;Ceylon&amp;#34; cinnamon - which is better for your health than cassia.  </li>
            <li> I was making my own thieves blend and needed cinnamon.  </li>
            <li> make my own lotion from coconut oil and almond oil</li>
            <li> Shipper had it nicely wrapped in a bubble wrap bag so</li>
            <li> Handy oil for balm mixtures.</li>
            <li> I sprinkle this on my brown carpets so my house smells nice</li>
            <li> The oil is highly aromatic and works wonderfully for my homemade soaps..  </li>
            <li> Received product as described, it is of high quality and the scent is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, great quality.</li>
            <li> This is good, aromatic, strong flavored oil.  </li>
            <li> , it is very strong if burnt with a candle warmer.</li>
            <li> Very strong.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t yet tried it, but am sure I will love it when I do!</li>
            <li> Very nice and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I think you could make a wonderful, all natural mouthwash with the peppermint oil, or a blend of whatever you like, too.  </li>
            <li> It will add the smell of fresh baked cookies and makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy even puts the name of the fragrance on top of the bottle - nice touch.</li>
            <li> The cinnamon bark was warm, spicy and pungent, nothing overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would work amazing in an aromatherapy diffuser.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong and authentic!</li>
            <li> Nice strong scent but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This oil is nice and strong, with a lingering scent even when it&#x27;s not being warmed.</li>
            <li> but I am new to oils but these seem good for non edible uses and you cant beat the price!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this smell and have gotten tons of complements.</li>
            <li> the price per larger unit used to be excellent.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it is therapeutic grade.  </li>
            <li> If you like the smell of cinnamon add a couple drops to some cheap lipgloss for a nice, tingly, lip venom effect.  </li>
            <li> Love this oil.</li>
            <li> Really potent.</li>
            <li> I have been 100% pleased with the oils.</li>
            <li> I mix it with lemon and let it simmer on my stove top and it makes my place smell</li>
            <li> smell is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love the cinnamon smell.  </li>
            <li> I love Cinnamon 100%.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for great product.</li>
            <li> I think an electric heater works better than a flame for these oils.</li>
            <li> I got this oil and used a Q-Tip to some run around the outlet plate and around where we saw them the most.</li>
            <li> I like to combine it with my vanilla perfume because many men and women like the scent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to use as a deodorant but don&#x27;t use it straight because it can burn the skin.</li>
            <li> However I thought it would be more of a cinnamon smell</li>
            <li> Very affordable and seems to be of great quality.</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> The scent is great, but the color and consistency isn&#x27;t good for my planned use of the essential oil.</li>
            <li> Love the smell in my diffuser.</li>
            <li> Ok scent.</li>
            <li> Ok strength.</li>
            <li> Ok, ok ok....</li>
            <li> I love this aroma.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m content with the scent could be better.</li>
            <li> I already added more scents  from this company to my wish list on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try more.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product and recommend for purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this and use it in my burner every day.</li>
            <li> They smell is okay for this.</li>
            <li> and I was looking for something stronger with more of a cinnamon scent.</li>
            <li> I wanted to add it to my scented wax warmer for more of a cinnamon scent</li>
            <li> The rest were sealed appropriately.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t an overwhelming scent and does not have a &amp;#34;fake fragrance&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> I love Plant Therapy oils.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THE SCENT THO.</li>
            <li> Love this scent.</li>
            <li> I want to love this oil, but of all the oils I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon, this one just missed the mark.</li>
            <li> We have gas heat and when the heat runs, it makes our home smell lovely.  </li>
            <li> I love using this scent in our home during the fall season.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely Love this oil.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful company to buy essential oils from!</li>
            <li> (you could also drop a couple drops into your favorite lip gloss).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments and literally given out some homemade shea butter / cinnamon oil lip salve as gifts (I use Now brand shea butter).</li>
            <li> ..not sure.</li>
            <li> OK.</li>
            <li> So I recently found this awesome lip plumper made by Bite Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> but I want to LOVE it.</li>
            <li> still love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love to put it on my feet.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> The.product is great and service was fast..</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more of this brand of oils in future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have more food.</li>
            <li> Love the product :)</li>
            <li> I love cinnamon and put in almost everything I eat.</li>
            <li> gloss,,,I find so many uses for it.  </li>
            <li> It is very fragrant and hopefully would work to help keep bacteria and viruses away!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried Cinnamon Oil , and very happy because it is so much easier and convenient compared to Cinnamon Powder.</li>
            <li> It smells kind of sweet to me, which I love.</li>
            <li> ( these products are so good you don&#x27;t need very much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got such a strong and wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> The aroma is warm, sweet, and spicy with no synthetic or chemical-y undertones.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells pretty good</li>
            <li> But, a lot of people claim that cinnamon is good for us, so I am willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Very good product, I would definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure, smells amazing (but strong!)</li>
            <li> Received in perfect, expected condition.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell and made a great lip plumper balm mixed with coconut oil.i am going to make pumpkin cinnamon soap next weekend.</li>
            <li> But, for the paltry price, it&#x27;s pretty nice stuff. :)</li>
            <li> This has a nice fresh cinnamon scent with an undertone of a woodsey scent.</li>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping, no complaints.</li>
            <li> It smells good, but it did absolutely nothing to my lips..</li>
            <li> This oil is strong and very sweet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may be a wonderful product for other uses, but not moles.  </li>
            <li> It smells great, but that is a personal observation, I love the smell of cinnamon.</li>
            <li> , it makes it easy to just get a drop at a time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too strong and I can&#x27;t use it for my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I used this to make scented soy candles and while the candles has a strong cinnamon smell when you put it up to your nose, it is practically odorless when it burns.</li>
            <li> I decided to taste it just to see how strong it was</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s so strong</li>
            <li> Not as strong as it used to be.</li>
            <li> This is strong, strong stuff.  </li>
            <li> The aroma is strong, but the diffuser keeps it from being overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I add the scent to my Scentsy warmer because I feel the scents are no longer as strong as they once were.</li>
            <li> Strong stuff.</li>
            <li> This is highly strong oil, do not put it on skin undiluted, it will burn you.</li>
            <li> This stuff is STRONG.</li>
            <li> Strong I like it ...</li>
            <li> It is not as strong a scent as I would have preferred.</li>
            <li> Not too strong after stung either.</li>
            <li> Strong cinnamony scent that fills the room.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any comparison but this seems like an excellent product to me, has the right smell and taste and the dispensing dropper works properly.</li>
            <li> if it is true bark oil it should have more aroma than this has.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fragrance when it&#x27;s first opened is really nice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong and doesn&#x27;t take much to give a lovely scent to homemade lotions and scrubs.</li>
            <li> Its very strong but its good for your lips to get pumper or bigger....</li>
            <li> It does smell a bit stronger than the doterra oil, but since I use it blended as a muscle rub, its works fine.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m fine.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this EO very much!</li>
            <li> Very potent High quality</li>
            <li> So strong and rich.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a couple of seconds, I&#x27;d realized I should be a Bluth, because I&#x27;d made a huge mistake.</li>
            <li> Eh, seems cheap.  </li>
            <li> I ave been using Plant Therapy products for a few months now and have been quite impressed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fantastic).  </li>
            <li> I like a clean strong cinnamon scent.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to worry about light affecting</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to use sparingly so as not to overpower others when mixing.</li>
            <li> However, if you are even the slightest bit sensitive (skin wise), don&#x27;t get it on your skin...</li>
            <li> They had a certain particular scent, and smelled great</li>
            <li> Put it on my pine cones and never smelt it again, added more and still no smell of Cinnamon after 10 min unless it was right under your nose.</li>
            <li> when they burned, This oil smells exactly like them, and i&#x27;m sure this must be what they used.</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t full strength, and I also enjoy the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The scent of this oil is extremely rich and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> This small purchase turned out to be one of my best purchases of the year.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, I use it when making my chapsticks a couple of drops goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I still think it worked, because dudes love funny chicks and the situation was nothing if not</li>
            <li> This oil has a rich, intoxicating cinnamon scent.</li>
            <li> Smells good and works just as good as any other cinnamon oil I purchased, but at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> The aftertaste is clean and sweet.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special, but nothing to rave about.</li>
            <li> This is fresh, nice and spicy and true to taste, can highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The smell was great, but be careful.  </li>
            <li> This cinnamon bark oil smells nothing like the holiday-type sweet smell I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> The Cinnamon Bark essential oil smells good.  </li>
            <li> Will make your wildest dreams come true</li>
            <li> Yoda says,&amp;#34;ummgh essential oil good no?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> for me the smell is to sweet.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t intend it for consumption, but wanted the true scent of cinnamon which is not always the case with scents intended for aroma.  </li>
            <li> It is good, but too much obviously becomes overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Good quality essential oil.</li>
            <li> This definitely smells good -- just like cinnamon, as I&#x27;d expect.  </li>
            <li> This is a really good cinnamon essential oil.</li>
            <li> It has a nice aroma, but the intensity fades very quickly and doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The peppermint, vanilla, and lemon were all fine (I dip the corners of the index cards we are working on in them), but the cinnamon bark doesn&#x27;t smell very much like cinnamon to me.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited when it came in, I popped the lid off straight away, and put some of the deliciously smelling essential oil directly on my lips.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> The cinnamon smell did not overpower and dissipated fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> This product most definitely smells like cinnamon and has become a staple for most of my blends.  </li>
            <li> also - and this is the main reason I love this - use it as a lip plumper.</li>
            <li> Luckily, the pain subsided after about 20 seconds, at which point I acknowledged I am truly an idiot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was just what I wanted, and quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> Just as described and quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> Smells great but not very strong.</li>
            <li> P&amp;T is a  essential oil that lasts a long time and the aroma is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I checked local stores, higher prices and not so good.</li>
            <li> I found some instructions online and followed them perfectly; however, the smell just didn&#x27;t last that long.  </li>
            <li> Gee, thanks!!</li>
            <li> and it is the perfect strength ... not too &#x27;hot&#x27; nor too weak or sweet smelling.  </li>
            <li> really a few drop in my steam infuser works great.</li>
            <li> Put a few drops in my diffuser and immediately my room smelled great.</li>
            <li> It is amazing how essential oils can flow throughout your body in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li> Looking for a more natural fragrance for the Holidays?  </li>
            <li> Reminds me of fresh cinnamon rolls in the morning.</li>
            <li> MY GRAND DAUGHTER HAS SENSITIVE SKIN AND BROKE OUT WHEN I TOUCHED HER WITH THE CINNAMON ON MY FINGERTIPS.  </li>
            <li> I ultimately poured the whole bottle in the warmer and got a good day out of it.</li>
            <li> I bought the Cinnamon Oil to add a fresh scent to the inside of my refrigerator.</li>
            <li> Instead of the hubbs coming home to a delicious smelling wife, he walked in on me feverishly trying to tend to the bright red welt on my neck &amp; wrists with a wet washcloth.</li>
            <li> when used PROPERLY, a little in the right places, it smells great.  </li>
            <li> Excellent and my clients actually prefer the taste as it&#x27;s smoother than any other Cinnamon Bark.</li>
            <li> The shipping is always quick, and the customer service is stellar.</li>
            <li> and I know the oil is good for lip plumping when diluted with some beeswax or other oil.  </li>
            <li> because why break the bank if you don&#x27;t have to, right?</li>
            <li> I accidentally spilled a drop on my media cabinet and did not notice right away.  </li>
            <li> The oil is very strong and I only use 5 drops and I can taste it.  </li>
            <li> A few drops in a spray bottle with water or alcohol keep the ants out and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Usually it&#x27;s too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Luckily, good old Amazon came thru for me &amp; the Cinnamon Bark Essential Oil came in record time.</li>
            <li> Right from the bottle the cinnamon smell was powerful and there was no need to have to use to much in my body scrub.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipper and just as described and boy</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced too!</li>
            <li> The smell is not to my personal liking, I think I was expecting more of a cinnamon pinecone smell - my fault for thinking that.</li>
            <li> I was making some homemade air/linen freshener, and this gave my mixture exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> First test it out on yourself though</li>
            <li> I love all of Plant Therapy&#x27;s essential oils.</li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist, and love to theme the scents in my room to the season (as much as possible), So this is one that I used for the Holidays!!  </li>
            <li> Over priced, cent does not last for more than a couple of days.</li>
            <li> This item was exactly what I ordered - wanted to add to shampoo as an aid to stop hair loss - hope it works.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t intended for consumption, I didn&#x27;t realize that at first.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Bought this for use with dryer balls and to give sheets and such some scent, keep the bugs away and to be enjoyed when they&#x27;re gotten out of the closet.  </li>
            <li> Cinnamon has a tan color and is &amp;#34;gloppy.&amp;#34;  Peppermint oil comes out clear and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li> does this stuff get hot when skin is contacted</li>
            <li> My head felt SOOO hot</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be reminded of Holiday decor, more than likely.</li>
            <li> This essential oil is being used for scientific research, and the purity level is definitely fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy more as necessary!</li>
            <li> Learning about using essential oils and since I love cinnamon anyway, decided to add this to the the beginnings of a collection.  </li>
            <li> If I buy it again in the future, and have a better experience, I will update my review.</li>
            <li> Overall, satisfied.</li>
            <li> Be warned, it does lightly burn for a couple of minutes, when put in direct contact with your skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to scent pinecones for winter decor and it did the job exactly as I hoped it would.</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell of the cinnamon bark essential oil.</li>
            <li> This is the first.</li>
            <li> , It must have been like eating hot wings or something\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It is potent enough to feel like it is burning my skin, if I forget to wash and, touch my face.</li>
            <li> I ordered three different oils and I love all of them.</li>
            <li> I plan to order more essential oils from your store.</li>
            <li> Overall good product, I&#x27;ll likely order from them again.</li>
            <li> I love this oil so much that this is my second order.</li>
            <li> As good as the more expensive brand I used to buy.  </li>
            <li> I am new to essential oils so right now I&#x27;m basically picking through the products and seeing what I&#x27;ll work with the most.</li>
            <li> But this particular cinnamon essential oil smells more like the hot cinnamon.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t leave the top off too long, it won&#x27;t get clogged.  </li>
            <li> Nice dark bottle</li>
            <li> This is a decent value, but it smells more like cinnamon gum or something than like actually cinnamon.</li>
            <li> excellant quality, very strong so be careful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to get one drop at a time due to the way the plastic undercap is made.</li>
            <li> certainly would not order again</li>
            <li> Most essential oils are loaded with alcohol to the point that you can smell the alcohol more than you can the actual oil, but in the case of this product, you definitely are getting a very pure cinnamon product.</li>
            <li> Be careful as the scent is powerful and could easily become overwelming.</li>
            <li> I have used other companies in the past for my oils and was very impressed with this one!</li>
            <li> Cinnamon is so aromatic and has really helped in calming my cravings whether it be for certain foods or alcohol.</li>
            <li> Given the very affordable price, I&#x27;d be willing to buy it again to see if it was just a problem with my particular bottle.</li>
            <li> At the very least, not until you&#x27;ve diluted it greatly.  </li>
            <li> This is great and you only need a little.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting something a little more different, but this is still enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> I only have to use a few drops to get a great cinnamon flavor.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It seems to work very well for that...</li>
            <li> After using testers everywhere - whole foods,&lt;br /&gt;holistic pharmacies, sprouts, etc.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I use this in my oil diffuser and really like it, the cinnamon smell really makes my mouth water too.</li>
            <li> but this one lasts the whole run.</li>
            <li> also very pungent (it&#x27;s cinnamon of course)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this brand before and really like it.</li>
            <li> This was very well packed and arrived in lightening speed.</li>
            <li> Bought it to scent pine cones for Christmas, had to use the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t smell like cinnamon.  </li>
            <li> The bark part really gave an off smell.</li>
            <li> but it did not add much.</li>
            <li> Smelled straight from the bottle</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you like cinnamon!</li>
            <li> The problem is that I went through the container SOOO fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and I really like it...</li>
            <li> Too fast this time.</li>
            <li> The price was so reasonable.</li>
            <li> I really like the drip tip too</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> reduced my urine infection and the size of my prostrate when I had it with warm water for about a week everyday</li>
            <li> I feel much better about using a 100% natural essential oil than any chemical scents.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quite nice, reminiscent to the candy &#x27;Red Hots&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It smells like Hot Tamales - you know, that hideous, bright red cinnamon flavored chewy candy that is a mess for your teeth?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other well known brands paying almost 3xs more.</li>
            <li> I use the Cinnamon Bark Essential Oil to drop droplets onto my wood stove while it is burning to put a clean fragrance into the air.</li>
            <li> It is VERY STRONG and you should start with just a few drops.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m slowly try&#x27;n more of the plant therapy products which I&#x27;m finding they are equal to or a better quality...</li>
            <li> It was a better quality than I expected!!</li>
            <li> I find myself looking forward to my new dental hygiene routine every day, and my teeth have gotten so much whiter in just one week.</li>
            <li> Just be careful to not get on skin as it irritates it and since its an oil it doesn&#x27;t wash off easily.</li>
            <li> I ordered this essential oil to flavor the coconut oil I&#x27;m using for daily oil pulling/swishing, and I love the way it tastes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is really a high quality oil.</li>
            <li> and is extremely high quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this vendor.</li>
            <li> I use this to spice up toothpicks and make rooms smell a little better.</li>
            <li> and I was very and pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> just make sure if you use it on the skin to mixed it with oil especially if you have sensitive skin,because it will burn if you don&#x27;t .</li>
            <li> Both dark colored bottles(sweet orange) came carefully sealed in bubble wrap, which was good.</li>
            <li> I actually burned too much of it the first time around, and had to air the place out.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops in my steam mop and now my house smells like the holidays. :)</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, but very weak and quickly dissipates.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong, and smells like how Big Red gum tastes!</li>
            <li> I use it for homemade toothpaste and it makes the baking soda base much more pleasant.</li>
            <li> you would get from a brand new cinnamon broom.</li>
            <li> I bought this to go with my new diffuser.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe in spending huge amounts of money on oils since there&#x27;s not actually any as therapeutic grade, but there is definitely low quality oil, and this is it.  </li>
            <li> The only &#x27;very minor&#x27; issue is that when I attempt to add a few drops to a mixture, you don&#x27;t have as much droplet control (rather quick), as I&#x27;m more familiar with when using other brands.</li>
            <li> It is very strong, you only ned a little bit.</li>
            <li> This Cinnamon EO reminds me of a small gift shop in the mountains that I went to many years ago.</li>
            <li> and it tasted like a red hot cinnamon candy with no burning.</li>
            <li> This Cinnamon Bark Essential Oil smells heavenly - exactly as the seller described it.</li>
            <li> First time buying essential oils</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other oils from our local health food store, but they&#x27;re not as potent.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Careful with getting it full strength on your skin - I just wash with soap and water immediately</li>
            <li> I wish it was less expensive but the product is excellent and the package was well packed.</li>
            <li> This oil is very strong and a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> It is very strong and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> The smell is not quite strong enough, nor lasting enough.</li>
            <li> The cinnamon oil is definitely 100% pure.</li>
            <li> It is rated so well, and I have a hard time believing what was shipped to me is what everyone seems so pleased with.</li>
            <li> I started with peppermint and moved onto other strong scents to use when studying different concepts in order to trigger their brains when they encountered the scent again.  </li>
            <li> , you don&#x27;t want to ruin a nice color lipgloss with too much and you don&#x27;t want any unfortunate allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> I use this for scented oil on pine cones, in potpourri and a  couple of drips on the molding near the litter box.</li>
            <li> 18 July 2015 amendment: I will not be ordering more from this company, at least not through Amazon.</li>
            <li> No issues using it on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The cinnamon bark essential oil works very well in my aroma diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that the oil was truly undiluted.</li>
            <li> I dripped this on some old potpourri in my master bedroom--</li>
            <li> so I went looking for a natural remedy.</li>
            <li> Do NOT get this near your eyes, lips, etc.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised the strength .  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I mixed too much with my coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER gone through a bottle of essential oils so fast.</li>
            <li> &quot; So I threw on the Young Guns soundtrack</li>
            <li> I use it nearly every day.</li>
            <li> Im going to find some lip gloss base to dilute it for the perfect plumper.</li>
            <li> The first time I did this, I added too much and had extremely red, dry lips for a week.</li>
            <li> Strong cinnamon taste, but very little smell.</li>
            <li> However, it was cheap enough that I may try other oils from this company.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it for hair care and for making a mouth rinse mixed with peppermint and rosemary oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I will find other uses for this other than diffuser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the sweet side for me</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil has a rather distinctive and (for me) slightly unpleasant taste, but the cinnamon masked it nicely--it tastes great.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any color left on the sheets, but there&#x27;s certainly color left on the wool dryer balls.  </li>
            <li> Hard to believe you can get such a pure, potent oil for such a low price.</li>
            <li> but this is what stimulates your hair folicules to grow back thanks to this oil my hair grows back every time the condition returns</li>
            <li> The scent is strong so a few drops will go a long way.</li>
            <li> Since I had not washed my hands but rather wiped, every spot I had directly touched on my face was red and slightly raised; it was not painful on my face (thank goodness), but my head felt like I was the human torch for about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Tried this oil, it is ok, but has strange odor besides the cinnamon, not the same pure cinnamon smell that the brooms originally had.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have used it for over a while now, the smell is really bad, has a chemical cinnamon smell, would not buy again.</li>
            <li> It makes it feel a little warming and also really helps with sore muscles if I&#x27;ve recently done an intense workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not that this stuff smells bad or anything, but I expected it to smell more like ground cinnamon or cinnamon sticks, but it has more of a &amp;#34;red hot&amp;#34; candy smell.</li>
            <li> Please beware though if you apply it directly to skin it will burn and skin will turn red.  </li>
            <li> So far I have used this in multiple purposes, and it does its job.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly only using it so far in my diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps this is what real cinnamon smells like, but it was more like tea being drunk by an individual in a nursing home.  </li>
            <li> Cinnamon bark essential oil is pure and can work well to help people calm down through smell and create other helps as well.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s exactly what it smells like under the odd cinnamon smell.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I really like this oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands of oils and none of them seem to be as strong as this one.</li>
            <li> it does burn a little at first</li>
            <li> in fact plump my lips, but with mascara running down my cheeks, the whole look was ruined.</li>
            <li> and we only had to use half as much as we did of the grapefruit scent.  </li>
            <li> I put a few drops in a large glass of water, and sip on it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I also dab a tiny amount on the base of an incandescent light bulb as a home fragrance - this typically lasts 24-36 hours and makes a warm, inviting smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower the house.  </li>
            <li> Not sure this is a pure essential oil.  </li>
            <li> One thing I must mention, a lot of people recommend mixing the product with other oils before applying it to the skin directly; do your research before you mix this with another oil.</li>
            <li> and they last a long time)</li>
            <li> I got this after several combat tours in the military medical creams did not work and a family member recomended this oil just place it on a Qtip and rub it on the (AA) areas</li>
            <li> I like to use the scent inside toilet paper rolls, use it in lip</li>
            <li> I used this to give my wedding venue a sent since it was in an old log cabin that smelled a little musty.</li>
            <li> It just smells more like what you&#x27;d expect an artificial cinnamon scent would be like.</li>
            <li> and it feels a bit warm but nothing painful or as excruciating as my carrot-cinnamon blend.</li>
            <li> It is what I expected it to be, except is smells like red hots instead of ground cinnamon.</li>
            <li> I expected a larger size</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if this is normal.  </li>
            <li> We had a wet summer and that caused an invasion of the tiny ants into the kitchen.</li>
            <li> ( as long as I don&#x27;t have to bake )</li>
            <li> The Cinnamon Bark Essential Oil was just as expected and shipped promptly.  </li>
            <li> But again, minor, and I&#x27;d buy this brand again</li>
            <li> Larger bottle than expected- added bonus!</li>
            <li> It also behaves differently in my diffuser than other brands of oils.  </li>
            <li> I add it too vinegar and some other essential oils that I use as an all-purpose cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I have to give credit to the service, though, because I received it even earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> I use a mixture of cinnamon bark oil and other oils mixed with water for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The bubble wrap was dry too, so I know that it didn&#x27;t leak out.</li>
            <li> I mixed a couple drops of this in with a few drops of clove oil into my coconut oil that I use for moisturizing daily to give it a spicy scent.  </li>
            <li> , the larger bottle &amp;#34;drops&amp;#34; easier - the smaller bottles seem to take longer or need a few shakes to get the drops going.</li>
            <li> Insects seem to infest my apartment every summer, so I bought this and few other oils to help keep them at bay, and it has worked well so far.</li>
            <li> I have bought the expensive brands, because \\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot;, is usually true.</li>
            <li> but as it began to dry out it started to stink!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this compares to other cinnamon essential oils from other companies.  </li>
            <li> I personally use it for two slightly unconventional uses - lotion and an all-natural lip</li>
            <li> but I added some of it to an oil that I put on my face (I have very dry skin).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that is due to the type of oil or the type of wax I used, but I will try a different type of oil next time I make candles.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, just wish the bottle was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> , I took a cotton swab and put a little on several moles on neck and shoulders.  </li>
            <li> Add a little vanilla essential oil and you won&#x27;t want to leave your home.</li>
            <li> this is just what I expected, I mix it with 1/2 water and 1/2 denatured alcohol to spray for dust mites.</li>
            <li> be careful may be it even.....</li>
            <li> This oil smells like wet cats to me.  </li>
            <li> I just know that my bottle is empty,</li>
            <li> This product seems to be of the quality that I expected.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> You need a much bigger amount to make an impact and this little bottle is too expensive for how much it does</li>
            <li> I bought this, along with other essential oils from this company, to use as \\&quot;brain joggers\\&quot; for my university students as we learn new and difficult concepts.  </li>
            <li> I do diffuse it in combination with some other oils.  </li>
            <li> This smells just like what I expected!  </li>
            <li> Other than that mishap</li>
            <li> It blends well with the other oils.</li>
            <li> It lasts until I turn my diffuser off which usually operates around 12 hours a day, some of the other oils I&#x27;ve tried only put out a smell for about an hour before fading away</li>
            <li> Blends well with other oils and butters for lotions</li>
            <li> anyway I&#x27;m not sure that this reflects on the quality of Plant Therapy as an essential oil brand.</li>
            <li> I also bought 3 other scents.</li>
            <li> It goes along way for such a small bottle, I will be getting it again.</li>
            <li> I went from bragging about this company&#x27;s oils to waiting for my other bottle of bergamot</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I bought this to make homemade toothpaste and other products.</li>
            <li> When I received the box, it contained a small essential oil bottle sealed inside a bubble wrap package.</li>
            <li> I mean I only felt a little tiny tingle--bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have other oils by plant therapy</li>
            <li> Planning other uses for it, as well.</li>
            <li> Spray bedding, carpets, and any other places dust collects.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a VERY LONG WAY, please keep that in mind.  </li>
            <li> It only takes maybe 3 drops added to an oil warmer with a little plain wax.  </li>
            <li> (I have very sensitive skin and also feel slightly weird about putting so many crazy sounding ingredients on my skin) and will sometimes add a few drops of this in.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was an old or weak batch?</li>
            <li> I bought this to help me loose a few pounds.</li>
            <li> I read in other reviews of people doing such, and they found out the hard way.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I real cinnamon not the fake pinecones at Walmart stuff .  </li>
            <li> I have become an essential oil fanatic.......</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I have dark wood</li>
            <li> Also, the ant traps  my husband put down were not working.</li>
            <li> since I use that on my hair often) applied it on my head, wiped my hands down and put on my make-up.</li>
            <li> If you remember the candy Red Hots you know what I mean by bite or burn.  </li>
            <li> This is a VERY small bottle and it lasted less than ten days.  </li>
            <li> -- I personally find it difficult to release a measured, controlled amount of oil from the bottle; I&#x27;m concerned about getting TOO much oil out onto the host surfaces, and therefore may be actually getting too LITTLE oil -- frustrating!</li>
            <li> I know that sounds so odd</li>
            <li> I mix this with half and half water and denatured alcohol for a dust mite killer.</li>
            <li> that time, there weren&#x27;t a lot of options, and I was usually stuck buying them at small independent health food stores.  </li>
            <li> and I can camouflage it with black ink.  </li>
            <li> The oil leaks down the side of the bottle and is quite messy.</li>
            <li> but these little oils have plenty of uses</li>
            <li> A little dab&#x27;ll do ya.</li>
            <li> deadly</li>
            <li> I cant afford what doterra charges and I need a few replacements.</li>
            <li> Not really cheap</li>
            <li> the bottle was so small not worth the price used it up in a day considering th eprice paid</li>
            <li> It appears to be undiluted and has a heavy scent that lasts.</li>
            <li> On use a few drops.</li>
            <li> I ended up sprinkling the pine cones every few days to keep the smell up</li>
            <li> I have small children</li>
            <li> so I might&#x27;ve went overboard in using it.</li>
            <li> I am not able to afford the two brands of ML oils</li>
            <li> Cheaper than the brand I usually buy.</li>
            <li> a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body, usually from the scalp.</li>
            <li> We usually buy the cinnamon brooms at the market in fall and the smell lasts a while and fills the house with cinnamon.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had no more accidents and the house smells like cinnamon.</li>
            <li> At first, I was disappointed--</li>
            <li> comical.funny chicks and the situation was nothing if not comical.</li>
            <li> Usually they&#x27;d have one brand, and it was expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Requiring a certain amount of words for a review is ridiculous makes me not want to do it next time :(!</li>
            <li> Put the bottle away only to bring it out a year later, this morning, and yup - still hate it when it drys.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had an allergic reaction to it, which I hear is common with cinnamon.</li>
            <li> My son, who has had awful allergies primarily from dust mites came to visit.</li>
            <li> but it was too late to redo all the index cards.</li>
            <li> it was too late to cancel</li>
            <li> , I usually buy YL oil but will purchase Plant Therapy from now on!</li>
            <li> No More Ants, and it didn&#x27;t stain the paint!</li>
            <li> My essential oil is a tad bit disappointing in that the strength seems to be just a bit weak.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s now become ridiculous, in my opinion, for what amounts to two teaspoons.  </li>
            <li> I got some on my skin a few times, even when decently diluted, and it still left horrible, itchy, painful redness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely sad and disappointed that there was such a few amount in it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to choose!</li>
            <li> My only issue is that the oil is too thick for the euro dropper, or the dropper is plain terrible.  </li>
            <li> and I am not happy with it.</li>
            <li> As advertised, but very small bottles!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to finally receive to check out  before making a return on this cat urine - I mean &amp;#34;Cinnamon&amp;#34;. :(</li>
            <li> Cannot be used on your skin without a carrier oil and without being seriously diluted!</li>
            <li> Worst part is the bottle totally leaked and got all over my expensive YL oils.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the oil, but I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> He did not have the awful scratchy throat in the mornings, so I think this made that possible.</li>
            <li> You would be wrong madam.</li>
            <li> Yes, it shockingly had the same reaction.</li>
            <li> i like this when i or family has a cold..</li>
            <li> disappointing.</li>
            <li> It never feels sticky or artificial.</li>
            <li> It stinks but does seem to help me with digestive issues.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really  bad.</li>
            <li> Mix with water and vodka to prevent nozzle clogging and it covers up bad smells.</li>
            <li> This item smells bad and not even close to cinnamon.</li>
            <li> Smells like bad dirt.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve known this before I bought it. :(</li>
            <li> It smelled very artificial to me, but who knows.</li>
            <li> I use it in an oil burner, as an ant repellent, and in perfume.  </li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed....</li>
            <li> This smells awful!</li>
            <li> I thought my nose was off until my kids ages eight and five came home from school and asked, WHAT IS THAT HORRIBLE SMELL?</li>
            <li> ZERO stars - it literally smells like cat urine; the worst quality I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> what is that terrible smell???&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Awful, gave my blisters.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great oil, great smell, I usually buy YL oil but will purchase Plant Therapy from now on!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this</li>
            <li> Great scent! Larger bottle than expected- added bonus!</li>
            <li> It is not what I was expecting.  It&#x27;s too strong and I can&#x27;t use it for my scalp.  I had purchased a different brand and it help to treat my scalp by massaging it.  I have no use for this.</li>
            <li> this is just what I expected, I mix it with 1/2 water and 1/2 denatured alcohol to spray for dust mites. leaves a wonderful smell and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This Cinnamon EO reminds me of a small gift shop in the mountains that I went to many years ago. they had the best home made candle tarts that I ever smelled, and the cinnamon was the best, and my favorite. They had a certain particular scent, and smelled great when they burned, This oil smells exactly like them, and i&#x27;m sure this must be what they used. i&#x27;m so happy to have found this oil. I put It on my pine cones and It smells great. i&#x27;m very pleased with this company, and will buy from them again.</li>
            <li> This is a decent value, but it smells more like cinnamon gum or something than like actually cinnamon. I used this to make scented soy candles and while the candles has a strong cinnamon smell when you put it up to your nose, it is practically odorless when it burns. I&#x27;m not sure if that is due to the type of oil or the type of wax I used, but I will try a different type of oil next time I make candles.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. Shipped quickly. Received in perfect, expected condition.</li>
            <li> Smells like Cinnamon sugar not Cinnamon bark. Put it on my pine cones and never smelt it again, added more and still no smell of Cinnamon after 10 min unless it was right under your nose. I decided to taste it just to see how strong it was and it tasted like a red hot cinnamon candy with no burning.</li>
            <li> I loved the way this oil made my house smell over the holidays. Used 5 drops in my oil diffuser.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly. I use this for scent control in my kitchen, and it works beautifully. I put 10-12 drops in a 1-quart pan of water on my stove and simmer all evening, and the room smells like cinnamon, not the dinner I cooked. Love this!</li>
            <li> Used this to refresh my cinnamon broom.  It&#x27;s good but I had to use a lot to get the sstrong smell you would get from a brand new cinnamon broom.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and I have already used it up in my soap.  Smells wonderful</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my homemade lip balms like plumpers too.  This is fresh, nice and spicy and true to taste, can highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Used this stuff to soak toothpicks in, in order to help kick smoking. After just a day, I had a sore in my lip that looked like herpes! Gee, thanks!!</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to use for a homemade carpet powder I was making.  It smells wonderful and lasts!  Reasonably priced too!</li>
            <li> horror story . bought it to add to my hair mask oil //got burns allergic reaction, my lymph nodes ( my boyfriends and my daughters too)  swell up and was hurting for weeks .. what is it??? be careful may be it even..... deadly</li>
            <li> Loved this around the holidays!</li>
            <li> really a few drop in my steam infuser works great.</li>
            <li> I use this for scented oil on pine cones, in potpourri and a  couple of drips on the molding near the litter box.</li>
            <li> This oil smells like wet cats to me.  I know that sounds so odd but it&#x27;s exactly what it smells like under the odd cinnamon smell.  It also behaves differently in my diffuser than other brands of oils.  I don&#x27;t believe in spending huge amounts of money on oils since there&#x27;s not actually any as therapeutic grade, but there is definitely low quality oil, and this is it.  However, it was cheap enough that I may try other oils from this company.</li>
            <li> Eh, seems cheap.  I do diffuse it in combination with some other oils.  Worst part is the bottle totally leaked and got all over my expensive YL oils.  Will not purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> Not that this stuff smells bad or anything, but I expected it to smell more like ground cinnamon or cinnamon sticks, but it has more of a &amp;#34;red hot&amp;#34; candy smell. It just smells more like what you&#x27;d expect an artificial cinnamon scent would be like. I haven&#x27;t tried it in any recipes yet, but I plan to use it in soaps, lotions and lip balms. Hopefully it will work well, but we&#x27;ll see! Otherwise, shipping and packaging were great!</li>
            <li> Smells good would buy  from them again. Thanks</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent, and a controlled drip.  I use this in bathrooms and the kitchen.</li>
            <li> excellant quality, very strong so be careful! Requiring a certain amount of words for a review is ridiculous makes me not want to do it next time :(!</li>
            <li> Strong cinnamon taste, but very little smell. I thought it was used as a cinnamon scent, but it does not diffuse at all. I have no clue what they intend this stuff to be used for since they recommend external use only.</li>
            <li> The smell is not to my personal liking, I think I was expecting more of a cinnamon pinecone smell - my fault for thinking that.</li>
            <li> Looking for a more natural fragrance for the Holidays?  Here it is.  This smells just like what I expected!  Love it!</li>
            <li> GOOD AT ALL  FATA  FATI</li>
            <li> Use this in my home made toothpaste, and tea. Really strong, and wonderful cinnamon taste with no aftertaste. Since it&#x27;s so strong it lasts quite awhile, and the price is great to begin with.</li>
            <li> This oil has the most wonderful aroma, and I got it because I read that cinnamon oil works to repel mosquitoes.  It seems to work very well for that... I mix it with another oil so it isn&#x27;t full strength, and I also enjoy the fragrance.  Unlike so many repellents which repel people too!</li>
            <li> The scent of this oil is extremely rich and lasts all day.  Please beware though if you apply it directly to skin it will burn and skin will turn red.  Other than that mishap I absolutely LOVE this smell and have gotten tons of complements.</li>
            <li> The smell is definitely cinnamon. I use it in my diffuser and the house smells great! Just what I was looking for, just wish the bottle was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> Just as described, arrived within a few days and was priced very well.</li>
            <li> It has a funky smell.</li>
            <li> After using testers everywhere - whole foods,&lt;br /&gt;holistic pharmacies, sprouts, etc., I finally&lt;br /&gt;found a cinnamon oil that smells like pure&lt;br /&gt;cinnamon.  I&#x27;m using it everywhere,&lt;br /&gt;and can&#x27;t get enough of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s asking why things smell so good!&lt;br /&gt;thank you, Plant therapy!</li>
            <li> This small purchase turned out to be one of my best purchases of the year. Hard to believe you can get such a pure, potent oil for such a low price. Usually it&#x27;s too good to be true. Not in this case. Will DEFINITELY buy again. This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I rated this company&#x27;s tea tree oil with this story, so apologies if you&#x27;ve already seen it. :)  I successfully held oral thrush (side effect of prednisone) at bay whilst waiting for my doc to return from vacation by rinsing with 2 drops of cinnamon and 2 drops of tea tree oils TID. A Godsend! The tea tree oil has a rather distinctive and (for me) slightly unpleasant taste, but the cinnamon masked it nicely--it tastes great. I think you could make a wonderful, all natural mouthwash with the peppermint oil, or a blend of whatever you like, too.  It&#x27;s very easy to get one drop at a time due to the way the plastic undercap is made. I will be ordering more from this company!   18 July 2015 amendment: I will not be ordering more from this company, at least not through Amazon. the price per larger unit used to be excellent. it&#x27;s now become ridiculous, in my opinion, for what amounts to two teaspoons.  very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and will go great in a brown sugar scrub I&#x27;ll be making my friends for the holidays. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this product again. It&#x27;s very strong and doesn&#x27;t take much to give a lovely scent to homemade lotions and scrubs.</li>
            <li> I used to buy cinnamon oil (to make cinnamon toothpicks) about 20 years ago. I thought I would try it again.  Not as strong as it used to be.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. I was making some homemade air/linen freshener, and this gave my mixture exactly what I needed. I ave been using Plant Therapy products for a few months now and have been quite impressed. This was no exception.</li>
            <li> i like this when i or family has a cold.. i think it cleans the air and helps kill germs</li>
            <li> I used this product for my pinecones for a nice spicy scent for my home. Nice strong scent but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this stuff.  It is uplifting. I add it too vinegar and some other essential oils that I use as an all-purpose cleaner.  It blends well with the other oils.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it is therapeutic grade.  Product good for many things.  Looking forward to using it for DH diabetes issue.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, smells great!</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of cinnamon add a couple drops to some cheap lipgloss for a nice, tingly, lip venom effect.  First test it out on yourself though, you don&#x27;t want to ruin a nice color lipgloss with too much and you don&#x27;t want any unfortunate allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> Great addition to potpourri or relaxing bath salts or soak. It will add the smell of fresh baked cookies and makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> I use this in my oil diffuser and really like it, the cinnamon smell really makes my mouth water too. I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands of oils and none of them seem to be as strong as this one. It lasts until I turn my diffuser off which usually operates around 12 hours a day, some of the other oils I&#x27;ve tried only put out a smell for about an hour before fading away but this one lasts the whole run.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Reminds me of fresh cinnamon rolls in the morning. No issues using it on my sensitive skin. Blends well with other oils and butters for lotions</li>
            <li> Really potent. Used to create my own lip plumper and it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> Heavenly, long-lasting fragrance.  I like to mix with Sandalwood oil.  Extremely pleasant and relaxing.</li>
            <li> I love all of Plant Therapy&#x27;s essential oils. I put a few drops in a large glass of water, and sip on it throughout the day. Especially if I&#x27;m going to eat a big Carb meal, as Cinnamon has been shown to regulate blood sugar levels.</li>
            <li> It is what I expected it to be, except is smells like red hots instead of ground cinnamon. Good product.</li>
            <li> I have only recently started using essential oils, and have tried out multiple different brands. They all claim to be \\&quot;pure\\&quot; and \\&quot;undiluted\\&quot;. It&#x27;s hard to choose! I have bought the expensive brands, because \\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot;, is usually true. But not in this case! I figured I would just try Plant Therapy, because why break the bank if you don&#x27;t have to, right? I have been 100% pleased with the oils. I am so excited to have found a company with a great product that I can afford!</li>
            <li> I would definitely describe this as a woodsy cinnamon, thus the cinnamon bark i suppose. I mix it with lemon and let it simmer on my stove top and it makes my place smell AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> This is strong, strong stuff.  Smells great and has the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; cinnamon taste I&#x27;ve been looking for.  The aftertaste is clean and sweet.  I use it for homemade toothpaste and it makes the baking soda base much more pleasant.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any comparison but this seems like an excellent product to me, has the right smell and taste and the dispensing dropper works properly.</li>
            <li> As advertised, but very small bottles!</li>
            <li> OH MY GOODNESS this stuff is AWESOME!!! However, if you are even the slightest bit sensitive (skin wise), don&#x27;t get it on your skin... I got it on my neck and it burned like crazy!&lt;br /&gt;BUT, it smells SOooooo Good~! &#x3D; )</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t eat this.  Everybody is reviewing this is something you eat.  But I read the bottle and it says don&#x27;t eat it.  Now what.</li>
            <li> Got this item to make homemade carpet refresher! I love the smell of this! I read many reviews of people who were happy with this product and I am very glad that I also bought this! I will be buying this again and from the seller!</li>
            <li> I do like the doterra, eden garden and now oils. I cant afford what doterra charges and I need a few replacements. I am very happy with this cinnamon bark. It does smell a bit stronger than the doterra oil, but since I use it blended as a muscle rub, its works fine.</li>
            <li> This cinnamon bark oil smells nothing like the holiday-type sweet smell I was hoping for. I opened it up and the scent hit me like a wall. It smells like Hot Tamales - you know, that hideous, bright red cinnamon flavored chewy candy that is a mess for your teeth? I suppose Big Red gum is another example of what this smells like...anyway I&#x27;m not sure that this reflects on the quality of Plant Therapy as an essential oil brand. Maybe this is what all cinnamon bark EO smells like? It smelled very artificial to me, but who knows.</li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist, and love to theme the scents in my room to the season (as much as possible), So this is one that I used for the Holidays!!  My clients loved it! Wonderful scent!</li>
            <li> I ordered the cinnamon bark oil because a friend had told me it would remove moles from my skin.  She did warn me that it would burn but would definitely remove the mole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I took a cotton swab and put a little on several moles on neck and shoulders.  The &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; did not bother me.  However, within two days, the areas I had treated were scarlet red.  Then the itching began.  Had to use cortisone cream for three weeks, night and day, to alleviate the itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be a wonderful product for other uses, but not moles.  They are all still there, laughing at me!</li>
            <li> I liked the container it came in. It has a protective cover so it does not spill all out at once if knocked over.</li>
            <li> very good quality oil</li>
            <li> Loved my cinnamon brooms, but smell was fading.  Tried this oil, it is ok, but has strange odor besides the cinnamon, not the same pure cinnamon smell that the brooms originally had.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have used it for over a while now, the smell is really bad, has a chemical cinnamon smell, would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, I use it when making my chapsticks a couple of drops goes a long way. just make sure if you use it on the skin to mixed it with oil especially if you have sensitive skin,because it will burn if you don&#x27;t .</li>
            <li> I love Plant Therapy&#x27;s Cinnamon Oi!  The dropper that is already built into the bottle is very handy because it makes it easy to measure.</li>
            <li> I use this to spice up toothpicks and make rooms smell a little better. Not really cheap but these little oils have plenty of uses</li>
            <li> Very potent High quality</li>
            <li> MY GRAND DAUGHTER HAS SENSITIVE SKIN AND BROKE OUT WHEN I TOUCHED HER WITH THE CINNAMON ON MY FINGERTIPS.  HAD TO RETURN.</li>
            <li> The cinnamon bark essential oil works very well in my aroma diffuser.  The aroma is strong, but the diffuser keeps it from being overpowering.  Delivery was as promised.</li>
            <li> This smells awful! I thought my nose was off until my kids ages eight and five came home from school and asked, WHAT IS THAT HORRIBLE SMELL? It&#x27;s really  bad.</li>
            <li> This oil is nice and strong, with a lingering scent even when it&#x27;s not being warmed. When warmed, it fills the house wonderfully.</li>
            <li> The Cinnamon Bark essential oil smells good.  I add the scent to my Scentsy warmer because I feel the scents are no longer as strong as they once were.</li>
            <li> You need a much bigger amount to make an impact and this little bottle is too expensive for how much it does</li>
            <li> This Cinnamon Bark Essential Oil smells heavenly - exactly as the seller described it. Packaging was good and the bottle itself is high-quality. I love it!</li>
            <li> Smells just as it should it worked well for sugar scrubs and we only had to use half as much as we did of the grapefruit scent.  I recommend.  Seems to be a nice quality oil..but I am new to oils but these seem good for non edible uses and you cant beat the price!</li>
            <li> Smells like cinnamon!  Will make your wildest dreams come true</li>
            <li> the bottle was so small not worth the price used it up in a day considering th eprice paid I expected a larger size</li>
            <li> This stuff is potent!  I&#x27;ve used miniscule amounts with lip balm, dabbed on my earlobes, or applied to my pulse points.  The aroma is warm, sweet, and spicy with no synthetic or chemical-y undertones.  I also dab a tiny amount on the base of an incandescent light bulb as a home fragrance - this typically lasts 24-36 hours and makes a warm, inviting smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower the house.  A little dab&#x27;ll do ya.</li>
            <li> bottle exploded on me.  beware.  also very pungent (it&#x27;s cinnamon of course)</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this oil, it is a great quality oil.&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to have a chance to get this at a discount for my honest review and I definitely will be purchasing more.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love the cinnamon smell.  I like to put a couple drops in my tea.  Sometimes I add a drop of the clove oil too. Mmmm.</li>
            <li> This product is what I have been looking for.  It appears to be undiluted and has a heavy scent that lasts. The product can burn sensitive skin so one would want to be careful not to get it on the face.  The product can be diluted for aroma therapy.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, but very weak and quickly dissipates.  Disappointed.  Not sure this is a pure essential oil.  Price is good however.</li>
            <li> This is really a wonderful oil and a scent that I love to use. I&#x27;ve purchased this brand before and really like it.</li>
            <li> was making homemade potpourri with pine cones. works great.  also works as a human scent but you have to dilute it with olive oil.&lt;br /&gt; And as always Amazon did a great job in shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. The scent is strong and authentic!</li>
            <li> I received the package with Plant Therapy Cinnamon Cassia Essential Oil, I diffused it, and I&#x27;m in heaven.</li>
            <li> great EO for the price</li>
            <li> This oil is very strong and a little does go a long way. I mainly use it for hair care and for making a mouth rinse mixed with peppermint and rosemary oil. Love it!</li>
            <li> So all i read is how toxic this is to ingest, and how it will burn your skin. Why is it made then? For risk of my kids getting it, I threw it away.</li>
            <li> I made homemade candle melts and did not add enough scent (10 drops).  I don&#x27;t have another scent to compare it to so I&#x27;m not sure if this is normal.  I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This has a nice fresh cinnamon scent with an undertone of a woodsey scent. I especially like it for the holidays. It only takes maybe 3 drops added to an oil warmer with a little plain wax.  This was very well packed and arrived in lightening speed. I will buy again from this seller. I also bought 3 other scents.</li>
            <li> if it is true bark oil it should have more aroma than this has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly would not order again</li>
            <li> Great quality product.  Smells homey and I know the oil is good for lip plumping when diluted with some beeswax or other oil.  This is great quality and very healthy and helpful around the house in a great many ways.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This was the best cinnamon I have found!!!  It was beyond my expectations.  Made the house smell wonderful during the holidays!!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that the oil was truly undiluted. It reinfused my previously-cinnamon-smelling pine cones so effectively that my husband noticed it.</li>
            <li> Cinnamon bark essential oil is pure and can work well to help people calm down through smell and create other helps as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for sometime with my Holistic Health practice. For years I was paying about 15 dollars per 10mls for Cinnamon Bark Oil. I finally found this! Excellent and my clients actually prefer the taste as it&#x27;s smoother than any other Cinnamon Bark. Kudos, great product.</li>
            <li> I love Cinnamon 100%.  Adds a nice aroma to the room you put this in.  Arrived in great shape and well wrapped to prevent breakage.  Thanks for great product.</li>
            <li> We use this to ward off Mosquitos. Just be careful to not get on skin as it irritates it and since its an oil it doesn&#x27;t wash off easily.</li>
            <li> Over priced, cent does not last for more than a couple of days. Bought it to scent pine cones for Christmas, had to use the whole bottle. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> It was a better quality than I expected!! The price was great as well!! I&#x27;ve tried other well known brands paying almost 3xs more. But I&#x27;m slowly try&#x27;n more of the plant therapy products which I&#x27;m finding they are equal to or a better quality...</li>
            <li> This item arrived on time and without damage. I have used other companies in the past for my oils and was very impressed with this one! This oil diffuses perfectly, smells great and helps with my headaches when mixed with peppermint. I diffuse alone as well. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> good product. read that this keeps bugs at bay.  diluted in water and sprayed away.</li>
            <li> Strong stuff. If you don&#x27;t leave the top off too long, it won&#x27;t get clogged.  I&#x27;ve ordered this a couple of times. Good price, fast shipping, no complaints.</li>
            <li> .....buy this again.  It has a nice aroma, but the intensity fades very quickly and doesn&#x27;t last.  I dripped this on some old potpourri in my master bedroom--maybe 6 drops each time every couple of days to keep the aroma going.  This is a VERY small bottle and it lasted less than ten days.  Not worth it.</li>
            <li> This item was exactly what I ordered - wanted to add to shampoo as an aid to stop hair loss - hope it works.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Awesome quality!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, great quality.</li>
            <li> Yoda says,&amp;#34;ummgh essential oil good no?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to finish my &amp;#34;theeves oil&amp;#34; recipe.</li>
            <li> Perfect for keeping ants off the windowsill !</li>
            <li> great product, good price</li>
            <li> Smells good. I&#x27;ve used it in lotions but I&#x27;ve had an allergic reaction to it, which I hear is common with cinnamon. I will not be using it in any product which has contact w my skin. But it still smells nice &amp; I can see using it to scent the house.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I LOVE cinnamon! I used this oil to flavor saponified coconut oil to make toothsoap. The coconut oil by itself was just TOO soapy tasting. Enter 8 or 10 drops of this oil, and I can&#x27;t wait to brush my teeth. I think I will go do that now. Plant Therapy rocks!!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t intended for consumption, I didn&#x27;t realize that at first. It&#x27;s smells pretty good, it is very strong if burnt with a candle warmer. I think an electric heater works better than a flame for these oils.</li>
            <li> reduced my urine infection and the size of my prostrate when I had it with warm water for about a week everyday</li>
            <li> The fragrance when it&#x27;s first opened is really nice but as it began to dry out it started to stink!  I don&#x27;t know why it did this but I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> We had a wet summer and that caused an invasion of the tiny ants into the kitchen. I found they were coming in through an outlet. I have small children so I went looking for a natural remedy. Also, the ant traps  my husband put down were not working. I got this oil and used a Q-Tip to some run around the outlet plate and around where we saw them the most. I even put some on a cotton ball and left it by the outlet. No More Ants, and it didn&#x27;t stain the paint! It also smells like a kitchen should! Wonderful solution!</li>
            <li> This is a very potent oil. A few drops in a spray bottle with water or alcohol keep the ants out and it smells amazing! Careful with getting it full strength on your skin - I just wash with soap and water immediately and I&#x27;m fine.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something a little more different, but this is still enjoyable.  I am new to essential oils so right now I&#x27;m basically picking through the products and seeing what I&#x27;ll work with the most.</li>
            <li> This is highly strong oil, do not put it on skin undiluted, it will burn you. Great oil.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I bought it to make my own Lip plumper which I did and I have to say it works better then expensive products I have purchased.</li>
            <li> It smells nice but I would prefer a sweeter and stronger scent.  I like to combine it with my vanilla perfume because many men and women like the scent.  It&#x27;s great to use as a deodorant but don&#x27;t use it straight because it can burn the skin.</li>
            <li> A+++ I used this to give my wedding venue a sent since it was in an old log cabin that smelled a little musty. It is very strong, you only ned a little bit. I feel much better about using a 100% natural essential oil than any chemical scents.</li>
            <li> Then product arrived on time with out any issues. However I thought it would be more of a cinnamon smell, the bark scent over takes the cinnamon.</li>
            <li> I only buy this brand ... Totally on point with the taste and the smell.. Will definitely continue to buy.....</li>
            <li> I mixed a couple drops of this in with a few drops of clove oil into my coconut oil that I use for moisturizing daily to give it a spicy scent.  Wonderful.</li>
            <li> Bought this oil to make my own anti-bacterial cleaning spray (water and vinegar and oils..it&#x27;s fantastic).  Very happy with the oil quality.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the larger bottle &amp;#34;drops&amp;#34; easier - the smaller bottles seem to take longer or need a few shakes to get the drops going.</li>
            <li> Great price but for me the smell is to sweet. I like a clean strong cinnamon scent.</li>
            <li> Was hoping this had some spice and heat- and it does.  Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This stuff is STRONG. Cannot be used on your skin without a carrier oil and without being seriously diluted! If that&#x27;s done, works well as a scent for homemade oils/lotions/creams.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and a good price too!</li>
            <li> Great product. Very strong. I took some on water and could feel my lips tingle for a good hour.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Put a few drops in my diffuser and immediately my room smelled great. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in my diffuser hoping to replace my Christmas candles.  When it arrived, it not only stank, but says on the bottle that it&#x27;s not recommeded for aromatherapy.  I wish I would&#x27;ve known this before I bought it. :(</li>
            <li> Love it! Very affordable and seems to be of great quality. I use it to make my own germ-fighting blend.</li>
            <li> OMG&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. Its very strong but its good for your lips to get pumper or bigger....</li>
            <li> P&amp;T is a  essential oil that lasts a long time and the aroma is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t smell like cinnamon.  The bark part really gave an off smell.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and works as I&#x27;d hoped. I bought it to use as an ingredient in a lip plumper. It provided the plumping I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> Bought this for use with dryer balls and to give sheets and such some scent, keep the bugs away and to be enjoyed when they&#x27;re gotten out of the closet.  Cinnamon has a tan color and is &amp;#34;gloppy.&amp;#34;  Peppermint oil comes out clear and smooth.  This comes out in brown lumps.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any color left on the sheets, but there&#x27;s certainly color left on the wool dryer balls.  The scent is great, but the color and consistency isn&#x27;t good for my planned use of the essential oil.</li>
            <li> This is really a high quality oil. It has a great scent and comes in a protected bottle. The plus side is that Plant Therapy is a name we can trust.</li>
            <li> Love the smell in my diffuser.</li>
            <li> I wish it was less expensive but the product is excellent and the package was well packed. Great job. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Nothing special, but nothing to rave about. Ok scent. Ok strength. Ok, ok ok.... i like cinnamon and it smells like cinnamon.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this on my felted dryer balls &amp; the scent is magnificent. I may try the cedar wood for sweaters, I haven&#x27;t used that one yet. I love this aroma.</li>
            <li> exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil as one of the ingredients for Thieves Oil. It is very fragrant and hopefully would work to help keep bacteria and viruses away!!!!</li>
            <li> great product, just what I&#x27;ve been looking for, shipping was fast and packaging was very good. Price of product was good as well. I can&#x27;t wait to use it in my next body mixtures.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell and made a great lip plumper balm mixed with coconut oil.i am going to make pumpkin cinnamon soap next weekend.Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> Good product. Good service.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. Cinnamon is so aromatic and has really helped in calming my cravings whether it be for certain foods or alcohol.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipper and just as described and boy does this stuff get hot when skin is contacted so remember not to keep it locked up in the kitchen!</li>
            <li> This is great and you only need a little.  It smells like you are baking cinnamon rolls.  Add a little vanilla essential oil and you won&#x27;t want to leave your home.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter. She loves it and uses it all the time. Makes the house smell wonderful</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this product as a temporary lip plumper, and I decided to try it! It smells good, but it did absolutely nothing to my lips..disappointing. I have to give credit to the service, though, because I received it even earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m content with the scent could be better.</li>
            <li> Cinnamon Bark Essential Oil is terrific.  Just what I wanted to refresh my Christmas pinecones and put in my diffuser.  Plant Therapy even puts the name of the fragrance on top of the bottle - nice touch.</li>
            <li> I bought this to go with my new diffuser. My house never smelled so good! Yummy, Iike I was baking all day.  I already added more scents  from this company to my wish list on Amazon.com. Can&#x27;t wait to try more. I checked local stores, higher prices and not so good.</li>
            <li> Right from the bottle the cinnamon smell was powerful and there was no need to have to use to much in my body scrub. It goes along way for such a small bottle, I will be getting it again.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this oil. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order this brand again. I used it to make my own Thieves oil blend--and it was just what I needed. It came promptly and smells divine!</li>
            <li> I received the product well packaged and on time. This is the first time I tried Cinnamon Oil , and very happy because it is so much easier and convenient compared to Cinnamon Powder. I am pleased with the product and recommend for purchase.</li>
            <li> Smells amaze. I combine it with clove eo for a room deodorizer. Mix with water and vodka to prevent nozzle clogging and it covers up bad smells. Reminds me of xmas</li>
            <li> On use a few drops. Strong I like it ...</li>
            <li> I love this and use it in my burner every day. It&#x27;s got such a strong and wonderful scent. I ordered several already and will always keep it on hand.</li>
            <li> The scent of this cinnamon oil is wonderful.  I didn&#x27;t intend it for consumption, but wanted the true scent of cinnamon which is not always the case with scents intended for aroma.  This oil is perfect.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Great product and great value. Will definitely buy again when I need to add to my essential oil stash!</li>
            <li> They smell is okay for this. It&#x27;s a little on the sweet side for me and I was looking for something stronger with more of a cinnamon scent.</li>
            <li> I like the product, the smell, I&#x27;m waiting to see if it will actually help with the hair growth part. One thing I must mention, a lot of people recommend mixing the product with other oils before applying it to the skin directly; do your research before you mix this with another oil. I mixed mine with carrot oil (since I use that on my hair often) applied it on my head, wiped my hands down and put on my make-up. I don&#x27;t know why this happened, but it felt like satan was tap-dancing on my head. My head felt SOOO hot AND I had orange spots where I had applied the mixture on my head (looked like iodine spots). Since I had not washed my hands but rather wiped, every spot I had directly touched on my face was red and slightly raised; it was not painful on my face (thank goodness), but my head felt like I was the human torch for about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I have applied the oil on it&#x27;s own since and it feels a bit warm but nothing painful or as excruciating as my carrot-cinnamon blend. It smells great, but that is a personal observation, I love the smell of cinnamon.</li>
            <li> So far I have used this in multiple purposes, and it does its job.  A little goes a VERY LONG WAY, please keep that in mind.  It is good, but too much obviously becomes overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;Also as a note to people unaware--this will burn your skin.  Do NOT get this near your eyes, lips, etc.  At the very least, not until you&#x27;ve diluted it greatly.  I read in other reviews of people doing such, and they found out the hard way.  I got some on my skin a few times, even when decently diluted, and it still left horrible, itchy, painful redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when used PROPERLY, a little in the right places, it smells great.  You&#x27;ll be reminded of Holiday decor, more than likely.</li>
            <li> Smells great but not very strong. I wanted to add it to my scented wax warmer for more of a cinnamon scent but it did not add much. I ultimately poured the whole bottle in the warmer and got a good day out of it. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> The lid wasn&#x27;t sealed, as in the plastic pieces which lock on the plastic pieces had already been opened.  I am the one who opened the package, and I know that it had already been opened.  Since I was mixing up Thieves oil to leave the country with on a missions trip, I went ahead and used it.  This was the same with four of the Essential Oils I purchased from you.  The rest were sealed appropriately.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this</li>
            <li> I was expecting a scent similar to cinnamon sticks or the cinnamon you cook with. But this particular cinnamon essential oil smells more like the hot cinnamon.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve used it before.Would order again.  I ordered this product for my mother&#x27;s lung health.  She diffuses it.</li>
            <li> It leaked all over and got everything it touched gunky. It also crystalized all around the cap effectively clogging the dropper.</li>
            <li> Truly love this oil! This product has a phenomenal scent and fills the room with the perfect amount of scent when used in my diffuser. This isn&#x27;t an overwhelming scent and does not have a &amp;#34;fake fragrance&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> ZERO stars - it literally smells like cat urine; the worst quality I&#x27;ve ever had. What has happened to this company? It seems like every bottle of any oil is completely different now. I went from bragging about this company&#x27;s oils to waiting for my other bottle of bergamot I&#x27;m afraid to finally receive to check out  before making a return on this cat urine - I mean &amp;#34;Cinnamon&amp;#34;. :(</li>
            <li> good stuff- cleans the skin</li>
            <li> Good quality essential oil.</li>
            <li> First time buying essential oils and I was very and pleasantly surprised. Both dark colored bottles(sweet orange) came carefully sealed in bubble wrap, which was good. The cinnamon bark was warm, spicy and pungent, nothing overwhelming. Packed quite a punch when I used it in my oil burner, but thats my fault since I didnt know I could lessen that with a carrier oil to make it last longer. Anyway, only drawback was it didn&#x27;t have a dropper so I might&#x27;ve went overboard in using it. Overall good product, I&#x27;ll likely order from them again.</li>
            <li> Some people believe essential oils cannot be ingested.  They can and they are beneficial to the system, and it tastes good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this bottle for almost a year now and I am not happy with it. I bought it with the intention of making cinnamon pine-cones for the holidays. Smelled straight from the bottle it&#x27;s quite nice, reminiscent to the candy &#x27;Red Hots&#x27;. Once it drys though - YUCK, such a terrible/odd scent, nothing like cinnamon. I found myself walking into the house going &amp;#34;oh god what is that terrible smell???&amp;#34;. Put the bottle away only to bring it out a year later, this morning, and yup - still hate it when it drys.</li>
            <li> I love Plant Therapy oils.  I am not able to afford the two brands of ML oils so I go with the 100 Therapeutic Grade and have found that theirs are a superior quality for the money.</li>
            <li> I bought the Cinnamon Oil to add a fresh scent to the inside of my refrigerator. It is not as strong a scent as I would have preferred. There is nothing wrong with the oil, but I would not buy it again. Good price.</li>
            <li> This is the 5th oil I&#x27;ve ordered from Plant Therapy. It is my go-to brand of essential oils. I like the quality and I like what the company stands for. The shipping is always quick, and the customer service is stellar. This cinnamon bark smells great, and will be a wonderful addition to my oil stash for this holiday season.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than the brand I usually buy.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. I real cinnamon not the fake pinecones at Walmart stuff .  I was surprised the strength .  Looking forward to the health resounds and the holiday aroma. ( as long as I don&#x27;t have to bake )</li>
            <li> Smell is very strong didn&#x27;t like it but seems good product</li>
            <li> This essential oil is being used for scientific research, and the purity level is definitely fantastic! Most essential oils are loaded with alcohol to the point that you can smell the alcohol more than you can the actual oil, but in the case of this product, you definitely are getting a very pure cinnamon product.</li>
            <li> My essential oil is a tad bit disappointing in that the strength seems to be just a bit weak. I had hoped to be \\&quot;overwhelmed\\&quot; with cinnamon aromas filling the room, but this is not the case. The issue *may* be the \\&quot;euro style dropper cap\\&quot; -- I personally find it difficult to release a measured, controlled amount of oil from the bottle; I&#x27;m concerned about getting TOO much oil out onto the host surfaces, and therefore may be actually getting too LITTLE oil -- frustrating! But, for the paltry price, it&#x27;s pretty nice stuff. :)</li>
            <li> I love this oil so much that this is my second order. Can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
            <li> HOW SHOULD I USE THIS FOR BEST EFFECT? DO I HEAT IT? OR  HOW DO I USE IT?  I LOVE THE SCENT THO.</li>
            <li> This is good, aromatic, strong flavored oil.  I&#x27;ve purchased other oils from our local health food store, but they&#x27;re not as potent.</li>
            <li> I mix this with half and half water and denatured alcohol for a dust mite killer. My son, who has had awful allergies primarily from dust mites came to visit. I had sprayed this mixture all over the sheets, pillow, carpet, and everything else in the room. He did not have the awful scratchy throat in the mornings, so I think this made that possible. The cinnamon smell did not overpower and dissipated fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> This product most definitely smells like cinnamon and has become a staple for most of my blends.  A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This product does burn my skin so you might have to mix it with a carrier oil which I do.  I use it for the bottom of my feet for it gets into my blood stream.  as it is researched to kill bacteria infections.</li>
            <li> Love this scent. I used it on my wool dryer ball in a load of towels and it smells great. Not too strong after stung either.</li>
            <li> I have Alopecia areata (AA) a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body, usually from the scalp. I got this after several combat tours in the military medical creams did not work and a family member recomended this oil just place it on a Qtip and rub it on the (AA) areas it does burn a little at first but this is what stimulates your hair folicules to grow back thanks to this oil my hair grows back every time the condition returns</li>
            <li> I have become an essential oil fanatic.......the cinnamon is great.  I made cinnamon toothpicks with it.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil to add a nice cinnamon smell to my family room.  We usually buy the cinnamon brooms at the market in fall and the smell lasts a while and fills the house with cinnamon.  This item smells bad and not even close to cinnamon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to dilute and spray on my carpet where our dog was peeing. It worked like a charm! We&#x27;ve had no more accidents and the house smells like cinnamon. It didn&#x27;t stain the carpet. I&#x27;ll buy more as necessary!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you like cinnamon! Strong cinnamony scent that fills the room. I also can count on this brand to be consentrated.</li>
            <li> The oil is very strong and I only use 5 drops and I can taste it.  But, a lot of people claim that cinnamon is good for us, so I am willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I thought I might make my own spicey cologne.  I have not done that yet but I added some of it to an oil that I put on my face (I have very dry skin). If you remember the candy Red Hots you know what I mean by bite or burn.  The stuff is en fuego.  I have to figure out how I want to use it but it does have a great scent.  as of 2/27/2016 I don&#x27;t care for the scent. Perhaps I mixed too much with my coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Learning about using essential oils and since I love cinnamon anyway, decided to add this to the the beginnings of a collection.  Haven&#x27;t yet tried it, but am sure I will love it when I do!</li>
            <li> I want to love this oil, but of all the oils I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon, this one just missed the mark. The smell is not quite strong enough, nor lasting enough. Maybe it was an old or weak batch? Given the very affordable price, I&#x27;d be willing to buy it again to see if it was just a problem with my particular bottle. It is rated so well, and I have a hard time believing what was shipped to me is what everyone seems so pleased with. If I buy it again in the future, and have a better experience, I will update my review.</li>
            <li> The Cinnamon Bark Essential Oil was just as expected and shipped promptly.  I used it in my Scentsy warmer and it created a nice scent in my kitchen.  I would buy from this vendor again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
            <li> Great strong scent for my candles and soaps.</li>
            <li> Awful, gave my blisters. TOO STRONG!!!!</li>
            <li> While this may be good for cleaning, it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;Ceylon&amp;#34; cinnamon - which is better for your health than cassia.  Read up on it.</li>
            <li> This oil smells just like cinnamon.  I dab a bit on our heat vents and on the gas fireplace screen.  We have gas heat and when the heat runs, it makes our home smell lovely.  I love using this scent in our home during the fall season.  Smells yummy!</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love this oil..... I&#x27;m honestly only using it so far in my diffuser.  I&#x27;m sure I will find other uses for this other than diffuser.</li>
            <li> I make my own germ fighter/thieves oil blend and this cinnamon EO works great! Love Plant therapy! It&#x27;s a wonderful company to buy essential oils from!</li>
            <li> This reminds me of the cinnamon oil I used to buy as a kid to make cinnamon stics from toothpics.  It is very strong but also perfect for adding to my coffee...12 drops per 10 cup pot.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this compares to other cinnamon essential oils from other companies.  I was making my own thieves blend and needed cinnamon.  This definitely smells good -- just like cinnamon, as I&#x27;d expect.  My only issue is that the oil is too thick for the euro dropper, or the dropper is plain terrible.  It does not form droplets.  I was best off removing the dropper and using my own pipettes for measurement.  Overall, satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure, smells amazing (but strong!) and is extremely high quality. I&#x27;m sure it would work amazing in an aromatherapy diffuser. I personally use it for two slightly unconventional uses - lotion and an all-natural lip plumper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make my own lotion from coconut oil and almond oil (I have very sensitive skin and also feel slightly weird about putting so many crazy sounding ingredients on my skin) and will sometimes add a few drops of this in. It makes it feel a little warming and also really helps with sore muscles if I&#x27;ve recently done an intense workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also - and this is the main reason I love this - use it as a lip plumper. I mix about 3 - 4 drops of this into a container of lip salve or shea butter (you could also drop a couple drops into your favorite lip gloss). It is VERY STRONG and you should start with just a few drops. The first time I did this, I added too much and had extremely red, dry lips for a week. But in moderation, it&#x27;s the best lip plumper I&#x27;ve ever used both in terms of effectiveness and feeling, smelling, and looking great. It never feels sticky or artificial. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments and literally given out some homemade shea butter / cinnamon oil lip salve as gifts (I use Now brand shea butter). Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this fragrance oil at all.</li>
            <li> This is a really good cinnamon essential oil. Be warned, it does lightly burn for a couple of minutes, when put in direct contact with your skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to scent pinecones for winter decor and it did the job exactly as I hoped it would.</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell of the cinnamon bark essential oil. So strong and rich. The problem is that I went through the container SOOO fast. I have NEVER gone through a bottle of essential oils so fast. They usually last me forever. In fact I have over 10 bottles and have not gone through one yet! This is the first. I&#x27;m extremely sad and disappointed that there was such a few amount in it. Or maybe the dropper drops a larger amount..not sure. I just know that my bottle is empty,</li>
            <li> I ordered this essential oil to flavor the coconut oil I&#x27;m using for daily oil pulling/swishing, and I love the way it tastes. I find myself looking forward to my new dental hygiene routine every day, and my teeth have gotten so much whiter in just one week. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Great for cooking and just keeong around the house.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.... I bought this to make homemade toothpaste and other products. When I received the box, it contained a small essential oil bottle sealed inside a bubble wrap package. I then opened the bottle, and smelled it, and low and behold, there was no scent, not oily residue of any sort. The bubble wrap was dry too, so I know that it didn&#x27;t leak out. I asked for a replacement bottle, so I will update my review when I hear back from them. Blazin mom 7/30/15</li>
            <li> I bought this to help me loose a few pounds. It stinks but does seem to help me with digestive issues.</li>
            <li> OK. So I recently found this awesome lip plumper made by Bite Cosmetics. It has cinnamon oil in it and I really like it...but I want to LOVE it. Im crafty-I can make it better! I scoured my local Vitamin Shoppe &amp; GNC, but I couldn&#x27;t find cinnamon oil anywhere. Luckily, good old Amazon came thru for me &amp; the Cinnamon Bark Essential Oil came in record time. I was so excited when it came in, I popped the lid off straight away, and put some of the deliciously smelling essential oil directly on my lips. At first, I was disappointed--I mean I only felt a little tiny tingle--bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of seconds, I&#x27;d realized I should be a Bluth, because I&#x27;d made a huge mistake. Holy moley, did it burn. Like burnnnning burn. You&#x27;re probably thinking \\&quot;Oh, It must have been like eating hot wings or something\\&quot;. You would be wrong madam. It was like a tiny Satan was breakdancing on my lips. This must be what it&#x27;s like if Krampus came &amp; got you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked in the mirror thru my teary eyes to find it did in fact plump my lips, but with mascara running down my cheeks, the whole look was ruined. Luckily, the pain subsided after about 20 seconds, at which point I acknowledged I am truly an idiot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still love this stuff. Im going to find some lip gloss base to dilute it for the perfect plumper. Five Stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 08/30/2013 I did add this to a lip gloss, and the homemade plumper is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update to the Update: 10/24/2013 My friend told me the smell of cinnamon subliminally attracts the male of the species. \\&quot;hrm...\\&quot; i thought \\&quot;i totally have some cinnamon oil sitting on my jewelry stand.\\&quot; So I threw on the Young Guns soundtrack &amp; Yes, I did--threw this all over my pulse points. Yes, it shockingly had the same reaction. Instead of the hubbs coming home to a delicious smelling wife, he walked in on me feverishly trying to tend to the bright red welt on my neck &amp; wrists with a wet washcloth. I still think it worked, because dudes love funny chicks and the situation was nothing if not comical.funny chicks and the situation was nothing if not comical.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make the scented pine cones at Christmas. I found some instructions online and followed them perfectly; however, the smell just didn&#x27;t last that long.  I ended up sprinkling the pine cones every few days to keep the smell up</li>
            <li> This oil is strong and very sweet. I actually burned too much of it the first time around, and had to air the place out. Insects seem to infest my apartment every summer, so I bought this and few other oils to help keep them at bay, and it has worked well so far. It smells great when combined with orange or dragon&#x27;s blood oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful! I use it nearly every day. It has a pleasant smell, lasts a long time. Totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product...this is the second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased from this company.  I use it in an oil burner, as an ant repellent, and in perfume.  It is very strong and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> This product seems to be of the quality that I expected. That is a good thing. I love to put it on my feet. I know it is working because after I use it I can literally taste it around the edges of my mouth. It is amazing how essential oils can flow throughout your body in a matter of minutes. Also, I always have to remind myself to wash my hands after I rub it on my feet. It is potent enough to feel like it is burning my skin, if I forget to wash and, touch my face. Things get very warm. I plan on purchasing this brand again.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. As expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this, along with other essential oils from this company, to use as \\&quot;brain joggers\\&quot; for my university students as we learn new and difficult concepts.  I started with peppermint and moved onto other strong scents to use when studying different concepts in order to trigger their brains when they encountered the scent again.  The peppermint, vanilla, and lemon were all fine (I dip the corners of the index cards we are working on in them), but the cinnamon bark doesn&#x27;t smell very much like cinnamon to me.  Perhaps this is what real cinnamon smells like, but it was more like tea being drunk by an individual in a nursing home.  NOT the scent I was going for...but it was too late to redo all the index cards.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like cinnamon.  Smells like bad dirt.  Ugh, I should have returned it but I was hoping my nose would get used to it, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am already recommending it to friends! Great product!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. No damage to product or packaged. I purchased this from Plant Therapy Essential Oils. The cinnamon oil is definitely 100% pure. I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I use the Cinnamon Bark Essential Oil to drop droplets onto my wood stove while it is burning to put a clean fragrance into the air. The oil could have been a bit stronger.</li>
            <li> The.product is great and service was fast.. Too fast this time. When  I realized  I&#x27;d ordered the same product a couple of months ago I attempted to cancel this order. ( these products are so good you don&#x27;t need very much and they last a long time) we&#x27;ll it was too late to cancel so now I have a second bottle. The price was so reasonable. It might take me a couple of years but I&#x27;ll eventually open the second bottle.</li>
            <li> In my former life, i was a licensed massage therapist.  I bought a lot of essential oils to scent my massage oils and lotions based on customer preference.&lt;br /&gt;At that time, there weren&#x27;t a lot of options, and I was usually stuck buying them at small independent health food stores.  Usually they&#x27;d have one brand, and it was expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a review from a lady who was making soaps (I think), and she mentioned this brand.  I bought the cinnamon and it has been wonderful.  As good as the more expensive brand I used to buy.  Shipper had it nicely wrapped in a bubble wrap bag so no worry about breakage.  Nice dark bottle so I don&#x27;t have to worry about light affecting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more of this brand of oils in future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy camper.  I put a few drops in my steam mop and now my house smells like the holidays. :)</li>
            <li> Wow!  What a great cinnamon EO!  I&#x27;m using this in a disinfectant blend and to run in my diffuser to liven up things and it is the perfect strength ... not too &#x27;hot&#x27; nor too weak or sweet smelling.  I am enjoying this EO very much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong, and smells like how Big Red gum tastes! I am very pleased with the scent and the quality of oil. Be careful as the scent is powerful and could easily become overwelming.</li>
            <li> I was just what I wanted, and quick delivery.  I really like the drip tip too, it makes it easy to just get a drop at a time.</li>
            <li> Very good product, I would definitely order this again. The oil is highly aromatic and works wonderfully for my homemade soaps..  I would highly recommend this vendor. I ordered three different oils and I love all of them. Prompt delivery and perfect packaging, Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Very pleasant smell, plant therapy has some good oils.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a squirrel deterrent on bird feeders.  Works great.  Squirrel do NOT like it and birds have more food.</li>
            <li> I like the scent of the cinnamon bark essential oil by plant therapy. I just seem to have a defective dropper. The oil leaks down the side of the bottle and is quite messy. Other than that I really like this oil. I have other oils by plant therapy so I know that not all of the bottles have this problem. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Thank you so much. I plan to order more essential oils from your store. This Cinnamon Bark was just what I was looking for. You have a wonderful selection!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this Cinnamon oil. The only &#x27;very minor&#x27; issue is that when I attempt to add a few drops to a mixture, you don&#x27;t have as much droplet control (rather quick), as I&#x27;m more familiar with when using other brands. But again, minor, and I&#x27;d buy this brand again</li>
            <li> Handy oil for balm mixtures.</li>
            <li> I sprinkle this on my brown carpets so my house smells nice</li>
            <li> Received product as described, it is of high quality and the scent is wonderful. I will not hesitate to purchas from this company again.</li>
            <li> Received product quickly and it smells wonderful!!  I use a mixture of cinnamon bark oil and other oils mixed with water for cleaning.  Love the product :)</li>
            <li> I love cinnamon and put in almost everything I eat. This oil has a rich, intoxicating cinnamon scent. It smells kind of sweet to me, which I love. The scent is strong so a few drops will go a long way.</li>
            <li> Bought this to make a lip plumper. Planning other uses for it, as well.</li>
            <li> I used the oil to resaturate some cinnamon pine cones for the holidays.  The smell was great, but be careful.  I accidentally spilled a drop on my media cabinet and did not notice right away.  By the time I tried to wipe it up...it had eaten through the finish on the cabinet.  Thankfully, I have dark wood and I can camouflage it with black ink.  But, all in all it was a very good product for the cinnamon bark (Cinnamomum cassia).</li>
            <li> Good product... great value!</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as described and expected. Smells good and works just as good as any other cinnamon oil I purchased, but at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent.  It&#x27;s important to use sparingly so as not to overpower others when mixing. Will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> I use this oil in home made toothpaste. Great product. I only have to use a few drops to get a great cinnamon flavor.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the cinnamon bark oil.  I like to use the scent inside toilet paper rolls, use it in lip gloss,,,I find so many uses for it.  It came promptly and in good packaging.</li>
            <li> Just as described and quick delivery.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Cinnamon Bark Essential Oil; smell magnificent (to me), it makes any room smell like you are cooking cookies. Cinnamon bark oil has been shown to control dust mites: mix several drops into 50/50 solution of water (I use distilled water) denatured alcohol (I order this denatured alcohol from Amazon.com). Spray bedding, carpets, and any other places dust collects.  It works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dust mites solution is from Bob Vila Eco-Friendly Cleaning site.</li>
