            <li> the floss wasn&#x27;t strung tight enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (the taste is very artificial and gross to me personally).</li>
            <li> but, I agree, the floss is too thick.</li>
            <li> I know this sounds ridiculous but the picture does not match the product.  </li>
            <li> , here is my last flosser, I will keep it for when I have bad teeth&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li> quick delivery and good price</li>
            <li> My kids literally ask for floss every night.  It&#x27;s the highlight of the evening.  My kids LOVE this stuff.  We already need to order another pack.</li>
            <li> use on my kids - works great</li>
            <li> Great product!  Makes flossing super easy and fun with our children.  Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> So easy for my child to use that she actually does.</li>
            <li> I should have looked more closely at the package photo vs. the description. Wouldn&#x27;t have purchased if I realized it was flavored (the taste is very artificial and gross to me personally). Also if you look at the package closely, this floss is fluoride coated which is not what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> Great product, very durable floss and easy to use.  Kids said you can&#x27;t taste the grape but they didnt mind</li>
            <li> Our daughter loves these and can&#x27;t wait to floss her teeth.</li>
            <li> Love these.  My two boys let me floss their teeth for them and they love picking out the color to use.</li>
            <li> Great value and they&#x27;re scented! My kids love them</li>
            <li> A hit with my 4 year old twins!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the grape flavor tastes really bad. My son won&#x27;t use them and I don&#x27;t like the taste either!</li>
            <li> Cute colors, comfortable for kids to handle - but, I agree, the floss is too thick.</li>
            <li> Bought them for my 5 year old; they&#x27;re handy to use but he needs help still. Discovered that my husband also find them handy as he&#x27;s been using them as well!!</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my son after receiving a free sample from our dentist.  He loved the grape flavor in the sample pack.  However, in this order although the packages clearly state &amp;#34;grape&amp;#34; flavor, they don&#x27;t have any taste/scent at all.  I&#x27;m still giving 3 stars because they get the job of flossing done.  However, it&#x27;s harder to convince my child to pick one up with out the grape flavor.</li>
            <li> no sharp corner. easy to grip . fine for the needs.</li>
            <li> My kids love these! They are always sneaking into the bathroom to get some more. I find them all over the house and the kids think they are lollipops! Flossing is exciting and easy. We&#x27;ve been using these for about half a year and kids still thrilled! I&#x27;ll need to find a better place to hide these :)</li>
            <li> Getting the kids to floss every night is tough, but they love the different colors, and easy to use design.</li>
            <li> Great for helping teach kids how to floss.</li>
            <li> These flossers are good for little kid teeth. They are smaller size and nice bright colors. My daughter is three and likes using them so that makes it good.</li>
            <li> These flossers were being used by our Pediactrics dentist. Kids love them, they do not have any sharp edges like other flossers. If you have kids, these are great for them.</li>
            <li> Love these little floaters. My dentist originally gave us a sample, and I really liked them for my toddlers little mouth.</li>
            <li> my kids floss every day now. they love the flavor and ease of these.  i don&#x27;t have to fight them to floss. great product</li>
            <li> My son (age 9) has trouble using regular floss and he hates mint flavor. He&#x27;s quite capable of flossing for himself with these, and even happy to do it because of the grape. Victory!</li>
            <li> Great product for kids in vibrant colors. You may need one or two per flossing session.</li>
            <li> good quality. kids like it.</li>
            <li> These flossers have no mint flavor (which my kids hate), but they seem better made than other brands.  My children have teeth that are close and need strong flossers.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old granddaughter actually asks for these.  A great way to introduce flossing to a younger child.</li>
            <li> They work well.  Fits into my 2 yr old and 4 yrs olds mouths.  The colors and designs on the handle make it fun for my 4 yr old.</li>
            <li> Great flosser&#x27;s for my kids, they absolutely love them! Colorful and well made, highly recommended. Great value for 3X packs.</li>
            <li> Work great on my 2 yr old.  Easy to use by U.S. or her and they don&#x27;t have the shape pick tip like the adult version making them safer for anyone&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> I specially bought this brand because I had purchased them before through Amazon.  I read the description for info on them and there was no listing indicating they were flavored.  I have a g-tube fed kid who are notorious for plaque build up and she won&#x27;t use flavored ones.</li>
            <li> Make flossing more fun for my 4-yr. old with all of the color options</li>
            <li> Kids can use them by themselves. Of course my boys argue over who has to use the purple ones...</li>
            <li> Kids love the colors, design is easy for them to hold.  Thickness of the floss seems to work well for the gaps in their teeth.  Been buying these for a while and will keep using them.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a lot of variability in lots.&lt;br /&gt;the first bag we got was good. the second bag it was like the floss wasn&#x27;t strung tight enough.&lt;br /&gt;i gave away the 3rd bag.&lt;br /&gt;we didnt have any issue with the thickness/quality of the floss itself.&lt;br /&gt;my 3yo daughter prefers flavored floss. she likes the colors.&lt;br /&gt;we floss at the same time and so i use the same type of floss she uses. we prefer the Plaquers. she likes the flavor &amp; shapes &amp; colors. and i feel like i get a better flossing job.</li>
            <li> Bought these a while ago for my 4 year old and last week he came to me telling me &amp;#34;Mom, here is my last flosser, I will keep it for when I have bad teeth&amp;#34;. I figured I had to buy moreâ€¦ They arrived yesterday, needless to tell you how happy my little one was! He uses them every day and I&#x27;m glad because gum care is something I forget, so making it a habit at a young age is awesome! If the lithe ones like it, then it&#x27;s good :)</li>
            <li> My preschooler loves flossing with these (the taste and feel) and in turn that makes me happy!</li>
            <li> It said it was grape flavored, but my kids always comment on how there is no flavoring.  It still works great for flossing, but I wonder why it&#x27;s not flavor like the ones I&#x27;ve bought in a store.</li>
            <li> Love these. Great for little hands and makes flossing more &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> best one. not just only for kids. i love using it myself.</li>
            <li> I know this sounds ridiculous but the picture does not match the product.  I ordered the product for a specific reason and when it came, the handle was different than what was listed.  I needed a solid handle versus one with holes in it.  Thus, I will not be able to use the product.  It was too much money to return, thus, I will have to keep it.</li>
            <li> Great product! Very easy to hold for little and big hands. Colors are great for both boys and girls.  Sturdy and they do a great job cleaning in between tight little teeth. I would recommend these to everyone.</li>
            <li> th shape of the floss cleans my adult teeth better than roll floss. It is sturdy enough for one piece to last an entire day</li>
            <li> My son loves being able to pick the color he wants each night.</li>
