            <li> Love this product. My hair has thickened and grown alot. Will be ordering more of these vitamins.</li>

I also have receded hairline at my temples and small patches of hair are developing there now too!!! I highly recommend these, but just know that your pee will probably turn bright yellow while on them, but that is just the excess vitamins and minerals that you don&#x27;t need being excreted from your body. Good luck :)</li>
            <li> Very helpful stopped my breakage and started my growth. I see a difference in my hair. I would recommend using this product.</li>

            <li> Great product and have diffidently seen a change in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have ordered these vitamins before and they do make my hair grow and get thick.  I will continue to use them in the future.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with hair thinning.  My beautician told me about these vitamins. I have been using these vitamins for at least 5 months and found that may hair has gotten longer and I am losing less hair.</li>
            <li> It takes awhile for this product to work. This product will change the texture of your hair. It makes it really soft, it my case I do not want soft  hair. My hair is thin so this product not work for me. It worked very good with my sister who is natural but I still have a relaxer so I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure because I&#x27;ve taken them all can&#x27;t afford to buy any more now. What else do you want me to say?</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT.  I AM SEEING RESULTS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this vitamin for at least 3 months now and I really don&#x27;t notice a difference.  From the reviews I&#x27;ve read, I thought this would really work.  I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this product; however, I only received 59 tablets instead of 60. This happened the last time I purchased them too. I will still continue to buy them just would like to get the amount I pay for. To potential buyers, please count your pills before using. 4 stars because of that reason only</li>
            <li> THE VITAMINS CAME IN BEATUP BOXES AS IF THEY HAD BEEN DAMAGED BY BEING DROPPED AND BROKEN PILLS. I WASN&#x27;T PLEASE WITH THE APPEARANCE.</li>
            <li> I have use this hair vitamin for a number of years; it really does work!</li>
            <li> This product gave me awful migraine headaches everyday.  No show of hair growth.  Not worth my my money,  time or health.</li>
            <li> I purchased about a three month supply of these vitamins and I must say it did stop the shedding tremendously,and reduced my split ends.... I think.It may have also contributed to my clearer skin.But it did not grow my hair or fix my edges in no miraculous way.Though I heard it takes at least four months to see results.I guess I don&#x27;t have the paitience.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and so I knew how great it was. It does everything it says and is an all around great vitamin. The reason why I only gave it 4 stars is it&#x27;s a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Some growth, still using after 3 months.</li>
            <li> I have used many hair vitamins over the years. This product is the best, I saw immediate results thicker, longer hair and nails. I love it.</li>
