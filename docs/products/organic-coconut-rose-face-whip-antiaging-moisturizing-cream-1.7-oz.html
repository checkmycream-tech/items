            <li>I appreciate the fine ingredients that are both effective and safe.  </li>

            <li>I will continue to use this and long as it keeps my face happy!</li>
            <li>I searched for a long time for the perfect skin care products.</li>
            <li>The new packaging is great too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually pretty easy to please when it comes to fragrances (and I absolutely LOVE the smell of the Skin2Spirit Caffeine Eye Whip - it might be my favorite smelling product ever!), but this is just ...</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, works great on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I think it is helping with my fine lines as well.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect face cream, all natural ingredients, it is light, absorbs quickly and in hot weather does not cause your face to perspire.  </li>
            <li>immediately fell in love with from the very first use!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much, which is nice</li>
            <li>Leaves my face so soft and smooth feeling, love that rose smell too.</li>
            <li>and it goes on skin smoothly.  </li>
            <li>After loving the eye cream so much, I tried the face whip</li>
            <li>It is so light and smooth and not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li>This is a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My face is so smooth</li>
            <li>and my skin is already noticeably softer and really, really smooth.</li>
            <li>It is also very cost effective</li>
            <li>Now i am going to purchase the foam wash for my face so excited to use this organic product that works</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this product to use alongside the coconut rose face wash and couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li>A real winner! :-)</li>
            <li>I have done non-stop research trying to find the perfect all natural, skin benefiting moisturizer and FINALLY my search is over!</li>
            <li>I suffer from dry flaky skin and have been searching for something that helps and works So HAPPY TO FIND THIS ONE!!I</li>
            <li>I love the rose facial foam...</li>
            <li>I started washing my face with distilled water and using skin2spirit face cleanser along with the coconut rose face whip and it fixed my skin!</li>
            <li>Well, I got this for Christmas after reading all the lovely reviews and putting it on my wishlist, and I am very surprised to find that I strongly dislike the scent.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;whip&amp;#34; is a creamy light texture that is easily absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li>My whole face seems a bit more plump in the mornings.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs really well and makes your skin feel so silky smooth!  </li>
            <li>A true find.  </li>
            <li>It does feel nice going on and leaves my face feeling soft, but a tad greasy.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so perfect for my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hydrating, very rich.</li>
            <li>The superior quality of a high end moisturizer with all natural ingredients and zero chemicals!</li>
            <li>I received a new canister from Amazon and boy am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>I try to stay out of the sun mostly and therefore am not able to tell right now how it behaves during the day time but at night it feel good.</li>
            <li>For an organic moisturizer this product is amazing, especially the price!!  </li>
            <li>I love knowing that I am using a product that is all natural without any additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin absorbed the products well and stays on for the rest of the day and night.  </li>
            <li>I love thats is made from natural ingriediens and this lady who owns it</li>
            <li>Seriously, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>this rose facial whip feels like an exfoliant and not a whip cream.  </li>
            <li>This face cream is superior to all other face creams I have tried.</li>
            <li>As soon as my next paycheck comes in the mail, you best bet that I will be exploring the other products that this skin care line has to offer!</li>
            <li>No nother all natural / organic moisturizer has been able to impress me as much as this one has.</li>
            <li>Shipping was also very fast.</li>
            <li>I use it sparingly and my skin is soft and rash free.  </li>
            <li>The first time I ordered this, it was packaged in a manner that caused the pump to break(not the seller&#x27;s fault at all)</li>
            <li>I love this, wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a natural fragrance unlike most chemical filled products.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have a mild case of rosacea.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a natural feel to the true temperature at night.</li>
            <li>I love this, it helps with my dry skin without making my face oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all about skin care and realized pure ingredients was something I needed to go for.</li>
            <li>This glass tube is large.  </li>
            <li>Pump was very hard to use but product was great</li>
            <li>Thanks~</li>
            <li>but it really does.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>and I find that for me, my skin feels smooth and hydrated for the entire day.</li>
            <li>and it really does the job.  </li>
            <li>I have absolutely zero skin problems now.</li>
            <li>so it goes under make up really well.</li>
            <li>really away.......</li>
            <li>I have been experiencing rashes with many other brands...</li>
            <li>most days I don&#x27;t need foundation due to the clarity....</li>
            <li>Other products, while also non-greasy, require 3x more.</li>
            <li>- I swear by rose hip oil for anti-aging since living in New Zealand for a few years and using their Trilogy skincare line.</li>
            <li>I have stopped using all &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; products and changed to organic products and after a month my skin is clear for the first time in 15 years.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that tends to be combination dry but also easily breaks out, so</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Neither of these products caused any sensitivity or breakouts, and both left my skin feeling calm and hydrated.</li>
            <li>So far, my skin seems to really like this product</li>
            <li>and I think more firm.</li>
            <li>A rich, non greasy moisturizer with absolutely no toxins or irritants.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for a little over about 2 weeks and love the results so far.</li>
            <li>The new batch smelled like roses, not mayonnaise.  </li>
            <li>No issues with the new pump on the jar.  </li>
            <li>and it makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in FL and it has hot and humid here, especially now.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for about 5days now and love everything about it.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if it is my wishful thinking or not</li>
            <li>I used Skin2Spirit eye cream for the first time and I was totally hooked.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>Price might be a little bit higher than use to spending, but worth it, to occassionally treat yourself.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin issues and was A bit concerned about the fragrance, but I had no problems, in fact my skin is smoother and the redness has diminished markedly!  </li>
            <li>You can tell that the seller really cares not only about creating an all-organic and natural skin care line, but also truly cares about customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li>It has completely cleared up and my skin looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and I like the product</li>
            <li>No heavy feeling</li>
            <li>But the moisturizer is truly a winner for my 68+ old face.  </li>
            <li>so much that I used almost all in 3 weeks only because I&#x27;m putting it like mask on the face- a lot</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and works all day.  </li>
            <li>I frequently have to use a skin balancing oil before this to fully hydrate.</li>
            <li>This face cream far exceeded my expectations...</li>
            <li>it goes on like silk and sinks right into my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am not giving up on Skin2Spirit since I love the natural ingredients and small-business aspect of it (and that yummy Caffeine Eye Whip, seriously.), but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get through this bottle.</li>
            <li>I especially appreciate that these are natural products derived from organic skin-beneficial ingredients that work just as well or better than high-end chemical-laden products that I have past used.</li>
            <li>2 oz is a very generous size and feel that it has helped to re-hydrate my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent</li>
            <li>This helps smooth dry patches and you only need a TINY amount for your face, and another tiny amount for neck.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft , never dry</li>
            <li>the one I was using previously had shea butter, hyaluronic acid, a few oils, and other good ingredients for the skin.  </li>
            <li>I always use natural products (I have tried several) and</li>
            <li>Compared to the coffee eye whip, it has barely any scent.</li>
            <li>I had purchased a small sample of this and immediately saw those lines diminishing that I then ordered the full size.  </li>
            <li>have mature dry, sensitive skin and it makes my skin feel wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find the smell a little overbearing with the rose scent but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I have normal skin with slightly dry cheeks.</li>
            <li>It smelled so much of mayonnaise that I had to mix it with some other face cream</li>
            <li>The tiny clear things left on my face looks like tiny bristles.  </li>
            <li>I have a few lines around the mouth area....2 smile lines and a long line under the mouth.  </li>
            <li>I have acne prone, sensitive, combination skin that has be very dry from the winter weather and over processing.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m usually pretty easy to please when it comes to fragrances (and I absolutely LOVE the smell of the Skin2Spirit Caffeine Eye Whip - it might be my favorite smelling product ever!), but this is just ...</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, works great on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I think it is helping with my fine lines as well.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect face cream, all natural ingredients, it is light, absorbs quickly and in hot weather does not cause your face to perspire.  </li>
            <li> immediately fell in love with from the very first use!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much, which is nice</li>
            <li> Leaves my face so soft and smooth feeling, love that rose smell too.</li>
            <li> and it goes on skin smoothly.  </li>
            <li> After loving the eye cream so much, I tried the face whip</li>
            <li> It is so light and smooth and not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li> This is a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My face is so smooth</li>
            <li> and my skin is already noticeably softer and really, really smooth.</li>
            <li> It is also very cost effective</li>
            <li> Now i am going to purchase the foam wash for my face so excited to use this organic product that works</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product to use alongside the coconut rose face wash and couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> A real winner! :-)</li>
            <li> I have done non-stop research trying to find the perfect all natural, skin benefiting moisturizer and FINALLY my search is over!</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry flaky skin and have been searching for something that helps and works So HAPPY TO FIND THIS ONE!!I</li>
            <li> I love the rose facial foam...</li>
            <li> I started washing my face with distilled water and using skin2spirit face cleanser along with the coconut rose face whip and it fixed my skin!</li>
            <li> Well, I got this for Christmas after reading all the lovely reviews and putting it on my wishlist, and I am very surprised to find that I strongly dislike the scent.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;whip&amp;#34; is a creamy light texture that is easily absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> My whole face seems a bit more plump in the mornings.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs really well and makes your skin feel so silky smooth!  </li>
            <li> A true find.  </li>
            <li> It does feel nice going on and leaves my face feeling soft, but a tad greasy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so perfect for my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hydrating, very rich.</li>
            <li> The superior quality of a high end moisturizer with all natural ingredients and zero chemicals!</li>
            <li> I received a new canister from Amazon and boy am I glad I did.</li>
            <li> I try to stay out of the sun mostly and therefore am not able to tell right now how it behaves during the day time but at night it feel good.</li>
            <li> For an organic moisturizer this product is amazing, especially the price!!  </li>
            <li> I love knowing that I am using a product that is all natural without any additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin absorbed the products well and stays on for the rest of the day and night.  </li>
            <li> I love thats is made from natural ingriediens and this lady who owns it</li>
            <li> Seriously, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> this rose facial whip feels like an exfoliant and not a whip cream.  </li>
            <li> This face cream is superior to all other face creams I have tried.</li>
            <li> As soon as my next paycheck comes in the mail, you best bet that I will be exploring the other products that this skin care line has to offer!</li>
            <li> No nother all natural / organic moisturizer has been able to impress me as much as this one has.</li>
            <li> Shipping was also very fast.</li>
            <li> I use it sparingly and my skin is soft and rash free.  </li>
            <li> The first time I ordered this, it was packaged in a manner that caused the pump to break(not the seller&#x27;s fault at all)</li>
            <li> I love this, wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a natural fragrance unlike most chemical filled products.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have a mild case of rosacea.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a natural feel to the true temperature at night.</li>
            <li> I love this, it helps with my dry skin without making my face oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all about skin care and realized pure ingredients was something I needed to go for.</li>
            <li> This glass tube is large.  </li>
            <li> Pump was very hard to use but product was great</li>
            <li> Thanks~</li>
            <li> but it really does.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> and I find that for me, my skin feels smooth and hydrated for the entire day.</li>
            <li> and it really does the job.  </li>
            <li> I have absolutely zero skin problems now.</li>
            <li> so it goes under make up really well.</li>
            <li> really away.......</li>
            <li> I have been experiencing rashes with many other brands...</li>
            <li> most days I don&#x27;t need foundation due to the clarity....</li>
            <li> Other products, while also non-greasy, require 3x more.</li>
            <li> - I swear by rose hip oil for anti-aging since living in New Zealand for a few years and using their Trilogy skincare line.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using all &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; products and changed to organic products and after a month my skin is clear for the first time in 15 years.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that tends to be combination dry but also easily breaks out, so</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Neither of these products caused any sensitivity or breakouts, and both left my skin feeling calm and hydrated.</li>
            <li> So far, my skin seems to really like this product</li>
            <li> and I think more firm.</li>
            <li> A rich, non greasy moisturizer with absolutely no toxins or irritants.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over about 2 weeks and love the results so far.</li>
            <li> The new batch smelled like roses, not mayonnaise.  </li>
            <li> No issues with the new pump on the jar.  </li>
            <li> and it makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in FL and it has hot and humid here, especially now.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 5days now and love everything about it.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if it is my wishful thinking or not</li>
            <li> I used Skin2Spirit eye cream for the first time and I was totally hooked.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> Price might be a little bit higher than use to spending, but worth it, to occassionally treat yourself.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin issues and was A bit concerned about the fragrance, but I had no problems, in fact my skin is smoother and the redness has diminished markedly!  </li>
            <li> You can tell that the seller really cares not only about creating an all-organic and natural skin care line, but also truly cares about customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> It has completely cleared up and my skin looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and I like the product</li>
            <li> No heavy feeling</li>
            <li> But the moisturizer is truly a winner for my 68+ old face.  </li>
            <li> so much that I used almost all in 3 weeks only because I&#x27;m putting it like mask on the face- a lot</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and works all day.  </li>
            <li> I frequently have to use a skin balancing oil before this to fully hydrate.</li>
            <li> This face cream far exceeded my expectations...</li>
            <li> it goes on like silk and sinks right into my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am not giving up on Skin2Spirit since I love the natural ingredients and small-business aspect of it (and that yummy Caffeine Eye Whip, seriously.), but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get through this bottle.</li>
            <li> I especially appreciate that these are natural products derived from organic skin-beneficial ingredients that work just as well or better than high-end chemical-laden products that I have past used.</li>
            <li> 2 oz is a very generous size and feel that it has helped to re-hydrate my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent</li>
            <li> This helps smooth dry patches and you only need a TINY amount for your face, and another tiny amount for neck.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft , never dry</li>
            <li> the one I was using previously had shea butter, hyaluronic acid, a few oils, and other good ingredients for the skin.  </li>
            <li> I always use natural products (I have tried several) and</li>
            <li> Compared to the coffee eye whip, it has barely any scent.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a small sample of this and immediately saw those lines diminishing that I then ordered the full size.  </li>
            <li> have mature dry, sensitive skin and it makes my skin feel wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find the smell a little overbearing with the rose scent but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have normal skin with slightly dry cheeks.</li>
            <li> It smelled so much of mayonnaise that I had to mix it with some other face cream</li>
            <li> The tiny clear things left on my face looks like tiny bristles.  </li>
            <li> I have a few lines around the mouth area....2 smile lines and a long line under the mouth.  </li>
            <li> I have acne prone, sensitive, combination skin that has be very dry from the winter weather and over processing.</li>
            <li> I just turned  50 and my oily skin has been getting a bit dry, especially during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> It turns out my first batch had likely gone bad after sitting in the Amazon warehouse, so it was replaced for free due to my review.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks and other different new products the last 2-3 months as the products I had been using was just leaving my skin looking dull and liveless</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend trying this product along with their other products.  </li>
            <li> I use it for dry skin</li>
            <li> At one point my forehead was severely dry, no creams or lotions would help.</li>
            <li> Whatever it is, it&#x27;s strong enough to give me a very faint headache.</li>
            <li> Took care of my dry skin in one day!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I continue to use this moisturizer (and I turned 51 a few months ago), which says a lot since I normally go on to different products, because of  how youthful looking my face looks and feels.</li>
            <li> but when you put it on your face it only feels that way for a few seconds</li>
            <li> finding the right products can be difficult.</li>
            <li> and I look forward to ordering other products from this seller.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> so I decided to search for other products to try.  </li>
            <li> Well, as much I love their eye cream, I am disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> My skin is softer but I will have to use it longer before I can say it helps with dark spots or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> no more dry skin on my face</li>
            <li> This lotion is gentle and doesn&#x27;t break me out while  moisturizing without all the very unnecessary chemicals.</li>
            <li> my skin looks healthier and less sallow than if I went w/o any moisture</li>
            <li> I like less toxic stuff on my face and skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural, no chemicals, nothing harsh or irritating.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few months now</li>
            <li> This cream are too heavy for me.</li>
            <li> Oh, pump stopped working after few days too.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but thumbs up on the foam wash, and big thumbs down on the face whip.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but this stuff barely smells like roses.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 43 years old, my skin is normally dull &amp; dry looking even though I always use very expensive skincare products.  </li>
            <li> Thank you again for this little luxury in a bottle!</li>
            <li> I think I will go through this quite quickly unfortunately as I need 4 pumps to moisturize my face, neck and upper chest every morning</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the pump, maybe it is just hard to get going.</li>
            <li> I can continue to fight off mother time, at least for my face, using this.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer feels thick when you get it out the bottle</li>
            <li> The smell is not pleasant either.  </li>
            <li> The reason for the four stars instead of five is because it was frustrating getting it to pump in the beginning.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t smell like a chicken sandwich all day.  </li>
            <li> I now have refined my routine with cold water and do this twice a day.</li>
            <li> All the 5-star reviews make me wonder if I got a bottle from a bad batch or something.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I immediately fell in love with from the very first use!&lt;br /&gt;The 2 oz is a very generous size and feel that it has helped to re-hydrate my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent customer service. Thanks~ I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;whip&amp;#34; is a creamy light texture that is easily absorbed into the skin.  I love knowing that I am using a product that is all natural without any additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My package included the product, directions for pump (if needed) and a business card.  You can tell that the seller really cares not only about creating an all-organic and natural skin care line, but also truly cares about customer satisfaction. I have only used this product once and already know that I don&#x27;t ever want to be without it from here on.  I have done non-stop research trying to find the perfect all natural, skin benefiting moisturizer and FINALLY my search is over! In addition to being a wonderful moisturizer, it also makes a great primer before makeup application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE don&#x27;t ever stop making this. I absolutely cannot wait to share this wonderful find with family and friends! As soon as my next paycheck comes in the mail, you best bet that I will be exploring the other products that this skin care line has to offer! Thank you again for this little luxury in a bottle!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect face cream, all natural ingredients, it is light, absorbs quickly and in hot weather does not cause your face to perspire.  I use it sparingly and my skin is soft and rash free.  I have been experiencing rashes with many other brands...not this one!  It has completely cleared up and my skin looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Skin2Spirit, you have a lifetime customer!</li>
            <li> wonderful product!!!  I adore the scent and how it absorbs into the skin.  I will be buying again.  Also, a GREAT gift for the health nuts of the family...totally organic at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> 4/30/16 Update:  I continue to use this moisturizer (and I turned 51 a few months ago), which says a lot since I normally go on to different products, because of  how youthful looking my face looks and feels. It looks bright, plump, and most days I don&#x27;t need foundation due to the clarity....I can continue to fight off mother time, at least for my face, using this. So after using this for a year I can definitely say it&#x27;s a top-notch product!  I have been using this for a little over about 2 weeks and love the results so far. I just turned  50 and my oily skin has been getting a bit dry, especially during the winter months.  I have a few lines around the mouth area....2 smile lines and a long line under the mouth.  I always use natural products (I have tried several) and the one I was using previously had shea butter, hyaluronic acid, a few oils, and other good ingredients for the skin.  For some reason it just wasn&#x27;t working (didn&#x27;t do anything for my lines) and it was starting to clog my skin and cause some big breakouts.  I had purchased a small sample of this and immediately saw those lines diminishing that I then ordered the full size.  The lines are still there but not as noticeable as before....they seem to be filling in.  My whole face seems a bit more plump in the mornings.  I&#x27;m so happy I took a chance on this because I didn&#x27;t think it would moisturize my skin like I was hoping for but it really does. I will continue to use this and long as it keeps my face happy! Btw, I am enjoying their eye cream as well. I am not reviewing that yet as I want to wait longer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a week. It smells great and is not greasy and feels good under makeup. It has not minimized my pores like I was hoping, however I&#x27;m sure that over time and with better nutrition from the inside I will see more of a change. I use this twice a day and it makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> this is a great product. I suffer from dry flaky skin and have been searching for something that helps and works So HAPPY TO FIND THIS ONE!!I It starting working day 1 no more dry skin on my face I apply it night and morning. Now i am going to purchase the foam wash for my face so excited to use this organic product that works</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product to use alongside the coconut rose face wash and couldn&#x27;t be happier! I have very sensitive skin that tends to be combination dry but also easily breaks out, so finding the right products can be difficult. Neither of these products caused any sensitivity or breakouts, and both left my skin feeling calm and hydrated. I especially appreciate that these are natural products derived from organic skin-beneficial ingredients that work just as well or better than high-end chemical-laden products that I have past used. Also, Kathi is delightful to work with and was prompt to answer a question I had about a product. I will definitely be a return customer!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week and I absolutely love it! I have very dry skin and my skin has never felt better! I will buy this moisturizer again.</li>
            <li> Lightly scented, non irritating. Compared to the coffee eye whip, it has barely any scent. I have normal skin with slightly dry cheeks. This helps smooth dry patches and you only need a TINY amount for your face, and another tiny amount for neck. Other products, while also non-greasy, require 3x more. I&#x27;m 21 so I can&#x27;t vouch for anti-aging properties... my skin looks healthier and less sallow than if I went w/o any moisture</li>
            <li> I love this, it helps with my dry skin without making my face oily. Smells awesome, too! I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered this, it was packaged in a manner that caused the pump to break(not the seller&#x27;s fault at all) When I contacted Amazon about it, I got a personal email from the seller asking why I had asked to return her product and asked if there was anything she could do. I received a new canister from Amazon and boy am I glad I did. I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month now and I really like it. It&#x27;s very hydrating, very rich. You don&#x27;t need much, which is nice and I find that for me, my skin feels smooth and hydrated for the entire day. So far, my skin seems to really like this product and I look forward to ordering other products from this seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but this stuff barely smells like roses.  It smelled so much of mayonnaise that I had to mix it with some other face cream so I didn&#x27;t smell like a chicken sandwich all day.  Other than that though, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  My skin is soft and I like the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***  UPDATE: ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What wonderful customer service from this company!  It turns out my first batch had likely gone bad after sitting in the Amazon warehouse, so it was replaced for free due to my review.  The new batch smelled like roses, not mayonnaise.  It is hydrating and I like it a lot.  The new packaging is great too.  No issues with the new pump on the jar.  All A+</li>
            <li> This moisturizer feels thick when you get it out the bottle but when you put it on your face it only feels that way for a few seconds and then it&#x27;s gone. It does moisturize. I&#x27;m in FL and it has hot and humid here, especially now. I try to stay out of the sun mostly and therefore am not able to tell right now how it behaves during the day time but at night it feel good. No heavy feeling and I don&#x27;t have my AC on all the time so that&#x27;s a natural feel to the true temperature at night. I have to wear a sunscreen during the day time so I don&#x27;t put this on because my sunscreen is also a moisturizer. The reason for the four stars instead of five is because it was frustrating getting it to pump in the beginning. Very good product and would recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this, wish it came in a bigger bottle. Smells amazing, works great on my dry skin. Whipped creamy feeling.</li>
            <li> Wonderful natural moisturizer that absorbs well amd doesnt break me out! A real winner! :-)</li>
            <li> Pump was very hard to use but product was great</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 5days now and love everything about it.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if it is my wishful thinking or not but it looks like some of my&lt;br /&gt;Sun spots are starting to fade.  I will keep you posted.  I have used products&lt;br /&gt;Specially designed to do this job but they failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mature dry, sensitive skin and it makes my skin feel wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SH</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this skin2spirit coconut rose face whip cream lotion for your face. I have been looking for a face product with real rose ingredients and the scent of a rose as well, this is great. Really good for your skin ingredients.  Price might be a little bit higher than use to spending, but worth it, to occassionally treat yourself. Leaves my face so soft and smooth feeling, love that rose smell too. I like less toxic stuff on my face and skin, this is safe and really good for you to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks and other different new products the last 2-3 months as the products I had been using was just leaving my skin looking dull and liveless so I decided to search for other products to try.  I admittedly say that this is a great face cream.  It has a hint of smell of rose and it goes on skin smoothly.  My skin absorbed the products well and stays on for the rest of the day and night.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Having the words &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;whip&amp;#34; together holds no appeal for me. But the moisturizer is truly a winner for my 68+ old face.  I like the scent of roses and once you have added your tinted sunscreen (Elta MD),it becomes a non-issue.</li>
            <li> I love this face cream smels amazing I like it so much that I used almost all in 3 weeks only because I&#x27;m putting it like mask on the face- a lot! My skin is soft , never dry and I think more firm. I love thats is made from natural ingriediens and this lady who owns it is so profesional allways on the top of the situation, I will buy again for 100%</li>
            <li> I used Skin2Spirit eye cream for the first time and I was totally hooked. I&#x27;m all about skin care and realized pure ingredients was something I needed to go for. After loving the eye cream so much, I tried the face whip and I really have to say I love their product!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this face cream.  After searching and buying so many over the years--this one is the best.  It is light and smells nice.  I use it for dry skin and it really does the job.  I use it all over my face before I apply make up.  It makes my skin very smooth. I also use it at night after I was my face.  I think it is helping with my fine lines as well.</li>
            <li> This face cream is wonderful!  It is so light and smooth and not at all greasy.  Absorbs really well and makes your skin feel so silky smooth!  It is perfect under makeup!  Of course, the best part of all of skin2spirit&#x27;s products is that they truly are natural and organic.  You can feel and smell beautiful and not worry about absorbing all sorts of franken-chemicals into your body!!!  Win-win!  EtsyKDougherty</li>
            <li> Very rich and creamy,  I love the way it feels on the skin and is firming too.  I find the smell a little overbearing with the rose scent but a little goes a long way.  Great product though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 43 years old, my skin is normally dull &amp; dry looking even though I always use very expensive skincare products.  After using this every night (not morning) for about a week, I woke up to a face with glowing skin.  I love this!</li>
            <li> For an organic moisturizer this product is amazing, especially the price!!  I have been using it for a few months now and it smells great and it great to use as a day moisturizer under your makeup.  My skin feels soft and works all day.  I would definitely recommend trying this product along with their other products.  Their whole line is great!!!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and I am prone to break outs.  This lotion is gentle and doesn&#x27;t break me out while  moisturizing without all the very unnecessary chemicals. I like being able to know what i&#x27;m putting on my face!  This is my second time ordering and I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> This face cream is superior to all other face creams I have tried. I have very sensitive skin and have a mild case of rosacea. I searched for a long time for the perfect skin care products. At one point my forehead was severely dry, no creams or lotions would help. I started washing my face with distilled water and using skin2spirit face cleanser along with the coconut rose face whip and it fixed my skin! I have absolutely zero skin problems now. It&#x27;s all natural, no chemicals, nothing harsh or irritating. It&#x27;s truely amazing! I recommened everyone try this product. It is not greasy so it goes under make up really well.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the pump, maybe it is just hard to get going. I have acne prone, sensitive, combination skin that has be very dry from the winter weather and over processing. I have stopped using all &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; products and changed to organic products and after a month my skin is clear for the first time in 15 years. This is a light moisturizer. I frequently have to use a skin balancing oil before this to fully hydrate. It does have a rose sent my husband described as almost &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; smelling but he is getting used to it. My skin is softer but I will have to use it longer before I can say it helps with dark spots or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  A rich, non greasy moisturizer with absolutely no toxins or irritants.  A true find.  I will be getting more items from this company.</li>
            <li> I just love the smell of this coconut rose face whip! I love the feel of it, the creamy non greasy texture and it&#x27;s so perfect for my dry sensitive skin. No nother all natural / organic moisturizer has been able to impress me as much as this one has. I will be a life time customer! The superior quality of a high end moisturizer with all natural ingredients and zero chemicals! Who can ask for more from a skin care product? Buy it, you will love it!</li>
            <li> Smells to me like blackcurrant tea - very pleasant and fresh.  Great consistency, hydrates with no oily residue.  I think I will go through this quite quickly unfortunately as I need 4 pumps to moisturize my face, neck and upper chest every morning but it&#x27;s a good price so Im not worried about re-ordering when I&#x27;ve finished this bottle.  Amazing ingredients - I swear by rose hip oil for anti-aging since living in New Zealand for a few years and using their Trilogy skincare line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face cream for a while now. I wash my face and immediately apply without drying with a towel. I let it soak in and wow! My face is so smooth and it&#x27;s the only face cream (or lotion) that won&#x27;t give me acne! I now have refined my routine with cold water and do this twice a day. Everyone comments on how beautiful my skin is. I&#x27;m so grateful for this product and the honesty of what&#x27;s in it! Seriously, it&#x27;s worth every penny. I love the rose smell too. It&#x27;s such a natural fragrance unlike most chemical filled products.</li>
            <li> Didnt care for this product.  Gave it to my daughter who loves it.</li>
            <li> This face cream far exceeded my expectations...it goes on like silk and sinks right into my skin.  No grease or shine.  I&#x27;ve used it for two nights now and my skin is already noticeably softer and really, really smooth. I love it! Super quality and amazing price, thank you!  Shipping was also very fast.</li>
            <li> Well, I got this for Christmas after reading all the lovely reviews and putting it on my wishlist, and I am very surprised to find that I strongly dislike the scent. I&#x27;m usually pretty easy to please when it comes to fragrances (and I absolutely LOVE the smell of the Skin2Spirit Caffeine Eye Whip - it might be my favorite smelling product ever!), but this is just ... not ... good. I generally love anything rose- or coconut-scented, but this smells like neither to me. Whatever it is, it&#x27;s strong enough to give me a very faint headache. It does feel nice going on and leaves my face feeling soft, but a tad greasy. All the 5-star reviews make me wonder if I got a bottle from a bad batch or something. I am not giving up on Skin2Spirit since I love the natural ingredients and small-business aspect of it (and that yummy Caffeine Eye Whip, seriously.), but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get through this bottle. Maybe the Carrot-Orange will work better for me!</li>
            <li> This is a very light face cream that has a lovely fragrance and does not irritate the skin. I have not noticed any beneficial changes but I also have not noticed anything adverse happening. It seems to just layer on well without greasiness.</li>
            <li> Best products I have ever used!  I have sensitive skin issues and was A bit concerned about the fragrance, but I had no problems, in fact my skin is smoother and the redness has diminished markedly!  I love these products (rose coconut cleaners and moisturizer)</li>
            <li> This eye cream is the best - I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them - and this one is as good as any of them for way less money.  This glass tube is large.  It&#x27;s a big bang for the buck.  Now I&#x27;m giving them as gifts.....Really great product.  It&#x27;s the only thing that actually has taken the bags away....really away.......</li>
            <li> I appreciate the fine ingredients that are both effective and safe.  The smell is dreamy and it is a good value.</li>
            <li> I love this product also.  It is creamy and not greasy.  It leaves your skin feeling soft and clean.  It has a wonder fragrance without being overbearing.  It is also very cost effective and I like the idea there are no chemicals involved in its making.</li>
            <li> Smooth, Awesome.  Has a cool pump that will use all of this wonderful cream that&#x27;s in this pretty, glass container.</li>
            <li> Well, as much I love their eye cream, I am disappointed with this product.  This cream are too heavy for me. With my oily skin it is probably not the best solution.</li>
            <li> This product gives me the benefit of coconut&#x27;s healing properties and yet is not greasy.  And the bonus is that it has a wonderful scent of roses.  I have been using coconut oil on my face and loved the results; but I didn&#x27;t love the greasy feel.  I love this product and will recommend it to my friends!</li>
            <li> I love the rose facial foam...it is the bomb, but this rose facial whip feels like an exfoliant and not a whip cream.  The tiny clear things left on my face looks like tiny bristles.  The smell is not pleasant either.  Sorry, but thumbs up on the foam wash, and big thumbs down on the face whip.  Mine is now in the garbage.  Oh, pump stopped working after few days too.</li>
            <li> I love this face cream! Took care of my dry skin in one day! It also has made my skin so smooth and has reduced the appearance of my larg pores and acne scars! The light rose sent is wonderful as well. I will definitely be shopping here again.</li>
