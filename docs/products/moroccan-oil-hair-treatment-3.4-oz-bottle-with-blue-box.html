            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell, but it&#x27;s really worthy to buy. It heals my try hair and makes it very smoothy. Good!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, exactly what I wanted. Works and smells great!</li>
            <li> this product works for long, curly, fine, colored dark hair like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever tried. I use it after every shampoo. I never run out.</li>
            <li> This is the product I love.  It really helps my dry hair from medications I take.  I love the smell as well</li>
            <li> Thank you for the fast delivery! The product itself is nice but it doesn&#x27;t smell like original one and the texture a bit different, sorry. Yesterday I&#x27;ve got one from a salon-yes, the same smell that I use to:(&lt;br /&gt;I would say I used this oil in much bigger quantities because it is kinda watery. Generally I use a few drops but not with this product.&lt;br /&gt;However, I can&#x27;t recommend this product because it is close to original but not really. However, this is my subjective opinion which is based on my experience.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever stop using this. This makes my hair so soft and shiny, and it smells very good. I&#x27;m hispanic with long, dark brown, thick hair, that tends to frizz. This bottle also tends to last me about 6 months if I&#x27;m the only one using it. After I wash my hair, I apply this while my hair is still damp. I start off with two pumps, then work it on my ends, then work my way up. I try not to put it on my roots because it can make it look oily. I&#x27;ve tried so many cheaper brands that contain moroccan oil but none of them can top this product. It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment  for my hair.  I have fine long hair and this makes my hair smooth and shiny and keeps it healthy looking. My hairdresser used it on my hair and I loved it, so I had to buy some of my own!</li>
            <li> Best hair product in years. Pump works great.</li>
            <li> Love it! The smell lasts a little longer than the other brands, which is what I look for in hair products.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. No other product compares. A little goes a long way, great value.</li>
            <li> I got some of this for free at the Chicago hair show this year! I love it! So I ordered more!!!</li>
            <li> I am currently deployed and I did not get to use the item, by the time I received it it had leaked out all over the package. It did smell really good. Wish I could have tried it.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal and I can&#x27;t say enough about how well it works.  I have mildly course hair, using this oil mainly on the last few inches of my hair every time I wash it makes all the difference in the world.  Smooths it out and smells great.</li>
            <li> i love this product, so good with my hair and makes it strong..... &#x3D; )</li>
            <li> Love it and smells great</li>
            <li> Love this product- make hair smooth and silky but not greasy!</li>
            <li> You know how you leave the hairdresser, with silky-smooth hair? Well this is your hairdresser&#x27;s secret! Don&#x27;t look at the price, because you only used dime-sized drop. Buy it now!</li>
            <li> Love this product and delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have used it for about two years now. I love the softness and shine of my hair and the fast growth. The Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment is a great product and it smells good, too, and it leaves my hands soft as well. It came to me carefully packaged and on time.</li>
            <li> I have used many other products for my course and frizzy hair (pantene, paul mitchell, etc..) and my concludion was that they were all &amp;#34;mediocre&amp;#34; at best.  This Moroccan Oil has far exceeded my expectations.  A little goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve used it when my hair is damp as well as dry and does wonders to my frizzy hair.  Will definitely highly recommend for all types of hair especially in a humid climate.</li>
