            <li> The manufacturer is incredibly hard to contact and the MSDS sheets are almost equally as baffling - not remotely the amount of information that should be on an MSDS</li>
            <li> I, myself and one of my closest &amp;#34;inkees&amp;#34; (hers far worse than mine) had a rather unfavorable reaction to something in &amp;#34;Danger Zone Orange&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> the black ink seal was broken and some was spilled into the bag...</li>
            <li> but it was a thick one</li>
            <li> so the reaction was much worse than mine, a small birds beak.</li>
            <li> but this ink is no good.</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive but you will not be sorry with the results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it was a bad bottle, I don&#x27;t know.</li>

            <li> damn good ink. no problems leaking out o.f the tat and they look good afterward</li>
            <li> BEST ink I&#x27;ve ever used. Been getting my tattoos done and redone for over 10 years and this is the only ink I have ever used that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, the colors stayed bright and wonderful, and has so far not needed to be fixed!</li>
            <li> Idk y but this ink is no good.</li>
            <li> Great set of ink, with these colors you can mix any shade you need or want. stick with the best I LOVE THIS INK</li>
            <li> my package come on time very happy I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon</li>
            <li> All amazing colors, packed well, shipped fast. All around great product... but... I, myself and one of my closest &amp;#34;inkees&amp;#34; (hers far worse than mine) had a rather unfavorable reaction to something in &amp;#34;Danger Zone Orange&amp;#34;. Her leg is going to have one hell of a scar for the rest of her life. I&#x27;m VERY glad it was only one line of orange but it was a thick one so the reaction was much worse than mine, a small birds beak. The manufacturer is incredibly hard to contact and the MSDS sheets are almost equally as baffling - not remotely the amount of information that should be on an MSDS sheet.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it was a bad bottle, I don&#x27;t know. My order was all 1/2oz bottles and that&#x27;s what they sent, except Danger Zone Orange, they gave me a full 1oz bottle. Ok, cool, these are for a few specific tattoos but I&#x27;ve got some extra orange. Great, except now I&#x27;m afraid to use it again. Anyone else have an similar issue?</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s holding pretty well. Orange glows in a black light.</li>
            <li> I have not used the new ink I just purchased but from my experience with MOMS ink is classic. It is a bit expensive but you will not be sorry with the results.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my son&#x27;s birthday and he loves it. The order arrived quickly and it was a great price. The colors are bright and the ink was not runny. He was happy and that was good enough for me. A good buy!!</li>
            <li> Got the product early and opened package an was very happy with what I seen and hoe the product performs. Will def be buying from vender again.</li>
            <li> Awesome ink. I will recommend highly to all of my fellow artists. Only one problem...the black ink seal was broken and some was spilled into the bag...</li>
            <li> Great colors, hhold very well over time. Will definitely be adding a broader selection of colors to collection !</li>
            <li> Nice colors. The blue balls looks a little bit more like purple, we&#x27;ll see what it looks like when we start using it.</li>
            <li> Best Ink Ever.  Won&#x27;t go back to unknown name ink... ever.  Stick with the good stuff.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay ink they do gush out going it invest in better ink I&#x27;m trying out star brite so far I&#x27;m loving that</li>
            <li> Mom&#x27;s ink is a great product, my complaint is that one of the bottles was busted and there was ink everywhere when I opened the package. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Great transaction, and product is what I needed..</li>
