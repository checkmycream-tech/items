            <li>love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>The longer the cologne is worn, the more the sharper citrus notes fade away, leaving you smelling like you use awesome laundry soap and fabric softener.  </li>
            <li>it smells good.  </li>
            <li>BUT IT DOES SMELL GOOD.</li>

            <li>Perfect, Exactly What i was looking for.  </li>

            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend for our anniversary because he really liked the smell.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it didn&#x27;t quite feel like a men&#x27;s fragrance at all.  </li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t describe what this smells</li>
            <li>Very pleasing to smell good!    </li>
            <li>Not for metro or clubber guys for sure.</li>
            <li>and I love it...</li>
            <li>May be my favorite.</li>
            <li>Top 3 favorite cologne ever.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.  </li>
            <li>Have had many people complement it at work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not a musk smell - it is citrusy and it seems to be the smell that women love.</li>
            <li>it is an OK scent if you are just wearing it to work or to the gym or something, but i wouldn&#x27;t ever wear it for a date.  </li>
            <li>however, this bottle losses it scent after 2 min at most</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gotten me many compliments.</li>
            <li>Sexy.</li>
            <li>This was a refreshing experience.</li>
            <li>Not too strong.</li>
            <li>, i even wear this more than my Reaction, it has a mellow and sweet smell.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a bit &#x27;perfumey&#x27; at first, but I like it more and more each time I wear it.</li>
            <li>YOU WILL ENJOY THIS SCENT.</li>
            <li>I also use Paris Hilton for Men (blue bottle) also great.</li>
            <li>Very fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fresh (citrusy)</li>
            <li>smells good and lasts the whole day... at a bargain price and fast delivery...</li>
            <li>It smells good but dosent last a minute on your clothes or skin should have been $5 instead of $20.</li>
            <li>It seems that this cologne would give a good impression to someone you expect to be up close and personal.    </li>
            <li>this would be a perfect fragrance to wear to the gym or to apply to your \\&quot;engine room\\&quot; if you like subtle scents</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I can still find my favorite cologne, the packaging may be different but its not a knock-off!</li>
            <li>It is very refreshing with hints of lemon, apple and other light scents that make you think CLEAN.</li>
            <li>I would describe the smell like an Orange Creamsicle,  Not as  sweet but just right.  </li>
            <li>THANKS AMAZON!!</li>
            <li>At first spray, I can smell a combination of orange citrus and clean linens.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing and it last</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s youthful, fresh, and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>That actually gave me the idea to hand it over to her, and she liked it a bit.  </li>
            <li>i own over 125 different colognes...</li>
            <li>Came right on time....</li>
            <li>So idk if there are two versions that have come out in the past but smells great.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase this for your boyfriend if he is more down-to-earth and chill.</li>
            <li>T-Shirt lives up to its name, and delivers exactly what I want; therefore, it gets 5 stars.    </li>
            <li>I really like this fragrance</li>
            <li>VERY GOOOD FRAGRANCE.</li>
            <li>real deal.  </li>
            <li>fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>This fresh, clean scent cannot be replicated in other colognes.</li>
            <li>so at this point im just collecting them...go with their regular Reaction, the yellow liquid in the clear bottle...that is a much better fragrance...citrusy and fresh....  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this fragrance for everyday/ evening wear.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it since it&#x27;s been discontinued for a few years</li>
            <li>IM NOT A HUGE FAN OF KENNETH COLE IM MORE</li>
            <li>Overall, the price was right,</li>
            <li>Thank you for a new hope.</li>
            <li>I think amazon is selling old bottles of cologne!</li>
            <li>Plus, it wearing it early in the morning, it would be gone in the early afternoon.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that Amazon had some in stock.</li>
            <li>then it may be for you, very light and easy fresh, like a very very subtle nautica voyage (which is one of my girlfriend&#x27;s favorites)  just too subtle for me</li>
            <li>I had a strong first impression about the subtlety of this cologne,but I appreciate that quality as part of its casual namesake.</li>
            <li>The tone seems to be masculine, but I am left with the impression that a girl could pull off wearing this.  </li>
            <li>This is the kind of cologne to wear in casual situations.  </li>
            <li>Its not strong but just right.  </li>
            <li>This cologne has a more subtle smell than other Reaction colognes.  </li>
            <li>this isn&#x27;t a BAD cologne, it is just so subtle that it seems like you aren&#x27;t wearing any at all, it is light and fresh, like clean linenrs, it smells like your clothes just came out of the laundry.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Seems to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if the product has defect or is not original but does not stay on skin for more than half an hour.</li>
            <li> It came in a orange and silver box and smells slightly different from the previous blue and white box version.</li>
            <li> It is too sad it is no longer available for sale in store.</li>
            <li> As strange as that sounds, my wife agrees with me.  </li>
            <li> In fact, in all honesty, the compliments have probably been in the 100&#x27;s for the other Kenneth Cole Reaction and now this one is getting the same responses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my lifetime, the only other cologne that I have constantly received compliments was the Kenneth Cole Reaction (Green Color).  </li>
            <li> Even the next day they still have a slight smell of it.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of using Reaction green (original), Black, or Connected for formal situations, and T-Shirt for casual.  </li>
            <li> It seems that other Reaction colognes permeate the room, whereas T-Shirt permeates your clothes and skin.    </li>
            <li> This has hardly any scent after multiple applications.</li>
            <li> but shit ass product</li>
            <li> The smell is not powerful like the green Reaction; as I stated previously, it is subtle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not one of those over-the-top smells too.</li>
            <li> I used it for a few days, and it didn&#x27;t work —some people even asked me whether I was using my wife&#x27;s cologne!  </li>
            <li> It has come to my attention that this has been discontinued, but I am skeptical about the comments that claim they received an old and weak product.  </li>
            <li> Its been hard to find this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s tastes are different for cologne, as for me, Kenneth Cole colognes have always been very pleasing for myself and the Mrs., and since I&#x27;ve been wearing it for over 10 years now, I can say I&#x27;ve never heard one bad comment nor have I been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about getting sick of it, because it is not strong at all.</li>
            <li> This item has been discontinued and impossible to find.  </li>
            <li> I like the smell, but is worthless if you lose it before your leave home</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for our anniversary because he really liked the smell. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but when he put it on it smelled great! It is very refreshing with hints of lemon, apple and other light scents that make you think CLEAN. It&#x27;s definitely not one of those over-the-top smells too. You wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about getting sick of it, because it is not strong at all. I would definitely purchase this for your boyfriend if he is more down-to-earth and chill. Not for metro or clubber guys for sure.</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance, i even wear this more than my Reaction, it has a mellow and sweet smell. Its not strong but just right.  I have friends asking me what it is b/c it smells good.  My girlfriend also wears this along with my reaction colonge.  I highly recommend this fragrance for everyday/ evening wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl but I use this and I love it... I figured if I like the way a man smells, why not just use what he uses. Anyway, I actually got this as a birthday gift from my host family during my stay in Germany and now every time I smell it, I think of the fond memories I have from that year abroad. It&#x27;s youthful, fresh, and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> IF YOU LIKE KENNETH COLE YOU WILL ENJOY THIS SCENT. IM NOT A HUGE FAN OF KENNETH COLE IM MORE A VERSACE MAN MYSELF BUT IT DOES SMELL GOOD.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a promotional cologne a year ago, and when I went to replace it I could only find it online. This fresh, clean scent cannot be replicated in other colognes. This is the best!</li>
            <li> Not sure if the product has defect or is not original but does not stay on skin for more than half an hour. I like the smell, but is worthless if you lose it before your leave home</li>
            <li> Honestly, it didn&#x27;t quite feel like a men&#x27;s fragrance at all.

            <li> VERY GOOOD FRAGRANCE. May be my favorite. Very fresh.</li>
            <li> Great scent  my 2nd bottle</li>
            <li> Came right on time.... Top 3 favorite cologne ever. Glad I found it since it&#x27;s been discontinued for a few years</li>
            <li> Love the scent.  Have had many people complement it at work. I can still smell it in the cloths at night when I get home.  Seems to last a long time.  Even the next day they still have a slight smell of it.</li>
            <li> People tell me that the smell is great and that is the best reason to keep using this... In my lifetime, the only other cologne that I have constantly received compliments was the Kenneth Cole Reaction (Green Color).  In fact, in all honesty, the compliments have probably been in the 100&#x27;s for the other Kenneth Cole Reaction and now this one is getting the same responses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a musk smell - it is citrusy and it seems to be the smell that women love.</li>
            <li> Perfect, Exactly What i was looking for.  While the bottle is a different color, the one i rec is Orange.  So idk if there are two versions that have come out in the past but smells great.  I would describe the smell like an Orange Creamsicle,  Not as  sweet but just right.  I also use Paris Hilton for Men (blue bottle) also great.</li>
            <li> It smells good but dosent last a minute on your clothes or skin should have been $5 instead of $20. I purchased mine from Burlington coat factory for $20, kenneth cole is a name brand but shit ass product</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t a BAD cologne, it is just so subtle that it seems like you aren&#x27;t wearing any at all, it is light and fresh, like clean linenrs, it smells like your clothes just came out of the laundry.  it is an OK scent if you are just wearing it to work or to the gym or something, but i wouldn&#x27;t ever wear it for a date.  i own over 125 different colognes...so at this point im just collecting them...go with their regular Reaction, the yellow liquid in the clear bottle...that is a much better fragrance...citrusy and fresh....  this would be a perfect fragrance to wear to the gym or to apply to your \\&quot;engine room\\&quot; if you like subtle scents then it may be for you, very light and easy fresh, like a very very subtle nautica voyage (which is one of my girlfriend&#x27;s favorites)  just too subtle for me</li>
            <li> Its been hard to find this fragrance. It came in a orange and silver box and smells slightly different from the previous blue and white box version. It still seems to do the trick though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I can still find my favorite cologne, the packaging may be different but its not a knock-off!</li>
            <li> We looked in every store we shopped in for the holidays. In desperation I looked on amazon.com and there it was! You made my college-age son very happy when he opened this gift. He didn&#x27;t think we could find it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, my reason for purchase. however, this bottle losses it scent after 2 min at most</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t describe what this smells like but it&#x27;s a wonderful, light, citrus-y scent. I thought it was a bit &#x27;perfumey&#x27; at first, but I like it more and more each time I wear it. It&#x27;s gotten me many compliments.</li>
            <li> I think amazon is selling old bottles of cologne! This has hardly any scent after multiple applications.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Sexy. Not too strong. It lasts.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend didn&#x27;t like it on him but uses it for his vehicle.</li>
            <li> Was on time, and met my expectations. Was properly wrapped to protect the bottle. Would definitley order again in the future when need be!</li>
            <li> At first spray, I can smell a combination of orange citrus and clean linens.  This cologne has a more subtle smell than other Reaction colognes.  The smell is not powerful like the green Reaction; as I stated previously, it is subtle.  It seems that other Reaction colognes permeate the room, whereas T-Shirt permeates your clothes and skin.    The longer the cologne is worn, the more the sharper citrus notes fade away, leaving you smelling like you use awesome laundry soap and fabric softener.  The tone seems to be masculine, but I am left with the impression that a girl could pull off wearing this.  As strange as that sounds, my wife agrees with me.  This is the kind of cologne to wear in casual situations.  My wife reports to me that when she is close to me, the smell makes her want to get closer.  It seems that this cologne would give a good impression to someone you expect to be up close and personal.    Overall, the price was right, ~$27, and the smell is amazing and settles well.  I will definitely be buying this one again.  I like the idea of using Reaction green (original), Black, or Connected for formal situations, and T-Shirt for casual.  T-Shirt lives up to its name, and delivers exactly what I want; therefore, it gets 5 stars.    Everyone&#x27;s tastes are different for cologne, as for me, Kenneth Cole colognes have always been very pleasing for myself and the Mrs., and since I&#x27;ve been wearing it for over 10 years now, I can say I&#x27;ve never heard one bad comment nor have I been disappointed.  I work in a public office, and I get compliments and questions about what cologne I wear all the time.  Very pleasing to smell good!    I would recommend this cologne to anyone.    UPDATE: It has come to my attention that this has been discontinued, but I am skeptical about the comments that claim they received an old and weak product.  Perhaps they understood the theme of the cologne differently than I.  I had a strong first impression about the subtlety of this cologne,but I appreciate that quality as part of its casual namesake.</li>
            <li> real deal.  great service.  fast delivery.  will use again</li>
            <li> love this stuff!! quick ship at a great price!!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t taken a shower in days and no one could tell. Will be buying it again. 5 stars</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Kenneth Cole cologne and I am sad that it has been discontinued. Bring it back Kenneth Cole!</li>
            <li> Smells like a t-shirt. That has been sprayed with cologne. If you like Kenneth Cole Reaction, this is a great &#x27;also&#x27; scent. Can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and it last</li>
            <li> smells good and lasts the whole day... at a bargain price and fast delivery...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smell like apple martini</li>
            <li> With all of the scams and people not caring about their fellow man. This was a refreshing experience. Item was received as scheduled, in great condition. Thank you for a new hope.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best scent I have ever worn. It is too sad it is no longer available for sale in store. It&#x27;s very fresh (citrusy)</li>
