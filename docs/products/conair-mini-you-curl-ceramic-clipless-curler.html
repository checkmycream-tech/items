    <ol>
            <li>I just tried it out, and I have the best curls I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Awesome look for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The curlers were perfect and lasted all night.</li>
            <li>perfect curls, every time.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll do my best to describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I took this curling iron on a cruise and it worked beautifully.</li>
            <li>If you like burning your fingers this is great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It would be great if I had shorter or finer hair.</li>
            <li>I used this in Europe and it worked good.</li>
            <li>Kind of have to push yourself to keep going.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am really happy with this!</li>
            <li>The curls are holding well, and without a clip, they&#x27;re nice and smooth, too.</li>
            <li>curler is magic.</li>
            <li>I got this one and the bigger version, and they both work great,  as good as the $100.00 versions.  </li>
            <li>Also, I have a heat safe glove - but I forgot to bring it with me</li>
            <li>Very easy to burn hand &amp; not that easy to use with the glove</li>
            <li>Nice size for travel but not user  friendly.</li>
            <li>It is easy to burn yourself if you are not used to using it.</li>
            <li>Works great, wish it had heat settings because it gets REALLY hot, almost too hot for my already curly hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty proficient at hair styling and this just would not curl my hair nicely.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this little curler is a good buy! :D</li>
            <li>it is light weight and easy to take along where ever you go.</li>
            <li>and I have rather fine locks.</li>
            <li>Purchased this thinking it&#x27;d be a fun new tool to play with and great for when I&#x27;m traveling.  </li>
            <li>This little guy is awesome!</li>
            <li>I would say the burns would have been worth it, if I was able to curl her hair, but I can&#x27;t say that happened.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair look exactly how I like it!!</li>
            <li>I am sure I will get even better at using the smaller size but even now it works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>so I had to curl the top first then</li>
            <li>And I was right!</li>
            <li>Why, in the name of common sense would you re-invent a tool that has worked perfectly for decades?</li>
            <li>so it takes longer than a full sized curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Gave it to my friends&#x27; 14 year old daughter and she&#x27;s loving it.  </li>
            <li>This mini curler was a good buy because it heated up very quickly and was hot enough to curl my hair quickly as well.  </li>
            <li>like it better than the full size because those were too long for me to wrap my hair around comfortably without the wand getting in the way of the wrapping</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only one I own.</li>
            <li>but this is by far my favorite thing to use.</li>
            <li>Just be careful, it does get very hot!!!</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t like it very much</li>
            <li>Pretty good little curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I have mid-length hair and thought I would be ok because a majority of the reviews said to avoid it if you have long hair.</li>
            <li>The mini curling iron was compact, which is great for travel, but because I have very thick hair, it would take forever to get it all curled.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it is very easy to burn you hands if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li>But I really like how compact it is and that you can just put in in your purse when you are on the go.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work for those who have too much hair</li>
            <li>Heats fast</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, really does the job.  </li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re looking for a good little curler buy the Conair TS63R MiniPro Ceramic Curling Iron, Blue, 1 Inch and use it like a wand.  </li>
            <li>Particularly during travel.</li>
            <li>This little thing is so cute, and if you travel a a lot</li>
            <li>Love this little thing as its become a staple in my day 2 hair regimen.</li>
            <li>It also only has one heat setting, but seems to be just the right temperature (no overheating-induced frizz).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning my curling iron and guess what, because of this &#x27;new and improved idea&#x27;, I may not EVEN look for a conair to replace it.</li>
            <li>I twist my hair in small sections to allow more coverage on the curler</li>
            <li>Actually worked really well.</li>
            <li>the  Conair Mini You Curl Curling Iron, Hot Pink on my daughters hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was pretty fast to use once I got used to it, and it takes less time than the spiral style (which only curls in one direction).</li>
            <li>gets lost and IF it would fit, makes handling clumsy.</li>
            <li>hair is about 6 inches past chin length, and I could get nice loose waves by holding it upside down and completely vertical</li>
            <li>You lost a decades long time customer because of a &#x27;new and improved&#x27; approach.</li>
            <li>Although the idea of this product is cool, its almost impossible to use if you hair is longer than chin length, my hair is about up to my shoulders, and I figured it would suffice  but shoulder length hair is indeed much too long for this product, Im going to have to upgrade to the full size you curl.</li>

            <li> If a curling iron is used, even with pounds of hairspray, my hair falls flat within hours.</li>

            <li> I only used it once and really do not want to try again.</li>
            <li> I gave this several tries and could not get it to work.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> After reading the bad reviews, I decided to purchase anyway - most of them said that this curler wasn&#x27;t long enough to work with long hair.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing, I saw this little curler had good and bad reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got hair that goes over halfway down my back, and is layered.  </li>
            <li> The measurments lie, the barrel is less than 3 inches long.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t burn myself once - just have to be careful!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I ended up taking my large curling iron on the trip.  </li>
            <li> The heated curler part was also a bit too small and could be a problem for people with long hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair that reaches half way down my back.</li>
            <li> Pinch the base of the previous curl you made and continue to work to the top.</li>
            <li> I pinch the end of the hair strand to the black tip of the curler with my fingers to keep the curl in place.</li>
            <li> I ended up giving this away to my little cousin, although I don&#x27;t think she uses it.</li>
            <li> There is no clip to hold your hair to the iron; it says that on the box, however it gives the idea that a little three fingered glove (included) solves the problem of the missing clip.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this because of the bad reviews, but I found it to be exactly what</li>
            <li> (sideways makes the hair slip off) and wrapping small sections of hair around the barrel about 3.5 times.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I think too hard to use without a clip on barrel.</li>
            <li> At least it will see use.  </li>
            <li> After 15 seconds, unravel (slowly) ensuring you don&#x27;t let go of the curl.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awkward, difficult, and simply not practical.  </li>
            <li> too difficult to use, too small to handle.</li>
            <li> Put the clip back on, people, and fire the moron that came up with the &#x27;glove&#x27; idea.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just awkward and chubby and not easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Pretty good little curling iron.  I find it a lot easier to use than the regular size curling irons but it does take some practice and time to figure it out.  Kind of have to push yourself to keep going. I am sure I will get even better at using the smaller size but even now it works pretty good.  Practice and coordination.  Just be careful, it does get very hot!!!</li>
            <li> There is no clip to hold your hair to the iron; it says that on the box, however it gives the idea that a little three fingered glove (included) solves the problem of the missing clip. News flash: the glove is not one size fits all and falls off, gets lost and IF it would fit, makes handling clumsy. Burning your fingers is not only possible, it is inevitable.   Why, in the name of common sense would you re-invent a tool that has worked perfectly for decades? Put the clip back on, people, and fire the moron that came up with the &#x27;glove&#x27; idea.   I&#x27;m returning my curling iron and guess what, because of this &#x27;new and improved idea&#x27;, I may not EVEN look for a conair to replace it. You lost a decades long time customer because of a &#x27;new and improved&#x27; approach. Idea for future development: if it isn&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this because of the bad reviews, but I found it to be exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;It works almost as well as the full-size clipless wand curling irons, but it is tricky.&lt;br /&gt;You do have to work out a technique so that you don&#x27;t get kinky curls.&lt;br /&gt;I like it better than the full size because those were too long for me to wrap my hair around comfortably without the wand getting in the way of the wrapping arm.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is about 6 inches past chin length, and I could get nice loose waves by holding it upside down and completely vertical (sideways makes the hair slip off) and wrapping small sections of hair around the barrel about 3.5 times.&lt;br /&gt;It was pretty fast to use once I got used to it, and it takes less time than the spiral style (which only curls in one direction). It also only has one heat setting, but seems to be just the right temperature (no overheating-induced frizz). Overall, I am really happy with this!</li>
            <li> Before purchasing, I saw this little curler had good and bad reviews. After reading the bad reviews, I decided to purchase anyway - most of them said that this curler wasn&#x27;t long enough to work with long hair. Well, I can tell that just by looking at it... don&#x27;t know what these people were expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair, on the other hand, was just cut into a cute little lob (long bob) a few days ago, and I needed a curler. I figured that with shorter hair, I could get away with using a shorter curling iron. And I was right! I just tried it out, and I have the best curls I&#x27;ve ever had. My hair doesn&#x27;t usually hold a curl very well, but these curls show no signs of falling out. The curls are holding well, and without a clip, they&#x27;re nice and smooth, too. Awesome look for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curler is magic. Don&#x27;t expect it to work well on long hair, but if you&#x27;re like me and your hair doesn&#x27;t quite reach your shoulders, this is all you need.</li>
            <li> This mini curler was a good buy because it heated up very quickly and was hot enough to curl my hair quickly as well.  The only problem is that it is very easy to burn you hands if you are not careful.  I know you can purchase heat-proof gloves to help but in my opinion, I thought it should have been included in the package.  The heated curler part was also a bit too small and could be a problem for people with long hair.  But I really like how compact it is and that you can just put in in your purse when you are on the go.  Overall, this little curler is a good buy! :D</li>
            <li> This little guy is awesome! I have thick hair that reaches half way down my back. I took this curling iron on a cruise and it worked beautifully. The curlers were perfect and lasted all night. Just give yourself some extra time and curl in smaller segments. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> If you like burning your fingers this is great.</li>
            <li> I got this one and the bigger version, and they both work great,  as good as the $100.00 versions.  I even bought a second one of the larger size so we wouldn&#x27;t be fighting over them.  Great product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for those who have too much hair</li>
            <li> The measurments lie, the barrel is less than 3 inches long.</li>
            <li> This is just avergage. Heats fast but I think too hard to use without a clip on barrel. Very easy to burn hand &amp; not that easy to use with the glove</li>
            <li> I bought this for a trip and tested the product before I left.  Needless to say, I ended up taking my large curling iron on the trip.  I have mid-length hair and thought I would be ok because a majority of the reviews said to avoid it if you have long hair. Wrong. It&#x27;s just awkward and chubby and not easy to use.  Oh, and then I forgot to return it within the 30 days so I&#x27;m stuck with it. Oh well.</li>
            <li> The mini curling iron was compact, which is great for travel, but because I have very thick hair, it would take forever to get it all curled. It would be great if I had shorter or finer hair. I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> I tried to us the  Conair Mini You Curl Curling Iron, Hot Pink on my daughters hair.  I did burn myself and her hair did not curl.  I would say the burns would have been worth it, if I was able to curl her hair, but I can&#x27;t say that happened.  I only used it once and really do not want to try again.</li>
            <li> Actually worked really well. Makes my hair look exactly how I like it!!</li>
            <li> This little thing is so cute, and if you travel a a lot it is light weight and easy to take along where ever you go. It is easy to burn yourself if you are not used to using it. So use caution. It works just as well as a regular size one. It&#x27;s the only one I own.</li>
            <li> Although the idea of this product is cool, its almost impossible to use if you hair is longer than chin length, my hair is about up to my shoulders, and I figured it would suffice  but shoulder length hair is indeed much too long for this product, Im going to have to upgrade to the full size you curl.</li>
            <li> I gave this several tries and could not get it to work.  I&#x27;m pretty proficient at hair styling and this just would not curl my hair nicely.  if you&#x27;re looking for a good little curler buy the Conair TS63R MiniPro Ceramic Curling Iron, Blue, 1 Inch and use it like a wand.  perfect curls, every time.</li>
            <li> I ended up giving this away to my little cousin, although I don&#x27;t think she uses it. I used it once and I didn&#x27;t like it very much, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, really does the job.  I have long hair so I had to curl the top first then the bottom so it takes longer than a full sized curling iron.  Also, I have a heat safe glove - but I forgot to bring it with me so I just used my uncovered fingers with it.  Didn&#x27;t burn myself once - just have to be careful!</li>
            <li> Maybe I should have realized this, but didn&#x27;t - but this does not have the metal &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; to hold your hair in place, and you&#x27;re supposed to use the provided heat resistant glove to hold your hair, and not get burned.  It&#x27;s awkward, difficult, and simply not practical.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Purchased this thinking it&#x27;d be a fun new tool to play with and great for when I&#x27;m traveling.  I&#x27;ve got hair that goes over halfway down my back, and is layered.  However, I&#x27;m not going to be keeping this because I just can&#x27;t figure out HOW to use it!  Gave it to my friends&#x27; 14 year old daughter and she&#x27;s loving it.  At least it will see use.  Guess I&#x27;ll stay old-school with a clip on my curling irons!!</li>
            <li> Works great, wish it had heat settings because it gets REALLY hot, almost too hot for my already curly hair. Just need low heat for touch ups. I used this in Europe and it worked good.</li>
            <li> too difficult to use, too small to handle. Nice size for travel but not user  friendly.</li>
            <li> Love this little thing as its become a staple in my day 2 hair regimen. Particularly during travel. I have long hair (middle of the back at its longest point) and this thing works wonders. There&#x27;s so technique involved and I&#x27;ll do my best to describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Scrap the finger glove. Gets in the way no matter which youcurl you own.&lt;br /&gt;2. You will get burned. Accept it as it&#x27;s part of the learning experience.&lt;br /&gt;3. Start at the ends and work your way to the scalp. I twist my hair in small sections to allow more coverage on the curler but this isn&#x27;t the technique I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;4. TECHNIQUE: Wrap your hair three or four times depending on the thickness/size of chunk you grabbed. I pinch the end of the hair strand to the black tip of the curler with my fingers to keep the curl in place. After 15 seconds, unravel (slowly) ensuring you don&#x27;t let go of the curl. Pinch the base of the previous curl you made and continue to work to the top. Repeat on each strand and tousle your locks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m the last chick on earth who maintains a beauty regimen but this is by far my favorite thing to use. My hair stays intact ALL day and I have rather fine locks. If a curling iron is used, even with pounds of hairspray, my hair falls flat within hours. This youcurl has worked wonders and I can&#x27;t suggest it enough.</li>
