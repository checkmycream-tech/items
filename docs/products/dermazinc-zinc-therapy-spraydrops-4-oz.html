    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The best for my skin when I experience an out-break of what appears to be psoriasis, on one or 2 of my fingers one or two times a year.</li>
            <li>works  great  </li>
            <li>It took about a week for me to notice that the urge to scratch my head was greatly reduced and then gone.  </li>
            <li>Dermazinc is great for seborrheic dermatitis, itching, flaking, blotchy, even acne ridden skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for all kinds of skin problems.  </li>
            <li>I never write reviews on products, but this one deserves a great review.  </li>
            <li>This liquid is great if you can&#x27;t get the cream DermaZinc Cream - 4 oz.</li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>I can get very nice clearing after just 4-6 applications then giving it a rest.</li>
            <li>For the scalp, the dropper is very nice.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many creams and soaps, and dermasync products are the best out there.</li>
            <li>She is absolutely delighted and feels she doesn&#x27;t have to be embarrassed anymore about getting a haircut or going to school.</li>
            <li>Good price, too.</li>
            <li>The good soaps contain 2% Zinc Pyrithione.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not as good as Skinzinc was.</li>
            <li>Good luck, I hope it is as effective for you as it has been for me!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was happy to see this product was available.</li>
            <li>but this spray has had an amazing effect on my psoriasis.</li>
            <li>For me the over-the-counter is about 75% effective at keeping things under control whereas the Rx is 100% effective.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both with great success.  </li>
            <li>For large skin areas the spray nozzle works great.  </li>
            <li>glad  amazon could help</li>
            <li>This product helps more than any prescription.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month and my skin is much better.</li>
            <li>However there is nothing better than Zinc to help Psoriasis.</li>
            <li>It clears up psoriasis better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>While the newer products worked, they took longer to bring flare-ups under control with many more applications.</li>
            <li>he found that many patients preferred the Taclonex.</li>
            <li>The best local price is $34 for 4 oz!</li>
            <li>It burned more than any product I had ever used</li>
            <li>All these things need to be used and re used to get greater control.</li>
            <li>Great product - fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use, non staining.</li>
            <li>DermaZinc is available as on over-the-counter psoriasis treatment or as a prescription strength formula.  </li>
            <li>The iching, dryness, and redness started getting better right away.  </li>
            <li>Have used these products in the past and have had excellent results!.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is actually a powerful cortisone medicine and not what is listed here!</li>
            <li>I originally started using the Dermazinc prescription strength formula (with Clobetasol Propionate) about 8 years ago...</li>
            <li>If you have very mild scalp issues, then this product may be right for you.</li>
            <li>be ordering more very soon.</li>
            <li>I cannot recommend more highly that psoriasis sufferers try this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It is very reasonable priced too!  </li>
            <li>This is not a negative to the product, however, like most psoriasis products you just have to find what works for you.  </li>
            <li>Follow the company&#x27;s suggestion and start with the over-the-counter formula to see if that is effective on its own - apparently for some it is enough.  </li>
            <li>I have used the non-prescription formula as a kind of maintenance treatment once the symptoms are controlled and it works well, although I have had to return to the prescription formula at times to get things back under control.  </li>
            <li>In addition to the zinc, this stuff IS alcohol-based, which helps with the itch, but would not be too great for dry hair - that&#x27;s why I like the fact that I can control the application easily and only have it go on the scalp (I use a medium-tooth comb to comb it in immediately after application).  </li>
            <li>When the rash spread to my right eyelid, I made an appointment with a dermatologist, who said I had seborrheic dermatitis and gave me four prescriptions.  </li>
            <li>The dermatologist said to only use the prescription shampoo (Ketoconazole 2%) twice a week, and use a mild shampoo in between if I wanted wash my hair more often.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so difficult to not be able to help your children and my daughter is so happy.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really help me!</li>
            <li>It may sting alittle at first application, but that&#x27;s just to let you know</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for this product!  </li>
            <li>Really helps calm psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>Clearing seems to last many days longer for me without &#x27;maintenance&#x27; applications.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>It stings a bit at first</li>
            <li>Sometimes it seemed like it was helping, but not enough to be sure and never came close to eliminating the symptoms.</li>
            <li>In about two weeks I was essentially &amp;#34;back to normal,&amp;#34; and I quit using the prescription shampoo because it is very, very drying and leaves my fine hair like a pile of straw.  </li>
            <li>When I first began applying it, each application would cause an immediate but short-lived intense burning sensation.  </li>
            <li>The nozzel meant to use for your scalp is too large and instead of drops coming out</li>
            <li>Would be nice if they sold a larger bottle (at a better price per oz) to refill the small 4 oz spray bottle.</li>
            <li>It is kind of expensive, but having tried all the other shampoos, soaps, creams, etc without success it is worth it if it proves effective for you.  </li>
            <li>and you use too much oil.</li>
            <li>I never imagined that it would work so well so fast.</li>
            <li>Am very satifised.</li>
            <li>also used something called Dermasmooth which worked well but was very oily.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thanks DermaZinc.</li>
            <li>the real reason I am giving this product one star is that the main ingredient is rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>After a few days, however, flaky skin particles began to release all over and within about a week there was absolutely zero sign of symptoms - for the first time in 25 years my scalp did not itch and did not flake, and the skin appeared healthy and normal.  </li>
            <li>Heals well in one-two weeks more or less.</li>
            <li>Flaking and itching is mostly it my beard and hair and this stuff has a ton less than 2% zinc.</li>
            <li>but I will make sure next time to tell the pharmacy \\&quot;spray only - no cream\\&quot;.was a cream, so</li>
            <li>but I will make sure next time to tell the pharmacy \\&quot;spray only - no cream\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>but lasts a long tile for me and worth every cent!</li>
            <li>The price was good, second time buying this product, lasts long enough for me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product line.</li>
            <li>so I had high hopes of it working.  </li>
            <li>But has a strong alcohol smell and is extremely drying.</li>
            <li>When nothing else will calm an itchy scalp that is driving me to distraction, I head for this stuff (no pun intended) and get almost instant relief.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, to get to the point: this DermaZinc liquid works for me, and I can control the application easily so that it only goes on the itchy spots (I no longer wash my hair daily, since it is drier).  </li>
            <li>I had to order it from my local CVS and the price was higher, so buying it on Amazon is a no brainer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always use conditioner, occasionally the Mizani one, which is extremly rich and tends to build up (so then I have to use a &amp;#34;clarifying&amp;#34; shampoo occasionally).  </li>
            <li>This is quite effective, but it burns for a few minutes and leaves the skin extremely dry.</li>
            <li>This stuff works better than the super expensive prescription creams.  </li>
            <li>I have tried creams, steroids, juicing, changing diet completely</li>
            <li>Dermatologist used to be surprised that this was the preparation I would ask for...</li>
            <li>I had oily skin as a teenager and young adult, but NEVER had dandruff ever.  </li>
            <li>Then during the winter of 2010/11 I started developing an itchy scalp, and crusts and &amp;#34;pimples.&amp;#34;  Since I also have migraines (in addition to sensitive skin), I used the fragrance-free Neutrogena T-Sal shampoo, followed by a fragrance-free conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Use this with other scalp psoriasis treatments (ex. taclonex and clobex) and it is useful.  </li>
            <li>Also, besides the active ingredient, I wish it had some botanicals (like aloe or other soothing ingredients) instead of mostly alcohol.</li>
            <li>I swear amazon and all the other companies out their must hire professional \\&quot;reviewers\\&quot; to make something out of nothing, and give tons of positive reviews, etc</li>
            <li>However, be careful with the dropper as it comes out fast.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had nothing but burning, dryness, complete and utter painfulness since using this s</li>

            <li> However, be careful with the dropper as it comes out fast.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had nothing but burning, dryness, complete and utter painfulness since using this s</li>
            <li> I only use the shampoo when I ABSOLUTELY have to; the rest of the time I use either plain fragrance-free shampoo or the Mizani shampoo sold on Amazon (it is a zinc product also).  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the seborrheic dermatitis keeps coming back, mostly in the winter months, when we have the central heat on, and the air is very dry even with a furnace-mounted humidifier.  </li>
            <li> In less than a week of use, I&#x27;ve already noticed a clear improvement in the itching and flaking.  </li>
            <li> I also could not go long in between applications before flare-ups emerged again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the product at the first sign of any skin problems and by the next morning i see dramatic results.</li>
            <li> Btw, I began transferring the solution (after shaking) into a smaller, empty Clobetasol squirt bottle because the smaller hole in the tip lets less fluid out and is less wasteful than the Dermazinc application tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This qualified for free shipping, but the instructions were so confusing I was charged $5.00 on a $25.00 purchase, or 20%, not happy,</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product and I had trouble buying it locally.</li>
            <li> The soap is gentle on the skin and helps to keep the psoriasis from getting worse with hand washing.</li>
            <li> Nothing I have ever tried has come even remotely close.</li>
            <li> I did recently try the Dermazinc alone without Clobetasol for maintenance and it can sting for quite a few minutes.</li>
            <li> The product was what I expected.  </li>
            <li> For the first few days it seemed to itch worse than ever.  </li>
            <li> , it usually only requires a few days (less than a week) to eliminate the scale -</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the sprayer is hard to press with your finger, it leaks when it finally releases the spray.</li>
            <li> but as she healed,the less it burned.  </li>
            <li> Imagine going to school with such flakes constantly on her shoulders and her scalp being so bad that there were cuts and was red.  </li>
            <li> I found this gave me little or no help for my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Having had skin problems in the past due to taking medications which dried me out, i thought there was no help out there for me, until now.</li>
            <li> and I put just a little on every few days in the problem scalp areas.  </li>
            <li> - I do know that this shouldn&#x27;t be used continually - use for a few days, then give it a break - for me</li>
            <li> the trouble is that the plaque returns -</li>
            <li> Worst...leaves my skin feeling completely dried out, has not helped at all, and</li>
            <li> I usually let it go for a while until I can&#x27;t stand looking at the plaque, then I start applying the combo again for a few days -</li>
            <li> I always have skin trouble somewhere on my body &amp; this is something that makes it go away, or a least go somewhere else.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few days (maybe 5), it has cleared up!  </li>
            <li> She complained that it burned going on for a few minutes after spraying</li>
            <li> And it flakes off easily, usually in thicker layers, unlike the newer products where I needed to soak in the tub to scrub off.</li>
            <li> Not sure why,</li>
            <li> Not sure why,</li>
            <li> Not good to overload and have it run down into your eye!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not only can this be painful for inflamed skin, it can also cause further drying of the skin and can be especially during the winter months in cold climates.</li>
            <li> I mix this with Clobetasol (prescription required) and spray it on affected areas, usually twice a day - with in a few days, the plaque is gone and leaves just reddened skin - this is the only stuff that has worked for me (I am afraid to try any of the pills)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, like it claims clearly, it is not prescription strength so do not expect any miracles.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this soap for a relative that suffers from psoriasis on the hands.</li>
            <li> Has too much alcohol base</li>
            <li> I did although I was skeptical because all other products I&#x27;d tried were ineffective.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend to keep looking, unless you&#x27;re desperate and I mean desperate for a tiny bit of relief.</li>
            <li> Four out of four bottles received with under-cap seals broken.</li>
            <li> Very hard to describe, almost look like very thin bendy plastic pieces.</li>
            <li> I still have to resort to the prescription shampoo in the winter if things get really bad, though, but I usually mix it with a milder, richer shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but it worked for me when nothing else did.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, psoriasis is not curable and the symptoms return without ongoing treatment.  </li>
            <li> did not work at all for skin conditions...plus has a weird smell.</li>
            <li> The itch and crusts kept getting worse - to the point of being painful.  </li>
            <li> the bad spots will begin to flake the day after I apply it.</li>
            <li> just ugh...talk about painful dryness and cracking</li>
            <li> Try it today, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> However, I was disappointed in the lack of progress after 30 days.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the shipping charge.  </li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> This spray had my scalp feeling like it was on fire because it burned so bad!</li>
            <li> ; it must be, my skin has never felt this horrible ever!!!!  </li>

            <li> Will never purchase any of their products again! This spray had my scalp feeling like it was on fire because it burned so bad!</li>
            <li> The best for my skin when I experience an out-break of what appears to be psoriasis, on one or 2 of my fingers one or two times a year. Heals well in one-two weeks more or less.</li>
            <li> The  product was  alright. I have severe psoriasis head to toe speckled all over my body. This is a nice substitute because I was desperate. As for clearing my skin, not a chance.  When I sprayed the zinc white flakes came out. Very hard to describe, almost look like very thin bendy plastic pieces. I would recommend to keep looking, unless you&#x27;re desperate and I mean desperate for a tiny bit of relief.</li>
            <li> This is quite effective, but it burns for a few minutes and leaves the skin extremely dry.</li>
            <li> When nothing else will calm an itchy scalp that is driving me to distraction, I head for this stuff (no pun intended) and get almost instant relief.  I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;d cope without it.  Pricey...but lasts a long tile for me and worth every cent!</li>
            <li> works  great  glad  amazon could help</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really help me!</li>
            <li> I was happy to see this product was available. I always have skin trouble somewhere on my body &amp; this is something that makes it go away, or a least go somewhere else.</li>
            <li> This product helps more than any prescription. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month and my skin is much better. My only complaint is that the sprayer is hard to press with your finger, it leaks when it finally releases the spray. The nozzel meant to use for your scalp is too large and instead of drops coming out it runs out and you use too much oil. I need to reorder again sooner than I feel is necessary.However there is nothing better than Zinc to help Psoriasis.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product and I had trouble buying it locally. I had to order it from my local CVS and the price was higher, so buying it on Amazon is a no brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The produce does seem to help with my psoriasis, though nothing actually cures it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap for a relative that suffers from psoriasis on the hands. The soap is gentle on the skin and helps to keep the psoriasis from getting worse with hand washing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but it worked for me when nothing else did.  It took about a week for me to notice that the urge to scratch my head was greatly reduced and then gone.  It has now been about a month and I put just a little on every few days in the problem scalp areas.  I never imagined that it would work so well so fast.</li>
            <li> I have tried creams, steroids, juicing, changing diet completely but this spray has had an amazing effect on my psoriasis. Nothing I have ever tried has come even remotely close. I highly recommend this product...there is no cure but this is the closest I have seen!!</li>
            <li> I mix this with Clobetasol (prescription required) and spray it on affected areas, usually twice a day - with in a few days, the plaque is gone and leaves just reddened skin - this is the only stuff that has worked for me (I am afraid to try any of the pills) - I do know that this shouldn&#x27;t be used continually - use for a few days, then give it a break - for me, it usually only requires a few days (less than a week) to eliminate the scale - the trouble is that the plaque returns - I usually let it go for a while until I can&#x27;t stand looking at the plaque, then I start applying the combo again for a few days -</li>
            <li> Have used these products in the past and have had excellent results!.&lt;br /&gt;Will be ordering more very soon. Am very satifised.</li>
            <li> My husband has seborrhea dermatitis and rosacea.  This stuff works better than the super expensive prescription creams.  I bought the spray drops, soap, shampoo and cream.  Highly recommend this product line.</li>
            <li> This product has been a miracle for me. Having had skin problems in the past due to taking medications which dried me out, i thought there was no help out there for me, until now. Dermazinc is great for seborrheic dermatitis, itching, flaking, blotchy, even acne ridden skin. I use the product at the first sign of any skin problems and by the next morning i see dramatic results. It may sting alittle at first application, but that&#x27;s just to let you know Dermazinc is working. This product has definately been a Godsend. Try it today, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  James Gorrell</li>
            <li> This is a great product for all kinds of skin problems.  It clears up psoriasis better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredient: Zinc Pyrithione (0.25%)&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Ingredients: SDA-40 Alcohol, Isopropyl Myristate, SLS Needles, Undecylenic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is actually a powerful cortisone medicine and not what is listed here!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews on products, but this one deserves a great review.  I have been to the dermatologist with my daughter and the products prescribed by him did nothing for her.  Imagine going to school with such flakes constantly on her shoulders and her scalp being so bad that there were cuts and was red.  It was heart breaking.  After reading a review, I decided to go around the dermatologist and try this product.      After using it for a few days (maybe 5), it has cleared up!  My stress level has been relieved... it&#x27;s so difficult to not be able to help your children and my daughter is so happy.  Thank you so much for this product!  It works.  She complained that it burned going on for a few minutes after spraying but as she healed,the less it burned.  She is absolutely delighted and feels she doesn&#x27;t have to be embarrassed anymore about getting a haircut or going to school.</li>
            <li> My husband has severe psoriasis; this product helps a lot.  Good price, too.</li>
            <li> One of those &#x27;where have you been all my life&#x27; products.  Really helps calm psoriasis.  But has a strong alcohol smell and is extremely drying.</li>
            <li> Although most products that contain Zinc Pyrithione are expensive, this product only contains (0.25%) and therefore seems overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is something that you leave on the skin, it is understandable that it only has a fraction of the soaps or shampoos that you rinse off. The good soaps contain 2% Zinc Pyrithione.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real reason I am giving this product one star is that the main ingredient is rubbing alcohol. Not only can this be painful for inflamed skin, it can also cause further drying of the skin and can be especially during the winter months in cold climates.</li>
            <li> I originally started using the Dermazinc prescription strength formula (with Clobetasol Propionate) about 8 years ago...also used something called Dermasmooth which worked well but was very oily. Since then I have tried newer preparations suggested by my dermatologist such as Taclonex or Clobex (clobetasol propionate solution) with Vectical (Vitamin D &#x27;vaseline&#x27;). While the newer products worked, they took longer to bring flare-ups under control with many more applications. I also could not go long in between applications before flare-ups emerged again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use the Dermazinc with Clobetasol Rx the bad spots will begin to flake the day after I apply it. And it flakes off easily, usually in thicker layers, unlike the newer products where I needed to soak in the tub to scrub off. That&#x27;s a big deal...this condition is enough of an inconvenience to start with. I can get very nice clearing after just 4-6 applications then giving it a rest. Clearing seems to last many days longer for me without &#x27;maintenance&#x27; applications. Btw, I began transferring the solution (after shaking) into a smaller, empty Clobetasol squirt bottle because the smaller hole in the tip lets less fluid out and is less wasteful than the Dermazinc application tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Dermatologist used to be surprised that this was the preparation I would ask for...he found that many patients preferred the Taclonex. As well, Insurance used to cover the Dermazinc with Clobetasol fully, but a few years back they began covering only the Clobetasol leaving the patient responsible for the retail cost of the OTC Dermazinc. So this combo fell out of favor with Dr&#x27;s and patients alike. The best local price is $34 for 4 oz! The Clobetasol Rx solution can be mixed as prescribed with the Dermazinc you find at the lowest price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last addition... I did recently try the Dermazinc alone without Clobetasol for maintenance and it can sting for quite a few minutes. I didn&#x27;t believe that before I tried it. The Clobetasol must have an anesthetic effect because the Rx solution does not sting. My Dermatologist suggested using Dovonex (Rx vitamin D analog) for maintenance, so I will try that. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> DermaZinc is available as on over-the-counter psoriasis treatment or as a prescription strength formula.  I&#x27;ve used both with great success.  After suffering with scalp psoriasis for decades, along with the torturous associated itching, flaking, and scaling, a family member recommended I try DermaZinc&#x27;s prescription formula.  I did although I was skeptical because all other products I&#x27;d tried were ineffective.  When I first began applying it, each application would cause an immediate but short-lived intense burning sensation.  For the first few days it seemed to itch worse than ever.  After a few days, however, flaky skin particles began to release all over and within about a week there was absolutely zero sign of symptoms - for the first time in 25 years my scalp did not itch and did not flake, and the skin appeared healthy and normal.  I could not believe how well it worked.  Unfortunately, psoriasis is not curable and the symptoms return without ongoing treatment.  I have used the non-prescription formula as a kind of maintenance treatment once the symptoms are controlled and it works well, although I have had to return to the prescription formula at times to get things back under control.  For me the over-the-counter is about 75% effective at keeping things under control whereas the Rx is 100% effective.  I cannot recommend more highly that psoriasis sufferers try this stuff.  It is kind of expensive, but having tried all the other shampoos, soaps, creams, etc without success it is worth it if it proves effective for you.  Follow the company&#x27;s suggestion and start with the over-the-counter formula to see if that is effective on its own - apparently for some it is enough.  If not, call your doctor and get the prescription formula.  Good luck, I hope it is as effective for you as it has been for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**7/29/12 Update - went to get a refill on this prescription &amp; the pharmacy accidentally gave me DermaZinc cream instead of spray.  I didn&#x27;t even know there was a cream, so I took it home figuring it would be the same but have discovered it does not work as well for me as the spray.  Not sure why, but I will make sure next time to tell the pharmacy \\&quot;spray only - no cream\\&quot;.was a cream, so I took it home figuring it would be the same but have discovered it does not work as well for me as the spray.  Not sure why, but I will make sure next time to tell the pharmacy \\&quot;spray only - no cream\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Only thing that works for my seborrhea. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> OMG! I had tried everything on my skin and nothing was working.  I ordered  the Dermazinc, what a relief.  The iching, dryness, and redness started getting better right away.  I would recommend this to anyone suffering from skin problems. It is very reasonable priced too!  Thanks DermaZinc.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, non staining. I put it on the affected skin and leave overnight. It works for me.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and used this product for about 30 days with worsening symptoms.  This is not a negative to the product, however, like most psoriasis products you just have to find what works for you.  It burned more than any product I had ever used so I had high hopes of it working.  However, I was disappointed in the lack of progress after 30 days.  Oh well, bring on the next product, ie coal tar, ACV, Denorex, etc....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the Bottling:&lt;br /&gt;I do like the setup and options.  For large skin areas the spray nozzle works great.  For the scalp, the dropper is very nice.  However, be careful with the dropper as it comes out fast.  Not good to overload and have it run down into your eye!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this product works for those who try it.  It is a constant struggle with psoriasis and I hope everyone finds something that works someday.</li>
            <li> Psoriasis is a nightmare. This product definitely helps. I prefer it in the cream though it is easier to control. This liquid is great if you can&#x27;t get the cream DermaZinc Cream - 4 oz. You can also buy from Amazon. Nothing works forever. All these things need to be used and re used to get greater control.Nothing totally clears it for me.</li>
            <li> Second purchase. Use it for itchy scalp. Works great - I use the dropper attachment rather than the spray. Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Relieves itching and helps with dandruff.</li>
            <li> Four out of four bottles received with under-cap seals broken. Product unusable for that reason.</li>
            <li> The product was what I expected.  I am disappointed in the shipping charge.  This qualified for free shipping, but the instructions were so confusing I was charged $5.00 on a $25.00 purchase, or 20%, not happy,</li>
            <li> I had been looking for an alternative zinc spray pyrithion for scalp issues. DermaZinc is a bit pricey, but it works.  Also, besides the active ingredient, I wish it had some botanicals (like aloe or other soothing ingredients) instead of mostly alcohol. It stings a bit at first and I end up using another botanical product to help soothe the scalp.  In less than a week of use, I&#x27;ve already noticed a clear improvement in the itching and flaking.  Would be nice if they sold a larger bottle (at a better price per oz) to refill the small 4 oz spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Flaking and itching is mostly it my beard and hair and this stuff has a ton less than 2% zinc. Use the stronger shampoo for this and never this stuff.</li>
            <li> I had oily skin as a teenager and young adult, but NEVER had dandruff ever.  Then during the winter of 2010/11 I started developing an itchy scalp, and crusts and &amp;#34;pimples.&amp;#34;  Since I also have migraines (in addition to sensitive skin), I used the fragrance-free Neutrogena T-Sal shampoo, followed by a fragrance-free conditioner.  The itch and crusts kept getting worse - to the point of being painful.  When the rash spread to my right eyelid, I made an appointment with a dermatologist, who said I had seborrheic dermatitis and gave me four prescriptions.  One was for an anti-fungal shampoo, another for the same thing in a cream (in a tube), and two lotions (one for spreading on all skin, another for squirting on the scalp).  The dermatologist said to only use the prescription shampoo (Ketoconazole 2%) twice a week, and use a mild shampoo in between if I wanted wash my hair more often.  In about two weeks I was essentially &amp;#34;back to normal,&amp;#34; and I quit using the prescription shampoo because it is very, very drying and leaves my fine hair like a pile of straw.  Unfortunately the seborrheic dermatitis keeps coming back, mostly in the winter months, when we have the central heat on, and the air is very dry even with a furnace-mounted humidifier.  I have kept renewing the prescription shampoo and the skin lotion, but not the cream and the scalp liquid.  I only use the shampoo when I ABSOLUTELY have to; the rest of the time I use either plain fragrance-free shampoo or the Mizani shampoo sold on Amazon (it is a zinc product also).  I always use conditioner, occasionally the Mizani one, which is extremly rich and tends to build up (so then I have to use a &amp;#34;clarifying&amp;#34; shampoo occasionally).  Anyway, to get to the point: this DermaZinc liquid works for me, and I can control the application easily so that it only goes on the itchy spots (I no longer wash my hair daily, since it is drier).  It does not leave a residue either, like the prescription lotion did.  In addition to the zinc, this stuff IS alcohol-based, which helps with the itch, but would not be too great for dry hair - that&#x27;s why I like the fact that I can control the application easily and only have it go on the scalp (I use a medium-tooth comb to comb it in immediately after application).  I still have to resort to the prescription shampoo in the winter if things get really bad, though, but I usually mix it with a milder, richer shampoo.</li>
            <li> Simply doesn&#x27;t work. They need to bring back SKIN ZINC! That is the only product that actually worked, and it seems no one sells it anymore!</li>
            <li> did not work at all for skin conditions...plus has a weird smell.</li>
            <li> Worst...leaves my skin feeling completely dried out, has not helped at all, and just ugh...talk about painful dryness and cracking so you don&#x27;t want to move!!!!  :(  I swear amazon and all the other companies out their must hire professional \\&quot;reviewers\\&quot; to make something out of nothing, and give tons of positive reviews, etc; it must be, my skin has never felt this horrible ever!!!!  Ugh but I&#x27;ve had nothing but burning, dryness, complete and utter painfulness since using this s***.</li>
            <li> I found this gave me little or no help for my psoriasis. Sometimes it seemed like it was helping, but not enough to be sure and never came close to eliminating the symptoms.</li>
            <li> It is not as good as Skinzinc was. Has too much alcohol base</li>
            <li> Use this with other scalp psoriasis treatments (ex. taclonex and clobex) and it is useful.  The fact that it sprays is a big plus.  Unfortunately, like it claims clearly, it is not prescription strength so do not expect any miracles.  If you have very mild scalp issues, then this product may be right for you.</li>
            <li> I have tried many creams and soaps, and dermasync products are the best out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product that helps my dermatitis.  I never want to be without it.</li>
            <li> Like this product, works well for my skin, without making me shiny and greasy.  The price was good, second time buying this product, lasts long enough for me.</li>
            <li> Great product - fast delivery.</li>
