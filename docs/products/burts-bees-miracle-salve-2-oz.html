            <li>Gives beard a nice shine and doesn&#x27;t leave it too greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using Professor Edward J. Fuzzworthy&#x27;s Beard Care Gloss and liked it --</li>
            <li>You kind of have to rub it between your fingers to warm it up.</li>
            <li>Softens it up and leaves a nice shine without any odor.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff, and useful for a variety of things!</li>
            <li>It is much more effective for both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes the beard have a nice healthy sheen, and easier to comb.</li>
            <li>It still works fine, but you have to rub it a bit to warm it up.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This item works well for the most part.</li>
            <li>Perfect for pet and human use!  </li>
            <li>Working it in, Miracle Salve seemed to absorb faster and more thoroughly than Fuzzworthy&#x27;s into my still-damp beard.</li>
            <li>It also seemed to penetrate the skin under my beard better.</li>
            <li>I just love Burts bees.</li>
            <li>In reading other reviews for this product it seemed like the perfect thing to silence the haters.</li>
            <li>3 day&#x27;s after the first use it felt so much better!</li>
            <li>Working it into my beard was easy</li>
            <li>Working it into my beard was easy</li>
            <li>I really like this better than anything else I have used ever!</li>
            <li>It melts in your hand really quickly and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product out primarily as a beard balm, as I had read in several places that it was good for beards.</li>
            <li>it is perfect and so reasonable compared to other eye creams.  </li>
            <li>I used this for my beard and it just stunk way too much for me to use more then twice.</li>
            <li>the jojoba and castor oils kept my beard soft and the eucalypt oil gave it a nice scent --</li>
            <li>This is good because dander is possible even with a well-groomed beard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now switched to using argan oil full time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now switched to using argan oil full time.</li>
            <li>not bad a lil oily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad scent at all</li>
            <li>Does an OK job of moisturizing, but it actually makes my beard look more fuzzy after applying.</li>
            <li>The scent was mild and didn&#x27;t compete with any my cologne or body spray,</li>
            <li>I love this stuff for my beard, it came highly recommend from fellow beardsman</li>
            <li>I tend to carry some of this in my bag at all times, it is a great little lifesaver.</li>
            <li>I hope they will find it as useful as myself.</li>
            <li>He can&#x27;t seem to get enough out of the jar and onto his beard for it to have any kind of effect</li>
            <li>Purchased this product for my beard to tame fly aways and moisturize.</li>
            <li>KP getting better only after 2 days of use!</li>
            <li>Opening it, I found its consistency notably more solid.</li>
            <li>Over the course of the next three days, my beard was softer and more manageable than it had ever been.</li>
            <li>Over the course of the next three days, my beard was softer and more manageable than it had ever been.</li>
            <li>I love using this for my dry skin in drier or cooler climates.</li>
            <li>I also love it for my dry hands!  </li>
            <li>It really is a miracle</li>
            <li>Earthsavers shipped this to me fast</li>
            <li>I was surprised that within an hour, my beard fully absorbed the oil.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that within an hour, my beard fully absorbed the oil.</li>
            <li>No scent really.  </li>
            <li>get stained really easly</li>
            <li>Third, and most egregious, was that it caused my beard to be completely overwhelmed with dandruff.</li>
            <li>The smell is subtle, but pleasant.</li>
            <li>I have used Honest Amish Heavy Duty Balm</li>
            <li>This has a mild scent of honey and olive oil, if you&#x27;ve ever used the chapstick it&#x27;s similar.</li>
            <li>It was more viscuous than olive oil and had a heavy but pleasing scent.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how, or why, but this salve is priced three times higher at local shops compared to amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>It keeps you beard soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>This product was far too greasy for my purpose.</li>
            <li>While it is true a little goes a long way, I had to dip into the tin too many times to get just a little bit.</li>
            <li>salve is very low key without having a scent, so that&#x27;s a plus and the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it does make my beard seem wet and doesn&#x27;t seem to get fully absorbed as much as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>and I really like it but can&#x27;t really get past the muted scent.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel shortly after application.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for dry skin!</li>
            <li>Really like the price compared to other balms.</li>
            <li>Over the next two weeks, I found I needed to apply Miracle Salve as often as Fuzzworthy&#x27;s to keep the same soft feeling.</li>
            <li>, it has luscious beard conditioning ingredients that are 100% natural as is the entire product which is also a big plus for me.</li>

            <li> It seems to work well when I can use it, however I generally have a dry skin problem in winter.</li>
            <li> Second, even though it is marketed as a healing salve for the skin, it didn&#x27;t help my hands, which were dry and calloused from my physically demanding job, at all.</li>
            <li> While I keep my beard short, trimming every other week with a 9mm blade, the hairs are coarse and unruly.</li>
            <li> First, it was not strong enough to tame out-of-control beard hair.</li>
            <li> I also used it after cutting myself while shaving and wow, a few hours after the burning was gone :3</li>
            <li> This works well on my long beard.  </li>
            <li> so he has since given up and switched to using Argan oil or BioSilk to tame the wild beast and both of those solutions work well, but can still become unruly if he runs his hands through his beard alot during a stressful day.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend everyone have this on hand for any small injury on your skin!</li>
            <li> With Fuzzworthy&#x27;s I have to be careful not to put on a pullover too soon after applying the gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> I am hoping we can experiment and get this product to work on his beard, but until then I guess we will just use it to draw out bee stings and other things salve is used for</li>
            <li> On the recommendation of other reviews, I bought this to condition my beard.</li>
            <li> the other hand, there were several negative aspects to this product.</li>
            <li> During this time my house gets cooled down to the 60s to save energy</li>
            <li> After using a ton of other products my brother-in-law showed me this product!  </li>
            <li> usually follow the instructions and apply it to my dry beard, and use the palms of my hands to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the rest of the day, Miracle Salve felt noticeably less greasy to the touch.</li>
            <li> also think it could be a little less greasy.</li>
            <li> Fixes my hair, moisturizes, and covers up if I smell a little hehe.   </li>
            <li> Little tricky to apply.</li>
            <li> This added a few unwelcome minutes to my beard care routine.</li>
            <li> and I noticed among the few toiletries she brought was a bottle of Moroccan argan oil.</li>
            <li> Because the argan oil absorbs fully into my beard, I still need to apply lotion or salve from time to time to keep the skin underneath my beard conditioned.cuous than olive oil and had a heavy but pleasing scent.</li>
            <li> your beard hairs and makes them supple and smoothe after a few uses</li>
            <li> But, it did help tame the beard and make it not soo crunchy and frizzy.</li>
            <li> It normally get&#x27;s quite unruly and he suffers some flack for it&#x27;s unkemot appearance at work.</li>
            <li> Our poor Cocker Spaniels nose got extremely dry and was cracking.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s difficult to get enough out of the tin.</li>
            <li> and I have found this is harder to use when its cold.</li>
            <li> bought this after someone recommended it to avoid beard irritation, and although skeptical, it does help with the itching.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Helps protect from the freezing cold in Chicago winters.</li>
            <li> It dried up the skin under my beard terribly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible.</li>

            <li> Purchased as a beard conditioner and it is effective for that. However, it&#x27;s difficult to get enough out of the tin. While it is true a little goes a long way, I had to dip into the tin too many times to get just a little bit.</li>
            <li> not bad a lil oily but it gets the job done hair is softer</li>
            <li> a must-have for winter, cuticles &amp; feet!</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for my beard to tame fly aways and moisturize. Does an OK job of moisturizing, but it actually makes my beard look more fuzzy after applying. I prefer using beard oil. It is much more effective for both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for a hand moisturizer though!</li>
            <li> Great for hair beards hands face you name it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I put in in my beard, up my nose, on my hands and on my lips. Helps protect from the freezing cold in Chicago winters.</li>
            <li> I like this product, and it smells good. It seems to work well when I can use it, however I generally have a dry skin problem in winter. During this time my house gets cooled down to the 60s to save energy and I have found this is harder to use when its cold. It still works fine, but you have to rub it a bit to warm it up. Not a big deal but it is something to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think it could be a little less greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!  It really is a miracle and it&#x27;s all natural. I use it on me and my child for everything from bug bites to burns. It helps bruises and cuts heal faster without stinging.</li>
            <li> I tend to carry some of this in my bag at all times, it is a great little lifesaver. Fixes my hair, moisturizes, and covers up if I smell a little hehe.   Earthsavers shipped this to me fast and I would do business again with them in the future. I am also doing gift bags for a trip I am currently on and this is one of the products I am giving people. I hope they will find it as useful as myself.</li>
            <li> This item works well for the most part. I just can&#x27;t stand the scent of cardboard or whatever wax they&#x27;re using. It&#x27;s terrible. I used this for my beard and it just stunk way too much for me to use more then twice. But, it did help tame the beard and make it not soo crunchy and frizzy.</li>
            <li> This has a mild scent of honey and olive oil, if you&#x27;ve ever used the chapstick it&#x27;s similar. Works well for beard, hands, face. Gives beard a nice shine and doesn&#x27;t leave it too greasy. This is over all a good salve for a good price.</li>
            <li> I tried this product out primarily as a beard balm, as I had read in several places that it was good for beards. On the positive side, I did notice that it did an excellent job of preventing split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, there were several negative aspects to this product. First, it was not strong enough to tame out-of-control beard hair. Second, even though it is marketed as a healing salve for the skin, it didn&#x27;t help my hands, which were dry and calloused from my physically demanding job, at all.

            <li> I bought this to keep my beard moisturized. This did the job. The miracle salve did the job. It keeps you beard soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning and every evening around my eyes and over my lips.  it is perfect and so reasonable compared to other eye creams.  I really like this better than anything else I have used ever!</li>
            <li> Our poor Cocker Spaniels nose got extremely dry and was cracking.  After using a ton of other products my brother-in-law showed me this product!  Within 2 days of use our Cocker Spaniels nose had almost cleared up.  Perfect for pets pads too!  I also love it for my dry hands!  Perfect for pet and human use!  I would highly recommend this product for dry skin!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend to use on his beard that he has been growing out. It normally get&#x27;s quite unruly and he suffers some flack for it&#x27;s unkemot appearance at work. In reading other reviews for this product it seemed like the perfect thing to silence the haters. Now however, we can&#x27;t figure out quite how to use it! He can&#x27;t seem to get enough out of the jar and onto his beard for it to have any kind of effect so he has since given up and switched to using Argan oil or BioSilk to tame the wild beast and both of those solutions work well, but can still become unruly if he runs his hands through his beard alot during a stressful day. I am hoping we can experiment and get this product to work on his beard, but until then I guess we will just use it to draw out bee stings and other things salve is used for</li>
            <li> KP getting better only after 2 days of use! Miracle product indeed</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF, I got it for my hemorrhoid and goodness! 3 day&#x27;s after the first use it felt so much better! I also used it after cutting myself while shaving and wow, a few hours after the burning was gone :3 I highly recommend everyone have this on hand for any small injury on your skin!</li>
            <li> good.The price is lower when I get it.</li>
            <li> I love using this for my dry skin in drier or cooler climates. My skin feels soft and it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel shortly after application.</li>
            <li> I used it to moisturizer my beard. Ultimately quit using it in favor of Jojoba oil. This product was far too greasy for my purpose.</li>
            <li> Great product use it on skin and hair</li>
            <li> On the recommendation of other reviews, I bought this to condition my beard. While I keep my beard short, trimming every other week with a 9mm blade, the hairs are coarse and unruly. Shampoo and conditioner are not enough. I&#x27;d been using Professor Edward J. Fuzzworthy&#x27;s Beard Care Gloss and liked it -- the jojoba and castor oils kept my beard soft and the eucalypt oil gave it a nice scent -- but I had to reapply it every day or two to keep my beard in check. I wanted something that lasted longer, so I tried Burt&#x27;s Bees Miracle Salve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like Fuzzworthy&#x27;s, Miracle Salve comes in a 2oz. tin. Opening it, I found its consistency notably more solid. It took a lot of working between the fingers to soften it sufficiently to work into the beard. This added a few unwelcome minutes to my beard care routine. The scent was mild and didn&#x27;t compete with any my cologne or body spray, something I can&#x27;t say about Fuzzworthy&#x27;s. Working it in, Miracle Salve seemed to absorb faster and more thoroughly than Fuzzworthy&#x27;s into my still-damp beard. This was good. With Fuzzworthy&#x27;s I have to be careful not to put on a pullover too soon after applying the gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the rest of the day, Miracle Salve felt noticeably less greasy to the touch. It also seemed to penetrate the skin under my beard better. This is good because dander is possible even with a well-groomed beard. Anything that conditions the skin as well as the hair will reduce the risk of unwanted flakes. The next day, though, my beard again felt coarse and needed another dose of Miracle Salve. Over the next two weeks, I found I needed to apply Miracle Salve as often as Fuzzworthy&#x27;s to keep the same soft feeling. Had the story ended there, I would have rated Miracle Salve four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epilogue: My wife and I went camping and I noticed among the few toiletries she brought was a bottle of Moroccan argan oil. I remembered reading about this stuff on a beard care forum and decided to try it. It was more viscuous than olive oil and had a heavy but pleasing scent. Working it into my beard was easy but I worried it would leave the beard greasy. I was surprised that within an hour, my beard fully absorbed the oil. Over the course of the next three days, my beard was softer and more manageable than it had ever been. I&#x27;ve now switched to using argan oil full time. A treatment after each shower leaves my beard feeling great. Because the argan oil absorbs fully into my beard, I still need to apply lotion or salve from time to time to keep the skin underneath my beard conditioned.cuous than olive oil and had a heavy but pleasing scent.

            <li> This works well on my long beard.  Tames it well.  No scent really.  It melts in your hand really quickly and is easy to apply.  Really like the price compared to other balms.</li>
            <li> I just love Burts bees. This made my skin look yonger and healthier en just one night application. I always wear it at night before bed and after a shower. When I wake up my legs look amazing and for someone whos skin get stained really easly this is just the perfect filler.</li>
            <li> Little tricky to apply. You kind of have to rub it between your fingers to warm it up. The smell is subtle, but pleasant. Makes the beard have a nice healthy sheen, and easier to comb.</li>
            <li> Use it for my beard and face. Works great.</li>
            <li> Great for the beard.  Softens it up and leaves a nice shine without any odor.  I have used Honest Amish Heavy Duty Balm and I really like it but can&#x27;t really get past the muted scent.  It&#x27;s not a bad scent at all but I prefer the Burt&#x27;s Bees Miracle Salve as it has no scent.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for my beard, it came highly recommend from fellow beardsman so I endulged and I bought three tins of it because I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere locally that carry&#x27;s BB products neat me, it has luscious beard conditioning ingredients that are 100% natural as is the entire product which is also a big plus for me. It&#x27;s non greasy and deeply conditions your beard hairs and makes them supple and smoothe after a few uses, the conditioning begins immediately as well as it&#x27;s amazing moisturizing abilities,  it keeps my beard in check and nourishes it too, a happy beard makes me a happy man</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how, or why, but this salve is priced three times higher at local shops compared to amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this after someone recommended it to avoid beard irritation, and although skeptical, it does help with the itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually follow the instructions and apply it to my dry beard, and use the palms of my hands to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The salve is very low key without having a scent, so that&#x27;s a plus and the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it does make my beard seem wet and doesn&#x27;t seem to get fully absorbed as much as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, and useful for a variety of things!</li>
