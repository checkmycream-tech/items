            <li>Overall very nice :)</li>
            <li>I am always loyal to these masks!</li>
            <li>Nice products and fast shipments.</li>
            <li>They really are a great buy and you won&#x27;t lose much to try it.</li>
            <li>it is very useful product and help me a lot.</li>
            <li>this is not as good as the natto mask or the black pearl one, it does smell nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never actually worn this for more than 10 minutes because I never have the time to relax with it on, but I have one on right now after showering and it feels very refreshing.</li>
            <li>specially with the price.  </li>
            <li>so you won&#x27;t spread bacteria while wearing the mask, which is the real reason I suspect most people break out.</li>
            <li>the touching feeling is really smooth.&lt;br /&gt;sorry</li>
            <li>It feels nice and cooling on the skin, and leaves my skin feeling soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>And they smell and feel great, just like green apples on the box suggest.</li>
            <li>ships SUPER fast!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too comfortable on for me but mainly because I have a petite body with a petite head</li>
            <li>do not expect they just magically disappears (it takes time), but sure they look less visible after using&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mask does have a very nice scent of green apples, and it is the real deal and not a fake.</li>
            <li>It is not as good as others, a little sticky after apply, don&#x27;t see the effect of minimize visiable pores.</li>
            <li>I am trying this type for the first time...</li>
            <li>This is the first My Beauty Diary product I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
            <li>but i recommend trying one of the others first</li>
            <li>this particular one gives a very fresh tighten feeling after using it , and the skin feels very soft.</li>
            <li>I enjoy all My Beauty Diary Masks in general.  </li>
            <li>My face was really dray, so i used it for a consistently two days.</li>
            <li>I have been using this mask for a long time and always love it.  </li>
            <li>Unlike cream masks, this mask doesn&#x27;t sting or tighten, which is good for me because I usually complain when a mask doesn&#x27;t feel soothing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure someone who isn&#x27;t as oily as me could use this three-four times a week with no problem, but I don&#x27;t think more than every other night would be necessary.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to shape onto my face, but for others I&#x27;m guessing it would fit better.</li>
            <li>This mask doesn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>These are definitely real products (as there are lots of counterfeit ones out there)</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>Makes my face very glowy and hydrated.</li>
            <li>My face feels so much softer after using this product</li>
            <li>It smells like fresh green apples and the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>This type has been my favorite of the My Beauty Diary masks so far, and I am a nearly daily user.</li>
            <li>This brand from Taiwan, I used it before, suit most young girl, and teenage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first sheet mask experience, but I will definitely be ordering more of these in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably going to buy other kinds of My Beauty Diary masks, but this one seems to be the scent I&#x27;m attracted to the most.</li>
            <li>With continual use you will definitely notice a texture improvement, just don&#x27;t forget to keep your hands clean</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this mask, and I may buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>this is a really nice mask, which i usually use it.</li>
            <li>It smells like fresh cider and leaves my pores clear and my skin supple and soft.</li>
            <li>so using these masks too much breaks me out, BUT once or twice a week makes my skin so glow-y and soft!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It doesnt have the same smooth materials that I used to and it felt dry when you put on your face and</li>
            <li>said, \\&quot;wow babe</li>
            <li>They leave your skin feeling baby soft.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to someone who has dry skin or problems with roughness and lines, and wants a clarifying, glowy after-effect.</li>
            <li>not sure it smells that much like apples, but the smell is mild and acceptable</li>
            <li>It feels cold when you put it on, kind of like taking your first steps into a pool, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The seller contacted me directly the next day explaining about the updated packaging taking place in 2013 and how they are not counterfeit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> skin was soft and moisturized after, but after a day it goes back to the way it was :/</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was worried about the smell of these masks since I leave them on for so long.</li>
            <li> I keep using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> i have been using this mask for a long time，everytime after using it，my face will keep moisture and</li>
            <li> I usually cut near the mouth area because the mouth area covers my lips and the holes for the eyes get product in my eyeball</li>
            <li> It is very obvious by the pixilated photo on the front, no embossing on the packaging, and uneven seals on each mask package.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other masks</li>
            <li> I have other masks from the \\&quot;my beauty diary\\&quot; brand, and I am trying this one out.</li>
            <li> however, i don&#x27;t recommend people use this one every day tho , should blend it with other ones .</li>
            <li> They are a lot thinner than the other sheet masks I use</li>
            <li> Not all of the my beauty diary products have them though, so don&#x27;t let that discourage you from trying their other masks.</li>
            <li> This one was VERY wet though and was dripping on my clothes.</li>
            <li> I used it late last night before going to sleep.</li>
            <li> i ordered it on Thursday, expecting waiting until at least next Tuesday, but it arrived overnight!&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is just teeny white heads when I wake up, nothing serious.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this and use it for a few years.</li>
            <li> the mask all is so wrinkle, not comfortable.</li>
            <li> for my poor english,</li>
            <li> My skin is already pale</li>
            <li> And shipping is a little bit slow.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling sticky and weird.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had such a bad.</li>
            <li> i think is not good.</li>
            <li> So I gave a poor review on this product and seller.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These masks mad me break out... : /</li>
            <li> This one smells faintly of apples.</li>
            <li> I ordered from this vendor and the mask is completely fake.  </li>
            <li> My hubby woke up this morning and looked at me (crazy morning</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed at the seller and the products and will never buy from them.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed I didn&#x27;t realize sooner.</li>
            <li> The seller selling FAKE products!!!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It is on time and it is a good product.  it is very useful product and help me a lot.</li>
            <li> This mask doesn&#x27;t really work for me. It is not as good as others, a little sticky after apply, don&#x27;t see the effect of minimize visiable pores.</li>
            <li> Tried these masks and they broke me out!! I&#x27;ve tried other masks and I&#x27;ve never had such a bad. skin was soft and moisturized after, but after a day it goes back to the way it was :/</li>
            <li> Made my skin look like a baby&#x27;s! I used it late last night before going to sleep. My hubby woke up this morning and looked at me (crazy morning bird&#x27;s-nest hair and all) and said, \\&quot;wow babe you look good!\\&quot; Haha. It&#x27;s my first sheet mask experience, but I will definitely be ordering more of these in the future. This one smells faintly of apples. yum!</li>
            <li> I have other masks from the \\&quot;my beauty diary\\&quot; brand, and I am trying this one out. These are definitely real products (as there are lots of counterfeit ones out there) an i love it!</li>
            <li> My wife likes this and use it for a few years. Nice price, nice product.</li>
            <li> These are not My Beauty Diary masks. It is very obvious by the pixilated photo on the front, no embossing on the packaging, and uneven seals on each mask package. I am very disappointed I didn&#x27;t realize sooner. Who knows what I have been putting on my face.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this mask. It smells like fresh green apples and the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming. The mask hydrates my skin and makes my pores look smaller. Great product.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot.</li>
            <li> this brand always been one of my favorite mask brand, it is cheaper than what i found in sephora, yet it works much better. this particular one gives a very fresh tighten feeling after using it , and the skin feels very soft. however, i don&#x27;t recommend people use this one every day tho , should blend it with other ones .</li>
            <li> i think is not good. the mask all is so wrinkle, not comfortable. i can&#x27;t buy this one. but before i bought another one is better than this one .</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin so using these masks too much breaks me out, BUT once or twice a week makes my skin so glow-y and soft! And they smell and feel great, just like green apples on the box suggest. I highly recommend this to someone who has dry skin or problems with roughness and lines, and wants a clarifying, glowy after-effect. With continual use you will definitely notice a texture improvement, just don&#x27;t forget to keep your hands clean so you won&#x27;t spread bacteria while wearing the mask, which is the real reason I suspect most people break out. I have very sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t agitate it at all, so that&#x27;s great, too. I&#x27;m sure someone who isn&#x27;t as oily as me could use this three-four times a week with no problem, but I don&#x27;t think more than every other night would be necessary. They really are a great buy and you won&#x27;t lose much to try it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I am using the second box.</li>
            <li> Makes my face very glowy and hydrated. Nice refreshing mask. Only con is that you might have to customize it. I usually cut near the mouth area because the mouth area covers my lips and the holes for the eyes get product in my eyeball so i just make cuts here and there. overall, i like them and would probably repurchase</li>
            <li> This is one of my holy grail sheet masks. It&#x27;s perfect for my combo skin. It noticeably reduces blemishes while brightening your overall skin.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was worried about the smell of these masks since I leave them on for so long. They have a light apple scent which is very pleasant. They are a lot thinner than the other sheet masks I use and I actually like that. They leave your skin feeling baby soft.</li>
            <li> no as good as Q10.  Just so so</li>
            <li> I am always loyal to these masks! They are great and cute packaging! I am trying this type for the first time...I like the smell :)</li>
            <li> the smell is very nice~</li>
            <li> This type has been my favorite of the My Beauty Diary masks so far, and I am a nearly daily user. It smells like fresh cider and leaves my pores clear and my skin supple and soft.</li>
            <li> Love this mask!  Any time I have a break out this is my go to mask!  When I wake up in the morning and majority of the inflammation is gone or the entire pimple is gone.</li>
            <li> Tightened up my pores, and added glow to my skin! Smells really good too! There&#x27;s alot of extra product left in the packet after use, so you can save it up and use it as a serum for days after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing that bothered me it was not paraben-free. Not all of the my beauty diary products have them though, so don&#x27;t let that discourage you from trying their other masks. Overall very nice :)</li>
            <li> love it love it love it..this is the best facial masks I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;With this mask, you no longer need a pore serum. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It works really good. My face was really dray, so i used it for a consistently two days. Then i can see a great change on my face.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s so good. I keep using it for a long time. It&#x27;s a good price. And shipping is a little bit slow.</li>
            <li> This brand from Taiwan, I used it before, suit most young girl, and teenage. But it smalls very good. May I will buy it again,</li>
            <li> The Apple mask smells VERY good and after using the lemon masks and the strawberry ones before this one, I have already noticed a change with my acne and it hasn&#x27;t been a week yet. There is just teeny white heads when I wake up, nothing serious. This one was VERY wet though and was dripping on my clothes.</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The mask does have a very nice scent of green apples, and it is the real deal and not a fake. I&#x27;ve never actually worn this for more than 10 minutes because I never have the time to relax with it on, but I have one on right now after showering and it feels very refreshing. It feels cold when you put it on, kind of like taking your first steps into a pool, but you get used to it. This is the first My Beauty Diary product I&#x27;ve ever bought but I focused on the scent rather than the purpose. I&#x27;m probably going to buy other kinds of My Beauty Diary masks, but this one seems to be the scent I&#x27;m attracted to the most. My skin is already pale so I don&#x27;t need a whitening mask, but I do need help with my pores. Unlike cream masks, this mask doesn&#x27;t sting or tighten, which is good for me because I usually complain when a mask doesn&#x27;t feel soothing. It&#x27;s not too comfortable on for me but mainly because I have a petite body with a petite head so it&#x27;s hard to shape onto my face, but for others I&#x27;m guessing it would fit better. Overall, I really like this mask, and I may buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I saw these masks recommended on YouTube.  I don&#x27;t notice anything special from using them, but they are nice and refreshing.</li>
            <li> The seller selling FAKE products!!! I have been using this mask for a long time and always love it.  I ordered from this vendor and the mask is completely fake.  It doesnt have the same smooth materials that I used to and it felt dry when you put on your face and all the liquid is not on the mask but inside the bag.  It doesnt work at all.  I am extremely disappointed at the seller and the products and will never buy from them.</li>
            <li> i have been using this mask for a long time，everytime after using it，my face will keep moisture and the touching feeling is really smooth.&lt;br /&gt;sorry for my poor english, and it&#x27;s a good product which is worth to be recommended.</li>
            <li> Fabulous, refreshing scent. Use as often as possible to get the desired effect.</li>
            <li> These masks mad me break out... : /</li>
            <li> I it wasn&#x27;t all that I heard it to be. It left my skin feeling sticky and weird.</li>
            <li> this is a really nice mask, which i usually use it. specially with the price.  and this kind of is my favorite ..</li>
            <li> I enjoy all My Beauty Diary Masks in general.  It feels nice and cooling on the skin, and leaves my skin feeling soft and supple.  I don&#x27;t notice having any excellent long-term results on my skin, but they are a nice pick-me-up.</li>
            <li> Useful and pretty good!</li>
            <li> Nice products and fast shipments.</li>
            <li> By looking at the packaging, I thought I have received counterfeit products. So I gave a poor review on this product and seller.&lt;br /&gt;The seller contacted me directly the next day explaining about the updated packaging taking place in 2013 and how they are not counterfeit.&lt;br /&gt;I did some research on my own and also put my face out there to try them and they feel the same as the ones I had before.&lt;br /&gt;Great prouduct!!!</li>
            <li> My face feels so much softer after using this product</li>
            <li> ships SUPER fast! i ordered it on Thursday, expecting waiting until at least next Tuesday, but it arrived overnight!&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve purchased this before and it does well in eliminating the pores. do not expect they just magically disappears (it takes time), but sure they look less visible after using&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m not sure it smells that much like apples, but the smell is mild and acceptable</li>
            <li> I ordered this after using their Whitening Masks, but my skin was breaking out everytime I used this mask.  My hormones were all over the place with baby and nursing.  I will try these masks once I stop nursing.</li>
            <li> this is not as good as the natto mask or the black pearl one, it does smell nice but i recommend trying one of the others first</li>
