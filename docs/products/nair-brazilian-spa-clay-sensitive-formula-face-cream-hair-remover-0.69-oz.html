            <li>I tried this product and it worked wonderfully!</li>
            <li>HOW ATTRACTIVE *rolls</li>
            <li>This product works great for me.</li>
            <li>and because it smelled good</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>However, this product sure did put my skin to the test with a freaking chemical burn!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>&quot;, I thought this should be safe!</li>
            <li>When the 7 minutes were up, I wiped it off with a warm washcloth.</li>
            <li>Nice find.</li>
            <li>I bought this after seeing a popular youtube beauty guru use it.</li>
            <li>First off, the smell is marvelous- not too strong, just a nice peachy smell.</li>
            <li>So many reviews were not favorable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried this and now will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>so I now have that for a mustache instead, which is even more embarrassing than the hair.  </li>
            <li>I wanted gone the most.  </li>
            <li>You may need more strips than provided with the product.</li>
            <li>but yet Nair is still in business and able to sell their products.</li>
            <li>No terrible smell.  </li>
            <li>love this product .......</li>
            <li>I found that by wiping it up, it took most of the hair off.</li>
            <li>It is amazing i love this product it is smooth and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin</li>
            <li>It started burning and stinging much more.</li>
            <li>Sure hope this doesn&#x27;t leave a permanent scar.</li>
            <li>Hopefully my skin will feel better tomorrow.</li>
            <li>but this 1 seems slightly safe and</li>
            <li>It is clean to use, effective, and convenient.  </li>
            <li>I picked this up on a promotion at Rite Aid for free a couple weeks ago (hey, if it&#x27;s free I&#x27;ll try it!) and tried it tonight.</li>
            <li>worked for me and it was easy.</li>
            <li>and he gave me a strong antibiotic cream with a soothing compound.</li>
            <li>this product works great although if u have sideburns they are  hard to remove with this product over all it lasts for a good while when you remove hair :)</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used any kind of hair removal product on my face.</li>
            <li>and i was fine.</li>
            <li>Nice nair product for more sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it was going to be good for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It leaves me stuck with having to pluck most of the hairs out which I tried avoiding in the first place by buying this product.</li>
            <li>Blisters spread twice the original diameter.</li>
            <li>Most astoundingly for ME, is that it actually removed the hair.</li>
            <li>it is perfect for facial hair as it is a sensitive formula....</li>
            <li>I really should have looked up more reviews before buying.</li>
            <li>It began to get very hot and itchy.</li>
            <li>I definitely give this 5-stars, as it is the most fast, affordable, and effective hair removal meth that I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re not supposed to leave it on for more than 10mins but for most effectiveness you can leave it on for 8 &amp; no matter what if I leave it on for that long</li>
            <li>few months ago, my friend suggested I try Spa Clay Sensitive Formula Nair, and I&#x27;ve been nothing but impressed with it.</li>
            <li>i wish in general nair was clear about it not removing hair for good or decreasing the amt or thickness.</li>
            <li>find it incredibly irresponsible to label something as a &#x27;sensitive&#x27; skin product, when it is CLEARLY the opposite.</li>
            <li>My hair came right off and it left my skin feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li>I liked this product so much, I placed a second order of it.  </li>
            <li>Removes hair gently and quickly.  </li>
            <li>If I get brave enough to use this again, I will only leave it one for 3 minutes tops</li>
            <li>It was very gentle on my skin</li>
            <li>First I tried shaving, but that lasted all of a day or two.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>First put on the pre-treatment then the removal cream.</li>
            <li>Stings more than the regular formula for non-sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t even take off any hair.  </li>
            <li>The first time, I tried it with a moist wipe and it did not work.</li>
            <li>Much smaller more concentrated clusters.</li>
            <li>I used this product exactly as directed, but it did not remove any hair.  </li>
            <li>Most removal creams, I have to wait the entire 10 minutes</li>
            <li>and I have red splotches.....and to top it off</li>
            <li>this is my first time buying it.</li>
            <li>With words on the packaging like, \\&quot;moisturizes with mango berry and acai berry\\&quot;, \\&quot;mineral rich clay\\&quot; and \\&quot;Sensitive formula\\</li>
            <li>It removed the peach fuzzy stuff but left a hideous bright red shiny burn</li>
            <li>I don’t normally have sensitive skin and don’t break out easily</li>
            <li>I tried it about a year ago, and was pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness and the smell (mild and not-offensive)</li>
            <li>I have fine blonde hair</li>
            <li>oh and remember those fine blonde hairs I wanted gone?</li>
            <li>I was really nervous to use this product.</li>
            <li>anyone wants to know what a Bellabe is, or buy one, here&#x27;s the link:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>and I kept it on for the whole 10mins.</li>
            <li>I kept it on for 5 minutes and at first everything looked normal.</li>
            <li>I bought this product after hearing how gentle it was.</li>
            <li>Oh my God, the burning was so intense..</li>
            <li>found this one to be much harsher.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really work as it claims.</li>
            <li>I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li>The cream was gentle and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I have dark hair (I&#x27;m Mexican) and it successfully removed all the hair where I placed the product.</li>
            <li>Sensitive formula MY ASS!!!</li>
            <li>Glad i only left it on for 5 minutes, because when I removed it I noticed I have burns on my face.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin, but this was the only product available at the store I went to, so decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>After carefully wiping it off, it was red and swollen for a good 5 hours, and I could barely move my face.</li>
            <li>it is effective and it doesn&#x27;t leave me with a red moustache outline on my upper lip or give me yellow, translucent scabs that make strangers stare at me in grocery stores: I am one scabby freak!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like my normal acne either.</li>
            <li>, I left it for 9 minutes and wiped it up instead of down with a warm cloth.</li>
            <li>But all seemed to be okay, mild discomfort and a little pink...</li>
            <li>Maybe this product just isn&#x27;t for me, but for anyone with fine dark hair, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li>and i have very sensitive skin)</li>
            <li>Be sure to test a small area first and don&#x27;t leave on for a second longer than 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>And this product is marketed for sensitive skin - wow!</li>
            <li>wish they made that clear.</li>
            <li>This was perect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Sensitive</li>
            <li>it left my skin very irritated</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin I would not recommend.</li>
            <li>Works very well on coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The packaging says for sensitive skin with a picture of a Mango and and</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin..save your money.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it does burn after a while.</li>
            <li>I feel like the hair grows back just as fast, if not faster, than if I shave it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>But this one actually did what it was supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my upper lip- fine, blonde hair (as in, I&#x27;m the only one who cares.</li>
            <li>After a small patch test on my chin and upper lip to which I waited 24hrs as directed, I notice a very mild flaking/dryness (I considered to be normal, I had a face peel once</li>
            <li>I started noticing a burning sensation after just a few minutes, but, waited the full 5 minutes before washing off.  </li>
            <li>I will most likely be writing Nair a complaint email.</li>
            <li>It took the hair off really well, but also left my face burning with red</li>
            <li>I wanted to remove fine blonde hairs on my upper lip, I let the product sit for 1 minute, maybe less then that and began to feel the burn.</li>
            <li>I could clearly see sores forming on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>I figured since I use retinol products that maybe my upper lip wasn&#x27;t that sensitive since I can tolerate those products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ha.).&lt;br /&gt;I left it on for 6 minutes, after which the hair was completely removed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I used Nair Sensitive Skin Face Cream several times, and it burned my skin every time.  </li>
            <li>I just apply it, follow the instructions, and a few minutes later, I say good by to the hair on my face for at least a week.</li>
            <li>After washing it off of my face with warm water per the instructions (WTF, NAIR??</li>
            <li>I decided to leave it on for the last few minutes and washed it off with cool water and washcloth.</li>
            <li>Even though it hurts a little (No worse than plucking)</li>

            <li> ha.).&lt;br /&gt;I left it on for 6 minutes, after which the hair was completely removed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used Nair Sensitive Skin Face Cream several times, and it burned my skin every time.  </li>
            <li> I just apply it, follow the instructions, and a few minutes later, I say good by to the hair on my face for at least a week.</li>
            <li> After washing it off of my face with warm water per the instructions (WTF, NAIR??</li>
            <li> I decided to leave it on for the last few minutes and washed it off with cool water and washcloth.</li>
            <li> Even though it hurts a little (No worse than plucking)</li>
            <li> Side note - my skin is not super sensitive and I&#x27;ve never had any major issues with hair removers</li>
            <li> but as other reviewers have said, it isn&#x27;t so sensitive.</li>
            <li> Left on for less that it said to as well because I have extremly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Definitely will continue to use as long as my skin tolerates it.</li>
            <li> I took ir off and it left my face red and with scabs from my skin peeling  its very dry and flaky now.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but it did sting a tiny bit while it was on and a little still after I removed it, but rinsing thorougly with cool/lukewarm water helped.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> The skin around my mouth is dry, red and blotchy.</li>
            <li> Finally, I tried some generic hair removal cream from, which was effective, but so painful and irritating that it wasn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I tried it the first time, it did left a bad stinging feeling right after on my face.</li>
            <li> It can also leave the skin slightly red and very dry and scaly.</li>
            <li> I have areas that have broken out and a couple spots that are super dry now.</li>
            <li> I washed it off immediately and it left a burning pink splotch on my skin.</li>
            <li> The result was swollen pink patches on my upper lip that BURN,</li>
            <li> and i like the texture too (not too thick but very smooth)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have really corse thick chin hair</li>
            <li> I get EXTREME chemical burn &amp; the facial hair</li>
            <li> Very minor.</li>
            <li> it also produces dry scaly skin every day like a sunburn would.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and use prescription Retinal on my face frequently making me unable to wax facial hair off my face.</li>
            <li> However it did not remove ONE SINGLE HAIR.</li>
            <li> Did not remove the coarse dark chin hair</li>
            <li> and I just wanted to remove a little spot of upper lip hair.</li>
            <li> I left it on for 5 minutes and it tingled a little.</li>
            <li> Obviously it burns your face a little</li>
            <li> I noticed little blisters and redness forming and the area became inflamed and started spreading beyond the actual application area.</li>
            <li> have a few pesky hairs on my chin and upper lip.</li>
            <li> Although if you have coarse hair don&#x27;&#x27;t waste your time it will do nothing but burn your face</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, this stuff is not gentle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to using the regular formula, it stings less but at least takes off the hair.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Please be careful!</li>
            <li> I shall be needing more. :(</li>
            <li> Both times it worked extremely well.</li>
            <li> other than this, it met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I was very careful with the directions while using this, and I didn&#x27;t exceed the time to leave it on.</li>
            <li> would be very careful using this.  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say is that it still smells.</li>
            <li> I never had extremely dark or think corse hair on my face, and I still don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> But I assume since my hair is dark it is easier to see what the product didn&#x27;t remove, which is almost everything.</li>
            <li> Basically, it SUCKED and not worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now just because I spent the money and feel I might as well use it</li>
            <li> Not only did it remove zero hair, it left a very angry, red, burning rash on my skin that has lasted for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> and it was just a slight tingling/stinging.</li>
            <li> Typically Nair and Nair-type products (Veet, etc.)</li>
            <li> in less than 5 mins.</li>
            <li> and I did not get any redness or irritation that I usually get from waxing and other products.</li>
            <li> There is a huge nasty burn on my upper lip now.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes, the cream was burning.</li>
            <li> disappointed about how u can only use it on ur face and the same other places as the other nair product.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the other negative reviews.</li>
            <li> People with skin sensitivities, like me, are prone to breakouts, sores, puffiness, redness, or WORSE, and to market products like these to us is so highly offensive, it should be criminal.</li>
            <li> and I still decided that it would be safe (stupid I know)!</li>
            <li> I usually pluck.</li>
            <li> It amazes me at how many horrible reviews there are</li>
            <li> but since using this product I exploded in small pimples on my chin and either side of my chin.</li>
            <li> you are crazy enough to try this stuff after reading all of these negative reviews, please get a tube of bacitracin because you are going to need it.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to look in the mirror the next morning...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not THAT sensitive, and I&#x27;ve never had such a horrible reaction to a product before in my life.</li>
            <li> very disappointing only removed a few hair</li>
            <li> so I look ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I have a nasty red, painful rash above my upper lip.</li>
            <li> It came back darker. :(</li>
            <li> By this time my patch test had changed to reveal a much worse reaction than it did in the 24hr test instructed by the packaging</li>
            <li> Swelling, stinging and redness became even worse.</li>
            <li> gooood but expensive at amazon</li>
            <li> Your face will look shiny and weird, but it feels</li>
            <li> It was horrible and embarrasing walking around with a burned upper lip!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think  this item would work, but i was wrong.</li>
            <li> Boy does it burn my face and leaves terrible red welts where it has been applied.</li>
            <li> RIDICULOUS!!</li>
            <li> Just an awful excuse of a product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this product got all the bad reviews!  </li>
            <li> This product is absolutely terrible, i&#x27;m typing this with one hand, the other hand is holding ice on my face.</li>
            <li> That hurts A THOUSAND TIMES WORSE THAN COLD WATER!)</li>
            <li> I immediately rinsed with cold water.</li>
            <li> I applied a cold pak before I went to bed.</li>
            <li> I applied a cold pak with ice for a bit, got some relief and noticed the blisters started oozing.</li>
            <li> I tried to soothe the skin with a cold compress, aloe, and eventually took Benadryl.</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> But it stung really bad.</li>
            <li> It was so bad I took a pain pill to give me some relief, then it wore off.</li>
            <li> i do know its bad for the environment</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin feeling burned and painful.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m so disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Its awful :(</li>
            <li> BUT I was wrong!!!</li>
            <li> Looks terrible.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and still had awful results.</li>
            <li> Worst product EVER.</li>
            <li> This is a Horrible product.</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible.</li>
            <li> This is terrible.</li>
            <li> What an extremely dangerous skin product being sold over the counter!!!</li>
            <li> Awful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I definitely give this 5-stars, as it is the most fast, affordable, and effective hair removal meth that I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a few pesky hairs on my chin and upper lip. First I tried shaving, but that lasted all of a day or two. Next I tried waxing, but that kept leading to breakouts and ingrown hairs. Finally, I tried some generic hair removal cream from, which was effective, but so painful and irritating that it wasn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago, my friend suggested I try Spa Clay Sensitive Formula Nair, and I&#x27;ve been nothing but impressed with it. I just apply it, follow the instructions, and a few minutes later, I say good by to the hair on my face for at least a week. No irritation, no redness, no pain, just smoothness.</li>
            <li> I also used this product as recommended. Glad i only left it on for 5 minutes, because when I removed it I noticed I have burns on my face. The skin around my mouth is dry, red and blotchy. Looks terrible. Would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was really nervous to use this product. So many reviews were not favorable. Lots of complaints on burning the skin and blisters. I figured since I use retinol products that maybe my upper lip wasn&#x27;t that sensitive since I can tolerate those products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This worked for me and it was easy. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used any kind of hair removal product on my face. I usually pluck. I&#x27;m glad I tried this and now will continue to use it. I followed the directions exactly. First put on the pre-treatment then the removal cream. Set the timer for 7 minutes. I didn&#x27;t feel anything until around minute 4 and it was just a slight tingling/stinging. Very minor. When the 7 minutes were up, I wiped it off with a warm washcloth. Removed all the hair! Followed with the moisturizer and done. Definitely will continue to use as long as my skin tolerates it.</li>
            <li> gooood but expensive at amazon</li>
            <li> Someone said this was painless.  Ha!  It removed the peach fuzzy stuff but left a hideous bright red shiny burn so I now have that for a mustache instead, which is even more embarrassing than the hair.  Did not remove the coarse dark chin hair I wanted gone the most.  Yucky, yucky, yucky!  Do not use!  I threw away the rest of the tube.  I don&#x27;t even want to risk another try.</li>
            <li> Stings more than the regular formula for non-sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t even take off any hair.  I&#x27;m going back to using the regular formula, it stings less but at least takes off the hair.</li>
            <li> Nice nair product for more sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have fine blonde hair and I just wanted to remove a little spot of upper lip hair. I left it on for 5 minutes and it tingled a little. I washed it off immediately and it left a burning pink splotch on my skin. I followed the directions and still had awful results. Avoid this product!!!</li>
            <li> I was very careful with the directions while using this, and I didn&#x27;t exceed the time to leave it on. But it stung really bad. After carefully wiping it off, it was red and swollen for a good 5 hours, and I could barely move my face. There is a huge nasty burn on my upper lip now. HOW ATTRACTIVE *rolls eyes*&lt;br /&gt;Yeah I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. Sensitive formula MY ASS!!!</li>
            <li> Will not be re-purchasing! Didn&#x27;t work, and left skin feeling like sandpaper!</li>
            <li> Do not get this product! I should have listened to the other reviews. I tried this thinking maybe nothing would happen to my skin, but it burned it to the point that some of my skin did come off. The next day my upper lip was swollen and extremely dried out, so much that some of it started to bleed. I never thought that something like this would be on the market if it did what it did to me. Also, it didn&#x27;t even get any of the hair off. Just an awful excuse of a product.</li>
            <li> This was perect for my sensitive skin. No breakouts! The only negative thing I have to say is that it still smells.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at CVS and used it - per packaging instructions. Side note - my skin is not super sensitive and I&#x27;ve never had any major issues with hair removers so I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot... Sensitive - IT IS NOT! I used it on my upper lip and chin area and man oh man did it hurt after removal... It burned my skin! I have areas that have broken out and a couple spots that are super dry now. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> very disappointing only removed a few hair it left my skin very irritated</li>
            <li> Worst product EVER. This stuff burned my face in a matter of minutes, and I am not over exaggerating: it looked and felt like a second degree burn! After washing it off of my face with warm water per the instructions (WTF, NAIR?? That hurts A THOUSAND TIMES WORSE THAN COLD WATER!) I could clearly see sores forming on my upper lip. After applying (and subsequently washing off) a multitude of products (aloe vera, organic lotion, a bag of frozen peas) I found the one thing in my arsenal that actually worked to relieve the pain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BACITRACIN ZINC OINTMENT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are crazy enough to try this stuff after reading all of these negative reviews, please get a tube of bacitracin because you are going to need it. Your face will look shiny and weird, but it feels oh-so-good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it incredibly irresponsible to label something as a &#x27;sensitive&#x27; skin product, when it is CLEARLY the opposite. People with skin sensitivities, like me, are prone to breakouts, sores, puffiness, redness, or WORSE, and to market products like these to us is so highly offensive, it should be criminal. Shame on you, Nair. I will NEVER buy a Nair product ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to my Bellabe. Even though it hurts a little (No worse than plucking) it is effective and it doesn&#x27;t leave me with a red moustache outline on my upper lip or give me yellow, translucent scabs that make strangers stare at me in grocery stores: I am one scabby freak!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone wants to know what a Bellabe is, or buy one, here&#x27;s the link:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001RPL902 Bellabe 118 Facial Hair Remover]]</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> this product works great although if u have sideburns they are  hard to remove with this product over all it lasts for a good while when you remove hair :)</li>
            <li> I used this about a month ago and the Area is still irritated and burns...it also produces dry scaly skin every day like a sunburn would.WILL NEVER USE AGAIN</li>
            <li> Does not work at all. Left on for less that it said to as well because I have extremly sensitive skin and it still burned my skin, face was left very red and sore for a day. Didn&#x27;t remove any of my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is meant to remove facial hair. I never had extremely dark or think corse hair on my face, and I still don&#x27;t. But I assume since my hair is dark it is easier to see what the product didn&#x27;t remove, which is almost everything. It leaves me stuck with having to pluck most of the hairs out which I tried avoiding in the first place by buying this product. Also I tend to get stuck with chemical burns often. You&#x27;re not supposed to leave it on for more than 10mins but for most effectiveness you can leave it on for 8 &amp; no matter what if I leave it on for that long I get EXTREME chemical burn &amp; the facial hair is still there. Maybe this product just isn&#x27;t for me, but for anyone with fine dark hair, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I liked this product so much, I placed a second order of it.  It is clean to use, effective, and convenient.  You may need more strips than provided with the product.</li>
            <li> Obviously it burns your face a little I doubt you will find one that does not. However it did not remove ONE SINGLE HAIR. Basically, it SUCKED and not worth it. The hair I tried to use it on is coarse so perhaps it works for non coarse hair. Although if you have coarse hair don&#x27;&#x27;t waste your time it will do nothing but burn your face and I kept it on for the whole 10mins.</li>
            <li> This product is the devil in a bottle! I read the reviews prior to using it and I still decided that it would be safe (stupid I know)! I don’t normally have sensitive skin and don’t break out easily so I figured that this product wouldn’t do any harm. However, this product sure did put my skin to the test with a freaking chemical burn! I don’t recommend anyone to purchase this item. I kept it on for 5 minutes and at first everything looked normal. Within about 3-4 hours I noticed the reaction it was having on me. It began to get very hot and itchy. Today is only day 2 of having the chemical burn and I advise you ALL to stay away from it. Don’t spend your money on something that will physically hurt you. It amazes me at how many horrible reviews there are but yet Nair is still in business and able to sell their products. RIDICULOUS!! I will most likely be writing Nair a complaint email. I doubt they&#x27;ll care but this s*** is beyond me.</li>
            <li> I picked this up on a promotion at Rite Aid for free a couple weeks ago (hey, if it&#x27;s free I&#x27;ll try it!) and tried it tonight. First off, the smell is marvelous- not too strong, just a nice peachy smell. Most astoundingly for ME, is that it actually removed the hair. Typically Nair and Nair-type products (Veet, etc.) don&#x27;t do ANYTHING for me. They just don&#x27;t remove any hair. But this one actually did what it was supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my upper lip- fine, blonde hair (as in, I&#x27;m the only one who cares. ha.).&lt;br /&gt;I left it on for 6 minutes, after which the hair was completely removed.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but it did sting a tiny bit while it was on and a little still after I removed it, but rinsing thorougly with cool/lukewarm water helped.&lt;br /&gt;My skin type is combination normal/dry/oily (le sigh.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was going to be good for my sensitive skin and because it smelled good BUT I was wrong!!! I used it on my upper lip and when the time came to remove it (as indicated in the box) it burned my skin and hair off! It was horrible and embarrasing walking around with a burned upper lip! Please be careful! I would NEVER use Nair in my life ever again! Now that my skin recovered,the pigmentation is off. It came back darker. :(</li>
            <li> Works very well on coarse hair.  Use on chin area. No terrible smell.  Removes hair gently and quickly.  Nice find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this product got all the bad reviews!  I tried it about a year ago, and was pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness and the smell (mild and not-offensive) and i like the texture too (not too thick but very smooth)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that the tube is so tiny.  I shall be needing more. :(</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing a popular youtube beauty guru use it. I really should have looked up more reviews before buying. I used it on my upper lip and I felt the burning sensation immediately. IMMEDIATELY. And this product is marketed for sensitive skin - wow! After torturing myself, I rinsed off and the hair was gone. I noticed that my skin was superbly moisturised though, but it was weird - the area looked a little greasy and over moisturized if you know what I mean? I don&#x27;t even need that. This is a Horrible product. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think  this item would work, but i was wrong. i took everything of. in less than 5 mins. I would order again</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and leave on my upper lip for 7-8 minutes and if takes it all off. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this from the store before and had no problem. I bought it online, and I don&#x27;t know its a knockoff or expired, but it does not remove hair.&lt;br /&gt;Instead, it left burns!</li>
            <li> This product does not work for me.I have really corse thick chin hair and I used this product three times and no results. The smell is horrible.</li>
            <li> Took off only the smaller-thinner hair.</li>
            <li> love this product .......it is perfect for facial hair as it is a sensitive formula....it doesn&#x27;t give you any irritations....(from my experience..and i have very sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> I bought this product after hearing how gentle it was. Let me tell you, this stuff is not gentle. I applied to my upper lip and left on for 10 minutes like the directions say to do. After a few minutes, the cream was burning. I decided to leave it on for the last few minutes and washed it off with cool water and washcloth. This product burned my skin. I have a nasty red, painful rash above my upper lip. Its awful :( I will never ever ever buy this product again and I suggest no one else does either. It will burn you. Chemical burns on your face sucks....avoid this product!</li>
            <li> I used Nair Sensitive Skin Face Cream several times, and it burned my skin every time.  I reduced the time I left it on my skin (upper lip) to only 3 minutes, but it still burned my skin.  I do not plan on using the rest of the tube or buying it again.</li>
            <li> With words on the packaging like, \\&quot;moisturizes with mango berry and acai berry\\&quot;, \\&quot;mineral rich clay\\&quot; and \\&quot;Sensitive formula\\&quot;, I thought this should be safe! Wrong! This is terrible. I agree with all the other negative reviews. I wanted to remove fine blonde hairs on my upper lip, I let the product sit for 1 minute, maybe less then that and began to feel the burn. I immediately rinsed with cold water. The result was swollen pink patches on my upper lip that BURN, oh and remember those fine blonde hairs I wanted gone? Still there. This product is absolutely terrible, i&#x27;m typing this with one hand, the other hand is holding ice on my face. Save yourself a lot of pain and just keep the hair.</li>
            <li> This product works great for me. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. I tried it once and it didn&#x27;t worked as how it claims but a couple of months after, I gave it a second try and this time, I left it for 9 minutes and wiped it up instead of down with a warm cloth. I found that by wiping it up, it took most of the hair off. The first time, I tried it with a moist wipe and it did not work. When I tried it the first time, it did left a bad stinging feeling right after on my face.</li>
            <li> I did a test and i was fine. After 24 hrs i did my face avoiding areas they said to. It burnded me and I still have sores on my face!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and use prescription Retinal on my face frequently making me unable to wax facial hair off my face. I tried this product and it worked wonderfully! It was very gentle on my skin and I did not get any redness or irritation that I usually get from waxing and other products. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item on clearance at a local supermarket and I&#x27;ve used it twice. Both times it worked extremely well. I have dark hair (I&#x27;m Mexican) and it successfully removed all the hair where I placed the product. Downfall is I believe this product gave me acne. I&#x27;ve always had acne but since using this product I exploded in small pimples on my chin and either side of my chin. It&#x27;s not like my normal acne either. Much smaller more concentrated clusters. And no they&#x27;re not ingrown hairs. Those areas of my face are extremely red as well. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an even trade off.</li>
            <li> If I could give no stars j would. this stuff burned and I knly left it on for 2 minutes I took ir off and it left my face red and with scabs from my skin peeling  its very dry and flaky now. do not buy this just wax ur face instead this stuff burns.</li>
            <li> It is amazing i love this product it is smooth and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin</li>
            <li> I used this product exactly as directed, but it did not remove any hair.  It leaves the skin feeling burned and painful.  It can also leave the skin slightly red and very dry and scaly.</li>
            <li> After a small patch test on my chin and upper lip to which I waited 24hrs as directed, I notice a very mild flaking/dryness (I considered to be normal, I had a face peel once and that&#x27;s what it looked like), I proceeded to apply the cream above my upper lip to rid myself of unwanted hair. Waited 5 min per direction. The area started burning to the point it brought tears. I immediately applied tap water to remove the cream. The stinging and burning continued. I applied a cold pak before I went to bed. I was afraid to look in the mirror the next morning... But all seemed to be okay, mild discomfort and a little pink... Until the end of the next day. By this time my patch test had changed to reveal a much worse reaction than it did in the 24hr test instructed by the packaging... blistering began to form. My upper lip started to feel taut and looked to be swelling by evening... I noticed little blisters and redness forming and the area became inflamed and started spreading beyond the actual application area. It started burning and stinging much more. I applied a cold pak with ice for a bit, got some relief and noticed the blisters started oozing. I applied Polysporin and went to bed. Tautness and burning woke me up around 4am. I looked in the mirror and my upper lip was swollen to the point I didn&#x27;t look like me. Oh my God, the burning was so intense.. Blisters spread twice the original diameter. Throughout the day (I could not work), I iced, applied Aloe Vera... Nothing stopped the stinging. It was so bad I took a pain pill to give me some relief, then it wore off. Swelling, stinging and redness became even worse. 4 days into this now as I write this and I have to go to the doctor. I wish I could post a photo here.... (Cont)... I went to my doctor.. My chemical burn is close to second degree. Says it could take a week or longer to see improvement and he gave me a strong antibiotic cream with a soothing compound. Sure hope this doesn&#x27;t leave a permanent scar. I think this product should be pulled from the shelves. The packaging says for sensitive skin with a picture of a Mango and and Acai berries.. Oh and Dermatologist tested!!!!! Bull$#|+! Deceitful advertising. Toxic is what this product is. Chemicals used in this product should&#x27;ve come with a neutralizer, to stop the chemicals from burning layers of skin. &amp;#34;Wash off with lukewarm water&amp;#34;, it says!!! ... are you kidding me? ha!! This combination of chemical ingredients cannot be &amp;#34;washed&amp;#34; off!!!...  it continues to eat layers of skin for hours!! What an extremely dangerous skin product being sold over the counter!!! And to think I had planned to use it on the rest of my fuzzy face..?? Had i done that?... No doubt, I&#x27;d be in the ER. Hope this review helps you, especially those of you with &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; skin such as I have, what&#x27;s left of it.</li>
            <li> Awful! I have stubborn upper lip hair and this product will not take it all off. Notice I said all? Yep it will only remove on sections so I look ridiculous. Did I mention it burns? Boy does it burn my face and leaves terrible red welts where it has been applied. I do not have sensitive skin..save your money.</li>
            <li> I have always used the Nair for Sensative Face. I&lt;br /&gt;could not find it online (blue box) so I tried this one&lt;br /&gt;and I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the regular nair face cream and never had a problem.&lt;br /&gt;I found this one to be much harsher. It took the hair off really well, but also left my face burning with red splotches.&lt;br /&gt;I would be very careful using this.  Be sure to test a small area first and don&#x27;t leave on for a second longer than 5 minutes.  If I get brave enough to use this again, I will only leave it one for 3 minutes tops</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t thrilled with this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now just because I spent the money and feel I might as well use it but as other reviewers have said, it isn&#x27;t so sensitive. I have sensitive skin and it does burn after a while. However, if I don&#x27;t keep it on for ten minutes, it won&#x27;t work. It does work when applied for ten minutes but it doesn&#x27;t really work as it claims. I feel like the hair grows back just as fast, if not faster, than if I shave it. I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. Use regular Nair or a Veet product - I will be returning to that method.</li>
            <li> The cream was gentle and moisturizing. My hair came right off and it left my skin feeling very smooth. I would definitely recommend this to anyone in need of facial hair removal.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin, but this was the only product available at the store I went to, so decided to give it a try.  Most removal creams, I have to wait the entire 10 minutes or they do not work (and even with going 10 minutes, they do not burn nor irritate my skin in any way.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream I started noticing a burning sensation after just a few minutes, but, waited the full 5 minutes before washing off.  MISTAKE! My skin is still burning a day later and I have red splotches.....and to top it off, I endured this discomfort and it only removed some of the hairs!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin but it&#x27;s not THAT sensitive, and I&#x27;ve never had such a horrible reaction to a product before in my life. I used the hair remover as directed, but only kept it on my face for about 7 minutes. Not only did it remove zero hair, it left a very angry, red, burning rash on my skin that has lasted for the rest of the day. I tried to soothe the skin with a cold compress, aloe, and eventually took Benadryl. All of which didn&#x27;t help at all. Hopefully my skin will feel better tomorrow. But I&#x27;m so disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> havent used it yet... disappointed about how u can only use it on ur face and the same other places as the other nair product. wish they made that clear. i noticed theres another newer similar product out now that also has healing creams with it. it is cheaper than buying it at walgreens or cvs. i wish in general nair was clear about it not removing hair for good or decreasing the amt or thickness. i do know its bad for the environment but this 1 seems slightly safe and this is my first time buying it. other than this, it met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I would recommend against using this face cream because you risk getting a chemical burn.</li>
