    <ol>
            <li> Great price for the brushes. Will order some more so I can enough. The brushes are great</li>
            <li> Amazon has obviously realized that there is a problem. The site had 9 brush heads for $16.49. I only got 3. I&#x27;m sure the product is fine.</li>
            <li> Fits the waterpik water flosser sonic toothbrush. A pretty good price. Comes out about the same as if you were buying a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Nice soft bristles, fits my Waterpik electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Work great and are color coded for ease of use by various family members.</li>
            <li> Good brushes but I thought this was a bargain.  The description specifically says &amp;#34;9 brush heads&amp;#34;.  I only received 3 brush heads.</li>
            <li> Best price Was able to find.</li>
            <li> they work well, good deal</li>
            <li> Works just as it is supposed to.</li>

            <li> Perfect replacement. A little pricey, but will last a while.</li>
            <li> Works great! Good value for the $$$$.</li>
            <li> I use to use Sonicare brand but I hate the fact that their brush heads are designed not to last very long. I picked Waterpik for a test use and now I stick with it, these brush heads are last much longer.</li>
            <li> We have a sensonic toothbrush and these heads are really hard to find in stores. They work great and are exactly like the original one that came with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Order was exactly what I wanted.  My expectations are always fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li> The fit the model needed.</li>
            <li> Keeps your teeth clean and the electric toothbrush is a great addition. Works fine so far and easy to maintain. Extra brushes not cheap but you know the story.</li>
            <li> No issues at all with these replacement brushes.  They are exactly like the original brushes that came with the product.</li>
            <li> Work as expected and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for my waterpik.  This is for the standard sized replacements,  not the compact.  Although not a concern for me,  conveniently,  the brush heads have different colored rims at the base for households that have multiple users.</li>
            <li> Great product.  We use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> Hey its a toothbrush - does its job but how can you &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> Product just as expected; great product.</li>
            <li> very well made, good quality.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>

            <li> These are perfect and a great price.</li>
            <li> I really like it. But feels that it is worn out quicker than normal tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> OEM replacements so they are just fine.</li>
            <li> It is what it is. Brush heads. They work as expected with my Waterpik sonic brush.</li>
            <li> Best price I could find, good product, great customer service</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  I did think the packaging was overkill though. A smaller box would have been just fine.</li>
            <li> Hard to find item at my local pharmacy store (CVS/Walgreens). Works well as advertised and fits my Waterpik toothbrush perfectly.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit, just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> My husband still uses his Waterpik electronic toothbrush although I&#x27;ve been through two. These replacement heads are just what he needed. The only issue is they were not delivered on the date promised.</li>
            <li> Love this tooth brush and replacement brush came quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> Feels like a professional cleaning every day.</li>
            <li> The best tooth brush and heads - soft and protects the gums</li>
