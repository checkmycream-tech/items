            <li>Thank you Apollo for such an awesome product.  </li>
            <li>Looks good , wonderful finish, its heavy and does not &amp;#34;tip&amp;#34; when used.</li>
            <li>OMG, I&#x27;m glad I bought this one.  </li>
            <li>Need the 25mm opening for most Parker brushes.  </li>
            <li>Brush rest by the flange at top of brush; not the bottom of the knot by the bristles.  </li>
            <li>Stainless is the way to go ,great products</li>
            <li>Great product super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Has a feel of high quality and a good weight.  </li>
            <li>but they are cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is nice that it is stainless, and it does the job.</li>
            <li>Finally a stand that fits my nice Parker brush the way it should!  </li>
            <li>Overall, Great Stand, and well worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li>This is really a cool idea and a really cool product.</li>
            <li>Plus it is stainless steel and will not rust on your counter top.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is stainless.  </li>
            <li>Seriously though its the best stand you&#x27;ll find for any amount of money</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, and the stainless steel is very heavy, so it doesn&#x27;t tip over.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I like this better than the rest of the nearly identical razor</li>
            <li>My sink is always wet from shaving and hair styling so seeing that this product doesn&#x27;t rust is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Apollo stand is well worth the money and will not disappoint.</li>
            <li>Solid and nice stand...</li>
            <li>other than that good stand for non shower use.</li>
            <li>to have it air dry and not sit in its own wetness.</li>
            <li>Very solid construction, much better than the rest, worth a look.</li>
            <li>Well constructed, simple, yet sophisticated.  </li>
            <li>I am going to get several more of these for Christmas gifts for all the guys on my list who shave</li>
            <li>It is easy to keep clean and looks sharp.  </li>
            <li>While they all look identical, many have parts that rust, or are simply not manufactured to high standards.</li>
            <li>It has a good weight to it and it feels like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>This one is all stainless and really well made.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see when the real thing is there.  </li>
            <li>Of the highest quality, all stainless steel.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have a stainless shower caddy where I keep this and</li>
            <li>Looks nice on my bathroom counter and takes up just a small footprint.  </li>
            <li>Primarily because of some of the not so positive reviews with some of the other stands.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I had the hardest time finding a stand, looking thru every online store with no luck finding one that fits my new Omega brush, until now.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>They rust, are light enough to tip, and don&#x27;t hold multiple sized brushes and razors.</li>
            <li>Nice and heavy and not too big.</li>
            <li>The stand was needed because the Apollo brush was far larger than most other stands.</li>
            <li>Its stainless steel and should last forever!</li>
            <li>extremely safisfied, better than I expected.</li>
            <li>After reading many other reviews on some of the other stands, I decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li>and I had a new one 2 days later.</li>
            <li>If you are considering this stand, be aware that the brush opening is rather large; this is not a good stand for smaller brushes.</li>
            <li>I especially appreciate the fact that it is constructed from stainless steel; I never have to worry about rust due to moisture (inherent with any bathroom).  </li>
            <li>The brush holder is a little too large to hold a couple of my brushes, and it wobbles a bit on the counter.</li>

            <li> The brush holder is a little too large to hold a couple of my brushes, and it wobbles a bit on the counter.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant at first because of the price, and the limited number of reviews.  </li>
            <li> I will be purchasing another in the near future for my other brush and razor.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I have with it is that if you are a shower shaver and want to keep this stand in the shower just be aware that while the entire thing is stainless the bottom of the base is not.</li>
            <li> Opening is big enough unlike a couple of other previous stands.  </li>
            <li> the stand itself is heavy enough to not fall over.</li>
            <li> Not real substantial, not real stable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that, no complaints yet, although I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to develop the rust spots a few other reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> some other stands out</li>
            <li> The sheer brilliance and beauty of the stand has gotten me laid at least twice.</li>
            <li> All are extreme!</li>
            <li> Would be nice to have a hard rubber/plastic cover over the base, to prevent scratches to the counter, however this is a minor complaint.  </li>
            <li> It is heavy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not cheap looking like</li>
            <li> They were out of stock when I purchased, but the product still arrived within a few weeks of purchase.  </li>
            <li> There are also expensive stands that do the same as this one but are overpriced.</li>
            <li> the rust from the base was starting to show on the caddy.</li>
            <li> They tend to show a little rust if water is allowed to rest on the base where the stem is inserted.</li>
            <li> Had a problem with mine rusting on the base but contacted the manufacturer</li>
            <li> After about a week of it being in the shower I started to see rust spots on the bottom of the base.</li>

            <li> This is a quality product.  Well constructed, simple, yet sophisticated.  Would be suitable sitting on the counter top of even the classiest bathroom.  I especially appreciate the fact that it is constructed from stainless steel; I never have to worry about rust due to moisture (inherent with any bathroom).  Would recommend to anyone who is in the market for a quality razor/brush stand,</li>
            <li> Good quality, great balance, and holds my razor and brush perfectly.  Would buy this again in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and excellent quality.</li>
            <li> I have many Apollo products. All are extreme! The stand was needed because the Apollo brush was far larger than most other stands. It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Nice material and quality,</li>
            <li> This is really a cool idea and a really cool product. Wish I had thought of this! It is sturdy and substantial and made of heavy guage stainless steel. The boys&amp;#34; razors fit right in there perfectly and gets them off the sink. I think this has to be better for the razor (and the sink!) to have it air dry and not sit in its own wetness. I am going to get several more of these for Christmas gifts for all the guys on my list who shave (my husband has decided to grow a beard but I will get him one as a hint to shave it off). Buy some!</li>
            <li> Nice!  I like this better than the rest of the nearly identical razor stands on the market.  While they all look identical, many have parts that rust, or are simply not manufactured to high standards. This one is all stainless and really well made.  It holds both my razors (obviously not at the same time), and my brush no problem.</li>
            <li> Very good looking but costly</li>
            <li> Great Finnish on this peace , nice and sturdy constructed . Looks awesome together with my razor and shaving brush from Apollo . I would definitely recommend this product to anyone .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this stand for about a month now. It is excellent. It is heavy so it won&#x27;t tip over. It also holds my heavy long-handled safety razor and my shaving brush both very well. My sink is always wet from shaving and hair styling so seeing that this product doesn&#x27;t rust is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are cheaper stands similar to this but they are cheap for a reason. They rust, are light enough to tip, and don&#x27;t hold multiple sized brushes and razors. There are also expensive stands that do the same as this one but are overpriced. Unless you want a gold, silver, or platinum stand on your sink, go ahead and purchase it. This Apollo stand is well worth the money and will not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase..It is heavy duty,made of stainless steel and well made. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Looks and feels great.  Nice and heavy and not too big.</li>
            <li> Its stainless steel and should last forever! This device does an impecable job of holding my razor and brush. Safety razor is the way to go. Better ,closer shave and way cheaper.</li>
            <li> Excellent stand.  Has a feel of high quality and a good weight.  It is easy to keep clean and looks sharp.  It holds my Merkur 34C razor and brush by The Art of Shaving perfectly. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Product looks good and holds my razor and brush well.  Finish appears to be of good quality and the stand itself is heavy enough to not fall over.</li>
            <li> I ordered several of these. They tend to show a little rust if water is allowed to rest on the base where the stem is inserted.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Matches the Merkur handle.</li>
            <li> Very solid construction, much better than the rest, worth a look.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, exactly as advertised.  Arrived in record time.  I would be glad to do business with this seller again.</li>
            <li> Not real substantial, not real stable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice that it is stainless, and it does the job. The brush holder is a little too large to hold a couple of my brushes, and it wobbles a bit on the counter. I intend to look around for a better alternative.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Had a problem with mine rusting on the base but contacted the manufacturer and I had a new one 2 days later.</li>
            <li> as I walk my dog and check my emails I realized I received one from Apollo. They want me to do a review and I will not lie I don&#x27;t mind. The sheer brilliance and beauty of the stand has gotten me laid at least twice. And that was with a disposable razor in it I can&#x27;t wait to see when the real thing is there.  Seriously though its the best stand you&#x27;ll find for any amount of money</li>
            <li> Great Stand. It has a good weight to it and it feels like it will last a long time. Fits my commodore x3 brush, and all my vintage gillette razors perfectly. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Great product super fast shipping.  Item is made of grade &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; stainless steel and heavy for the size.  Price is great for the quality.  Holds my brush and razor perfect and looks great in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Solid stand and beautiful! It has a lot of weight to it and will not tip over like the cheaper stands.  This holds my Edwin Jagger DE89 and my Art of Shaving silver tip badger brush perfectly.  It holds my Van Der Hagen brush too. I will be purchasing another in the near future for my other brush and razor.  Thank you Apollo for such an awesome product.  Plus it is stainless steel and will not rust on your counter top.</li>
            <li> extremely safisfied, better than I expected.</li>
            <li> If you are considering this stand, be aware that the brush opening is rather large; this is not a good stand for smaller brushes. Other than that, no complaints yet, although I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to develop the rust spots a few other reviewers mentioned. If I see any rust, I&#x27;ll update the review accordingly.</li>
            <li> I use this stand with my Merkur 38HD and badger brush and it works great. Both items fit on/are held perfectly by this stand. It looks very nice, too. It&#x27;s definitely not cheap looking like some other stands out there are. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this stand for your DE safety razor and lather brush.</li>
            <li> Looks good , wonderful finish, its heavy and does not &amp;#34;tip&amp;#34; when used. Great product.</li>
            <li> Of the highest quality, all stainless steel.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant at first because of the price, and the limited number of reviews.  After reading many other reviews on some of the other stands, I decided to give this one a try. Primarily because of some of the not so positive reviews with some of the other stands.  OMG, I&#x27;m glad I bought this one.  Excellent quality, and the stainless steel is very heavy, so it doesn&#x27;t tip over.  The stand fits my Edwin Jagger De89LBL Razor &amp; Parker Shaving Brush perfect!  They were out of stock when I purchased, but the product still arrived within a few weeks of purchase.  No packaging/shipment problems.  Overall, Great Stand, and well worth the purchase.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Quality product.  Had to modify the brush holder, uilizing rubber tubing, to hold my Edwin Jagger badger brush.  Looks nice on my bathroom counter and takes up just a small footprint.  Would be nice to have a hard rubber/plastic cover over the base, to prevent scratches to the counter, however this is a minor complaint.  Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Finally a stand that fits my nice Parker brush the way it should!  Opening is big enough unlike a couple of other previous stands.  Need the 25mm opening for most Parker brushes.  Brush rest by the flange at top of brush; not the bottom of the knot by the bristles.  Solid and nice stand... only wish their logo was not all over it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Very high quality construction and looks great on my bathroom sink! Holds my Badger Brush and Safety Razor perfectly!</li>
            <li> Just a nice quality stand.  I love the fact that it is stainless.  Holds my Merkur HD 34c perfectly!</li>
            <li> This is a nice stand looks great fits my brush and safety razor just fine. The only issue I have with it is that if you are a shower shaver and want to keep this stand in the shower just be aware that while the entire thing is stainless the bottom of the base is not. After about a week of it being in the shower I started to see rust spots on the bottom of the base. I have a stainless shower caddy where I keep this and the rust from the base was starting to show on the caddy. other than that good stand for non shower use.</li>
            <li> I had the hardest time finding a stand, looking thru every online store with no luck finding one that fits my new Omega brush, until now.&lt;br /&gt;This Apollo has the quality of the $105.00 German stands for a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to You!</li>
            <li> Stainless is the way to go ,great products</li>
