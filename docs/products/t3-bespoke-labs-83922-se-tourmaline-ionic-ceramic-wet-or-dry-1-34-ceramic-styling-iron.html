            <li>I am thrilled!</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t care, as the price savings made it a very good value even if it would need to be repaired or replaced at my own cost...and considering the reviews and good warranty</li>
            <li>and I actually loved it.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it had superior reviews on [...]</li>
            <li>and I loved the result</li>

            <li>I really wanted to be impressed</li>
            <li>The rhinestones on the iron are a nice touch</li>
            <li>The protective  pad for my vanity was nice as well.</li>
            <li>Just one thing that kind of hung me up at the beginning</li>
            <li>A good thing after reading the many reviews here, they would have probably scared me off.</li>
            <li>Welcome to the world of wonderful comments on your hair, and enjoy your new T3 Tourmaline,     Terri</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to hold my hair taught and never had to go over a section of my hair more than once.</li>
            <li>For all of you who love this iron</li>
            <li>Oh, one more thing.</li>
            <li>It comes out better for me</li>
            <li>I love this iron.</li>
            <li>I love my T3.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I have never had a better straightening iron.  </li>
            <li>every chance she can her friends love it as well</li>
            <li>But I did and love it</li>
            <li>she said it is the best one she ever tried she has had many flat irons</li>
            <li>It is the best flat iron you will ever need.</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron out there!  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel silky smooth and everyone comments on how healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other irons before (i.e., maxiglide) and have found this to be the best option out there.  </li>
            <li>The plates do indeed glide easily through my hair.</li>
            <li>I have used many flat irons over the years, this one is the absolute best.</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey but most definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>It is FANTASTIC and makes my hair silky and smooth and pin-straight in minutes, without drying it out.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a fantastic flatiron,</li>
            <li>It made a great birthday present for each of them.</li>
            <li>Just the idea of the sizzling sound must be causing damage.  </li>
            <li>Hair even feels smooth and softer after using the iron.  </li>
            <li>Its a good iron, but my hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li>This is by far the best flat iron, yes it is even better than the Chi.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, it doesn&#x27;t keep my hair straight.</li>
            <li>The heat dial allows for good temperature control and at 375 I only need to pass my hair through once or twice.</li>
            <li>If you do straighten straight from the shower, make sure you use a leave in conditioner or it will look frizzy.</li>
            <li>It also reached over 400 degrees but the really nice thing was that one plate was covered in pins and the opposite plate had holes where the pins fit into.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping from the store, thx.</li>
            <li>Hair is super shiny after use.</li>
            <li>I love my new hair iron.</li>
            <li>this one is strong and you can even change the temp real plus.</li>
            <li>I got a good deal on the T3; however, it does not even compare to my Hot Tools flat iron.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s frustrating that it&#x27;s drying out my hair and yet failing to perfectly straighten it.    </li>
            <li>So far my hair still feels and looks healthy.</li>
            <li>definitely worth the cost.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Her flat iron runs about $600, great for her in her line of work, much too costly for my budget, there just simply has to be a better solution than that.     </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not all that thrilled with this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Better yet, it holds real well in the high humid temperatures found in the St Louis Metro area</li>
            <li>and it heats up super fast.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s just my difficult hair as I purchased this unit because it had so many great reviews.</li>
            <li>No need here, it really does heat up quickly.     </li>
            <li>As always with Amazon the shipping on the T3 was very fast.</li>
            <li>This iron leaves my hair looking very straight.  </li>
            <li>I need that higher temp.     </li>
            <li>Overall not too pleased with my results.</li>
            <li>I just wish T3 would not put them on the handle in the first place.</li>
            <li>But the first one lasted almost 6 years.</li>
            <li>I have had to put it on a higher heat setting than the directions suggest.</li>
            <li>I decided to spend extra and overpay for this one hoping it would be better.</li>
            <li>This is a great flat iron for long, medium-to-thick hair.</li>
            <li>It works great with my hair, doesn&#x27;t fry it, and it actually gets it straight, and it stays for a long time.</li>
            <li>Flat Ironing works much better.     </li>
            <li>Jilbere flat iron (which I pretty much loved) finally kicked the bucket -</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re going to straighten your damp locks anyway (80% dry is good enough, right?)</li>
            <li>Ok, this flat iron works really well.</li>
            <li>It heats up VERY quickly, so I don&#x27;t need to leave it on for any length of time at all before actually using it, plugging it in just a minute or two before use.</li>
            <li>I have fine very curly hair and have to constantly battle the frizz.  </li>
            <li>It also had a \\&quot;well\\&quot; which held spring water and one press of the button would release a gentle and moisturizing steam.</li>
            <li>but I really wanted to see how it worked on damp hair.</li>
            <li>although it appears it may not be covered by the warranty because it was purchased through an Amazon seller (is this even legal??)</li>
            <li>I have high hopes for this one!</li>
            <li>and they all stop working fast</li>
            <li>and it makes it straight</li>
            <li>Finally an iron that gets warm enough</li>
            <li>All that said, I love the iron, its cord is long enough that I don&#x27;t have to stand on top of the outlet, the outside doesn&#x27;t get so hot that I can&#x27;t touch it, it doesn&#x27;t catch my hair and break it off at the plate edges.</li>
            <li>Bypass this and go for a cheaper one, you&#x27;ll get better results for half the price.</li>
            <li>In fact, when I wear my hair curly (which is rare), people actually tell me that they thought my hair was straight all along.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lent my older version of this product to my sister and friend, and they both wanted it immediately.</li>
            <li>And believe me, it would be worth double the price!  </li>
            <li>The product was brand new and sealed...</li>
            <li>We&#x27;d all like to save time in the morning, but just as you can&#x27;t turn ice into vapor without creating water first, you can&#x27;t turn wet hair into straightened glossiness without blow drying first before flatironing.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and even with the extreme humidity we have down here, my hair can stay nice and straight during a thunderstorm.  </li>
            <li>I have very naturally curly hair and my hair stylist</li>
            <li>All of that with using a tool that heats to 410 degrees, wow!</li>
            <li>This flat iron was everything that I was looking for:  -quick to heat up  -has multiple adjustable temperature settings  -gets</li>
            <li>When passed through wet hair, the iron steams out the water and creates a sizzling sound (however, it&#x27;s not burning the hair since it doesn&#x27;t smell like burned and because I&#x27;ve used it for 8 months and the condition of my hair has actually improved).  </li>
            <li>With such wide plates, this baby will smooth and flatten your hair in no time.</li>
            <li>They clearly state that they will NOT warranty any product from Amazon.</li>
            <li>That all being said, I don&#x27;t feel this iron does anywhere near the job that my old Maxium did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually noticed my hair is much drier and seems to be getting damaged, and yes, I do use a salon brand thermal protectant with this unit.</li>
            <li>This iron still doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair anywhere near what my Maxium did</li>
            <li>By the way, my stylist said, \\&quot;NEVER EVER put any hot styling tool to your hair unless it is absolutely positively dry, or you will ruin your hair over time, causing it to break and split, so I always either use a blow dryer or let my hair air dry (often overnight) before using a hot iron on it.    </li>
            <li>Granted, my hair is pretty thick and coarse, but my old iron could make it smooth.</li>
            <li>It is VERY wavy, without being curly at all, so I have to either flat iron it or curl it or it won&#x27;t look done.</li>
            <li>hot enough to straighten my coarse hair    </li>
            <li>I never had to press hard and it would glide easily through my hair</li>
            <li>, now I have new look that I can actually do in 45 minutes.  </li>
            <li>This will give you straighter hair in less time than a couple of short quick passes.    </li>
            <li>My friend recommended that new Instyler, but I&#x27;ve read they are always breaking after only a few months and the temp is just not that hot.</li>
            <li>At first the steam made me a little weary, but need not worry.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t hold very well in my hair, falling to waves again in less than an hour (even in the winter).</li>
            <li>I would think with any unit that gets this hot, you might experience trouble over time with it burning itself out if left on for extended periods of time.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I know the routine of patience, pull the flat iron slowly, use a heat protecting pretreatment, and all that, but with other irons (including a Chi), they just didn&#x27;t make it look like my stylist makes it look.</li>

            <li> The product was brand new and sealed...</li>
            <li> We&#x27;d all like to save time in the morning, but just as you can&#x27;t turn ice into vapor without creating water first, you can&#x27;t turn wet hair into straightened glossiness without blow drying first before flatironing.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and even with the extreme humidity we have down here, my hair can stay nice and straight during a thunderstorm.  </li>
            <li> I have very naturally curly hair and my hair stylist</li>
            <li> All of that with using a tool that heats to 410 degrees, wow!</li>
            <li> This flat iron was everything that I was looking for:  -quick to heat up  -has multiple adjustable temperature settings  -gets</li>
            <li> When passed through wet hair, the iron steams out the water and creates a sizzling sound (however, it&#x27;s not burning the hair since it doesn&#x27;t smell like burned and because I&#x27;ve used it for 8 months and the condition of my hair has actually improved).  </li>
            <li> With such wide plates, this baby will smooth and flatten your hair in no time.</li>
            <li> They clearly state that they will NOT warranty any product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> That all being said, I don&#x27;t feel this iron does anywhere near the job that my old Maxium did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually noticed my hair is much drier and seems to be getting damaged, and yes, I do use a salon brand thermal protectant with this unit.</li>
            <li> This iron still doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair anywhere near what my Maxium did</li>
            <li> By the way, my stylist said, \\&quot;NEVER EVER put any hot styling tool to your hair unless it is absolutely positively dry, or you will ruin your hair over time, causing it to break and split, so I always either use a blow dryer or let my hair air dry (often overnight) before using a hot iron on it.    </li>
            <li> Granted, my hair is pretty thick and coarse, but my old iron could make it smooth.</li>
            <li> It is VERY wavy, without being curly at all, so I have to either flat iron it or curl it or it won&#x27;t look done.</li>
            <li> hot enough to straighten my coarse hair    </li>
            <li> I never had to press hard and it would glide easily through my hair</li>
            <li> , now I have new look that I can actually do in 45 minutes.  </li>
            <li> This will give you straighter hair in less time than a couple of short quick passes.    </li>
            <li> My friend recommended that new Instyler, but I&#x27;ve read they are always breaking after only a few months and the temp is just not that hot.</li>
            <li> At first the steam made me a little weary, but need not worry.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t hold very well in my hair, falling to waves again in less than an hour (even in the winter).</li>
            <li> I would think with any unit that gets this hot, you might experience trouble over time with it burning itself out if left on for extended periods of time.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I know the routine of patience, pull the flat iron slowly, use a heat protecting pretreatment, and all that, but with other irons (including a Chi), they just didn&#x27;t make it look like my stylist makes it look.</li>
            <li> Instead of drying out my hair as flat irons tend to do, that resulted in actually cramming moisture into the hair shaft.</li>
            <li> this is my 3rd wet/dry flat iron.</li>
            <li> My T3 Tourmaline Model 83922, will be my last flat iron ever!     </li>
            <li> then flat ironing it.     </li>
            <li> Really like the iron; but I am a little concerned about using this on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> It will not dry wet hair.</li>
            <li> the 2nd one (the pink one) did not last very long.</li>
            <li> I have bought several other irons, hoping to find one that will last.</li>
            <li> I prefer to air dry my hair and then flat iron it.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with it, which I&#x27;ve had with other flat irons (even ones in the salons), is that my hair is a bit staticky after using it.</li>
            <li> I have very curly thick hair</li>
            <li> My only other criticism is that I bought this on Dec. 1</li>
            <li> The wide plates make for fast time in straigntening thick long hair.</li>
            <li> and I have very long hair.</li>
            <li> I NEVER cleaned the plates and kept dropping it from my 4 ft high dresser onto hard tile.</li>
            <li> By May my hair was totally dry and frizzy, with tons of split ends.</li>
            <li> I can literally wash my hair, towel dry, and proceed to ironing.  </li>
            <li> Hey, in college, space is limited.</li>
            <li> It works on wet hair, but it will take a long time to actually dry and straighten it.</li>
            <li> But I kept using it (though not very often) for a few months because I had no other options.</li>
            <li> I never ever EVER use it on wet hair, but even on dry hair with heat protectant in it, it just seems to damage my hair.</li>
            <li> I like the fact you can use it while your hair is wet.</li>
            <li> I use it when my hair is wet (with leave-in conditioner applied).</li>
            <li> However, it will minimize damage if you do flatiron wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and a lot of it, but it only takes me about 30 minutes to dry my hair using a blow dryer and</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I immediately returned the iron from the other retailer and bought it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Then even if you bought this product elsewhere, their warranty terms are so restrictive, you have to fill out forms in a certain number of days, and also pay an expensive handling fee.</li>
            <li> Using this iron on damp hair not only makes me uncomfortable as it sounds as if it is frying my hair as it steams it dry (and my hairdresser told me NEVER use a flat iron on damp hair regardless if the manufacturer says it&#x27;s made to do it.</li>
            <li> that if done slowly like you&#x27;re supposed to, only takes one swipe over the hair, to straighten it.</li>
            <li> In fact I find it easier to start near the roots with a comb and then put the iron on behind the comb and pull them both down the hair together.</li>
            <li> Curling is a bad idea, for not only is it very drying</li>
            <li> and it takes me half the time</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> When your hair is dry, pull the iron through SLOWLY.</li>
            <li> It just frizzes and cause all the little ends to stick out.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, so you had to figure out that once it&#x27;s plugged in and you&#x27;ve adjusted the temperature, the little power button has to be pushed too (even though it doesn&#x27;t look like a button).    </li>
            <li> I have very coarse hair which admittedly has always been tough to straighten and get that sleek look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone slow enough to where this ironshould straighten in one pass but not too slow as to fry my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair, but soooo much of it that it looks really thick.</li>
            <li> Less then an year!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I accidently left it on all day and burned it out</li>
            <li> I use a small amount of the Biosilk and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li> Your hair will look as if you had an expensive blow dry.  </li>
            <li> It totally and effortlessly removes all frizz from my hair, which has never been done before except at a salon with a lot of time-consuming and painful tugging.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> And the manufacturer refused to stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> Bad service, Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not working all that well for me. :(      </li>
            <li> you wont be disappointed</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> The one thing that is slightly annoying is the fact that the rhinestones fall out of the handle.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product - I&#x27;m saving my money for a BaByliss or a Solia.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent product, very well done. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Well I posted in one of the comment sections that I&#x27;d post my review of this iron after using it for a bit, so here goes. I&#x27;m obviously in the minority but I&#x27;m not all that thrilled with this flat iron. I really wanted to be impressed but oh well...    I have very coarse hair which admittedly has always been tough to straighten and get that sleek look. My last iron was a brand called Maxium (I believe that was the brand). Unfortunately I accidently left it on all day and burned it out so I had to replace with something. I got the Maxium on HSN about 3-4 years ago and I actually loved it. It also reached over 400 degrees but the really nice thing was that one plate was covered in pins and the opposite plate had holes where the pins fit into. This resulted in seperating the strands of hair. I never had to press hard and it would glide easily through my hair and I have very long hair. It also had a \\&quot;well\\&quot; which held spring water and one press of the button would release a gentle and moisturizing steam. Instead of drying out my hair as flat irons tend to do, that resulted in actually cramming moisture into the hair shaft. I didn&#x27;t have to hold my hair taught and never had to go over a section of my hair more than once. My friend recommended that new Instyler, but I&#x27;ve read they are always breaking after only a few months and the temp is just not that hot. I need that higher temp.     As always with Amazon the shipping on the T3 was very fast. The rhinestones on the iron are a nice touch and I like that it goes over 400 and it heats up super fast. The plates do indeed glide easily through my hair. The protective  pad for my vanity was nice as well. That all being said, I don&#x27;t feel this iron does anywhere near the job that my old Maxium did. I have no problems with holding my hair taught. In fact I find it easier to start near the roots with a comb and then put the iron on behind the comb and pull them both down the hair together. I&#x27;ve gone slow enough to where this ironshould straighten in one pass but not too slow as to fry my hair. Since I&#x27;ve started using this iron I&#x27;ve actually noticed my hair is much drier and seems to be getting damaged, and yes, I do use a salon brand thermal protectant with this unit. This iron still doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair anywhere near what my Maxium did so it&#x27;s frustrating that it&#x27;s drying out my hair and yet failing to perfectly straighten it.    Perhaps it&#x27;s just my difficult hair as I purchased this unit because it had so many great reviews. Think I&#x27;ll sell this iron on eBay and try to find another Maxium. For all of you who love this iron I&#x27;m happy it works well on the majority of reviewers. It&#x27;s just not working all that well for me. :(      Oh, one more thing. Using this iron on damp hair not only makes me uncomfortable as it sounds as if it is frying my hair as it steams it dry (and my hairdresser told me NEVER use a flat iron on damp hair regardless if the manufacturer says it&#x27;s made to do it. I tried it once and noticed that it did not work well at all using it that way. I prefer to air dry my hair and then flat iron it. It comes out better for me but I really wanted to see how it worked on damp hair. Not too well in my case. Overall not too pleased with my results.</li>
            <li> I bought this in like February or March because my [...] Jilbere flat iron (which I pretty much loved) finally kicked the bucket - I NEVER cleaned the plates and kept dropping it from my 4 ft high dresser onto hard tile. Hey, in college, space is limited. Anyway. I bought this because it had superior reviews on [...]and I thought that for  [...]a bargain compared to buying it in the salon) it would work perfectly. Simply put, it doesn&#x27;t. I never ever EVER use it on wet hair, but even on dry hair with heat protectant in it, it just seems to damage my hair. Granted, my hair is pretty thick and coarse, but my old iron could make it smooth. This can&#x27;t. It just frizzes and cause all the little ends to stick out. What&#x27;s more, it doesn&#x27;t keep my hair straight. Within hours it starts to frizz and go back to being wavy. But I kept using it (though not very often) for a few months because I had no other options. By May my hair was totally dry and frizzy, with tons of split ends. I just stopped straightening and pulled it back. Very disappointed in this product - I&#x27;m saving my money for a BaByliss or a Solia. Bypass this and go for a cheaper one, you&#x27;ll get better results for half the price.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron out there!  I have fine very curly hair and have to constantly battle the frizz.  I&#x27;ve tried other irons before (i.e., maxiglide) and have found this to be the best option out there.  I can literally wash my hair, towel dry, and proceed to ironing.  When passed through wet hair, the iron steams out the water and creates a sizzling sound (however, it&#x27;s not burning the hair since it doesn&#x27;t smell like burned and because I&#x27;ve used it for 8 months and the condition of my hair has actually improved).  This iron leaves my hair looking very straight.  In fact, when I wear my hair curly (which is rare), people actually tell me that they thought my hair was straight all along.  My hair no longer gets frizzy. I live in Florida and even with the extreme humidity we have down here, my hair can stay nice and straight during a thunderstorm.  I use a small amount of the Biosilk and that&#x27;s it.  It is a bit pricey but most definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I love this iron. It dries hair to a sleek mirror finish.  At first the steam made me a little weary, but need not worry.  Your hair will look as if you had an expensive blow dry.  Happy I made this purchase.  Saves time and money. I have been using this for a while and have not noticed any damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> The speed with which my order was delivered was amazing.  The product was brand new and sealed...although it appears it may not be covered by the warranty because it was purchased through an Amazon seller (is this even legal??), I don&#x27;t care, as the price savings made it a very good value even if it would need to be repaired or replaced at my own cost...and considering the reviews and good warranty, I don&#x27;t expect I will have to use it.</li>
            <li> I got a good deal on the T3; however, it does not even compare to my Hot Tools flat iron.  The T3 is in storage.</li>
            <li> Its a good iron, but my hair is naturally curly so it takes forever to straighten it. I like the fact you can use it while your hair is wet.</li>
            <li> I love my T3.  My sister recommended it to me and I did not believe her until I tried it.  After I tried it, I got one of my own!</li>
            <li> I love this product!! my hair dresser used it on my hair and I had to get one. I love it!! This is by far the best flat iron, yes it is even better than the Chi. I have long thick hair and it takes me half the time and i get salon results!! you wont be disappointed</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron for long, medium-to-thick hair. The heat dial allows for good temperature control and at 375 I only need to pass my hair through once or twice. The one thing that is slightly annoying is the fact that the rhinestones fall out of the handle. This obviously does not affect the overall usablilty of the product. I just wish T3 would not put them on the handle in the first place.</li>
            <li> I love my new hair iron. Everytime I use it people ask me if I have just had my hair done at a salon. I use it when my hair is wet (with leave-in conditioner applied). So far my hair still feels and looks healthy. After I use the iron, my hair is shiny and silky. I love this product! My only lament is that I paid $200 for it at sephora</li>
            <li> Ok, this flat iron works really well. The only problem I have with it, which I&#x27;ve had with other flat irons (even ones in the salons), is that my hair is a bit staticky after using it. I&#x27;m going to try and buy some product for my hair that will help with this problem.     I have really thick hair and a lot of it, but it only takes me about 30 minutes to dry my hair using a blow dryer and then flat ironing it.     My only other criticism is that I bought this on Dec. 1 and when I was browsing Amazon on Dec. 6 - one day after I received it - Amazon cut the price by almost $20! I paid $95 for it and then it was $76! Bad service, Amazon. I don&#x27;t know how often I&#x27;ll keep shopping here if you&#x27;re just going to cut your prices after people purchase the items!</li>
            <li> this is my 3rd wet/dry flat iron. the 2nd one (the pink one) did not last very long. Less then an year! But the first one lasted almost 6 years. I have high hopes for this one! Quick shipping from the store, thx.</li>
            <li> This flat iron was everything that I was looking for:  -quick to heat up  -has multiple adjustable temperature settings  -gets hot enough to straighten my coarse hair    Just one thing that kind of hung me up at the beginning... I had no idea how to turn it on! It doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, so you had to figure out that once it&#x27;s plugged in and you&#x27;ve adjusted the temperature, the little power button has to be pushed too (even though it doesn&#x27;t look like a button).    Other than that, I totally recommend this iron! It works on wet hair, but it will take a long time to actually dry and straighten it. If you do straighten straight from the shower, make sure you use a leave in conditioner or it will look frizzy. Blow drying first will get the best results. When your hair is dry, pull the iron through SLOWLY. This will give you straighter hair in less time than a couple of short quick passes.    Enjoy!</li>
            <li> With such wide plates, this baby will smooth and flatten your hair in no time. It will not dry wet hair. However, it will minimize damage if you do flatiron wet hair. It doesn&#x27;t work miracles, but it prevents disasters. We&#x27;d all like to save time in the morning, but just as you can&#x27;t turn ice into vapor without creating water first, you can&#x27;t turn wet hair into straightened glossiness without blow drying first before flatironing. But if you&#x27;re going to straighten your damp locks anyway (80% dry is good enough, right?), might as well get this which has an avenue for some moisture to evaporate.</li>
            <li> Love this! Hair is super shiny after use. Because I have fine/wavy hair I have had to put it on a higher heat setting than the directions suggest.</li>
            <li> this is a great product,only one problem buying from amazon you cant register this for a warrenty,i hope i dont need it</li>
            <li> You buy this product thinking you are obtaining a quality product, for the price. Then 6 months later, it stops working. Very disappointing. I have bought several other irons, hoping to find one that will last. I decided to spend extra and overpay for this one hoping it would be better. It states that there is a 4 year warranty. No there is not. They clearly state that they will NOT warranty any product from Amazon. So this has no warranty. Then even if you bought this product elsewhere, their warranty terms are so restrictive, you have to fill out forms in a certain number of days, and also pay an expensive handling fee. Sorry. that&#x27;s useless. In th end, the unit simply stopped heating up, after only 6 months of use. And the manufacturer refused to stand behind their product. Just because I bought it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have never had a better straightening iron.  My daughters are always stealing it away from me.  Unless you want to share.  HIDE IT!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for x-mas 09 she loves it uses it every chance she can her friends love it as well one of them even bought one. she said it is the best one she ever tried she has had many flat irons and they all stop working fast this one is strong and you can even change the temp real plus. the price has gone up I got it for [...] bucks i think. still great for what you are buying.</li>
            <li> This straightener is wonderful. It works great with my hair, doesn&#x27;t fry it, and it actually gets it straight, and it stays for a long time. Definitely a must-have.</li>
            <li> I read about this straightener here: after mine stopped working. It is FANTASTIC and makes my hair silky and smooth and pin-straight in minutes, without drying it out. I have very thick hair and it&#x27;s a fantastic flatiron, definitely worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone looking for a straightener to use.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research about straightening irons and asked a couple of friends since I have never straightened my hair before.  I have very naturally curly hair and my hair stylist had this iron and used it on my hair a couple of times and I loved the result, so I wanted to get it to see if I could do it.  The first time I did it - it was perfect - I couldn&#x27;t believe it, I never thought that I could do it.  But I did and love it, now I have new look that I can actually do in 45 minutes.  Thanks!!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever write reviews, but I had to here! I have used many flat irons over the years, this one is the absolute best. A friend loaned me hers and I had to have one. A good thing after reading the many reviews here, they would have probably scared me off. I have very thin hair, but soooo much of it that it looks really thick. It is VERY wavy, without being curly at all, so I have to either flat iron it or curl it or it won&#x27;t look done. Curling is a bad idea, for not only is it very drying but it doesn&#x27;t hold very well in my hair, falling to waves again in less than an hour (even in the winter). Flat Ironing works much better.     Okay, so I know the routine of patience, pull the flat iron slowly, use a heat protecting pretreatment, and all that, but with other irons (including a Chi), they just didn&#x27;t make it look like my stylist makes it look. Which I knew meant that it had to be the iron, for I was using the same products that she was. Her flat iron runs about $600, great for her in her line of work, much too costly for my budget, there just simply has to be a better solution than that.     By the way, my stylist said, \\&quot;NEVER EVER put any hot styling tool to your hair unless it is absolutely positively dry, or you will ruin your hair over time, causing it to break and split, so I always either use a blow dryer or let my hair air dry (often overnight) before using a hot iron on it.    Finally an iron that gets warm enough that if done slowly like you&#x27;re supposed to, only takes one swipe over the hair, to straighten it. Even my stylist has to make two or three swipes! Better yet, it holds real well in the high humid temperatures found in the St Louis Metro area and this is the warmest summer on record.     All that said, I love the iron, its cord is long enough that I don&#x27;t have to stand on top of the outlet, the outside doesn&#x27;t get so hot that I can&#x27;t touch it, it doesn&#x27;t catch my hair and break it off at the plate edges. It makes my hair feel silky smooth and everyone comments on how healthy my hair looks. All of that with using a tool that heats to 410 degrees, wow! I am thrilled! Enough Said! My T3 Tourmaline Model 83922, will be my last flat iron ever!     I have been using a T3 for about 6 months now with no problems to the unit or my hair. It heats up VERY quickly, so I don&#x27;t need to leave it on for any length of time at all before actually using it, plugging it in just a minute or two before use. I would think with any unit that gets this hot, you might experience trouble over time with it burning itself out if left on for extended periods of time. Not to mention the damage it might do to your bathroom counter. No need here, it really does heat up quickly.     Welcome to the world of wonderful comments on your hair, and enjoy your new T3 Tourmaline,     Terri</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lent my older version of this product to my sister and friend, and they both wanted it immediately. It made a great birthday present for each of them.</li>
            <li> I had just purchased this iron from another retailer at over double this price when I saw this on Amazon.  I immediately returned the iron from the other retailer and bought it from Amazon.  And believe me, it would be worth double the price!  It totally and effortlessly removes all frizz from my hair, which has never been done before except at a salon with a lot of time-consuming and painful tugging.  This is a keeper!</li>
            <li> Really like the iron; but I am a little concerned about using this on wet hair.  Just the idea of the sizzling sound must be causing damage.  Hair even feels smooth and softer after using the iron.  The wide plates make for fast time in straigntening thick long hair.</li>
            <li> It is the best flat iron you will ever need. I have very curly thick hair and it makes it straight so no one knows I have curly hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent seller!!!</li>
