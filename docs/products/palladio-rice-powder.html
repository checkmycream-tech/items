            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this powder!</li>
            <li>This product works amazing for me</li>
            <li>It does provide a nice, matte finish.</li>
            <li>also this is nice for the t-zone...</li>
            <li>Covers shine and sets makeup all while blending nicely</li>
            <li>Smells nice though</li>
            <li>If you use a good brush with this powder, it would be a lot more even</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell, easy to use.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines and it has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>The powder is very fine and does not look cakey or visible.</li>
            <li>This powder is very light</li>
            <li>it offers very good coverage and seems to control oil somewhat.</li>
            <li>It also lasts no time and requires many reapplications.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and i would tend to get more after im done..</li>
            <li>Not necessarily the best coverage,</li>
            <li>but I recommend using this with a brush and using extra and it works great!</li>
            <li>Lovely powder that truly works for the paler girls.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always satisfied with this powder.</li>
            <li>I think a screw top would be a better option</li>
            <li>discovered some time ago, I love this powder.  </li>
            <li>OH, it also smells lovely.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>The powder itself is just ok</li>
            <li>Also if you&#x27;re planning to take this with you try using a hair tie to keep the top box in bottom box together</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>The powder itself is ok, but who the heck designed this package?</li>
            <li>And love the price.</li>
            <li>This is more like translucent tinted powder.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I came across this rice powder.</li>
            <li>The powder appears white almost like baby powder, but it blended to my pinkish skin tone perfectly and didn&#x27;t wash me out.</li>
            <li>I opted to apply it with a brush as opposed to the included powder press, and it has a nice, light cover.</li>
            <li>Make sure to put it on the T area if you have oily face like mine.</li>
            <li>I love this powder.</li>
            <li>and I love it to death.</li>
            <li>I have been using this to set my foundation and concealer, and even &amp;#34;bake&amp;#34; my highlights and contouring and love the way everything sets.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident this product will do the trick for my wedding. :)</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I love this powder, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 years.</li>
            <li>I love this powder -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to see better packaging though.</li>
            <li>The powder is good and well worth it if you can some how move the powder to another package  or if you don&#x27;t need it to travel with</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>The cute packaging is what originally attracted me to this!</li>
            <li>Pretty good for oily skin.</li>
            <li>First use was good, it defiantly controls oil like it claims.</li>
            <li>I was so excited!</li>
            <li>My lip color also stayed on my lips for a significantly longer period!</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t as good as the HD powder, but it works good enough for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>But so far I am happy with this one and would recommend to try if you haven&#x27;t tried rice powder before.</li>
            <li>I checked out so many higher end face setting powders and none of them impressed me because they left me looking cakey and</li>
            <li>I have no problem returning product, make it easy for me when its your mistake.</li>
            <li>My skin has been having problems and this has been absorbent and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>This shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>My eyeshadow looked pretty darn good at the end of the day, which is amazing especially since we&#x27;ve been having some warm humid weather here, plus I chase after a toddler all day.</li>
            <li>This would be fine if I could bring it with me for retouches at work</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d give this a try, since the price was right and the reviews looked pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Light and fine texture.</li>
            <li>I would not have purchased this if they had accurately described it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting used to it but prefer my powders to be scent free.</li>
            <li>I needed a light powder to cover my face when I&#x27;m not wearing sunscreen..  </li>
            <li>and it turns out to be cheap and capitalizing on those who think like me.  </li>
            <li>Great price and came earlier than it was supposed to!</li>
            <li>Works well, but I don&#x27;t like the box/non secure lid.</li>
            <li>and this is light weight.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to everyone who wants a nice setting powder</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite cheap for a lot of product.</li>
            <li>I enjoy doing my makeup</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably go to walmart and buy a cheap powder brush.</li>
            <li>Price is good, but this is a no-go for those of us with good skin who don&#x27;t want a heavy powder.</li>
            <li>So good for sensitive folks.</li>
            <li>but other than that it&#x27;s DEF worth a try!!!!!</li>
            <li>First time setting powder user, but love this.</li>
            <li>It has a light, clean scent (think baby powder) which is a tad strong at first, but it goes away within an hour or so after application.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this powder.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>I am an older woman who is very light complected.</li>
            <li>Anyway product has super cool logo, vintage looking logo.</li>
            <li>As far as loose powders go this is probably the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Let me start off by stating that no powder has ever been so effective at reducing the shine of my hopelessly oily facr, and I really have tried them all, from cheap brands to high end.</li>
            <li>SERIOUSLY ANOTHER HONEST REVIEW DELETED?!!!</li>
            <li>The only good part is that its really cheap and lasts a long time - makes a good setting powder for people with normal skin.</li>
            <li>I read about this powder on a blog then read a few great reviews and decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li>I really like the texture of the rice powder and it feels light when applied.</li>
            <li>Worth giving a try.</li>
            <li>and it actually smells nice.</li>
            <li>It feels light weight, smooth, and natural.</li>
            <li>Less is definitely more and as long as you don&#x27;t use too much you will look flawless.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy with the product and would highly recommend it for someone looking for a loose powder that is buildable, light, controls oil, sets makeup well and can also be used as a highlighter.  </li>
            <li>Will go right into the garbage where it belongs.</li>
            <li>really like the lightweight clean feel, and oil control.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, yes the little sponge thing is crappy, but who says you need to use it!  </li>
            <li>It has really helped me pull off a more natural look.</li>
            <li>This product really is translucent, I can feel it going on but that cakey feeling quickly goes away</li>
            <li>This powder helped me to do so, with a nice light finish, but I must say that it looks a bit too pale on me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gives a smooth, completely natural, and matte looking finish!</li>
            <li>I must say it worked pretty well the first day or 2, but then I guess my skin acclimated to it</li>
            <li>, it looks good when I first put it on in the morning but disappears after a few hours.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a top notch powder for a low cost.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, no silica, which is notorious for giving off white casts in flash photography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is also not travel-friendly as the lid just sits on top and is not secured.</li>
            <li>I also like to put on regular powder makeup on top of this translucent powder.</li>
            <li>The powder smells good and translucent version of this powder doesn&#x27;t make my skin too pale.</li>
            <li>it takes a little extra shipping time but products comes well packaged and it is a very good price.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend putting it into a more secure, little plastic container if you plan on carrying it with you.</li>
            <li>It keeps my face from getting very oily, makes my skin look soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>the ingredients aren&#x27;t all natural at all (like most natural products sold).</li>
            <li>I love this powder and have used for a long time.</li>
            <li>I have been using bare minerals and liked the results, but I wanted something to last longer and make my face look smoother.</li>
            <li>My skin is  super sensitive and prone to breakouts(not acne)</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I can see this product lasting a long time, so good value in my book...</li>
            <li>It cannot travel with you unless you put a rubber band around it, and even then, be careful when you take the lid off, this powder is very light, and will get everywhere.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It is VERY noticeable.</li>
            <li>Very nature looking and long-lasting oil control.</li>
            <li>Be carefull not to apply too much, or you could look like a ghost.</li>
            <li>Sets makeup (I used mineral powder by Clinique) just as it should but much cheaper than others on the market.</li>
            <li>really with powder cosmetics</li>
            <li>Works very well..</li>
            <li>(and I get very oily indeed)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very translucent and smells sort of like baby powder which I don&#x27;t have a problem with.</li>
            <li>The pad doesn&#x27;t hold powder very well</li>
            <li>I suppose it does what it&#x27;s intended to - a very lightweight translucent powder.</li>
            <li>I will still keep looking for the original white cake form of rice powder.</li>
            <li>I had to be very careful opening the top</li>
            <li>I love makeup and switch back and forth to try new things that come out, both professional products and drug-store.</li>
            <li>/&gt;powder is not heavy-and has a lovely slight fragrance that is very comforting to me.  </li>
            <li>One of those buys I consider a loss where I think it looks cool and want something different</li>
            <li>I do only give it four stars however because of all the parabens in the formula itself, but hey, it performs well so that may not even be a big deal for many.</li>
            <li>It comes in two colors mainly and it will blend on any type of skin tone that you have.</li>
            <li>My expectations might&#x27;ve been high.</li>
            <li>Works really nicely, doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry my skin and lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li>The powder itself is pretty good, the puff it comes with is useless.</li>
            <li>I normally doesn&#x27;t have skin issues.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply with a short big puffy brush.</li>
            <li>It was pretty much what I expected, messy to use and just ok for oil absorbing powers.</li>
            <li>live it</li>
            <li>This powder is silky smooth and only takes a tiny amount to set my foundation and concealer.  </li>
            <li>As a very fair-skinned woman (hijacking my boyfriend&#x27;s Amazon account), this powder matched my skin very well and was totally mattefying.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>completely removes my shine!</li>
            <li>but the compact is not travel friendly, it doesn&#x27;t clip shut and would definitely fall open in my bag.</li>
            <li>It makes my face look clear and smooth unlike any other powder I&#x27;ve had that made my skin look like a cake</li>
            <li>My skin felt really soft!</li>
            <li>The only problem of this powder is that it&#x27;s too loose and weighs too light.</li>
            <li>Just to be clear</li>
            <li>I have a really oily face and one application last goes about 4 hours before I start to see shine come through.</li>
            <li>I bought the translucent and I have light skin, green eyes.</li>
            <li>Its a cheap plastic box that doesn&#x27;t even have a way of closing except for gravity making it not portable and messy.  </li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t always shift so much, but that&#x27;s not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li>It smelled like perfume and old ladies wear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural face powder to cover up shine and seal in makeup.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really rate it since I got the blotting sheets instead of the actual powder.</li>
            <li>not bad to seal in all of my foundation and concealer but doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s the same as every other powder out there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a plastic box, with a lid that slides onto it, not tightly at all.</li>
            <li>this powder makes my face look a pretty pink-</li>
            <li>More importantly, trying to use it on a bare face is virtually impossible.  </li>
            <li>The box has small holes like most loose powders but does not come with a sticker or seal over them.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this powder after searching far and wide for some miracle to control my oily skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not pale white</li>
            <li>used this years ago when had makeup done by a professional and finally found it on Amazon</li>
            <li>Only reason I reduced a star is that it has sort of an old lady smell.</li>
            <li>Very matte finish, but lighter then expected.</li>
            <li>For the price I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much, but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to powders being too dark despite claims of being translucent, but this definitely hit the right mark for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s barely visible, unless your skin is already pretty dry, in which case the talc in this product will make dry spots visible, I recommend lotion.</li>
            <li>It really settles into creases and does not work well with other makeups.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t stain, but there will be powder all over the llacr , and it&#x27;ll be hard to clean up.</li>
            <li>The package is small enough to fit into a clutch for date nights and because I&#x27;m a teacher I also keep an extra container in my desk for touch-ups during the schoolday.  </li>

            <li> It does provide a nice, matte finish.</li>
            <li> also this is nice for the t-zone...</li>
            <li> Covers shine and sets makeup all while blending nicely</li>
            <li> Smells nice though</li>
            <li> If you use a good brush with this powder, it would be a lot more even</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell, easy to use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines and it has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> The powder is very fine and does not look cakey or visible.</li>
            <li> This powder is very light</li>
            <li> it offers very good coverage and seems to control oil somewhat.</li>
            <li> It also lasts no time and requires many reapplications.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and i would tend to get more after im done..</li>
            <li> Not necessarily the best coverage,</li>
            <li> but I recommend using this with a brush and using extra and it works great!</li>
            <li> Lovely powder that truly works for the paler girls.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always satisfied with this powder.</li>
            <li> I think a screw top would be a better option</li>
            <li> discovered some time ago, I love this powder.  </li>
            <li> OH, it also smells lovely.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> The powder itself is just ok</li>
            <li> Also if you&#x27;re planning to take this with you try using a hair tie to keep the top box in bottom box together</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> The powder itself is ok, but who the heck designed this package?</li>
            <li> And love the price.</li>
            <li> This is more like translucent tinted powder.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I came across this rice powder.</li>
            <li> The powder appears white almost like baby powder, but it blended to my pinkish skin tone perfectly and didn&#x27;t wash me out.</li>
            <li> I opted to apply it with a brush as opposed to the included powder press, and it has a nice, light cover.</li>
            <li> Make sure to put it on the T area if you have oily face like mine.</li>
            <li> I love this powder.</li>
            <li> and I love it to death.</li>
            <li> I have been using this to set my foundation and concealer, and even &amp;#34;bake&amp;#34; my highlights and contouring and love the way everything sets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident this product will do the trick for my wedding. :)</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I love this powder, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 years.</li>
            <li> I love this powder -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to see better packaging though.</li>
            <li> The powder is good and well worth it if you can some how move the powder to another package  or if you don&#x27;t need it to travel with</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> The cute packaging is what originally attracted me to this!</li>
            <li> Pretty good for oily skin.</li>
            <li> First use was good, it defiantly controls oil like it claims.</li>
            <li> I was so excited!</li>
            <li> My lip color also stayed on my lips for a significantly longer period!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t as good as the HD powder, but it works good enough for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> But so far I am happy with this one and would recommend to try if you haven&#x27;t tried rice powder before.</li>
            <li> I checked out so many higher end face setting powders and none of them impressed me because they left me looking cakey and</li>
            <li> I have no problem returning product, make it easy for me when its your mistake.</li>
            <li> My skin has been having problems and this has been absorbent and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> This shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> My eyeshadow looked pretty darn good at the end of the day, which is amazing especially since we&#x27;ve been having some warm humid weather here, plus I chase after a toddler all day.</li>
            <li> This would be fine if I could bring it with me for retouches at work</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this a try, since the price was right and the reviews looked pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Light and fine texture.</li>
            <li> I would not have purchased this if they had accurately described it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting used to it but prefer my powders to be scent free.</li>
            <li> I needed a light powder to cover my face when I&#x27;m not wearing sunscreen..  </li>
            <li> and it turns out to be cheap and capitalizing on those who think like me.  </li>
            <li> Great price and came earlier than it was supposed to!</li>
            <li> Works well, but I don&#x27;t like the box/non secure lid.</li>
            <li> and this is light weight.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone who wants a nice setting powder</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite cheap for a lot of product.</li>
            <li> I enjoy doing my makeup</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably go to walmart and buy a cheap powder brush.</li>
            <li> Price is good, but this is a no-go for those of us with good skin who don&#x27;t want a heavy powder.</li>
            <li> So good for sensitive folks.</li>
            <li> but other than that it&#x27;s DEF worth a try!!!!!</li>
            <li> First time setting powder user, but love this.</li>
            <li> It has a light, clean scent (think baby powder) which is a tad strong at first, but it goes away within an hour or so after application.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this powder.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> I am an older woman who is very light complected.</li>
            <li> Anyway product has super cool logo, vintage looking logo.</li>
            <li> As far as loose powders go this is probably the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by stating that no powder has ever been so effective at reducing the shine of my hopelessly oily facr, and I really have tried them all, from cheap brands to high end.</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY ANOTHER HONEST REVIEW DELETED?!!!</li>
            <li> The only good part is that its really cheap and lasts a long time - makes a good setting powder for people with normal skin.</li>
            <li> I read about this powder on a blog then read a few great reviews and decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I really like the texture of the rice powder and it feels light when applied.</li>
            <li> Worth giving a try.</li>
            <li> and it actually smells nice.</li>
            <li> It feels light weight, smooth, and natural.</li>
            <li> Less is definitely more and as long as you don&#x27;t use too much you will look flawless.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy with the product and would highly recommend it for someone looking for a loose powder that is buildable, light, controls oil, sets makeup well and can also be used as a highlighter.  </li>
            <li> Will go right into the garbage where it belongs.</li>
            <li> really like the lightweight clean feel, and oil control.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, yes the little sponge thing is crappy, but who says you need to use it!  </li>
            <li> It has really helped me pull off a more natural look.</li>
            <li> This product really is translucent, I can feel it going on but that cakey feeling quickly goes away</li>
            <li> This powder helped me to do so, with a nice light finish, but I must say that it looks a bit too pale on me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gives a smooth, completely natural, and matte looking finish!</li>
            <li> I must say it worked pretty well the first day or 2, but then I guess my skin acclimated to it</li>
            <li> , it looks good when I first put it on in the morning but disappears after a few hours.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a top notch powder for a low cost.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, no silica, which is notorious for giving off white casts in flash photography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is also not travel-friendly as the lid just sits on top and is not secured.</li>
            <li> I also like to put on regular powder makeup on top of this translucent powder.</li>
            <li> The powder smells good and translucent version of this powder doesn&#x27;t make my skin too pale.</li>
            <li> it takes a little extra shipping time but products comes well packaged and it is a very good price.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend putting it into a more secure, little plastic container if you plan on carrying it with you.</li>
            <li> It keeps my face from getting very oily, makes my skin look soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> the ingredients aren&#x27;t all natural at all (like most natural products sold).</li>
            <li> I love this powder and have used for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using bare minerals and liked the results, but I wanted something to last longer and make my face look smoother.</li>
            <li> My skin is  super sensitive and prone to breakouts(not acne)</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I can see this product lasting a long time, so good value in my book...</li>
            <li> It cannot travel with you unless you put a rubber band around it, and even then, be careful when you take the lid off, this powder is very light, and will get everywhere.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It is VERY noticeable.</li>
            <li> Very nature looking and long-lasting oil control.</li>
            <li> Be carefull not to apply too much, or you could look like a ghost.</li>
            <li> Sets makeup (I used mineral powder by Clinique) just as it should but much cheaper than others on the market.</li>
            <li> really with powder cosmetics</li>
            <li> Works very well..</li>
            <li> (and I get very oily indeed)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very translucent and smells sort of like baby powder which I don&#x27;t have a problem with.</li>
            <li> The pad doesn&#x27;t hold powder very well</li>
            <li> I suppose it does what it&#x27;s intended to - a very lightweight translucent powder.</li>
            <li> I will still keep looking for the original white cake form of rice powder.</li>
            <li> I had to be very careful opening the top</li>
            <li> I love makeup and switch back and forth to try new things that come out, both professional products and drug-store.</li>
            <li> /&gt;powder is not heavy-and has a lovely slight fragrance that is very comforting to me.  </li>
            <li> One of those buys I consider a loss where I think it looks cool and want something different</li>
            <li> I do only give it four stars however because of all the parabens in the formula itself, but hey, it performs well so that may not even be a big deal for many.</li>
            <li> It comes in two colors mainly and it will blend on any type of skin tone that you have.</li>
            <li> My expectations might&#x27;ve been high.</li>
            <li> Works really nicely, doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry my skin and lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> The powder itself is pretty good, the puff it comes with is useless.</li>
            <li> I normally doesn&#x27;t have skin issues.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply with a short big puffy brush.</li>
            <li> It was pretty much what I expected, messy to use and just ok for oil absorbing powers.</li>
            <li> live it</li>
            <li> This powder is silky smooth and only takes a tiny amount to set my foundation and concealer.  </li>
            <li> As a very fair-skinned woman (hijacking my boyfriend&#x27;s Amazon account), this powder matched my skin very well and was totally mattefying.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> completely removes my shine!</li>
            <li> but the compact is not travel friendly, it doesn&#x27;t clip shut and would definitely fall open in my bag.</li>
            <li> It makes my face look clear and smooth unlike any other powder I&#x27;ve had that made my skin look like a cake</li>
            <li> My skin felt really soft!</li>
            <li> The only problem of this powder is that it&#x27;s too loose and weighs too light.</li>
            <li> Just to be clear</li>
            <li> I have a really oily face and one application last goes about 4 hours before I start to see shine come through.</li>
            <li> I bought the translucent and I have light skin, green eyes.</li>
            <li> Its a cheap plastic box that doesn&#x27;t even have a way of closing except for gravity making it not portable and messy.  </li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t always shift so much, but that&#x27;s not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> It smelled like perfume and old ladies wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural face powder to cover up shine and seal in makeup.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really rate it since I got the blotting sheets instead of the actual powder.</li>
            <li> not bad to seal in all of my foundation and concealer but doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s the same as every other powder out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a plastic box, with a lid that slides onto it, not tightly at all.</li>
            <li> this powder makes my face look a pretty pink-</li>
            <li> More importantly, trying to use it on a bare face is virtually impossible.  </li>
            <li> The box has small holes like most loose powders but does not come with a sticker or seal over them.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this powder after searching far and wide for some miracle to control my oily skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not pale white</li>
            <li> used this years ago when had makeup done by a professional and finally found it on Amazon</li>
            <li> Only reason I reduced a star is that it has sort of an old lady smell.</li>
            <li> Very matte finish, but lighter then expected.</li>
            <li> For the price I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to powders being too dark despite claims of being translucent, but this definitely hit the right mark for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s barely visible, unless your skin is already pretty dry, in which case the talc in this product will make dry spots visible, I recommend lotion.</li>
            <li> It really settles into creases and does not work well with other makeups.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t stain, but there will be powder all over the llacr , and it&#x27;ll be hard to clean up.</li>
            <li> The package is small enough to fit into a clutch for date nights and because I&#x27;m a teacher I also keep an extra container in my desk for touch-ups during the schoolday.  </li>
            <li> why pay so much for something so simple and plain.</li>
            <li> The boxy packaging is small and not good for traveling unless you tape it or want the whole box full of powder in your make up bag.</li>
            <li> During these tough economic times I don&#x27;t plan to spend a whole lot on a loose powder.</li>
            <li> DO NOT APPLY NEAR BLACK CLOTHING, such as setting it on your lap while appying, or letting it fall onto your shirt.</li>
            <li> Will last you a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only con is that it has a very loose cap so it could easily open if you carry it around in your make up bag</li>
            <li> This does not mattify, this does not look good, I was very unhappy with the way this powder worked.</li>
            <li> If I were to find a similar product with different packaging, I would probably purchase the other product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone with oily skin that has trouble with shine!</li>
            <li> And during these summer months of humid New England weather, I find myself less shiny and less likely to touch-up throughout the day when using this powder.</li>
            <li> so you need to be careful when you open it up (it will spill).</li>
            <li> Certainly would not advise carrying it in your handbag for touch ups, but if you want to take it with you travelling, you can put it in a little plastic bag, wrap/fold the excess plastic around it tightly and keep it in place with a rubber band.</li>
            <li> The only difference is this has a little rice powder mixed in.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lasts for a very long time and it keeps my skin shine-free.</li>
            <li> I have to be very careful how to brush it on because it will tend to cake just like regular face powder.</li>
            <li> The closest thing I have found to L&#x27;oreal translucent loose powder.</li>
            <li> and it gets REALLY loose</li>
            <li> One container lasts about 1 and a half years with daily use.</li>
            <li> I never used the puff because I prefer to use my brush, and I always end up doing such a mess when I apply</li>
            <li> I gave 4 out of 5 stars because I found the container cannot contain the powder well and causes a fall-out mess on my counter every time I open and close the case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting married next month and was desperate to find something that will keep my makeup in place for the big day.</li>
            <li> The puff is useable but the whole box is just a horrible idea, it comes open so easily and dumps all the powder out.</li>
            <li> but it only takes a little to cover my face &amp; lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last me.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the actual package.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt calify to return it back so wasted my money..</li>
            <li> I use it after I put on foundation to lock everything in, not really for color purposes</li>
            <li> powder sticks on with absolutely no residue.</li>
            <li> I really like how thin it goes on.</li>
            <li> I am 44 years old with some forehead oiliness (due to getting bangs), and never liked liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li> Other commercial products are heavy, off color, and cake.</li>
            <li> Will order again once I run out even though a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My package did not state talc as one of the ingredients, as one reviewer mentioned, nor did it mention magnesium silicate or soapstone (other terms for talc).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like any other powder.</li>
            <li> The powder puff included is pretty useless</li>
            <li> other points to note, however: ingredients.</li>
            <li> The list of ingredients is comparable to every other powder out there.</li>
            <li> With that being said, I still need to blot my face 2x a day as I have extremely oily skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing nothing, however that is not uncommon for most of the finishing powders I have used.</li>
            <li> Does the same as an expensive powder would...reduces shine, sets makeup, powder is super thin so won&#x27;t build up or won&#x27;t get cakey.</li>
            <li> The only thing is when you are done it have that hard clay mask feeling but eventually it wares off.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way, I&#x27;ve had mine for a little over a year now, and I&#x27;m just now running out.</li>
            <li> The package sucks too - definitely not for carrying unless you put it into a plastic baggy.</li>
            <li> Haha life is silly that way.</li>
            <li> If your careful it isn&#x27;t messy.  </li>
            <li> I feel let down by product.</li>
            <li> Other then that, I like it!</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff because I have oily skin, and I wanted to find something less expensive and better than the expensive powder I&#x27;ve been using for years.</li>
            <li> not worth the waste of time.</li>
            <li> I was unhappy with the expensive loose powder I was currently using and the price point made this worth a try.  </li>
            <li> It cakes up a little bit in creases about halfway through the day, but all I have to do is dab it with my finger and it de-clumps.</li>
            <li> Also I used a kabuki brush to apply instead of the little pad it comes</li>
            <li> There is a lot of powder in this little box too.</li>
            <li> but I hate spending so much time on it when often days it rubs off half way through (especially my eyeshadow).</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll update this is a few weeks to test if it causes me to break out or not.</li>
            <li> It came packaged a bit poorly, but it wasn&#x27;t too upsetting since I expect a bit of a mess from loose powders.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered this and for some ungodly reason received blotting tissues!?!?!?</li>
            <li> it is like what the description says.</li>
            <li> This does not mattify, this does not look good, I was very unhappy with the way this powder worked. It really settles into creases and does not work well with other makeups.  More importantly, trying to use it on a bare face is virtually impossible.  It also lasts no time and requires many reapplications.&lt;br /&gt;Just not worth the waste of time.</li>
            <li> used this years ago when had makeup done by a professional and finally found it on Amazon I was so excited! I love this product! Makes me look 10 years younger!</li>
            <li> Bought this after reading about it on a site for oily skin. It does provide a nice, matte finish. Only reason I reduced a star is that it has sort of an old lady smell. I&#x27;m getting used to it but prefer my powders to be scent free.</li>
            <li> This tranlucent powder is the best under the eyes applying this powder after your concealer is gonna give you a smooth finish and its not gonna cake up under the eyes also this is nice for the t-zone...I love it and i would tend to get more after im done..</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years. Unlike another reviewer mine has never had talc as an ingredient. I am an older woman who is very light complected. Other commercial products are heavy, off color, and cake. On me this product does none of these things.</li>
            <li> Price is good, but this is a no-go for those of us with good skin who don&#x27;t want a heavy powder. VERY heavy coverage, even when applied with a brush because it contains talc. Will go right into the garbage where it belongs.</li>
            <li> It was not powder, but wipes.</li>
            <li> ***OMG!!! SERIOUSLY ANOTHER HONEST REVIEW DELETED?!!!*** UGH. Purchased product at local Asian Market after seller sent blogging tissues instead &amp; Amazon further aggravated me by asking me to return product via ups store. On my time &amp; dime. I have no problem returning product, make it easy for me when its your mistake. Thanks. Anyway product has super cool logo, vintage looking logo. That&#x27;s the awesome plus. Idk if bitterness dribbled into product, but I feel that it is a product w no specialiness to it. I can get this type of product at Rite Aid, Walgreens, or Longs Drugstore. My expectations might&#x27;ve been high. I feel let down by product.</li>
            <li> Not necessarily the best coverage, but I recommend using this with a brush and using extra and it works great!</li>
            <li> Covers shine and sets makeup all while blending nicely, you can&#x27;t even tell there&#x27;s anything on your face. It&#x27;s perfect for a no makeup makeup-look. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> completely removes my shine! live it</li>
            <li> It did keep the shine away but after about a week I started to notice myself breaking out. So I stopped and started using a different product to see if this was my problem. And it doesn&#x27;t last all day, blotting was still required.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by stating that no powder has ever been so effective at reducing the shine of my hopelessly oily facr, and I really have tried them all, from cheap brands to high end. A little goes a very long way, I&#x27;ve had mine for a little over a year now, and I&#x27;m just now running out. It seems to reduce redness, and keeps shine off my skin and sets foundation for hours, and I actually mean hours, 5-6 for me. It&#x27;s barely visible, unless your skin is already pretty dry, in which case the talc in this product will make dry spots visible, I recommend lotion. I do only give it four stars however because of all the parabens in the formula itself, but hey, it performs well so that may not even be a big deal for many. Also, what I dislike the most about this product is the packaging, god awful. It&#x27;s a plastic box, with a lid that slides onto it, not tightly at all. It cannot travel with you unless you put a rubber band around it, and even then, be careful when you take the lid off, this powder is very light, and will get everywhere. BEWARE: DO NOT APPLY NEAR BLACK CLOTHING, such as setting it on your lap while appying, or letting it fall onto your shirt. It is VERY noticeable. It won&#x27;t stain, but there will be powder all over the llacr , and it&#x27;ll be hard to clean up. It is a very messy product. I would recommend putting it into a more secure, little plastic container if you plan on carrying it with you.</li>
            <li> Lovely powder that truly works for the paler girls.  I&#x27;m used to powders being too dark despite claims of being translucent, but this definitely hit the right mark for me.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this powder after searching far and wide for some miracle to control my oily skin. I read about this powder on a blog then read a few great reviews and decided to purchase it. I must say it worked pretty well the first day or 2, but then I guess my skin acclimated to it and it has been as oily as always (if not more oily). The package sucks too - definitely not for carrying unless you put it into a plastic baggy. The only good part is that its really cheap and lasts a long time - makes a good setting powder for people with normal skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I got it in translucent so it would be similar to the mineral veil I also use.  I can layer it without looking like I&#x27;m preparing for a clown act.  It lasts for a very long time and it keeps my skin shine-free.</li>
            <li> Very good but perhaps a bit drying</li>
            <li> Very nature looking and long-lasting oil control.</li>
            <li> The closest thing I have found to L&#x27;oreal translucent loose powder. Works perfectly with my fair skin. Also, I have used this product every day for 4 months &amp; still have a ton left.</li>
            <li> Very matte finish, but lighter then expected. Be carefull not to apply too much, or you could look like a ghost.</li>
            <li> I love this powder and have used for a long time. I&#x27;m always satisfied with this powder. The only problem of this powder is that it&#x27;s too loose and weighs too light. Every time I use this powder, the powder keeps flying all over the space and I can see the powder flies in a shape of smoke, so every time I use, I hold my breath.</li>
            <li> I needed a light powder to cover my face when I&#x27;m not wearing sunscreen..  This rice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;powder is not heavy-and has a lovely slight fragrance that is very comforting to me.  I have Rosacea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and this powder makes my face look a pretty pink-instead of like an ill tomato.</li>
            <li> This little box lasted me eight months (January 2013- now)! It is perfect for its price and I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> This product works great and does what its suppose to do, absorb the oil on my face. I have a really oily face and one application last goes about 4 hours before I start to see shine come through. My only complain is that the box is so TINY . I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last me.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something that was different in my make up routine. My skin has been having problems and this has been absorbent and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Although this information is omitted from the ad page (as of the time of this writing), when you actually receive the product the label lists talc as the third ingredient.  I would not have purchased this if they had accurately described it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not translucent. It&#x27;s white. Ashy white. I hate it. I&#x27;m trying to find a use for it...maybe on my lids to mattify when they get a bit oily and I need to apply lashes.</li>
            <li> With scented talc And parabens and its too messy !! It doesnt calify to return it back so wasted my money..</li>
            <li> This powder was recommended to me by a friend.  I was unhappy with the expensive loose powder I was currently using and the price point made this worth a try.  I LOVE this powder!  I have very oily skin and have trouble with shiny spots and also with caking whenever I attempt to touch up those shiny spots.  This powder is silky smooth and only takes a tiny amount to set my foundation and concealer.  It doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines and it has a pleasant smell.  The package is small enough to fit into a clutch for date nights and because I&#x27;m a teacher I also keep an extra container in my desk for touch-ups during the schoolday.  I have applied this powder with a brush and with a puff and prefer the puff for under my eyes and a brush for the rest of my face.  This is excellent for oil control, the price is awesome and not much product is needed to get the job done.  My only complaint would be the actual package.  The box has small holes like most loose powders but does not come with a sticker or seal over them.  I had to be very careful opening the top but still a lot of the powder \\&quot;poofed\\&quot; out.  I think a screw top would be a better option but then, of course, that might affect the price.  Overall I am very happy with the product and would highly recommend it for someone looking for a loose powder that is buildable, light, controls oil, sets makeup well and can also be used as a highlighter.  My package did not state talc as one of the ingredients, as one reviewer mentioned, nor did it mention magnesium silicate or soapstone (other terms for talc). I can only assume the product I received was a talc-free product.  [[ASIN:B001ADUC1I Palladio Powder: Translucent RP02]]</li>
            <li> Great powder to set your makeup with. Will order again once I run out even though a little goes a long way. Translucent as it states on the package.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a cost savings to the Make Up Forever HD Powder.  This isn&#x27;t as good as the HD powder, but it works good enough for a fraction of the cost. I will very likely buy again.</li>
            <li> The cute packaging is what originally attracted me to this! The powder itself is pretty good, the puff it comes with is useless. Wish it didn&#x27;t contain talc.</li>
            <li> discovered some time ago, I love this powder.  it takes a little extra shipping time but products comes well packaged and it is a very good price.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great to control my oily skin and the quality for that price is just amazing! Only con is that it has a very loose cap so it could easily open if you carry it around in your make up bag or maybe it&#x27;s just mine....but other than that it&#x27;s DEF worth a try!!!!!</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this a try, since the price was right and the reviews looked pretty good.  It was pretty much what I expected, messy to use and just ok for oil absorbing powers.</li>
            <li> First time setting powder user, but love this. Light and fine texture. Easy to apply with a short big puffy brush. Sets makeup (I used mineral powder by Clinique) just as it should but much cheaper than others on the market. Worth giving a try. No sent or color. So good for sensitive folks.</li>
            <li> Works really nicely, doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry my skin and lasts for a very long time. I suggest tilting your head back during application to minimize fallout on your clothes. It cakes up a little bit in creases about halfway through the day, but all I have to do is dab it with my finger and it de-clumps. I use it over BB cream. The clumping will probably decrease once I start using a primer as well. OH, it also smells lovely.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try rice powder and I love it. I am 44 years old with some forehead oiliness (due to getting bangs), and never liked liquid foundation.  I have been using bare minerals and liked the results, but I wanted something to last longer and make my face look smoother. This stuff is great, yes the little sponge thing is crappy, but who says you need to use it!  I bought the translucent and I have light skin, green eyes. It&#x27;s great as a foundation with blush !</li>
            <li> The powder itself is just ok, it looks good when I first put it on in the morning but disappears after a few hours. This would be fine if I could bring it with me for retouches at work but the compact is not travel friendly, it doesn&#x27;t clip shut and would definitely fall open in my bag. Also the little pad they give you is basically useless, I have to use a brush to get any powder on my face. For the price I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much, but really with powder cosmetics it seems that a locking, or fully closing case is paramount because of spilling.</li>
            <li> I needed a powder to help me fight greasiness in my T-Zone. This powder helped me to do so, with a nice light finish, but I must say that it looks a bit too pale on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package needs serious improvement, it is not convenient at all, it is a box with some little holes in it to use with a puff. I never used the puff because I prefer to use my brush, and I always end up doing such a mess when I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very nice and feminine.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, I can&#x27;t not use this in my everyday makeup routine!</li>
            <li> Its a cheap plastic box that doesn&#x27;t even have a way of closing except for gravity making it not portable and messy.  One of those buys I consider a loss where I think it looks cool and want something different and it turns out to be cheap and capitalizing on those who think like me.  Out of the three powders I bought, I ended up with Maybelline.</li>
            <li> As far as loose powders go this is probably the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Just to be clear I use it after I put on foundation to lock everything in, not really for color purposes so I got the Translucent. Also I used a kabuki brush to apply instead of the little pad it comes with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This powder sticks on with absolutely no residue. It helps keep my make-up locked in all day and it actually smells nice. There is a lot of powder in this little box too. The only downside is I travel with this powder and it gets REALLY loose so you need to be careful when you open it up (it will spill). Also if you&#x27;re planning to take this with you try using a hair tie to keep the top box in bottom box together so it doesn&#x27;t spill everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a top notch powder for a low cost. I would have given it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t always shift so much, but that&#x27;s not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like any other powder. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s different besides the ingredients. The powder didn&#x27;t seem any different to me but the smell was definately different. I love the smell. It&#x27;s made out of rice paper and it smells so good.</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff because I have oily skin, and I wanted to find something less expensive and better than the expensive powder I&#x27;ve been using for years. I read great reviews of this powder, so I tried it, and it works!</li>
            <li> I really like how thin it goes on. Great setting powder!</li>
            <li> The powder itself is ok, but who the heck designed this package? If you buy this, prepare to put it in another container or carry it in a ziplock. The lid doesn&#x27;t stay on at all... bad design flaw.</li>
            <li> I love this powder! It keeps my face from getting very oily, makes my skin look soft and smooth. Great price and came earlier than it was supposed to!</li>
            <li> I ordered translucent rice powder but received rice blotting paper.</li>
            <li> I like how it sets my makeup. The only thing is when you are done it have that hard clay mask feeling but eventually it wares off. Other then that, I like it!</li>
            <li> Great product that delivers its promise to keep shine away from the face. It feels light weight, smooth, and natural.</li>
            <li> This product works amazing for me and I have SEVERE oily skin..This stuff keeps my makeup on and prevents shine for hours..If you are worried about looking cakey get it in translucent. Its practically invisible. And love the price. Highly recommend for anyone with oily skin that has trouble with shine!</li>
            <li> Not what I was looking for. I am trying to replace a white translucent rice powder that came in cake form from Japan. This is more like translucent tinted powder. I have to be very careful how to brush it on because it will tend to cake just like regular face powder. I will still keep looking for the original white cake form of rice powder.</li>
            <li> Works well, but I don&#x27;t like the box/non secure lid.</li>
            <li> During these tough economic times I don&#x27;t plan to spend a whole lot on a loose powder. Unbelievable to see how expensive name brand powders are...why pay so much for something so simple and plain. I am so glad I came across this rice powder. Does the same as an expensive powder would...reduces shine, sets makeup, powder is super thin so won&#x27;t build up or won&#x27;t get cakey. I hightly recommend. Try it and compare for yourself. Will last you a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: I use a face brush to apply, I don&#x27;t like the sponge it comes with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased mine from a Sally Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li> not bad to seal in all of my foundation and concealer but doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> I think it does the job BUT i just couldnt stand the smell. It smelled like perfume and old ladies wear. lol..</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this powder. After a couple of hours my face still gets just as oily as it did before I started using this product. Smells nice though</li>
            <li> My skin is  super sensitive and prone to breakouts(not acne) I think the talc or something in this irritated my skin badly. I ordered only because it had \\&quot;rice powder\\&quot; in it which is SUPPOSED to be natural-read the label the ingredients aren&#x27;t all natural at all (like most natural products sold). And it was flaky!!!!!!!!! people use this as MAKE-UP????? Horrible.</li>
            <li> Works very well.. gives u a polished look.. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> Pretty good for oily skin.</li>
            <li> This shipped very quickly. I have super sensitive skin and this is light weight. It has really helped me pull off a more natural look. The powder appears white almost like baby powder, but it blended to my pinkish skin tone perfectly and didn&#x27;t wash me out. I don&#x27;t carry makeup in my purse bc I find it messes up the quality, but this is definitely not packaged in a way to be considered a carry-along. I find I don&#x27;t need touch ups with this either so it&#x27;s really not a big deal. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I received blotting tissues instead of my powder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural face powder to cover up shine and seal in makeup.  I really like the texture of the rice powder and it feels light when applied.</li>
            <li> This powder is very light so it doesn&#x27;t cake up on your face, it keeps me matte and I have oily skin. I recommend this to everyone who wants a nice setting powder</li>
            <li> This product does all I need it to do as a finishing powder -- set my foundation, control shine (and I get very oily indeed) look flawless and smooth. The powder is very fine and does not look cakey or visible. It&#x27;s quite cheap for a lot of product. The powder puff included is pretty useless so I use a fluffy brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other points to note, however: ingredients. From my packaging, it has talc as the 3rd ingredient, and parabens and fragrance lower in the list. If you don&#x27;t like these ingredients, then now you know. Personally I&#x27;m indifferent. On the plus side, no silica, which is notorious for giving off white casts in flash photography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is also not travel-friendly as the lid just sits on top and is not secured. Certainly would not advise carrying it in your handbag for touch ups, but if you want to take it with you travelling, you can put it in a little plastic bag, wrap/fold the excess plastic around it tightly and keep it in place with a rubber band. No spillage.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  If your careful it isn&#x27;t messy.  I have oily skin but it only takes a little to cover my face &amp; lasts all day.</li>
            <li> As a very fair-skinned woman (hijacking my boyfriend&#x27;s Amazon account), this powder matched my skin very well and was totally mattefying. I opted to apply it with a brush as opposed to the included powder press, and it has a nice, light cover. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing nothing, however that is not uncommon for most of the finishing powders I have used. It came packaged a bit poorly, but it wasn&#x27;t too upsetting since I expect a bit of a mess from loose powders. It has a light, clean scent (think baby powder) which is a tad strong at first, but it goes away within an hour or so after application. Overall, I like this product and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. It is the best powder.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. The list of ingredients is comparable to every other powder out there. The only difference is this has a little rice powder mixed in.&lt;br /&gt;It works, it&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s the same as every other powder out there.</li>
            <li> I heard someone mentioning that this made their face cakey but I think they did something wrong with it. If you use a good brush with this powder, it would be a lot more even and it is not cakey at all for me. I like the way it smells too. It definitely reduces the oil on my face throughout the day. Make sure to put it on the T area if you have oily face like mine. I also like to put on regular powder makeup on top of this translucent powder.</li>
            <li> I love this powder. Its translucent and helps control oil and shine. I use it everyday and a little goes a long way. Definitely a great purchase and I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> really like the lightweight clean feel, and oil control. would be good for ance prone skin, oily skin, prevents shine all day at work,</li>
            <li> I checked out so many higher end face setting powders and none of them impressed me because they left me looking cakey and ghostly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this powder and purchased it on a whim and I love it to death. It&#x27;s very translucent and smells sort of like baby powder which I don&#x27;t have a problem with. Less is definitely more and as long as you don&#x27;t use too much you will look flawless.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really rate it since I got the blotting sheets instead of the actual powder. I&#x27;ve used them but I wasn&#x27;t expecting to receive the blotting sheets.</li>
            <li> Love it! Gives a smooth, completely natural, and matte looking finish!</li>
            <li> I have been using this to set my foundation and concealer, and even &amp;#34;bake&amp;#34; my highlights and contouring and love the way everything sets. I have combination oily skin, meaning my pores are larger in my T-zone area. And during these summer months of humid New England weather, I find myself less shiny and less likely to touch-up throughout the day when using this powder. I love makeup and switch back and forth to try new things that come out, both professional products and drug-store. I think the quality for the price matches. I gave 4 out of 5 stars because I found the container cannot contain the powder well and causes a fall-out mess on my counter every time I open and close the case. I would recommend different packaging for the manufacturer. I also do not use the square powder puff applicator, as I prefer to use a powder brush, but I keep the applicator in case to control the amount of spillage that comes through the holes of the case. If I were to find a similar product with different packaging, I would probably purchase the other product. But so far I am happy with this one and would recommend to try if you haven&#x27;t tried rice powder before.</li>
            <li> I enjoy doing my makeup but I hate spending so much time on it when often days it rubs off half way through (especially my eyeshadow). I&#x27;m getting married next month and was desperate to find something that will keep my makeup in place for the big day. Well I received this product this week, and let me tell you.. My eyeshadow looked pretty darn good at the end of the day, which is amazing especially since we&#x27;ve been having some warm humid weather here, plus I chase after a toddler all day. My lip color also stayed on my lips for a significantly longer period! I&#x27;m confident this product will do the trick for my wedding. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not pale white but I&#x27;m not the tannest either. This product really is translucent, I can feel it going on but that cakey feeling quickly goes away (I&#x27;m assuming after the product sets). The pad isn&#x27;t the greatest, but its done the job just fine. I&#x27;ll probably go to walmart and buy a cheap powder brush. I can see this product lasting a long time, so good value in my book...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an actor and singer and I have to wear make-up when I perform and I used to always use baby powder as a setting powder and my friend that was doing a show with me showed me this and I love it and I buy this all the time...I love this</li>
            <li> I love this powder! It makes my face look clear and smooth unlike any other powder I&#x27;ve had that made my skin look like a cake</li>
            <li> I love this powder, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 years. One container lasts about 1 and a half years with daily use. I have very sensitive skin and I don&#x27;t have an issue with this product at all. Also, if you&#x27;re looking for an eyeliner try their liquid eyeliner, it&#x27;s to die for.</li>
            <li> Bought it for oil shine control. It does work for shine control. But it cause pimples. I normally doesn&#x27;t have skin issues. After three days of using I break out like crazy. Once stop for three days the break out went away. Will never buy again.</li>
            <li> I consider this a setting powder since it&#x27;s transparent and it&#x27;s good to use after putting on your foundation. It comes in two colors mainly and it will blend on any type of skin tone that you have. Doesn&#x27;t matter if your the lightest or the darkest skin tone.</li>
            <li> I love this powder - it offers very good coverage and seems to control oil somewhat. With that being said, I still need to blot my face 2x a day as I have extremely oily skin. The powder smells good and translucent version of this powder doesn&#x27;t make my skin too pale. I&#x27;d love to see better packaging though. The pad doesn&#x27;t hold powder very well (powder keeps falling off) and the box is not that attractive looking IMO</li>
            <li> I bought this as a shine reducer. First use was good, it defiantly controls oil like it claims. Pleasant smell, easy to use. I&#x27;ll update this is a few weeks to test if it causes me to break out or not.</li>
            <li> After trying out this powder multiple times, I&#x27;ve come to realize that I don&#x27;t need it. Haha life is silly that way. I suppose it does what it&#x27;s intended to - a very lightweight translucent powder.</li>
            <li> The boxy packaging is small and not good for traveling unless you tape it or want the whole box full of powder in your make up bag. The puff is useable but the whole box is just a horrible idea, it comes open so easily and dumps all the powder out. The powder is good and well worth it if you can some how move the powder to another package  or if you don&#x27;t need it to travel with and it can sit upright on your bathroom counter undisturbed.</li>
            <li> My skin felt really soft! Love it</li>
