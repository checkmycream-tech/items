            <li>Keep up the amazing work, L&#x27;Oreal!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>So i decided to give this L&#x27;oreal serum a try and ITS AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I really loved this product it made a great change on my face within 2 days..</li>
            <li>it smelled nice though!.</li>
            <li>I have been using this serum morning and evening under my moisturizer, on my face, neck and chest for about one month, and I am ASTONISHED at the remarkable difference it has made.</li>
            <li>I use L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect as my moisturizer over top of this Youth Code product.  </li>
            <li>I know Caucasian friends have used it successfully, so</li>
            <li>Pleasant on skin.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin prone to breakouts and in am in my 50s .</li>
            <li>/&gt;Either way this is a good face moisturizer</li>
            <li>I use creams that make my face feel good and don&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>I bought this when it was being offered at a good price on Amazon</li>
            <li>I got a couple bottles of this when there was a good deal.  </li>
            <li>Asians don&#x27;t look good with freckles though.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>Started using this after seeing the review in Good Housekeeping.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of the good reviews and the cheaper price.</li>
            <li>I never write comments, but this product was that good.  </li>
            <li>Its so hydrating and smells good.  </li>
            <li>I feel that good about my skin.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;good qality, good value</li>
            <li>It works good</li>
            <li>I know the NIA product line is good for cleansing scrub</li>
            <li>Not to good.</li>
            <li>Acts as a good add to my moisturizer -</li>
            <li>I eventually desided to take a risk because good house keeping listed this serum as one of this years anti-aging award winners.</li>
            <li>smells good.</li>
            <li>It does smell good, though, if you aren&#x27;t worried about clogging pores (although I don&#x27;t know how you couldn&#x27;t be ...)</li>
            <li>All in all it seems to be a very good product and feels good (smooth) on my skin.  </li>
            <li>TREMENDOUS!!!  </li>
            <li>but so worth the money best spot corrector  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied with results</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Smells good and feels nice.  </li>
            <li>Moisturizes very nicely, spreads well and dries NOT greasy, no breakouts, safe eyes...</li>
            <li>However, with this price it won&#x27;t hurt to give your face a chance to become baby skin again :) it works for me and hope it works for you!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>WILL BE ORDERING MORE MUY PRONTO!</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>My skin feels amazing and looks amazing too.</li>
            <li>I was stunned to see how amazingly well this product worked.</li>
            <li>, I buy it because it feels amazing on my face.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice as well.</li>
            <li>To be honest, when your over 70, I wonder if anything helps.  </li>
            <li>It could work as a primer too because my foundation and/or concealer go on quite nicely over this serum.</li>
            <li>It smells nice</li>
            <li>The smell was really nice</li>
            <li>Got nice compliments from coworkers.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, honestly.</li>
            <li>Nice packaging.</li>
            <li>but it was a lotion that I could kind of afford</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s hoping a 13.99 bottle will feel just as nice</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on reviews, many women seem to have good results with this product.  </li>
            <li>and it leaves a nice glowy look on your skin.</li>
            <li>lotion has a very nice consistency and texture and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Giving the product two stars because it is a very nice light moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or make me break out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember this particular lotion having the best reviews</li>
            <li>This Youth Code Spot Serum Corrector along with the mositurizer is the best, I am seeing results and will highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have medium/dark skin that scars very easily, and is also prone to acne.</li>
            <li>I take very good care of my skin and am very disciplined in my routine.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m impressed with the improvement I&#x27;ve seen in the hyperpigmentation that&#x27;s plagued me for years.</li>
            <li>The advertisements make it sound good.</li>
            <li>goes on smooth and thats what I loved about it</li>
            <li>IT HAS VERY FINE RATINGS, WHICH IS THE REASON I PURCHASED IT.</li>
            <li>After using this product every morning and every evening for two weeks, I really started noticing that my skin looked good!</li>
            <li>This has a nice light texture and smooths onto my skin nicely.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even tell where the chemical burns were on my cheeks, and its very, very light on my chin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and leaves no shine or oily feeling.</li>
            <li>but I have very light skin tone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light weight.  </li>
            <li>The sent is fine, I&#x27;m not allergic to it, and it feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It works as promised, I was hoping they would lighten more though.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I bought it and can honestly say I saw immediate difference (which I thought it was just maybe the product reflecting the light)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, maybe it just works on my skin type, but I sure don&#x27;t want to be without it ever again.</li>
            <li>My skin is much more even toned and did not breakout.</li>
            <li>I think this  did a better job than a$70 cream I bought</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it and update this review when appropriate.  </li>
            <li>love it ,</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t do any harm.</li>
            <li>I think my skin looks more illuminated and is smoother.</li>
            <li>Love this item</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s an overnight difference, but you should be able to see a change in 1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I trusted this brand as I was a Biotherm user for many years.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>If I was able to give it no stars, I would of done that.</li>
            <li>Also, I just ordered two more bottle online to stock up.</li>
            <li>This product does a great job, considering its reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Not horrible, but needed way more work.</li>
            <li>I just put this on with an SPF 30 lotion on top</li>
            <li>It works OK if they have been on your skin for a while like in a year or so.</li>
            <li>However I must say I am quite pleased with the product</li>
            <li>I love the product because it works for me.</li>
            <li>Really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>THAT IS MY FAVORITE.</li>
            <li>Okay so writing this on my BF&#x27;s account</li>
            <li>Will be buying more</li>
            <li>I also love that it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily</li>
            <li>My sun spots are fading and my skin looks more even toned.</li>
            <li>It was more luminous.</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments since using this.</li>
            <li>My two most problematic spots are showing the most improvement.  </li>
            <li>I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue this, I will need more soon.</li>
            <li>I love the way this product makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that a product from the L&#x27;Oreal would be great, but this hasn&#x27;t worked for me.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use it: I&#x27;m looking forward to even better results with continued use.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll keep fading until they&#x27;re gone.  </li>
            <li>love the scent of it and how it feels on my face.</li>
            <li>There are better products on the market.</li>
            <li>I think most people will like this product.</li>
            <li>So overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>but I was able to find it at a lower price on another web site</li>
            <li>It has a glow and my complexion is more even.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not used a spot corrector before, but had read so many good reviews on this that I thought it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I started using this a month ago and love the results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll be interesting to see just how many of the spots disappear.  </li>
            <li>but I recommend another more legitimate product like Clinique or even go prescription and get Tri Luma.</li>
            <li>- it is now one of my favorite serums ever.  </li>
            <li>I love this product line, will continue to buy Youth Code products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for many weeks now and have seen zero results.</li>
            <li>I use sunblock and it will be interesting to see how well the combination of this product and the SPF 30 moisturizer work to keep the spots away.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to others, a very happy purchase.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;d have been better off not adding any fragrance at all.</li>
            <li>My skin is more toned and even.</li>
            <li>It works much better than Clinique products.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll be able to tell better this Fall.  </li>
            <li>I do notice that my skin looks more cared for when I use this serum.</li>
            <li>It smells great and the price is reasonable on Amazon.</li>
            <li>However, everyone is different and each person has to find what works best for them.  </li>
            <li>Youth code did my my skin look more radiant</li>
            <li>but It also clogged my pores and gave me more acne.</li>
            <li>the more blotchy my skin</li>
            <li>Nice and light texture but no Noticeable changes here.</li>
            <li>I used this twice a day and MAKE SURE TO APPLY SUN SCREEN.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, for the $</li>
            <li>Frankly, I have no idea if it&#x27;s &amp;#34;correcting dark spots&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s a great primer for moisturizer and makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, this has been a great product for me.</li>
            <li>This is a much better product to use than two others I&#x27;ve tried, more economical but smoother, easier to use dispenser,  and more effective.</li>
            <li>This lotion is pretty good, though.  </li>
            <li>I loved this product when I first started it as a sample</li>
            <li>Considering this product is a drugstore spot corrector, It does works pretty good.</li>
            <li>All things considered, my skin looks pretty good.  </li>
            <li>This is great as a super light moisturizer when you don&#x27;t need a full surge, or as a night time product when layering your anti aging products.</li>
            <li>NOT an overnight fix, but after 2 bottles this stuff it really started working great and had HUGE noticeable difference</li>
            <li>Love this stuff; have used for months and months and can&#x27;t say it is strong in the &amp;#34;dark spot correcting&amp;#34; column, but it does &amp;#34;illuminate&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I am 27 and have acne-prone yet dry skin, so for me this works perfect.</li>
            <li>It smells more like they were going for a mixture of florals and a strong soap...</li>
            <li>Honestly, once my spots started fading, I would have to question if I scrubbed all my makeup off because my skin was very pretty (if I do say so myself).  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin glowing and feels amazing and fresh.</li>
            <li>I bought the full size because the free sample I got was amazing...</li>
            <li>My acne scar has faded significantly and the area where my sun spots are located looks much more even.</li>
            <li>I bought this one on a lark, just to try one more time, and within a week I noticed significant lightening of the spots.</li>
            <li>Excellent addition to other products for reducing signs of aging.</li>
            <li>Works best with other Youth Code products.</li>
            <li>My skin gets freckles easily</li>
            <li>and if you have skin that breaks out easy</li>
            <li>I also do not like strong fragrances and this cream</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda strong</li>
            <li>The fragrance was soooooo strong, it literally knocked me out, and I passed out for about an hour.</li>
            <li>It has completely faded brown spots and old acne spots, leaving me a creamier, smoother, more beautiful complexion than I have ever had in my life!</li>
            <li>The smell of this serum is pretty nice as well as how it glides on the skin.</li>
            <li>Nothing special that I found, it went on smooth and as you know serums are better than creams.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I now have a nice, even, smooth skin without too much work!</li>
            <li>My eyes are very sensitive so this is a good product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how much my husband and I love this product!</li>
            <li>HUGE plus bc</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about two weeks in and there is a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already ordered a second one, and will continue until I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I apply it at night and morning under my clinque oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light smell and</li>
            <li>a light feel that I put on every morning and night.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better, so it&#x27;s worth the try.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>One push is all I need to smooth on my face.  </li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s making my face smooth.  </li>
            <li>After about a year, these splotches are greatly reduced, though not totally gone.  </li>
            <li>I give it one start because it made my skin feel amazing and very well</li>
            <li>this product leave my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>, It goes on really smooth and light.</li>
            <li>it is really light weight and non-</li>
            <li>Worth it.  :)</li>
            <li>However, this did make my skin extremely smooth</li>
            <li>but I will keep using the product to see how light they can get.</li>
            <li>Creamy but not greasy, no annoying fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and absorbs into the skin without residue or balling up.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smooth, supple, glowing, EVEN &amp; RADIANT.</li>
            <li>I just bought a cheap moisturizer to replace this</li>
            <li>It has light scent</li>
            <li>Light crime with a satin shine.</li>
            <li>If they made this product fragrance free, I&#x27;d give it a 10 star rating.the product.</li>
            <li>If they made this product fragrance free, I&#x27;d give it a 10 star rating.</li>
            <li>My skin is VERY noticeably smoother, clearer, more even toned, glowing and healthy.</li>
            <li>I never write reviews, but this product has done wonders with my old acne scars and it deserves a good review.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair skin that scars easily, as in every zit leaves a dark spot, and this product improves the healing time for the blemishes I get.</li>
            <li>Though I am not sure it works because I haven&#x27;t seen any changes in over two months, I give it four starts because it has a nice texture and a great smell.</li>
            <li>Hopefully with a more consistent application it will do what it is meant to.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product out, as I want to even out my complexion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m most likely the only person who this has happens to lol!</li>
            <li>But other wise I do recommend!</li>
            <li>I have to say I am so glad I tried it, because this stuff absolutely WORKS!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure at first that it was working and got discouraged.</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin glow, has evened tone significantly, and seems to help keep blemishes at bay.  </li>
            <li>at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if it the the serum, or the accompanying YOUTH CODE SPF30 MOISTURIZER, so I tried them separately.  </li>
            <li>It is not gone, but significantly improved.  </li>
            <li>I spent almost 5 months using this product and really seemed good in the beginning but never got any good results.</li>
            <li>Be sure to apply the serum first, before any moisturizer or sunscreen, so it can penetrate the skin.  </li>
            <li>I am very impressed with the amount of technology that has since gone into over-the-counter products in the past decade.</li>
            <li>The product came fast and it was in excellent condition as expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s obviously intended to be pleasant - it&#x27;s not a chemical smell.</li>
            <li>but, for now, I am happy with the strong visible improvement on my dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right now, I just use a BB cream with a stipple brush to cover up any discoloration, but soon I won&#x27;t have to!</li>
            <li>The spot was lighter right away!</li>
            <li>Likewise, the serum is very light and gently and absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>Its ok, not seeing results much.</li>
            <li>Creating more of a problem than fixing the problem it&#x27;s suppose to fix-- how ironic.</li>
            <li>It has been 4 full weeks since I began using it.  </li>
            <li>like I wear a full face of makeup, but,</li>
            <li>I used it with the the Youth Code Dark Day Cream, and they work beautifully.</li>
            <li>I used to have such good skin</li>
            <li>Considering the fact that it lasts over a year, the price is really not bad</li>
            <li>not bad, i&#x27;m almost invisble</li>
            <li>I never bad mouth any product because not everything works for everyone,</li>
            <li>The product does take a while to see significant results 2-3 months, which is about 1 bottle of the stuff; but it is worth the wait and money</li>
            <li>It has lightened it up and did so quickly.</li>
            <li>it does the job spots go away quick</li>
            <li>Even though the results aren&#x27;t as quick as I&#x27;d like it to be, I AM seeing results.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product since I love the Youth Code BB cream</li>
            <li>I tried to give it a full week to work but each day I gained more than 2 new pimples.</li>
            <li>I like it very much!</li>
            <li>My dark spots have diminished and my complexion looks great.</li>
            <li>This made my skin really smooth, and I could see results within the first two weeks</li>
            <li>This has worked better than anything I have ever tried - I have been using this serum for only a week and have had significant improvement!  </li>
            <li>and we&#x27;ve been married for 22 years!</li>
            <li>and I wondered at first if it was just wishfull thinking, but 3 months in I can truly say it has made a significant difference.  </li>
            <li>BUT, I used the whole bottle because it was a fine moisturizer and didn&#x27;t stink, wasn&#x27;t greasy, I didn&#x27;t break out, and it didn&#x27;t burn my eyes (</li>
            <li>Its is nice smelling lotion that I used under my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It does have a lovely effect of leaving my skin feeling soft and moisturized without the oiliness.  </li>
            <li>so I have to use some kind of whitening skin serum to control my freckles not to look obvious on my face.</li>
            <li>Again, no miracle, but it&#x27;s nice to not yell \\&quot;GAH!\\&quot; in the mirror in the morning and needing only spot treatments - not foundation.</li>
            <li>It is worth it</li>
            <li>I got three days worth of product from the sample</li>
            <li>My skin is clear and it glows, I absolutely love the way the skin looks.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and should&#x27;ve known better than to try it.</li>
            <li>For anyone who&#x27;s Asian, maybe this product isn&#x27;t effective for us?  </li>
            <li>It is quickly absorbed by your skin and leaves it feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>But, it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>Over the years proactive kind of stopped working for me (Ive been using it for about 6 years) and my acne came back with vengance and the fact that since I was in college</li>
            <li>Probably no - I&#x27;m afraid any chemical product would age my face -</li>
            <li>I have find L&#x27;Oreal to be of better quality than most other product brands in this beauty regime.</li>
            <li>Not to mention it arrive pretty quick, &amp; in one piece.</li>
            <li>I do get a lot of compliments about how smooth, clear and clean my face look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try if for no other reason than the smooth texture it gives your skin after application!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is worth trying because it&#x27;s inexpensive, and as I said, works ok as a serum in general.</li>
            <li>Nice product, clean, non greasy, doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes which other products have.  </li>
            <li>For being super cheap in comparison to professional products, I definitely see a difference - even better than I expected - even better than many products out there.</li>
            <li>For being super cheap in comparison to professional products, I definitely see a difference - even better than I expected - even better than many products out there.</li>
            <li>The dark spots that I get on my lower jaw in the sun when I play golf have been faded and the results are as good as my clinque product for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how well or how long it would take to work if you have darker, more abundant dark spots and scars, but for me it was the perfect choice!</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend giving  it a try!  .</li>
            <li>I loved the old formula which comes in a container just as pictured in the product description - white pump with no removable cap.  </li>
            <li>I am a 40  year old Caucasian female with &#x27;fair&#x27; skin.  </li>
            <li>I went to CVS store and saw this dark spot correcting serum was on sale and sounds pretty good deal to me.</li>
            <li>I noticed my frown line was less, well, noticeable, and my face seemed to be having a good phase.</li>
            <li>( I just can&#x27;t see spending $30.00+ on a bottle if I can find something just as good for half the price)</li>
            <li>I like how light and fast absorbing</li>
            <li>Since turning 40, I&#x27;ve noticed more fine lines and dark spots, and since I&#x27;ve started using this product, both have seemingly improved.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the exact opposite of the kinds of scents I like (light, grassy, clean).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid-50&#x27;s with very fair skin and have 3 different kinds of dark spots I was hoping to get rid of:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear any makeup other than mascara, and I feel confident that my skin looks good for the first time in as long as I can remember!  </li>
            <li>I have oily/combination skin (it kinda does what it wants to!), and African-American.</li>
            <li>I am almost finished with my first bottle, and I can see a difference.</li>
            <li>I am on my third bottle of this product and I have given it plenty of time to be sure the results were there.</li>
            <li>Oh, and an added bonus: My skin normally reacts quite badly to most regenerative type skin treatments, but so far....</li>
            <li>My overall skin quality has been better, though.</li>
            <li>It really does work!</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try (first time trying to tackle this).  </li>
            <li>Need to look cause I would love to see that there is some sort of money back guarantee</li>
            <li>Well, might as well give it a try, and if it doesn&#x27;t work, just throw it away because it is not expensive.</li>
            <li>I am hopeful that with further use my skin will improve even more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it and it made my skin way better and back to when I was a child.  </li>
            <li>Even my husband noticed the difference when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>tHANKS!</li>
            <li>; the name and composition of which escapes me right now, to hide a large spot on my nose.</li>
            <li>I was interested in this product, but will decline from purchasing it because L&#x27;Oreal continues to test their products on animals and to use ingredients tested on animals.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it exactly one month</li>
            <li>First of all some background.</li>
            <li>Experiencing acme for the first time in my life</li>
            <li>so much I gave it to my sister!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive</li>
            <li>I am 61 and love being outside and on the water</li>
            <li>Better\\&quot; Dark Spot Corrector, with which I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle of this Aug 13, 2014 and just ran out of it on Valentine day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it is changing my skin beyond the first skin layer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months now and it really has evened out my skin tone!  </li>
            <li>and I am raving after the first week.</li>
            <li>It did faded my acne marks pretty visibly.</li>
            <li>I am from indian (not Native American) descent, so my skin is a bit tanner than most causian females, but I am on the \\&quot;fair\\&quot; end of my type of people.</li>
            <li>well this shit isnt ideal for a normal person that doesnt live in cave.</li>
            <li>It really fades acne spots and evens out skin tone effectively, right on par with Clinique&#x27;s product.  </li>
            <li>The cream stunk like straight sunscreen, this smells wonderful, the cream left my skin greasy, shiny &amp; oily actually causing more breakouts &amp; therefore more dark spots because my blemishes heal &amp; leave dark marks.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t handle extreme strong cheap perfume smell</li>
            <li>My dry and dead skin wiped away after using it making it bright smooth!</li>
            <li>Hard to tell right now, but it does feel really good on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth and lasts a long time!  </li>
            <li>and there were lots of positive reviews here and also on YouTube.</li>
            <li>Not worth the price, buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li>I formed dark spots after years of being on birth control, then having babies (probably my own fault for not using sunblock, but I digress).  </li>
            <li>Since I am a biology major I looked up the ingredients and its effects on the skin, and it turns out clinque made my skin really sensitve and prone to UV light....</li>
            <li>I have used it day and night for ten weeks and find that the dark spots have lighten up a great deal.  </li>
            <li>Figured \\&quot;well, guess that Youth Code was doing SOMETHING\\&quot; and it certainly was.</li>
            <li>It already looks fantastic, and I can&#x27;t wait to only have to wear moisturizer/sunscreen because my goal is to not wear foundation anymore.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you have very pigmented skin patches it may work.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have that much damage though.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>In about two weeks you can really see the difference.  </li>
            <li>I really hasn&#x27;t done anything for my spots at all.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it is just my skin, but this stuff really works</li>
            <li>straight away).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go find another product thanks.</li>
            <li>It works very well for me ,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The improvement has been so gradual that I haven&#x27;t really even noticed it, until this morning.</li>
            <li>After spending way too much on every product out there I figured I&#x27;d try this one.  </li>
            <li>I have this one very noticeable spot on my cheek bone</li>
            <li>but this lotion has really been beneficial to my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>My skin is very prone to breakouts, and I have a rather neutral skin tone.</li>
            <li>My skin feels silky smooth and almost all of my red spots are gone!</li>
            <li>I do not spend much time in the sun (am told otherwise to get Vitamin D).  </li>
            <li>This line has worked really well for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe I didn&#x27;t see much improvement bc</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>It is also very affordable, and came quicker than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>Helped brighten up dark/brown spots but not that much.</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t think it helped me that much.</li>
            <li>or if there really is a difference, but either way, I plan to keep using it.</li>
            <li>And I believe in aging gracefully and not being too image and youth-obsessed as so much of our culture today seems to be.</li>
            <li>and I really see a difference.</li>
            <li>It really</li>
            <li>It really has done wonders for me.</li>
            <li>Does really do anything for me.</li>
            <li>and I need lots of moisture, but in spring/summer I go much lighter.</li>
            <li>Patience really pays off.  </li>
            <li>SO MUCH?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried changing the amount that I apply, thinking that I was applying too much-</li>
            <li>This serum absolutely DELIVERS what it says</li>
            <li>This product REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Youth Code.</li>
            <li>If you can get a prescription for that, then you really don&#x27;t need anything else.</li>
            <li>Thanks L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li>was just to much for me.theres</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to exfoliate regularly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if you need a harder working serum then shell out more bucks.</li>
            <li>just depends on how much you need improved.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it as much as they reccomended.</li>
            <li>This serum soaks in really well not making my skin shiny/oily.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>and I really can tell a difference.</li>
            <li>I really like the product</li>
            <li>I thought i finished it fast...</li>
            <li>When your using this, please be gentle with your face, your skin is trying to \\&quot;turn</li>
            <li>so baby your skin and treat it gently...using gentle cleansers.</li>
            <li>but I know when I read reviews I want people to include these details.t gently...using gentle cleansers.</li>
            <li>Fast forward, yes, I was scared to put this on my face -</li>
            <li>It does not seem as effective after a few months either.</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and I&#x27;m Asian, so I can&#x27;t conclude that it won&#x27;t be effective for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oh, and I use sunblock on my face now to prevent new spots from forming  ;)</li>
            <li>(Luckily, with make-up, the ones on my face are barely noticeable.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I tried many other products, but this one seems to be doing the trick.</li>
            <li>I use it with 2 other L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code items and am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>I do not see much if any lightening of the dark spots, of which there are many, on my face.  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Dark Spot Serum Corrector, 1 Fluid Ounce working good on my face</li>
            <li>I have used a more expensive product for many years and thought it did a good job at making the dark spots lighter, but once I tried Loreal Youth Code Dark Spot Serum I won&#x27;t go back to the more expensire product.  </li>
            <li>I have many dark spots in my face with a lot of years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using product for almost 1 month and my dark spots are getting lighter in color and love the smell and how it feels on my face.</li>
            <li>but I was so surprised how it effected my skin so fast!</li>
            <li>The dark marks have faded a bit, and my complexion does look more even.</li>
            <li>The lotion smelled so good, made my skin feel so soft, and my complexion so clear that I used it year round.</li>
            <li>It works ok as a serum, but I don&#x27;t observe improvement in the dark spots and redness.  </li>
            <li>I often refer to my bathroom closet as my &amp;#34;cosmetic graveyard&amp;#34; once product reaches the shelves it remains there .. tons of money spent on products claiming amazing results only to dissapoint and frustrate me.</li>
            <li>Helps keep my skin looking more refreshed and less &amp;#34;stressed&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m white with a mildly olive</li>
            <li>I want to avoid using makeup but the older I get (62)</li>
            <li>gave it 2 stars solely because it is a decent moisturizer, but that is about all the praise I can award to this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>other products are far better than this.</li>
            <li>as good as any top selling product behind the makeup counters but half the price.</li>
            <li>and Wow! What a difference in my skin!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and moist but not greasy which I really like.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t waste any more money on this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few dark spot treatments in the past without great results, but I figured I might as well give this one a shot since it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive and received good reviews.</li>
            <li>I have wasted money on so many creams and products and none of them come close to this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several products and as of yet have not found anything that effectively works to fade the dark spots.  </li>
            <li>rarely ever come back and leave reviews</li>
            <li>Although I only slightly recognized a difference in the first couple days of use after a couple weeks now, everyday my skin seems to look better and better.</li>
            <li>Better than laser treatment which didn&#x27;t last very long for me.</li>
            <li>Also, if you stop using these, they come right back.  </li>
            <li>This time,I use it for two weeks,the dark spots have been significantly reduced,thank you so much.</li>
            <li>and I cannot live without it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to buying the new texture perfecter after this bottle to minimize my pores.</li>
            <li>So I have to look for something new.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I think this is going be my new skin care regime.</li>
            <li>I accidentally purchased this product - I was waiting for my doctor&#x27;s office to get in the new Illuminizer from SkinMedica, however, they&#x27;ve run out.</li>
            <li>I have sun damage, aka freckles, fine lines, dark spots from acne, and a ruddy complexion.  </li>
            <li>My skin is always super dry</li>
            <li>I have relatively clear skin most of the time and although I tan quite easily, have tried to avoid suntanning in the past few years after much worshipping in my teens and 20s.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t completely disappeared but it is becoming less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>The consistency of this product is very runny, but one pump is more than enough and it dries quickly (semi-matte to natural) which makes it a great base for other products, be it skincare or cosmetic.</li>
            <li>Well, my skin is nearly perfectly clear!</li>
            <li>One of my cheeks is completely clear already!</li>
            <li>I fortunately found several packages of the old formula at a local store and I bought them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with Youth Code Dark Spot Serum Corrector, but feel that skin changes take a fairly long time to be apparent.  </li>
            <li>I just need something more heavy duty!</li>
            <li>After reading the other reviews, I was expecting to love this but after using it only once a day for a week my face broke out in a unsightly rash.  </li>
            <li>However, in one day, it made my face completely break out!  </li>
            <li>My dark spot is disappearing to just light brown.  </li>
            <li>Fine lines are less noticeable and seems to be disappearing?  </li>
            <li>dark spot look lightly, I will continue to used.</li>
            <li>The first night I used this, the next day my skin was peeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was scared to use this again, but I did little spots to build up to the strong odor.</li>
            <li>I researched a lot of the more expensive dark spot and wrinkle creams (and other drugstore brands) and decided that on my first go, I&#x27;d like to try something gentle and a little more cost effective.</li>
            <li>I tried many products &amp; they are very harsh on my skin (for spot removal).</li>
            <li>i gave this 3 stars because i havent used this product long enouth only a mounth, but my face feels so smooth with it on</li>
            <li>Have only used a week now, but am sure It will help my dark spots.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go back to paying more for the Clinique Dark Spot Corrector.</li>
            <li>Dark spots from acne mostly gone and the ones that are left are getting lighter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong heavy cloying smell.</li>
            <li>It smells fine, but I think my skin broke out a little after using it for a week.</li>
            <li>I have noticed significant lightning on dark spots and over all texture improvement.</li>
            <li>So I bought this and the day cream, and have only been using it for a week and a half, both products day and night, and making sure to wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Over the last 4 weeks, my spots have been fading, slowly but surely!</li>
            <li>Large portions of my forehead where discolored, and I have a big spot under my eye.  </li>
            <li>or I certainly will be going back to this one.</li>
            <li>As far as its efficacy in correcting dark spots, I am not 100% certain yet as I have only used it for 3 weeks and want to give it the full 8 weeks before I decide.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing in about another two weeks, my skin will be completely clear.</li>
            <li>My skin has been clear and is of an even tone.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely clear the skin, but it lightens everything quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>you have sensitive skin , do not buy it .</li>
            <li>Can you really turn back time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 56 years old</li>
            <li>My skin is normally really sensitive to anything I put on my face</li>
            <li>So far the product as worked as planned.</li>
            <li>so far nothing.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin and using this product has not caused breakouts so far</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been seeing much spot (only one) reduction, but</li>
            <li>I work in the sun and have very olive tone skin, 3 kids later and 43 years, I&#x27;ve got several sun spots, especially near my eyes and jaw line.  </li>
            <li>I am very please with this L&#x27;Oreal product as well as several others.</li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t need as much covering up, but I actually got a couple of comments on my skin looking \\&quot;healthier lately\\&quot; upon using it.</li>
            <li>I use this every morning under my sunscreen &amp; moisturizer, and I can tell a real difference in the overall appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>Overall, my skin feels softer and happier, I highly recommend this creme!  </li>
            <li>I use this from Spring through early winter.</li>
            <li>So I nearly didn&#x27;t try this until I read some reviews and saw a couple of glowing testimonials on YouTube.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my sun spots will ever completely fade away</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin but seems like once I switched to night time</li>
            <li>but most have lightened at least two shades.</li>
            <li>Since using, my skin has cleared up (which isn&#x27;t the purpose of this but still) and is really soft and luminous.</li>
            <li>I started using the alba night cream, its all natural.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Loreal is the budget version of Lancome, and this product is nearly identical to Lancome&#x27;s Genifique, for a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY wish I could take it back.</li>
            <li>I am really surprised that, for the price, this product works as well as it does.  </li>
            <li>Spots are fading and they aren&#x27;t nearly as noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 49 years old.  </li>
            <li>I would think if you want a completely unmarked face, you&#x27;d have to go to a dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>:  I continue to be happily surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li>I think the spots took around 2 to 3 weeks to fade completely</li>
            <li>so you have to watch if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I will never waste money on this again.</li>
            <li>However, I am still looking for something more moisturizing, but I would recommend trying it at least once.</li>
            <li>that was such a waste of money, I broke out even more</li>
            <li>SO bottom line it will work...if you are a hermit and live in a basement for the period you try it, but once your exposed to sun, it WILL CAUSE MORE SUN SPOTS and after that I was just left scarred and was becoming desperate.</li>
            <li>Typical, right!</li>
            <li>Boy, am I excited about L&#x27;oreal Youth Code Dark Spot Serum!</li>
            <li>Because of that, I&#x27;ll continue to use it but only until I find some more of the Clinique or some other product that produces the same results without triggering a gag reflex.</li>
            <li>This product not only clears dark spots it makes the overall appearance of face beam with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I think I need to use it for at least six months to see any real effects, but I do live in the fog and am rarely out in the sun, so one would think you would see the results a bit sooner.</li>
            <li>When applied, there is a slight moment of mild sting that imparts a sense that it is working.  </li>
            <li>if you try this product, TEST IT FIRST before committing to your entire face, unless you like wearing big sunglasses and a hat every where you go.</li>
            <li>The first bottle lasted me approximately 4 months, using a light amount each morning and evening.</li>
            <li>am also using this in conjuction with Pond&#x27;s Clarant B3, so I will come back to repost on that particular product, but this Youth Code serum just didn&#x27;t do it for me</li>
            <li>Wow, I never expected to get the results from this product that I&#x27;ve seen!</li>
            <li>I had very little hope for this product, but it was so cheap</li>
            <li>Thanks for alienating yet another one of your loyal customers L&#x27;Oreal.  </li>
            <li>I do have very sensitive skin and have had trouble with many other cosmetics as well.</li>
            <li>Everybody has different skin type and different reaction over certain skin care product.</li>
            <li>Also, my skin quality improved and my acne is totally gone (when I have a new spot I just apply this product and the spot dries out</li>
            <li>The new formula comes in a different bottle with a plastic cap over the pump.  </li>
            <li>To save your skin, not only should you change to a healthier diet that works with your body type and live style, you also need to avoid sun damage and change medication if you are taking any.</li>
            <li>DO REALLY LIKE the LUMINESCENCE of the accompanying YOUTH CODE SPF 30 MOISTURIZER, BUT my SKIN ENDS UP LOOKING GROSS BECAUSE IT PEELS INTO VISIBLE WHITE PIECES.</li>
            <li>and I had a lot of dark, dark spots on top of my hands.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t show much of the change for the first two weeks, but after two weeks, it started to show a little different on my face.</li>
            <li>When I was in my teen and early adult years, I was a major sun worshiper, always seeking to get the darkest tan I could.  </li>
            <li>After using it for mere 10 days my hyperpigmented skin looks much, much better!  </li>
            <li>After a week of using this product, however, I barely need make up!</li>
            <li>I put on my regular moisturizer and completely forgot about my foundation!  </li>
            <li>I have found that since using it on my cheeks and forehead, my skin seems a tiny bit plumper (thanks, peptides!), but my overall skin tone is definitely improved.</li>
            <li>so there no other proof that I need....</li>
            <li>I can only hope that they will disappear completely soon!</li>
            <li>I prefer other products a little more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking to even their skin tone, reduce a few light spots and doesn&#x27;t want to spend an extreme amount.</li>
            <li>The Avon dark spot corrector (Banishing Creme) is more effective and less expensive.</li>
            <li>I am very fair with oily skin and after using this product I no longer even need to wear makeup base.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It went on smooth, and lasted longer than I though (at least 4-5 weeks)</li>
            <li>When I stopped using it and went back, my pores were all clear again.</li>
            <li>It has had a big impact on my old acne scars.</li>
            <li>I have been using ever since and though my spots are not 100% gone (forget about that) they are barely visible.</li>
            <li>I recommend all natural products, such as castor oil and non-alcohol licorice extract.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had red acne marks on my cheeks since my early twenties, and I thought they were just going to be there forever.  </li>
            <li>I have used nearly all of the product and no further change has occurred.</li>
            <li>Seems to be lightening some of my old acne red areas and some of my brownish sun spots.</li>
            <li>This is about the least effective product I have tried for dark spots.</li>
            <li>the price is good, but when i received it, the package looks not very good, so, it&#x60;s hard to give my friend as a gift</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry your face out and is gentle enough to use under make up.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend is saying how much improvement my skin has, and he is now a strong believer that \\&quot;expensive isn&#x27;t always better.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I applied Youth Code Dark Spot Serum Corrector directly to the age spots every morning and night for several weeks with no apparent change, if anything the spots seemed to become a little more noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying several treatments and products over the last 3-4 years to try to decrease the dark areas without much success.  </li>
            <li>- Will rate gain a few more months down the road!</li>
            <li>I used this for a few weeks so probably not long enough to be able to tell whether or not it worked on dark spots.</li>
            <li>I was hopping for dramatic results after over a moth of applying this product and yes, I have notable changes, clearer skin</li>
            <li>It shows minimal to almost none improvement on spots that are older than 5 years or longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I washed my face well and only put on a thin layer I still got more acne.</li>
            <li>Olay Wash, Olay 7, Bare Minerals powder foundation (not anymore!), Maybelline Instant Age</li>
            <li>old and live at the beach, Youth has removed all dark spots on my face and hands.</li>
            <li>It really help diminished my dark spots.</li>
            <li>so it is very noticeable if there is any dark spot on my face.</li>
            <li>It really works to remove dark spots/sun spots on my face.</li>
            <li>Really like this Dark Spot &amp; Illuminating Serum.</li>
            <li>It is by no means a miracle solution and requires consistent use over a few weeks, but there is still a noticeable improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>having had to daily, actually needing foundation/powder all over the face again, the overall look was less luminous, the tone was uneven(er) and generally my face didn&#x27;t look so hot.</li>
            <li>So each blemish is very visible for a very long time, LONG after the actual zit dies.</li>
            <li>It worked at only a little first after using it for about 3 months, but it seemed as if it stopped working.</li>
            <li>I ordered this to try to combat a lot of the dark spots I have on my face from too much time in the sun when I was younger and age.  </li>
            <li>Sure it moisturizers, but did not diminish dark spots...at least not for me.</li>
            <li>I only apply this on my blemishes and it really makes them less visible.</li>
            <li>I started using the Dark Spot corrector and within a few days I noticed significant lightening of this one spot.  </li>
            <li>Well, good news, bad news.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I really loved this product it made a great change on my face within 2 days..</li>
            <li> it smelled nice though!.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum morning and evening under my moisturizer, on my face, neck and chest for about one month, and I am ASTONISHED at the remarkable difference it has made.</li>
            <li> I use L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect as my moisturizer over top of this Youth Code product.  </li>
            <li> I know Caucasian friends have used it successfully, so</li>
            <li> Pleasant on skin.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin prone to breakouts and in am in my 50s .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Either way this is a good face moisturizer</li>
            <li> I use creams that make my face feel good and don&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> I bought this when it was being offered at a good price on Amazon</li>
            <li> I got a couple bottles of this when there was a good deal.  </li>
            <li> Asians don&#x27;t look good with freckles though.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> Started using this after seeing the review in Good Housekeeping.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the good reviews and the cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I never write comments, but this product was that good.  </li>
            <li> Its so hydrating and smells good.  </li>
            <li> I feel that good about my skin.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;good qality, good value</li>
            <li> It works good</li>
            <li> I know the NIA product line is good for cleansing scrub</li>
            <li> Not to good.</li>
            <li> Acts as a good add to my moisturizer -</li>
            <li> I eventually desided to take a risk because good house keeping listed this serum as one of this years anti-aging award winners.</li>
            <li> smells good.</li>
            <li> It does smell good, though, if you aren&#x27;t worried about clogging pores (although I don&#x27;t know how you couldn&#x27;t be ...)</li>
            <li> All in all it seems to be a very good product and feels good (smooth) on my skin.  </li>
            <li> TREMENDOUS!!!  </li>
            <li> but so worth the money best spot corrector  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied with results</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Smells good and feels nice.  </li>
            <li> Moisturizes very nicely, spreads well and dries NOT greasy, no breakouts, safe eyes...</li>
            <li> However, with this price it won&#x27;t hurt to give your face a chance to become baby skin again :) it works for me and hope it works for you!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>

            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazing and looks amazing too.</li>
            <li> I was stunned to see how amazingly well this product worked.</li>
            <li> , I buy it because it feels amazing on my face.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice as well.</li>
            <li> To be honest, when your over 70, I wonder if anything helps.  </li>
            <li> It could work as a primer too because my foundation and/or concealer go on quite nicely over this serum.</li>
            <li> It smells nice</li>
            <li> The smell was really nice</li>
            <li> Got nice compliments from coworkers.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, honestly.</li>
            <li> Nice packaging.</li>
            <li> but it was a lotion that I could kind of afford</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s hoping a 13.99 bottle will feel just as nice</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on reviews, many women seem to have good results with this product.  </li>
            <li> and it leaves a nice glowy look on your skin.</li>
            <li> lotion has a very nice consistency and texture and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Giving the product two stars because it is a very nice light moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or make me break out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember this particular lotion having the best reviews</li>
            <li> This Youth Code Spot Serum Corrector along with the mositurizer is the best, I am seeing results and will highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have medium/dark skin that scars very easily, and is also prone to acne.</li>
            <li> I take very good care of my skin and am very disciplined in my routine.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m impressed with the improvement I&#x27;ve seen in the hyperpigmentation that&#x27;s plagued me for years.</li>
            <li> The advertisements make it sound good.</li>
            <li> goes on smooth and thats what I loved about it</li>
            <li> IT HAS VERY FINE RATINGS, WHICH IS THE REASON I PURCHASED IT.</li>
            <li> After using this product every morning and every evening for two weeks, I really started noticing that my skin looked good!</li>
            <li> This has a nice light texture and smooths onto my skin nicely.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even tell where the chemical burns were on my cheeks, and its very, very light on my chin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and leaves no shine or oily feeling.</li>
            <li> but I have very light skin tone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light weight.  </li>
            <li> The sent is fine, I&#x27;m not allergic to it, and it feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this product</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It works as promised, I was hoping they would lighten more though.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I bought it and can honestly say I saw immediate difference (which I thought it was just maybe the product reflecting the light)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, maybe it just works on my skin type, but I sure don&#x27;t want to be without it ever again.</li>
            <li> My skin is much more even toned and did not breakout.</li>
            <li> I think this  did a better job than a$70 cream I bought</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it and update this review when appropriate.  </li>
            <li> love it ,</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t do any harm.</li>
            <li> I think my skin looks more illuminated and is smoother.</li>
            <li> Love this item</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s an overnight difference, but you should be able to see a change in 1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I trusted this brand as I was a Biotherm user for many years.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> If I was able to give it no stars, I would of done that.</li>
            <li> Also, I just ordered two more bottle online to stock up.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job, considering its reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Not horrible, but needed way more work.</li>
            <li> I just put this on with an SPF 30 lotion on top</li>
            <li> It works OK if they have been on your skin for a while like in a year or so.</li>
            <li> However I must say I am quite pleased with the product</li>
            <li> I love the product because it works for me.</li>
            <li> Really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> THAT IS MY FAVORITE.</li>
            <li> Okay so writing this on my BF&#x27;s account</li>
            <li> Will be buying more</li>
            <li> I also love that it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily</li>
            <li> My sun spots are fading and my skin looks more even toned.</li>
            <li> It was more luminous.</li>
            <li> I have received many compliments since using this.</li>
            <li> My two most problematic spots are showing the most improvement.  </li>
            <li> I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue this, I will need more soon.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that a product from the L&#x27;Oreal would be great, but this hasn&#x27;t worked for me.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it: I&#x27;m looking forward to even better results with continued use.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll keep fading until they&#x27;re gone.  </li>
            <li> love the scent of it and how it feels on my face.</li>
            <li> There are better products on the market.</li>
            <li> I think most people will like this product.</li>
            <li> So overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> but I was able to find it at a lower price on another web site</li>
            <li> It has a glow and my complexion is more even.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used a spot corrector before, but had read so many good reviews on this that I thought it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> I started using this a month ago and love the results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll be interesting to see just how many of the spots disappear.  </li>
            <li> but I recommend another more legitimate product like Clinique or even go prescription and get Tri Luma.</li>
            <li> - it is now one of my favorite serums ever.  </li>
            <li> I love this product line, will continue to buy Youth Code products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many weeks now and have seen zero results.</li>
            <li> I use sunblock and it will be interesting to see how well the combination of this product and the SPF 30 moisturizer work to keep the spots away.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to others, a very happy purchase.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;d have been better off not adding any fragrance at all.</li>
            <li> My skin is more toned and even.</li>
            <li> It works much better than Clinique products.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll be able to tell better this Fall.  </li>
            <li> I do notice that my skin looks more cared for when I use this serum.</li>
            <li> It smells great and the price is reasonable on Amazon.</li>
            <li> However, everyone is different and each person has to find what works best for them.  </li>
            <li> Youth code did my my skin look more radiant</li>
            <li> but It also clogged my pores and gave me more acne.</li>
            <li> the more blotchy my skin</li>
            <li> Nice and light texture but no Noticeable changes here.</li>
            <li> I used this twice a day and MAKE SURE TO APPLY SUN SCREEN.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, for the $</li>
            <li> Frankly, I have no idea if it&#x27;s &amp;#34;correcting dark spots&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s a great primer for moisturizer and makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, this has been a great product for me.</li>
            <li> This is a much better product to use than two others I&#x27;ve tried, more economical but smoother, easier to use dispenser,  and more effective.</li>
            <li> This lotion is pretty good, though.  </li>
            <li> I loved this product when I first started it as a sample</li>
            <li> Considering this product is a drugstore spot corrector, It does works pretty good.</li>
            <li> All things considered, my skin looks pretty good.  </li>
            <li> This is great as a super light moisturizer when you don&#x27;t need a full surge, or as a night time product when layering your anti aging products.</li>
            <li> NOT an overnight fix, but after 2 bottles this stuff it really started working great and had HUGE noticeable difference</li>
            <li> Love this stuff; have used for months and months and can&#x27;t say it is strong in the &amp;#34;dark spot correcting&amp;#34; column, but it does &amp;#34;illuminate&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I am 27 and have acne-prone yet dry skin, so for me this works perfect.</li>
            <li> It smells more like they were going for a mixture of florals and a strong soap...</li>
            <li> Honestly, once my spots started fading, I would have to question if I scrubbed all my makeup off because my skin was very pretty (if I do say so myself).  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin glowing and feels amazing and fresh.</li>
            <li> I bought the full size because the free sample I got was amazing...</li>
            <li> My acne scar has faded significantly and the area where my sun spots are located looks much more even.</li>
            <li> I bought this one on a lark, just to try one more time, and within a week I noticed significant lightening of the spots.</li>
            <li> Excellent addition to other products for reducing signs of aging.</li>
            <li> Works best with other Youth Code products.</li>
            <li> My skin gets freckles easily</li>
            <li> and if you have skin that breaks out easy</li>
            <li> I also do not like strong fragrances and this cream</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda strong</li>
            <li> The fragrance was soooooo strong, it literally knocked me out, and I passed out for about an hour.</li>
            <li> It has completely faded brown spots and old acne spots, leaving me a creamier, smoother, more beautiful complexion than I have ever had in my life!</li>
            <li> The smell of this serum is pretty nice as well as how it glides on the skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing special that I found, it went on smooth and as you know serums are better than creams.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I now have a nice, even, smooth skin without too much work!</li>
            <li> My eyes are very sensitive so this is a good product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how much my husband and I love this product!</li>
            <li> HUGE plus bc</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about two weeks in and there is a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already ordered a second one, and will continue until I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I apply it at night and morning under my clinque oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light smell and</li>
            <li> a light feel that I put on every morning and night.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better, so it&#x27;s worth the try.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly</li>
            <li> One push is all I need to smooth on my face.  </li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s making my face smooth.  </li>
            <li> After about a year, these splotches are greatly reduced, though not totally gone.  </li>
            <li> I give it one start because it made my skin feel amazing and very well</li>
            <li> this product leave my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> , It goes on really smooth and light.</li>
            <li> it is really light weight and non-</li>
            <li> Worth it.  :)</li>
            <li> However, this did make my skin extremely smooth</li>
            <li> but I will keep using the product to see how light they can get.</li>
            <li> Creamy but not greasy, no annoying fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and absorbs into the skin without residue or balling up.  </li>
            <li> My skin is smooth, supple, glowing, EVEN &amp; RADIANT.</li>
            <li> I just bought a cheap moisturizer to replace this</li>
            <li> It has light scent</li>
            <li> Light crime with a satin shine.</li>
            <li> If they made this product fragrance free, I&#x27;d give it a 10 star rating.the product.</li>
            <li> If they made this product fragrance free, I&#x27;d give it a 10 star rating.</li>
            <li> My skin is VERY noticeably smoother, clearer, more even toned, glowing and healthy.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but this product has done wonders with my old acne scars and it deserves a good review.  </li>
            <li> I have very fair skin that scars easily, as in every zit leaves a dark spot, and this product improves the healing time for the blemishes I get.</li>
            <li> Though I am not sure it works because I haven&#x27;t seen any changes in over two months, I give it four starts because it has a nice texture and a great smell.</li>
            <li> Hopefully with a more consistent application it will do what it is meant to.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product out, as I want to even out my complexion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m most likely the only person who this has happens to lol!</li>
            <li> But other wise I do recommend!</li>
            <li> I have to say I am so glad I tried it, because this stuff absolutely WORKS!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first that it was working and got discouraged.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin glow, has evened tone significantly, and seems to help keep blemishes at bay.  </li>
            <li> at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if it the the serum, or the accompanying YOUTH CODE SPF30 MOISTURIZER, so I tried them separately.  </li>
            <li> It is not gone, but significantly improved.  </li>
            <li> I spent almost 5 months using this product and really seemed good in the beginning but never got any good results.</li>
            <li> Be sure to apply the serum first, before any moisturizer or sunscreen, so it can penetrate the skin.  </li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the amount of technology that has since gone into over-the-counter products in the past decade.</li>
            <li> The product came fast and it was in excellent condition as expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obviously intended to be pleasant - it&#x27;s not a chemical smell.</li>
            <li> but, for now, I am happy with the strong visible improvement on my dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Right now, I just use a BB cream with a stipple brush to cover up any discoloration, but soon I won&#x27;t have to!</li>
            <li> The spot was lighter right away!</li>
            <li> Likewise, the serum is very light and gently and absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> Its ok, not seeing results much.</li>
            <li> Creating more of a problem than fixing the problem it&#x27;s suppose to fix-- how ironic.</li>
            <li> It has been 4 full weeks since I began using it.  </li>
            <li> like I wear a full face of makeup, but,</li>
            <li> I used it with the the Youth Code Dark Day Cream, and they work beautifully.</li>
            <li> I used to have such good skin</li>
            <li> Considering the fact that it lasts over a year, the price is really not bad</li>
            <li> not bad, i&#x27;m almost invisble</li>
            <li> I never bad mouth any product because not everything works for everyone,</li>
            <li> The product does take a while to see significant results 2-3 months, which is about 1 bottle of the stuff; but it is worth the wait and money</li>
            <li> It has lightened it up and did so quickly.</li>
            <li> it does the job spots go away quick</li>
            <li> Even though the results aren&#x27;t as quick as I&#x27;d like it to be, I AM seeing results.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product since I love the Youth Code BB cream</li>
            <li> I tried to give it a full week to work but each day I gained more than 2 new pimples.</li>
            <li> I like it very much!</li>
            <li> My dark spots have diminished and my complexion looks great.</li>
            <li> This made my skin really smooth, and I could see results within the first two weeks</li>
            <li> This has worked better than anything I have ever tried - I have been using this serum for only a week and have had significant improvement!  </li>
            <li> and we&#x27;ve been married for 22 years!</li>
            <li> and I wondered at first if it was just wishfull thinking, but 3 months in I can truly say it has made a significant difference.  </li>
            <li> BUT, I used the whole bottle because it was a fine moisturizer and didn&#x27;t stink, wasn&#x27;t greasy, I didn&#x27;t break out, and it didn&#x27;t burn my eyes (</li>
            <li> Its is nice smelling lotion that I used under my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It does have a lovely effect of leaving my skin feeling soft and moisturized without the oiliness.  </li>
            <li> so I have to use some kind of whitening skin serum to control my freckles not to look obvious on my face.</li>
            <li> Again, no miracle, but it&#x27;s nice to not yell \\&quot;GAH!\\&quot; in the mirror in the morning and needing only spot treatments - not foundation.</li>
            <li> It is worth it</li>
            <li> I got three days worth of product from the sample</li>
            <li> My skin is clear and it glows, I absolutely love the way the skin looks.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and should&#x27;ve known better than to try it.</li>
            <li> For anyone who&#x27;s Asian, maybe this product isn&#x27;t effective for us?  </li>
            <li> It is quickly absorbed by your skin and leaves it feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> But, it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> Over the years proactive kind of stopped working for me (Ive been using it for about 6 years) and my acne came back with vengance and the fact that since I was in college</li>
            <li> Probably no - I&#x27;m afraid any chemical product would age my face -</li>
            <li> I have find L&#x27;Oreal to be of better quality than most other product brands in this beauty regime.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it arrive pretty quick, &amp; in one piece.</li>
            <li> I do get a lot of compliments about how smooth, clear and clean my face look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try if for no other reason than the smooth texture it gives your skin after application!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is worth trying because it&#x27;s inexpensive, and as I said, works ok as a serum in general.</li>
            <li> Nice product, clean, non greasy, doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes which other products have.  </li>
            <li> For being super cheap in comparison to professional products, I definitely see a difference - even better than I expected - even better than many products out there.</li>
            <li> For being super cheap in comparison to professional products, I definitely see a difference - even better than I expected - even better than many products out there.</li>
            <li> The dark spots that I get on my lower jaw in the sun when I play golf have been faded and the results are as good as my clinque product for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how well or how long it would take to work if you have darker, more abundant dark spots and scars, but for me it was the perfect choice!</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend giving  it a try!  .</li>
            <li> I loved the old formula which comes in a container just as pictured in the product description - white pump with no removable cap.  </li>
            <li> I am a 40  year old Caucasian female with &#x27;fair&#x27; skin.  </li>
            <li> I went to CVS store and saw this dark spot correcting serum was on sale and sounds pretty good deal to me.</li>
            <li> I noticed my frown line was less, well, noticeable, and my face seemed to be having a good phase.</li>
            <li> ( I just can&#x27;t see spending $30.00+ on a bottle if I can find something just as good for half the price)</li>
            <li> I like how light and fast absorbing</li>
            <li> Since turning 40, I&#x27;ve noticed more fine lines and dark spots, and since I&#x27;ve started using this product, both have seemingly improved.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the exact opposite of the kinds of scents I like (light, grassy, clean).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-50&#x27;s with very fair skin and have 3 different kinds of dark spots I was hoping to get rid of:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear any makeup other than mascara, and I feel confident that my skin looks good for the first time in as long as I can remember!  </li>
            <li> I have oily/combination skin (it kinda does what it wants to!), and African-American.</li>
            <li> I am almost finished with my first bottle, and I can see a difference.</li>
            <li> I am on my third bottle of this product and I have given it plenty of time to be sure the results were there.</li>
            <li> Oh, and an added bonus: My skin normally reacts quite badly to most regenerative type skin treatments, but so far....</li>
            <li> My overall skin quality has been better, though.</li>
            <li> It really does work!</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try (first time trying to tackle this).  </li>
            <li> Need to look cause I would love to see that there is some sort of money back guarantee</li>
            <li> Well, might as well give it a try, and if it doesn&#x27;t work, just throw it away because it is not expensive.</li>
            <li> I am hopeful that with further use my skin will improve even more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it and it made my skin way better and back to when I was a child.  </li>
            <li> Even my husband noticed the difference when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> tHANKS!</li>
            <li> ; the name and composition of which escapes me right now, to hide a large spot on my nose.</li>
            <li> I was interested in this product, but will decline from purchasing it because L&#x27;Oreal continues to test their products on animals and to use ingredients tested on animals.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it exactly one month</li>
            <li> First of all some background.</li>
            <li> Experiencing acme for the first time in my life</li>
            <li> so much I gave it to my sister!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not expensive</li>
            <li> I am 61 and love being outside and on the water</li>
            <li> Better\\&quot; Dark Spot Corrector, with which I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle of this Aug 13, 2014 and just ran out of it on Valentine day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it is changing my skin beyond the first skin layer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months now and it really has evened out my skin tone!  </li>
            <li> and I am raving after the first week.</li>
            <li> It did faded my acne marks pretty visibly.</li>
            <li> I am from indian (not Native American) descent, so my skin is a bit tanner than most causian females, but I am on the \\&quot;fair\\&quot; end of my type of people.</li>
            <li> well this shit isnt ideal for a normal person that doesnt live in cave.</li>
            <li> It really fades acne spots and evens out skin tone effectively, right on par with Clinique&#x27;s product.  </li>
            <li> The cream stunk like straight sunscreen, this smells wonderful, the cream left my skin greasy, shiny &amp; oily actually causing more breakouts &amp; therefore more dark spots because my blemishes heal &amp; leave dark marks.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t handle extreme strong cheap perfume smell</li>
            <li> My dry and dead skin wiped away after using it making it bright smooth!</li>
            <li> Hard to tell right now, but it does feel really good on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth and lasts a long time!  </li>
            <li> and there were lots of positive reviews here and also on YouTube.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price, buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I formed dark spots after years of being on birth control, then having babies (probably my own fault for not using sunblock, but I digress).  </li>
            <li> Since I am a biology major I looked up the ingredients and its effects on the skin, and it turns out clinque made my skin really sensitve and prone to UV light....</li>
            <li> I have used it day and night for ten weeks and find that the dark spots have lighten up a great deal.  </li>
            <li> Figured \\&quot;well, guess that Youth Code was doing SOMETHING\\&quot; and it certainly was.</li>
            <li> It already looks fantastic, and I can&#x27;t wait to only have to wear moisturizer/sunscreen because my goal is to not wear foundation anymore.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have very pigmented skin patches it may work.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have that much damage though.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> In about two weeks you can really see the difference.  </li>
            <li> I really hasn&#x27;t done anything for my spots at all.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it is just my skin, but this stuff really works</li>
            <li> straight away).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go find another product thanks.</li>
            <li> It works very well for me ,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The improvement has been so gradual that I haven&#x27;t really even noticed it, until this morning.</li>
            <li> After spending way too much on every product out there I figured I&#x27;d try this one.  </li>
            <li> I have this one very noticeable spot on my cheek bone</li>
            <li> but this lotion has really been beneficial to my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> My skin is very prone to breakouts, and I have a rather neutral skin tone.</li>
            <li> My skin feels silky smooth and almost all of my red spots are gone!</li>
            <li> I do not spend much time in the sun (am told otherwise to get Vitamin D).  </li>
            <li> This line has worked really well for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I didn&#x27;t see much improvement bc</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> It is also very affordable, and came quicker than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> Helped brighten up dark/brown spots but not that much.</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t think it helped me that much.</li>
            <li> or if there really is a difference, but either way, I plan to keep using it.</li>
            <li> And I believe in aging gracefully and not being too image and youth-obsessed as so much of our culture today seems to be.</li>
            <li> and I really see a difference.</li>
            <li> It really</li>
            <li> It really has done wonders for me.</li>
            <li> Does really do anything for me.</li>
            <li> and I need lots of moisture, but in spring/summer I go much lighter.</li>
            <li> Patience really pays off.  </li>
            <li> SO MUCH?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried changing the amount that I apply, thinking that I was applying too much-</li>
            <li> This serum absolutely DELIVERS what it says</li>
            <li> This product REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much Youth Code.</li>
            <li> If you can get a prescription for that, then you really don&#x27;t need anything else.</li>
            <li> Thanks L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> was just to much for me.theres</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to exfoliate regularly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if you need a harder working serum then shell out more bucks.</li>
            <li> just depends on how much you need improved.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it as much as they reccomended.</li>
            <li> This serum soaks in really well not making my skin shiny/oily.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> and I really can tell a difference.</li>
            <li> I really like the product</li>
            <li> I thought i finished it fast...</li>
            <li> When your using this, please be gentle with your face, your skin is trying to \\&quot;turn</li>
            <li> so baby your skin and treat it gently...using gentle cleansers.</li>
            <li> but I know when I read reviews I want people to include these details.t gently...using gentle cleansers.</li>
            <li> Fast forward, yes, I was scared to put this on my face -</li>
            <li> It does not seem as effective after a few months either.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and I&#x27;m Asian, so I can&#x27;t conclude that it won&#x27;t be effective for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh, and I use sunblock on my face now to prevent new spots from forming  ;)</li>
            <li> (Luckily, with make-up, the ones on my face are barely noticeable.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tried many other products, but this one seems to be doing the trick.</li>
            <li> I use it with 2 other L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code items and am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> I do not see much if any lightening of the dark spots, of which there are many, on my face.  </li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Dark Spot Serum Corrector, 1 Fluid Ounce working good on my face</li>
            <li> I have used a more expensive product for many years and thought it did a good job at making the dark spots lighter, but once I tried Loreal Youth Code Dark Spot Serum I won&#x27;t go back to the more expensire product.  </li>
            <li> I have many dark spots in my face with a lot of years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using product for almost 1 month and my dark spots are getting lighter in color and love the smell and how it feels on my face.</li>
            <li> but I was so surprised how it effected my skin so fast!</li>
            <li> The dark marks have faded a bit, and my complexion does look more even.</li>
            <li> The lotion smelled so good, made my skin feel so soft, and my complexion so clear that I used it year round.</li>
            <li> It works ok as a serum, but I don&#x27;t observe improvement in the dark spots and redness.  </li>
            <li> I often refer to my bathroom closet as my &amp;#34;cosmetic graveyard&amp;#34; once product reaches the shelves it remains there .. tons of money spent on products claiming amazing results only to dissapoint and frustrate me.</li>
            <li> Helps keep my skin looking more refreshed and less &amp;#34;stressed&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white with a mildly olive</li>
            <li> I want to avoid using makeup but the older I get (62)</li>
            <li> gave it 2 stars solely because it is a decent moisturizer, but that is about all the praise I can award to this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> other products are far better than this.</li>
            <li> as good as any top selling product behind the makeup counters but half the price.</li>
            <li> and Wow! What a difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and moist but not greasy which I really like.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t waste any more money on this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few dark spot treatments in the past without great results, but I figured I might as well give this one a shot since it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive and received good reviews.</li>
            <li> I have wasted money on so many creams and products and none of them come close to this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several products and as of yet have not found anything that effectively works to fade the dark spots.  </li>
            <li> rarely ever come back and leave reviews</li>
            <li> Although I only slightly recognized a difference in the first couple days of use after a couple weeks now, everyday my skin seems to look better and better.</li>
            <li> Better than laser treatment which didn&#x27;t last very long for me.</li>
            <li> Also, if you stop using these, they come right back.  </li>
            <li> This time,I use it for two weeks,the dark spots have been significantly reduced,thank you so much.</li>
            <li> and I cannot live without it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to buying the new texture perfecter after this bottle to minimize my pores.</li>
            <li> So I have to look for something new.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I think this is going be my new skin care regime.</li>
            <li> I accidentally purchased this product - I was waiting for my doctor&#x27;s office to get in the new Illuminizer from SkinMedica, however, they&#x27;ve run out.</li>
            <li> I have sun damage, aka freckles, fine lines, dark spots from acne, and a ruddy complexion.  </li>
            <li> My skin is always super dry</li>
            <li> I have relatively clear skin most of the time and although I tan quite easily, have tried to avoid suntanning in the past few years after much worshipping in my teens and 20s.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t completely disappeared but it is becoming less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> The consistency of this product is very runny, but one pump is more than enough and it dries quickly (semi-matte to natural) which makes it a great base for other products, be it skincare or cosmetic.</li>
            <li> Well, my skin is nearly perfectly clear!</li>
            <li> One of my cheeks is completely clear already!</li>
            <li> I fortunately found several packages of the old formula at a local store and I bought them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with Youth Code Dark Spot Serum Corrector, but feel that skin changes take a fairly long time to be apparent.  </li>
            <li> I just need something more heavy duty!</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews, I was expecting to love this but after using it only once a day for a week my face broke out in a unsightly rash.  </li>
            <li> However, in one day, it made my face completely break out!  </li>
            <li> My dark spot is disappearing to just light brown.  </li>
            <li> Fine lines are less noticeable and seems to be disappearing?  </li>
            <li> dark spot look lightly, I will continue to used.</li>
            <li> The first night I used this, the next day my skin was peeling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was scared to use this again, but I did little spots to build up to the strong odor.</li>
            <li> I researched a lot of the more expensive dark spot and wrinkle creams (and other drugstore brands) and decided that on my first go, I&#x27;d like to try something gentle and a little more cost effective.</li>
            <li> I tried many products &amp; they are very harsh on my skin (for spot removal).</li>
            <li> i gave this 3 stars because i havent used this product long enouth only a mounth, but my face feels so smooth with it on</li>
            <li> Have only used a week now, but am sure It will help my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go back to paying more for the Clinique Dark Spot Corrector.</li>
            <li> Dark spots from acne mostly gone and the ones that are left are getting lighter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strong heavy cloying smell.</li>
            <li> It smells fine, but I think my skin broke out a little after using it for a week.</li>
            <li> I have noticed significant lightning on dark spots and over all texture improvement.</li>
            <li> So I bought this and the day cream, and have only been using it for a week and a half, both products day and night, and making sure to wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Over the last 4 weeks, my spots have been fading, slowly but surely!</li>
            <li> Large portions of my forehead where discolored, and I have a big spot under my eye.  </li>
            <li> or I certainly will be going back to this one.</li>
            <li> As far as its efficacy in correcting dark spots, I am not 100% certain yet as I have only used it for 3 weeks and want to give it the full 8 weeks before I decide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing in about another two weeks, my skin will be completely clear.</li>
            <li> My skin has been clear and is of an even tone.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely clear the skin, but it lightens everything quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> you have sensitive skin , do not buy it .</li>
            <li> Can you really turn back time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 56 years old</li>
            <li> My skin is normally really sensitive to anything I put on my face</li>
            <li> So far the product as worked as planned.</li>
            <li> so far nothing.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin and using this product has not caused breakouts so far</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been seeing much spot (only one) reduction, but</li>
            <li> I work in the sun and have very olive tone skin, 3 kids later and 43 years, I&#x27;ve got several sun spots, especially near my eyes and jaw line.  </li>
            <li> I am very please with this L&#x27;Oreal product as well as several others.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t need as much covering up, but I actually got a couple of comments on my skin looking \\&quot;healthier lately\\&quot; upon using it.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning under my sunscreen &amp; moisturizer, and I can tell a real difference in the overall appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> Overall, my skin feels softer and happier, I highly recommend this creme!  </li>
            <li> I use this from Spring through early winter.</li>
            <li> So I nearly didn&#x27;t try this until I read some reviews and saw a couple of glowing testimonials on YouTube.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my sun spots will ever completely fade away</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin but seems like once I switched to night time</li>
            <li> but most have lightened at least two shades.</li>
            <li> Since using, my skin has cleared up (which isn&#x27;t the purpose of this but still) and is really soft and luminous.</li>
            <li> I started using the alba night cream, its all natural.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Loreal is the budget version of Lancome, and this product is nearly identical to Lancome&#x27;s Genifique, for a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> I REALLY wish I could take it back.</li>
            <li> I am really surprised that, for the price, this product works as well as it does.  </li>
            <li> Spots are fading and they aren&#x27;t nearly as noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 49 years old.  </li>
            <li> I would think if you want a completely unmarked face, you&#x27;d have to go to a dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> :  I continue to be happily surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li> I think the spots took around 2 to 3 weeks to fade completely</li>
            <li> so you have to watch if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I will never waste money on this again.</li>
            <li> However, I am still looking for something more moisturizing, but I would recommend trying it at least once.</li>
            <li> that was such a waste of money, I broke out even more</li>
            <li> SO bottom line it will work...if you are a hermit and live in a basement for the period you try it, but once your exposed to sun, it WILL CAUSE MORE SUN SPOTS and after that I was just left scarred and was becoming desperate.</li>
            <li> Typical, right!</li>
            <li> Boy, am I excited about L&#x27;oreal Youth Code Dark Spot Serum!</li>
            <li> Because of that, I&#x27;ll continue to use it but only until I find some more of the Clinique or some other product that produces the same results without triggering a gag reflex.</li>
            <li> This product not only clears dark spots it makes the overall appearance of face beam with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I think I need to use it for at least six months to see any real effects, but I do live in the fog and am rarely out in the sun, so one would think you would see the results a bit sooner.</li>
            <li> When applied, there is a slight moment of mild sting that imparts a sense that it is working.  </li>
            <li> if you try this product, TEST IT FIRST before committing to your entire face, unless you like wearing big sunglasses and a hat every where you go.</li>
            <li> The first bottle lasted me approximately 4 months, using a light amount each morning and evening.</li>
            <li> am also using this in conjuction with Pond&#x27;s Clarant B3, so I will come back to repost on that particular product, but this Youth Code serum just didn&#x27;t do it for me</li>
            <li> Wow, I never expected to get the results from this product that I&#x27;ve seen!</li>
            <li> I had very little hope for this product, but it was so cheap</li>
            <li> Thanks for alienating yet another one of your loyal customers L&#x27;Oreal.  </li>
            <li> I do have very sensitive skin and have had trouble with many other cosmetics as well.</li>
            <li> Everybody has different skin type and different reaction over certain skin care product.</li>
            <li> Also, my skin quality improved and my acne is totally gone (when I have a new spot I just apply this product and the spot dries out</li>
            <li> The new formula comes in a different bottle with a plastic cap over the pump.  </li>
            <li> To save your skin, not only should you change to a healthier diet that works with your body type and live style, you also need to avoid sun damage and change medication if you are taking any.</li>
            <li> DO REALLY LIKE the LUMINESCENCE of the accompanying YOUTH CODE SPF 30 MOISTURIZER, BUT my SKIN ENDS UP LOOKING GROSS BECAUSE IT PEELS INTO VISIBLE WHITE PIECES.</li>
            <li> and I had a lot of dark, dark spots on top of my hands.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t show much of the change for the first two weeks, but after two weeks, it started to show a little different on my face.</li>
            <li> When I was in my teen and early adult years, I was a major sun worshiper, always seeking to get the darkest tan I could.  </li>
            <li> After using it for mere 10 days my hyperpigmented skin looks much, much better!  </li>
            <li> After a week of using this product, however, I barely need make up!</li>
            <li> I put on my regular moisturizer and completely forgot about my foundation!  </li>
            <li> I have found that since using it on my cheeks and forehead, my skin seems a tiny bit plumper (thanks, peptides!), but my overall skin tone is definitely improved.</li>
            <li> so there no other proof that I need....</li>
            <li> I can only hope that they will disappear completely soon!</li>
            <li> I prefer other products a little more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking to even their skin tone, reduce a few light spots and doesn&#x27;t want to spend an extreme amount.</li>
            <li> The Avon dark spot corrector (Banishing Creme) is more effective and less expensive.</li>
            <li> I am very fair with oily skin and after using this product I no longer even need to wear makeup base.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It went on smooth, and lasted longer than I though (at least 4-5 weeks)</li>
            <li> When I stopped using it and went back, my pores were all clear again.</li>
            <li> It has had a big impact on my old acne scars.</li>
            <li> I have been using ever since and though my spots are not 100% gone (forget about that) they are barely visible.</li>
            <li> I recommend all natural products, such as castor oil and non-alcohol licorice extract.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had red acne marks on my cheeks since my early twenties, and I thought they were just going to be there forever.  </li>
            <li> I have used nearly all of the product and no further change has occurred.</li>
            <li> Seems to be lightening some of my old acne red areas and some of my brownish sun spots.</li>
            <li> This is about the least effective product I have tried for dark spots.</li>
            <li> the price is good, but when i received it, the package looks not very good, so, it&#x60;s hard to give my friend as a gift</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry your face out and is gentle enough to use under make up.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is saying how much improvement my skin has, and he is now a strong believer that \\&quot;expensive isn&#x27;t always better.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I applied Youth Code Dark Spot Serum Corrector directly to the age spots every morning and night for several weeks with no apparent change, if anything the spots seemed to become a little more noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying several treatments and products over the last 3-4 years to try to decrease the dark areas without much success.  </li>
            <li> - Will rate gain a few more months down the road!</li>
            <li> I used this for a few weeks so probably not long enough to be able to tell whether or not it worked on dark spots.</li>
            <li> I was hopping for dramatic results after over a moth of applying this product and yes, I have notable changes, clearer skin</li>
            <li> It shows minimal to almost none improvement on spots that are older than 5 years or longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I washed my face well and only put on a thin layer I still got more acne.</li>
            <li> Olay Wash, Olay 7, Bare Minerals powder foundation (not anymore!), Maybelline Instant Age</li>
            <li> old and live at the beach, Youth has removed all dark spots on my face and hands.</li>
            <li> It really help diminished my dark spots.</li>
            <li> so it is very noticeable if there is any dark spot on my face.</li>
            <li> It really works to remove dark spots/sun spots on my face.</li>
            <li> Really like this Dark Spot &amp; Illuminating Serum.</li>
            <li> It is by no means a miracle solution and requires consistent use over a few weeks, but there is still a noticeable improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> having had to daily, actually needing foundation/powder all over the face again, the overall look was less luminous, the tone was uneven(er) and generally my face didn&#x27;t look so hot.</li>
            <li> So each blemish is very visible for a very long time, LONG after the actual zit dies.</li>
            <li> It worked at only a little first after using it for about 3 months, but it seemed as if it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to try to combat a lot of the dark spots I have on my face from too much time in the sun when I was younger and age.  </li>
            <li> Sure it moisturizers, but did not diminish dark spots...at least not for me.</li>
            <li> I only apply this on my blemishes and it really makes them less visible.</li>
            <li> I started using the Dark Spot corrector and within a few days I noticed significant lightening of this one spot.  </li>
            <li> Well, good news, bad news.</li>
            <li> This really seems to even out my slightly age spotted complexion, I would buy again!</li>
            <li> I had previously tried Clinique, Aveeno and Bremenn&#x27;s Clinical Dark Spot Correctors, all without any success.</li>
            <li> update dec 2014 been using this product for 5 months started out with a bang but clogged my pores gave me extreme acne over last few months was faithful in my use made no change in laugh line no change in crows feet.</li>
            <li> Instead of removing the dark spots on my face, I added a ton of new ones.</li>
            <li> It made my skin very soft, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have some mild acne scars and uneven skin tone with slight redness on my cheeks and sides of my nose.  </li>
            <li> You only need a little  to make your skin feel soft and not dry.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I started out with any real issues like deep wrinkles or lots of lines, but I had been noticing darker places and an uneven tone that was making wearing a foundation a necessity!  </li>
            <li> I like how smooth and illuminating it makes your face, and it corrects some small spots I have, when I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> 3 years ago I was working at a pool during the summer and developed dark spots on my upper lip and forehead.</li>
            <li> My skin feels tight, almost like a wind burn, and is very sensitive to the heat.</li>
            <li> There is only one bad one so far on Amazon, but a broader search online reveals many stories like mine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this to remove some of the dark spots on my cheeks from old acne scars.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if they really work.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think ANY serum you apply to reduce dark spots is going to completely get rid of them.  </li>
            <li> After using this consistently for two months and finishing the product, I concluded it doesn&#x27;t work or at least on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the issue is except that it has way too much added water in the product.</li>
            <li> Does lighten the dark spots, but doesn&#x27;t obliterate them completely.</li>
            <li> It really works, but you have to use it everyday!  </li>
            <li> Have not used this long enough.</li>
            <li> I have problems with ingrown hairs leaving dark spots, it&#x27;s a major problem that has caused me to get medical strength skin lightener.</li>
            <li> It was absurdly embarrassing and became even more embarrassing when other people started commenting on it asking me what I had on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> Using the new moisturizer my skin still feels dry and terrible but when I used this L&#x27;Oreal product it felt great</li>
            <li> It is possible that an area of dark spots on my left forehead (from years of driving) are fading but not totally gone at this point.  </li>
            <li> Even though I use a very small amount, when it is hot and I sweat, the product causes my eyes to burn and blur.</li>
            <li> Seriously, a hour after I applied it for the first time</li>
            <li> It is because of this product that I am warming up to possibly trying out other L&#x27;Oreal products in the future.</li>
            <li> In an attempt to save money in these hard economic times, I decided to try a drugstore brand for my serum and purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I just remember there were \\&quot;Big promises, very little delivery\\&quot; when I was young</li>
            <li> Youth code makes your face feel real soft, I guess over time maybe some of the small wrinkles may go away.</li>
            <li> I spent nearly $70 on clinique&#x27;s dark spot corrector, with no improvement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a total bust, in my opinion, but I will have to search out a different product for the dark spots that still need some attention.</li>
            <li> (might take a while - it goes a long way)</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t mind as long as it does its job.</li>
            <li> so excuse the name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4stars because it took longer than I expected.  </li>
            <li> and I find myself getting whiffs of it all day long.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance as well, not overwhelming or irritating to my skin</li>
            <li> I have tried other dark spot cremes with very little success.  </li>
            <li> From reading other reviews, it seems that this product works differently for everyone.</li>
            <li> I will keep hunting for something better!  :(</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try other stuff in this line once I run out of my current moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say the same for other skin lighteners.</li>
            <li> have had acne scars for a very long time, and wanted something to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> In the winter, my skin is dry as heck</li>
            <li> and it got rid of my acne but not the scars, so to treat the dark spots I invested in Clinque dark spot corrector and WOW...</li>
            <li> does not live up to its claims.   </li>
            <li> After using this serum for two weeks I haven&#x27;t had a single unwanted reaction.</li>
            <li> I had really dark patches all over the place, especially on my cheeks and chin</li>
            <li> dark, &amp;#34;shadowy&amp;#34; marks from occasional breakouts</li>
            <li> and I can say without a doubt that none of my various types of dark spots have changed one bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say this totally removes the dark spots but they are fading.  </li>
            <li> Product did not lighten up my dark spots, and it made my pores look larger.</li>
            <li> I have several dark spots on my face from sun damage (I think).</li>
            <li> It has faded my dark spots enough that I don&#x27;t have to use foundation.  </li>
            <li> + on some designer creme to fade dark spots, and not only did it not work</li>
            <li> It does fade dark spots, but one can is not enough.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t contain any sunscreen and so recommends \\&quot;use with SPF 30 Day Cream to prevent the appearance of future dark</li>
            <li> My dark spots (sun spots, hyper-pigmentation)  have faded, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll ever be gone entirely.  </li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle faithfully on my face and hands.. where I am getting dark spots or liver spots..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 4 months and have seen a big improvement in the dark spots on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY very expensive products and some prescriptions as well.  </li>
            <li> This product works extremely well if your dark spot or brown spot is newly formed, as in less than 6 month.</li>
            <li> I had used the studio beauty alpha hydroxy acid for a month because I&#x27;d seen a hundred rave reviews on it, so I went down to the local walgreens to see what all the fuss was about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a week now and my skin has definitely settled down.</li>
            <li> I did a little research on dark reducing spot lotions going completely off of customer reviews.</li>
            <li> This product seemed to work at first, but after using it for a few months I noticed that I was getting a lot of blackheads, which I hardly used to get.  </li>
            <li> I am African American,I have a brown skin tone similar to Zoe Saldana and I have alot of hyperpigmentation from past acne.</li>
            <li> I feel less ruddy, which was a problem that remained after my acne cleared up last year.</li>
            <li> our brown spots are small and not really dark...</li>
            <li> Wish I could bring this mess back.</li>
            <li> I tried several other products like ROC multi-correction Garnier dark spot corrector.</li>
            <li> It broke me out, in tiny little bumps all over my face.</li>
            <li> still rolled into little, unattractive white pieces.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of acne marks on my cheeks, little red dots that make me look spotty even though I&#x27;m not!</li>
            <li> I took it as he advised and it didn&#x27;t clear up hardly at all.</li>
            <li> Like many women my age I&#x27;m being driven a little crazy by the appearance of age spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> So even if I have no active pimples, I still look very uneven and blemished.</li>
            <li> I used to have laser removing the dark spot, but the dark spot appeared back even darker.  </li>
            <li> They are A LOT more expensive but at least they work.</li>
            <li> I used it until the bottle was completely empty.  </li>
            <li> I think if you have faint spots/pigmentation this stuff is definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li> I am going to stick with this Loreal Youth Code Dark Spot Correcting Serum for a long while until....</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.</li>
            <li> but I see minimal results.</li>
            <li> There is a spa store where I work, and I had spent $40</li>
            <li> However, I must say that I saw improvement to the overall complexion of my skin within a few days.  </li>
            <li> I received a sample from a magazine, so there was not much to use.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for weeks, and it has made absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> It is slowly going away finally, but only after unwanted hardship and added expense.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am extremely skeptical of the ridiculously over-hyped claims for most women&#x27;s beauty products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a 2 months now in the morning and the evening on a few sunspots or minor age spots on my forehead and have seen no real change.</li>
            <li> I have dark spots (only a few) but they do bother me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African-American and didn&#x27;t want to use anything that was going to be harsh to get rid of some recent acne dark spots, and am against any chemical peels.  </li>
            <li> I used this for several weeks on a few dark spots on my skin, and could tell no difference.</li>
            <li> I was sincerely tired of paying the high price, though,</li>
            <li> With regular use, I definitely see brighter skin, and a serious reduction in even the oldest dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products, but none of them worked as well as this one.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll keep going with this and try some of the other product line.  </li>
            <li> I might purchase again or I might try other brand to compare results.</li>
            <li> It balls up if you wear it under other moisturizers or makup</li>
            <li> Following the terrible result, I searched product reviews and it seems many other users have had a similar reaction.</li>
            <li> It is also pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> Not much to lose if you&#x27;ve purchased it anyway!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this, but it really does work!  </li>
            <li> Not sure if they actually disappear</li>
            <li> I read some other reviews on here and thought i&#x27;d give this product a chance.  </li>
            <li> Goes on under other makeup without problems.</li>
            <li> I will order this again as it also works well with the other Loreal products</li>
            <li> I have tried the pricey Clinique and used it faithfully twice a day until it was gone...which was weeks, and saw absolutely no difference on the dark spots on my hands.</li>
            <li> I use to sell Estée Lauder, I have spent hundreds of dollars on serums that didn&#x27;t work as well as this!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any other changes in my skin appearance other than that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s winter here and after washing my face it feels like it is crawling off due to dryness.</li>
            <li> and it would probably only work the same or worse than those other products.</li>
            <li> various small dark spots that I assume are sun/age related&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, because my complexion is pale, whenever I had a breakout, it left behind a red or a dark mark for a long time.</li>
            <li> This product did not fade my dark areas due to sun damage.  </li>
            <li> I will say that my dark spots appear to be fading, but that could be because I am using other spot correcting products (e.g. face wash, toner, moisturizer) in addition to the serum.</li>
            <li> It is also not hurting my eyes like some of the other Dark Spot removal products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some other dark spot correctors and this one seems to beat the ones I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t work like other products tried it for weeks with no success.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anybody who has dark spots on their face.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Youth Code Dark Spt Serum for 3 weeks</li>
            <li> From years of boating and sun, I found that my face had a lot of freckles and dark spots.</li>
            <li> my dark spots have not diminish one bit and neither has the redness from acne marks.</li>
            <li> It was a bump that turned into a dark purple spot.</li>
            <li> Got this to lighten my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to have to just get used to these dark spots</li>
            <li> I have been using the dark spot correcting serum about 2 months now</li>
            <li> I have 2 dark spots that appeared on my forehead</li>
            <li> No visible reduction in dark marks/scars.</li>
            <li> My dark spots are genetic.  </li>
            <li> This has lots of hype; but I&#x27;ve used it about a month and can tell no difference in my dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I have dark spots on my face from sun damage and acne scarring.</li>
            <li> and I get dark spots from acne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now gone through two bottles of this and see no change in the dark spots.  </li>
            <li> Dark spots are still there.</li>
            <li> I was focused on what it is SUPPOSED to do - the dark spots.</li>
            <li> dark spots: m&#x27;eh.</li>
            <li> I have Eczema and dark spots had taken over my face.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how long does it takes to work on dark spots but</li>
            <li> It keeps my face moisturizer as well as lightens the dark spots.</li>
            <li> Although, if your dark spots are not that dark and just show a bit this is a product for you.</li>
            <li> Skin brighter, dark spots not gone but improved.</li>
            <li> WHETHER IT WORKS FOR DARK SPOTS</li>
            <li> my dark spots didn&#x27;t just disappear just then)</li>
            <li> and I noticed a difference in my dark spots as they have become lighter.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d be buying a lot of this stuff to see any improvement in my acne scar dark spots.</li>
            <li> I started seeing improvements with my dark spots fading.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that the container does not allow you to see when the product is running out...</li>
            <li> The dark spots are lighter.</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks, I noticed that dark spots on my face drastically faded.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product to help my dark spots from acne, and have used it for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> My dark spots are still there</li>
            <li> He suggested I use a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; dark spot corrector.  </li>
            <li> Also, NOT CHANGE IN DARK SPOTS- NOPE NOTHING, and I&#x27;ve been USING IT FOR 6 WEEKS.</li>
            <li> I picked up a bottle of L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Dark Spot Correcting &amp; Illuminating Serum about 2 weeks ago</li>
            <li> My dark spots have already begun fading dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just a moisturizer and DOES NOT correct dark spots.  </li>
            <li> My age spots are not even that dark to start with.</li>
            <li> Will not buy the L&#x27;Oreal Dark Spot Corrector again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I thought after using the entire thing I would at least see some difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try their dark spot corrector instead and see how that works.</li>
            <li> All the wrinkles and dark spots are still there.</li>
            <li> I have not found this product to have removed the dark spots on my skin</li>
            <li> I broke out after a week of using the product and my dark spots are still there.</li>
            <li> My dark spots have not changed.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem I have with my skin is \\&quot;age spots,\\&quot; dark splotches on my face, hands, arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> after just 4 days I noticed my dark spots were fading and every morning I would have a glow on my face.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about a month ago, and I have not notice any difference whatsoever with my dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a week, watching my dark spots slowly fade away.</li>
            <li> If you want a thick, instant lifting product, don&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the other brand names face products and got little or no results.</li>
            <li> , \\&quot;86% saw less dark spots;\\</li>
            <li> I have noticed a slight fade in my dark marks already</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past few weeks and have definitely noticed a difference in my dark acne scars!</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it is a little greasy but def will buy again</li>
            <li> It made my sun spots slightly lighter but that was it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a week and a half</li>
            <li> Both areas are significantly less noticeable and some of the lighter areas are gone.  </li>
            <li> but it got less noticeable every day.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, 1 oz does not last very long, but it&#x27;s still cheaper than other overpriced brands.</li>
            <li> I have blotchy uneven skin tone and sebborreah kerotisis that makes dark crusty spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I have been a user of Clinique&#x27;s Dark Spot Corrector for a few years.  </li>
            <li> I am very pale and got a number of dark splotches on my skin because I was not aware of a prescription side effect.  </li>
            <li> I tried to cover the spots up with make-up but for some reason it only made the dark spots look worse.</li>
            <li> Must wait a little while longer before I make up my mind</li>
            <li> and i see a little results.</li>
            <li> It might be due to an ingredient that is often used for anti-ageing purposes - Im not sure.</li>
            <li> it fades them a little but does not make them disappear</li>
            <li> After 4 weeks of use, it looks like my dark spots are fading!</li>
            <li> Maybe a little lighter</li>
            <li> Maybe a little lighter after a month.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t effect the dark spots!</li>
            <li> nothing a little face powder cant fix.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using it and seeing a difference little by little everyday.</li>
            <li> I had a spot beside my eye that was very dark.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I have spent hundred and hundred of dollars for the expensive tiny size of skin whitening products.</li>
            <li> Will update in a few months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of expensive prescriptions and over the counter potions that made my sensitive skin burn and peel, etc.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I have a few sun spots on my cheekbones and a reddish acne scar that has been bothering me for months.</li>
            <li> I have used this everyday for over 3 months to see if it would work.  </li>
            <li> If I could even see a small difference in the 3 months I used it, I would of had hope that this would work and help fade the dark spot.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> After a few days my age spots are diminishing.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now saw no diffarence in my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had medium acne for a few years and a few scars on the cheeks and forehead and this product has not helped.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> However, for someone with acne-prone skin trying to fade marks left behind this is not for you.</li>
            <li> I am on my fourth bottle, and I am addicted.  </li>
            <li> No serum works in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> I feel as if I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I was a lil skeptical about this purchase.</li>
            <li> I used this a few times...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I bought this product along with the cleanser and day cream and it took me a few weeks to realize (</li>
            <li> Weird to have my review under our joint account name, oh well....&lt;br /&gt;I have developed hyperpigmentation along my jaw line where my golf visor or baseball cap didn&#x27;t shade.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything to my uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li> dont try to microderm or any heavy grinding on your face.</li>
            <li> dont try to microderm or any heavy grinding on your face.</li>
            <li> I used this product everyday for a little over a month and saw very little to no difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> but sadly it has not corrected any of my dark spots even though I have been using it religiously for months.</li>
            <li> I suppose, but broke me out horribly which resulted in more dark spots.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I finally made it to the dermatologist the &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34; was veins near the surface of the skin and the dermatologist told me I should NOT be using ANYTHING on it, that it was probably irritating the area!</li>
            <li> It did slightly lighten the color, but if you weren&#x27;t looking, it would be hard to notice.  </li>
            <li> It did fade some of the discolorations, but the itching was bad enough not to want to use this product further.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 weeks now, and my dark spots have SERIOUSLY faded.  </li>
            <li> I no longer expect the spots to be removed, but I do expect the spots to at least lighten a little.  </li>
            <li> very little of the product in the container</li>
            <li> This is unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> Even small acne scars have not faded.  </li>
            <li> This item I purchased because of the brand name and it usually lives up to its name but not this time.  </li>
            <li> I ran out and I returned to my usual Olay 7 (you can use both</li>
            <li> i AM NOT SURE</li>
            <li> Not sure if its working for me or not.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement past my 3 month mark.</li>
            <li> I usually wear tinted moisturizer to even things out</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past 2 months and it has not shown any signs of clearing my scars/spots from acne.</li>
            <li> I even got a few compliments at work!</li>
            <li> i could see a change after just a few days!  </li>
            <li> Not sure if product was suppose to burn face.</li>
            <li> not really sure</li>
            <li> My skin is usually oily, and acne prone.</li>
            <li> Sorry this was long...</li>
            <li> Sorry this was long...</li>
            <li> I just got over a bad breakout and was left with post, dark acne spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and was concerned about having a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> As a woman of color its hard to find products that truly work on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I go out now with hardly any makeup on.</li>
            <li> Hard to tell.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work in the least for me...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t auto correct scars, or at least not immediately.</li>
            <li> and I used this product hoping that they would at least fade....</li>
            <li> You must give it at least three weeks, applying every day.  </li>
            <li> Did not notice a smell until it &amp;#34;melted.&amp;#34; Not offensive, but not nice either.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> complaint, however, is the smell.</li>
            <li> However, after using an entire bottle, I am disappointed to say I have not seen any improvement with my dark spots.  </li>
            <li> The Avon banishing creme is thick and non greasy, so I&#x27;ve been using them together until I run out of the Youth Code.</li>
            <li> slow</li>
            <li> This product seems to be working in that my spots are slowly disappearing.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately my spots were very dark on my pale skin, now they just look lighter with a month of use.</li>
            <li> so I was very shocked when i saw results right away.</li>
            <li> And it lasts -- the smell, I mean.</li>
            <li> Well, it is yet another addition to the list of useless items for removing dark spots.  </li>
            <li> It looks like very small bumps densely concentrated over every part of my skin&#x27;s surface where I applied the product.</li>
            <li> works alright - not much better or worse than the Clinique product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t work on my dark spots at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, though, and getting hard to find, so I decided to try L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s product since it&#x27;s a little less expensive and a lot easier to find.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This July I went on vacation to Costa Rica and because of the sun my sun spots were terrible and to add to that big acne crisis (looking back at the pictures I feel embarrassed).</li>
            <li> I am 23 and when I was a teenager I had terrible acne that left tons of red spots all over my face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive for lotion</li>
            <li> not the same as the product is not in conformity with regret bad seller</li>
            <li> The pump packaging wastes a lot of an expensive product.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, you won&#x27;t have to learn the hard way like I did!</li>
            <li> This stuff is way too expensive for my usual taste but a bottle lasts over a year and is standing proof in my opinion that all lotions are not created equal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d constantly walk away disappointed.</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because at the very least, it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> Hard to tell with this product whether or not those faint brown spots of freckles are fading.</li>
            <li> I use all Clinque products on my face but was tired of parting with $79 for their spot serum</li>
            <li> Tired of companies that claim to do &amp;#34;wonders&amp;#34; when in reality they don&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> and I noticed they were getting worse.  </li>
            <li> I was too poor to afford proactive</li>
            <li> I had high hopes when I made my purchase but was very disappointed with the lack of results.</li>
            <li> Horrible new fragrance they&#x27;ve added!  </li>
            <li> dramatic results</li>
            <li> However, if you have my skin type the serum does make your skin a little greasy and sticky (but not to a annoying level) thruought the day...</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I use a lot of foundation and</li>
            <li> However, it ended up being just expensive face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it can&#x27;t be returned.  </li>
            <li> greasy just was not impressed with the product and didn&#x27;t fell like it helped with the areas it was supposed too</li>
            <li> I know that sounds weird, but you&#x27;ll have to experience it to understand.  </li>
            <li> Useless?</li>
            <li> Sorry...</li>
            <li> I feel like its fake go buy this item at the store instead</li>
            <li> Also useless as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> You stopped me from looking like a weird dude every summer.</li>
            <li> That was really scary</li>
            <li> &quot; I must be one of the unfortunate 14%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it made me really insecure that now I couldn&#x27;t just leave the house with no make up on.</li>
            <li> Bored, I went to the cheap-o makeup products section, when I accidentally came across this product.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product along side the spot corrector cream since May 2013 and to my disappointment, it has not work at all.  </li>
            <li> must they put these gag-me artificial fragrances in everything?  </li>
            <li> and I started getting cold sores on my lips.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong!?</li>
            <li> That was very disturbing to me, so I was in search of something that would lighten them.  </li>
            <li> They are not gone, but they are very faint now.  </li>
            <li> sometime I get bad acne also on my forehead.</li>
            <li> The smell is not that bad.</li>
            <li> Not too bad.</li>
            <li> When I told her what I had been using she said the Youth Code was bad for my skin and contained ingredients that I wouldn&#x27;t want on my skin.</li>
            <li> My hyperpigmentation is still here :-(</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of it.</li>
            <li> WHY WOULD I HATE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> /&gt;Clinique was worthless for me too.  </li>
            <li> , it made me get sick to my stomach every time I used it!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I hated it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love how it makes my skin feel.  Have only used a week now, but am sure It will help my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have oily/combination skin (it kinda does what it wants to!), and African-American. I had used the studio beauty alpha hydroxy acid for a month because I&#x27;d seen a hundred rave reviews on it, so I went down to the local walgreens to see what all the fuss was about. Well, it burned my skin. I had really dark patches all over the place, especially on my cheeks and chin and it was so embarrassing and I hated it! So I bought this and the day cream, and have only been using it for a week and a half, both products day and night, and making sure to wear sunscreen. Well, my skin is nearly perfectly clear! I can&#x27;t even tell where the chemical burns were on my cheeks, and its very, very light on my chin. I&#x27;m guessing in about another two weeks, my skin will be completely clear. It already looks fantastic, and I can&#x27;t wait to only have to wear moisturizer/sunscreen because my goal is to not wear foundation anymore. Right now, I just use a BB cream with a stipple brush to cover up any discoloration, but soon I won&#x27;t have to! LOVE this product and it will definitely be a regular part of my routine, but I&#x27;ll probably just use  the day cream in the morning and the serum only at night once my skin is where it should be.</li>
            <li> I used this product everyday for a little over a month and saw very little to no difference in my skin. It didnt break me out but i will not be repurchasing. does not live up to its claims.   Maybe if you have very pigmented skin patches it may work. I didn&#x27;t have that much damage though.</li>
            <li> I bought this to remove some of the dark spots on my cheeks from old acne scars. Its is nice smelling lotion that I used under my daily moisturizer. It leaves my skin soft and moist but not greasy which I really like.It does not break me out which is a miracle in itself but sadly it has not corrected any of my dark spots even though I have been using it religiously for months. I will continue to use the bottle since it is almost done but I will not purchase again</li>
            <li> I really loved this product it made a great change on my face within 2 days.. Great product . I would recommend it to anybody who has dark spots on their face. It really works.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Youth Code Dark Spt Serum for 3 weeks and maybe it is just the power of wishful thinking but I think it has helped even out my skin tone. I have blotchy uneven skin tone and sebborreah kerotisis that makes dark crusty spots on my face. Th serum won,t work on these but it is very pleasant smelling and does not feel greasy and the best day and night cream I have tried. Will update in a few months</li>
            <li> I have used a more expensive product for many years and thought it did a good job at making the dark spots lighter, but once I tried Loreal Youth Code Dark Spot Serum I won&#x27;t go back to the more expensire product.  In about two weeks you can really see the difference.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> I used this for abou 6 months.  It did slightly lighten the color, but if you weren&#x27;t looking, it would be hard to notice.  It works as promised, I was hoping they would lighten more though.  Also, if you stop using these, they come right back.  you can&#x27;t be in the sun if you are using the product, or they will come back also.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter.  She loves how it makes her skin feel.</li>
            <li> This really seems to even out my slightly age spotted complexion, I would buy again!</li>
            <li> Products affordable, this is too perfect.</li>
            <li> I forget to use this every day as directed, however, the brown spots I target have faded!  I have tried other products, but none of them worked as well as this one.  Will continue to use it and will buy again.</li>
            <li> From years of boating and sun, I found that my face had a lot of freckles and dark spots. That was very disturbing to me, so I was in search of something that would lighten them.  I tried many other products, but this one seems to be doing the trick. I use it both day and night before moisturizing.  I am almost finished with my first bottle, and I can see a difference. I&#x27;ve already ordered a second one, and will continue until I am happy with the results. I would give it a try if you have similar problems.</li>
            <li> This product seemed to work at first, but after using it for a few months I noticed that I was getting a lot of blackheads, which I hardly used to get.  It does not seem as effective after a few months either.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product since I love the Youth Code BB cream and there were lots of positive reviews here and also on YouTube. I&#x27;m in my mid-50&#x27;s with very fair skin and have 3 different kinds of dark spots I was hoping to get rid of:&lt;br /&gt;1. dark, &amp;#34;shadowy&amp;#34; marks from occasional breakouts&lt;br /&gt;2. marks on my upper cheeks that I&#x27;ve had for years (I believe they are pregnancy/hormonal related)&lt;br /&gt;3. various small dark spots that I assume are sun/age related&lt;br /&gt;The lotion has a very nice consistency and texture and goes on smoothly. The smell is nice as well. I used the serum faithfully morning and night after washing my face for over 6 weeks now and I can say without a doubt that none of my various types of dark spots have changed one bit.&lt;br /&gt;Giving the product two stars because it is a very nice light moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use the rest of the bottle and will update if anything miraculous happens. (might take a while - it goes a long way)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  As a woman of color its hard to find products that truly work on my skin.  I won&#x27;t say this totally removes the dark spots but they are fading.  This is my 3rd bottle.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product along side the spot corrector cream since May 2013 and to my disappointment, it has not work at all.  my dark spots have not diminish one bit and neither has the redness from acne marks. i am still using it because i still have but i will not be purchasing it again.  the search continues</li>
            <li> I really hasn&#x27;t done anything for my spots at all.  And I have been using this for over 2 months.  Don&#x27;t think I will buy this product again</li>
            <li> I am on my third bottle of this product and I have given it plenty of time to be sure the results were there. I use all Clinque products on my face but was tired of parting with $79 for their spot serum so I decided to give this a try on the advice of a friend. It works! I apply it at night and morning under my clinque oil free moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve had no problems with breakouts. The dark spots that I get on my lower jaw in the sun when I play golf have been faded and the results are as good as my clinque product for a fraction of the price. I am sticking with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have skin darkening around my chin area from sun and hormone changes, I suppose. It has lightened it up and did so quickly. You need to only use one pump, so it lasts awhile. It&#x27;s very light and leaves no shine or oily feeling.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. It&#x27;s the perfect balance of hydration that&#x27;s not too oily. It has had a big impact on my old acne scars. It&#x27;s a little expensive for lotion but I&#x27;ll pay the price because it really is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;One note: I only use it once a day, not twice like it suggests. I find using it before bed, after washing my face, is all I need.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is just my skin, but this stuff really works and I cannot live without it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I have severe sun spots on my forehead. To add to that sometime I get bad acne also on my forehead. I tried several other products like ROC multi-correction Garnier dark spot corrector. It made my sun spots slightly lighter but that was it. I thought this was more expensive and it would probably only work the same or worse than those other products. This July I went on vacation to Costa Rica and because of the sun my sun spots were terrible and to add to that big acne crisis (looking back at the pictures I feel embarrassed). So after coming home I was in the supermarket and thought to myself, why not? I bought it and can honestly say I saw immediate difference (which I thought it was just maybe the product reflecting the light) but no, my spots were WAY lighter. I have been using ever since and though my spots are not 100% gone (forget about that) they are barely visible. Also, my skin quality improved and my acne is totally gone (when I have a new spot I just apply this product and the spot dries out straight away).&lt;br /&gt;Again, maybe it just works on my skin type, but I sure don&#x27;t want to be without it ever again. Cheers!</li>
            <li> This is unbelievable.  I am baffled!  After using it for mere 10 days my hyperpigmented skin looks much, much better!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good,I like this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year but the last time I purchased it through my subscription on Amazon I had to send it back -- Horrible new fragrance they&#x27;ve added!  I loved the old formula which comes in a container just as pictured in the product description - white pump with no removable cap.  The new formula comes in a different bottle with a plastic cap over the pump.  I fortunately found several packages of the old formula at a local store and I bought them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why must they put these gag-me artificial fragrances in everything?  Thanks for alienating yet another one of your loyal customers L&#x27;Oreal.  I&#x27;ll go find another product thanks.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me :(&lt;br /&gt;When I used it , I started to have breaks out but when my sister use it , it work perfectly .&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin , do not buy it .</li>
            <li> To be honest, when your over 70, I wonder if anything helps.  However I continue to purchase, and use daily.  Perhaps it does help, I dont want to stop to find out.  I must admit, my skin does feel smoother.</li>
            <li> I like it very much! I have many dark spots in my face with a lot of years. This time,I use it for two weeks,the dark spots have been significantly reduced,thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin prone to breakouts and in am in my 50s . My skin is much more even toned and did not breakout. I think this  did a better job than a$70 cream I bought</li>
            <li> I have noticed significant lightning on dark spots and over all texture improvement. I will purchase it again. Only as mall amount  is necessary each application.</li>
            <li> I have heard great things about this product and decided to try it.  Have been using it for about one month, twice daily.  I am very satisfied with Youth Code Dark Spot Serum Corrector, but feel that skin changes take a fairly long time to be apparent.  It is possible that an area of dark spots on my left forehead (from years of driving) are fading but not totally gone at this point.  Perhaps they will never be (without laser).  All in all it seems to be a very good product and feels good (smooth) on my skin.  I will continue to use it and update this review when appropriate.  I would certainly recommend giving  it a try!  .</li>
            <li> Product did not lighten up my dark spots, and it made my pores look larger. It also made my face break out.</li>
            <li> It works very well for me ,&lt;br /&gt;I love it ,</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work in the least for me...</li>
            <li> have not noticed any changes.</li>
            <li> I read about this product in a magazine. It was ranked #1 and the #2 item was $100. I figured for the price, what did I have to lose. I had a spot beside my eye that was very dark. You couldn&#x27;t miss it.. It was a bump that turned into a dark purple spot. After 28 days putting it on morning and night it&#x27;s just about gone! I have told several people about this product. It&#x27;s a light smell and a light feel that I put on every morning and night. I may never stop buying this product.</li>
            <li> Got this to lighten my dark spots. It did lighten my spots but did not eliminate them. I have been using it for about 2 months.</li>
            <li> Hard to tell with this product whether or not those faint brown spots of freckles are fading. It does have a lovely effect of leaving my skin feeling soft and moisturized without the oiliness.  I think I need to use it for at least six months to see any real effects, but I do live in the fog and am rarely out in the sun, so one would think you would see the results a bit sooner. Unfortunately, 1 oz does not last very long, but it&#x27;s still cheaper than other overpriced brands.</li>
            <li> I spent nearly $70 on clinique&#x27;s dark spot corrector, with no improvement. After a week of using this product, however, I barely need make up! I have very fair skin that scars easily, as in every zit leaves a dark spot, and this product improves the healing time for the blemishes I get.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I have no idea if it&#x27;s &amp;#34;correcting dark spots&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s a great primer for moisturizer and makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of claims about these products but I&#x27;m not sure if they really work. Can you really turn back time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way this is a good face moisturizer and I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t do any harm.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about a month ago.  The improvement has been so gradual that I haven&#x27;t really even noticed it, until this morning. I put on my regular moisturizer and completely forgot about my foundation!  I went about my morning routine and then when I looked in the mirror one last time before heading out the door, it dawned on me.  I had NO foundation on and my skin looked great!  That&#x27;s saying a lot.  I&#x27;m 56 years old and I admit that I&#x27;ve been blessed with youthful genes. I can&#x27;t say that I started out with any real issues like deep wrinkles or lots of lines, but I had been noticing darker places and an uneven tone that was making wearing a foundation a necessity!  I think I&#x27;ll keep going with this and try some of the other product line.  Oh, and an added bonus: My skin normally reacts quite badly to most regenerative type skin treatments, but so far....no problems at all!</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of it. My skin does not absorb it well. I can rub it off just like that.</li>
            <li> I was hopping for dramatic results after over a moth of applying this product and yes, I have notable changes, clearer skin but at some point stopped showing any improvements. I guess this all that is going to do for me. I don;t know if I ned to use it for a year so I can see improvment. My skin looks better, so it&#x27;s worth the try. I might purchase again or I might try other brand to compare results.</li>
            <li> I LLIKE THIS SKIN CORRECTOR IS VERY NICE...BUT IT DOESNT WORK WELL WITH ANY MAKEUP APPLIED AFERWARDS</li>
            <li> Its ok, not seeing results much. It balls up if you wear it under other moisturizers or makup</li>
            <li> After spending way too much on every product out there I figured I&#x27;d try this one.  Well, it is yet another addition to the list of useless items for removing dark spots.  I no longer expect the spots to be removed, but I do expect the spots to at least lighten a little.  There was zero difference between the before and after.  Won&#x27;t waste any more money on this product.</li>
            <li> ;IT TAKES TIME AND PATIENCE FOR THIS SERUM TO WORK.  IT HAS VERY FINE RATINGS, WHICH IS THE REASON I PURCHASED IT. I AM STILL USING IT, AS IT DOES NOT ERASE THE BROWN SPOTS OVER NIGHT.</li>
            <li> I have medium/dark skin that scars very easily, and is also prone to acne. I&#x27;ve tried tons of expensive prescriptions and over the counter potions that made my sensitive skin burn and peel, etc. So far I&#x27;m impressed with the improvement I&#x27;ve seen in the hyperpigmentation that&#x27;s plagued me for years. With regular use, I definitely see brighter skin, and a serious reduction in even the oldest dark spots. I&#x27;d definitely recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle.  It does not work at all.  Even small acne scars have not faded.  This is a waste of money.  Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping it would work like it said.  I used it until the bottle was completely empty.  My acne scars did not fade away like it described.  All it did was make my face feel silky but I expecting the multiple benefits that it promised.</li>
            <li> I have several dark spots on my face from sun damage (I think). I was hoping this product would lighten or eliminate those spots, but it didn&#x27;t. My overall skin quality has been better, though. I think my skin looks more illuminated and is smoother. From reading other reviews, it seems that this product works differently for everyone. It&#x27;s like anything...trial and error. It&#x27;s not a total bust, in my opinion, but I will have to search out a different product for the dark spots that still need some attention.</li>
            <li> I am in my early/ mid thirties and have just started to use some aging serums on my skin. I have relatively clear skin most of the time and although I tan quite easily, have tried to avoid suntanning in the past few years after much worshipping in my teens and 20s. I have a few sun spots on my cheekbones and a reddish acne scar that has been bothering me for months. I researched a lot of the more expensive dark spot and wrinkle creams (and other drugstore brands) and decided that on my first go, I&#x27;d like to try something gentle and a little more cost effective. Boy, am I excited about L&#x27;oreal Youth Code Dark Spot Serum! I&#x27;ve been using it (along with Neutrogena Wrinkle Repair Serum on alternating nights) for about two weeks now and I have already noticed quite a difference. My acne scar has faded significantly and the area where my sun spots are located looks much more even. Likewise, the serum is very light and gently and absorbs quickly and there is no distinctive odor. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking to even their skin tone, reduce a few light spots and doesn&#x27;t want to spend an extreme amount. I am not sure how well or how long it would take to work if you have darker, more abundant dark spots and scars, but for me it was the perfect choice!</li>
            <li> I use creams that make my face feel good and don&#x27;t break me out. I don&#x27;t expect any cream to turn back time or solve all my skin problems. I bought this when it was being offered at a good price on Amazon I have tried other dark spot cremes with very little success.  I have this one very noticeable spot on my cheek bone and I have just gotten used to covering it up with concealer.  I started using the Dark Spot corrector and within a few days I noticed significant lightening of this one spot.  It hasn&#x27;t completely disappeared but it is becoming less noticeable.  I have combination skin with the occasional break out.  This did not cause any break outs for me at all.  I also do not like strong fragrances and this cream has a fragrance I can tolerate.  It goes on smoothly and I have not had any issues with my foundation or bb cream application over this cream.  I thought I was going to have to just get used to these dark spots but this lotion has really been beneficial to my skin. I just placed an order for another bottle.</li>
            <li> I got a couple bottles of this when there was a good deal.  I really like the smell and it&#x27;s not sticky at all.  One push is all I need to smooth on my face.  I feel it&#x27;s making my face smooth.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> It does its job. Love this item</li>
            <li> NOT an overnight fix, but after 2 bottles this stuff it really started working great and had HUGE noticeable difference</li>
            <li> Packaging does not allow for use of entire product. The pump packaging wastes a lot of an expensive product. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I saw a BIG difference in just one use! My scars were like 10x lighter &amp; it came in a day! But it doesn&#x27;t look like there is a lot of product in it but so worth the money best spot corrector  I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> This product made my face darker in a matter of days... So I thought it&#x27;s because I wasn&#x27;t using the day cream. So I bought it and it didn&#x27;t improve anything!!! Very disappointed...I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it!</li>
            <li> Wow, I never expected to get the results from this product that I&#x27;ve seen! My skin is very prone to breakouts, and I have a rather neutral skin tone. So each blemish is very visible for a very long time, LONG after the actual zit dies. So even if I have no active pimples, I still look very uneven and blemished. Needless to say, I use a lot of foundation and concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few dark spot treatments in the past without great results, but I figured I might as well give this one a shot since it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive and received good reviews. I am so very glad that I did! Over the last 4 weeks, my spots have been fading, slowly but surely! I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s an overnight difference, but you should be able to see a change in 1-2 weeks. When I wash off my makeup at night, I can&#x27;t believe that my skin finally looks clear-ish again. I can&#x27;t wait to see what continued use does!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could give this product 10 stars, I would! Keep up the amazing work, L&#x27;Oreal!</li>
            <li> I began using this product on a Thursday. By the following Tuesday morning, I had a rash all over my face. It looks like very small bumps densely concentrated over every part of my skin&#x27;s surface where I applied the product. My skin feels tight, almost like a wind burn, and is very sensitive to the heat. I went to the doctor and he suggested I take Benadryl. I took it as he advised and it didn&#x27;t clear up hardly at all. I went back to see the doctor and he gave me an oral steroid. It is slowly going away finally, but only after unwanted hardship and added expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a reaction like this to any skin care product. I take very good care of my skin and am very disciplined in my routine. In an attempt to save money in these hard economic times, I decided to try a drugstore brand for my serum and purchased this product. I trusted this brand as I was a Biotherm user for many years. Following the terrible result, I searched product reviews and it seems many other users have had a similar reaction. There is only one bad one so far on Amazon, but a broader search online reveals many stories like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know not everyone has the same reactions to products. I don&#x27;t like the odds though. In subsequent conversations with friends about it, almost everyone I talked to knew someone who had the same experience with \\&quot;a L&#x27;Oréal anti-aging product\\&quot;. Why risk it? I&#x27;ll go back to paying more for the Clinique Dark Spot Corrector.</li>
            <li> I have been using the dark spot correcting serum about 2 months now and Wow! What a difference in my skin! I am 23 and when I was a teenager I had terrible acne that left tons of red spots all over my face.  After reading the reviews on here I decided to take a chance and buy it. My skin feels silky smooth and almost all of my red spots are gone! My skin is normally really sensitive to anything I put on my face and this didn&#x27;t irritate it at all! I don&#x27;t even use foundation anymore! I am looking forward to buying the new texture perfecter after this bottle to minimize my pores.</li>
            <li> It really does work! Unfortunately my spots were very dark on my pale skin, now they just look lighter with a month of use. I think if you have faint spots/pigmentation this stuff is definitely worth it.  I just need something more heavy duty!</li>
            <li> So far the product as worked as planned. I&#x27;ve had it for a week now and my skin has definitely settled down. It doesn&#x27;t auto correct scars, or at least not immediately. It does however soothe the skin and tones it. Hopefully with a more consistent application it will do what it is meant to. The smell is not that bad. It reminds me of foundation smell.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product would be the answer I was looking for.  I have 2 dark spots that appeared on my forehead and I used this product hoping that they would at least fade....so far nothing.  Hope to find something out there that works!</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a month. I have oily skin and using this product has not caused breakouts so far</li>
            <li> No visible reduction in dark marks/scars. It is also pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> I love it. It really help diminished my dark spots.</li>
            <li> A serum is a serum is a serum. Nothing special that I found, it went on smooth and as you know serums are better than creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to determine how much of a financial investment you&#x27;re going to put towards your facial routine.</li>
            <li> I am a 40  year old Caucasian female with &#x27;fair&#x27; skin.  I do not spend much time in the sun (am told otherwise to get Vitamin D).  My dark spots are genetic.  I have one spot just below my check on my left side.  I decided to give this a try (first time trying to tackle this).  I have used this everyday for over 3 months to see if it would work.  I am here to say that it does not!  If I could even see a small difference in the 3 months I used it, I would of had hope that this would work and help fade the dark spot.  There was NO change.  Save your money and do not try this product.  Need to look cause I would love to see that there is some sort of money back guarantee so I can return the remains and get a refund.  If I was able to give it no stars, I would of done that.</li>
            <li> This has lots of hype; but I&#x27;ve used it about a month and can tell no difference in my dark spots.  I will not be purchasing another bottle.</li>
            <li> I am an Asian woman but I have very light skin tone. My skin gets freckles easily so I have to use some kind of whitening skin serum to control my freckles not to look obvious on my face. Asians don&#x27;t look good with freckles though. Anyway, I have spent hundred and hundred of dollars for the expensive tiny size of skin whitening products. They worked for  a couple of  years but once your skin get used to a skin care product for years, it will not work again. So I have to look for something new. I went to CVS store and saw this dark spot correcting serum was on sale and sounds pretty good deal to me. I doubt it if this unexpensive product would work for my face. I was standing in front of this product keep thinking and thinking. Well, might as well give it a try, and if it doesn&#x27;t work, just throw it away because it is not expensive. I bought one and gave it a try. It didn&#x27;t show much of the change for the first two weeks, but after two weeks, it started to show a little different on my face. I feel like my skin is smoother, and clearer. I don&#x27;t like to wear make up at all so it is very noticeable if there is any dark spot on my face. My face look clearer and clearer every week and up until now I am using the third bottle. I do get a lot of compliments about how smooth, clear and clean my face look. I have bought one bottle from CVS store when it was on sale again. Also, I just ordered two more bottle online to stock up. I am going to stick with this Loreal Youth Code Dark Spot Correcting Serum for a long while until....I don&#x27;t know yet but will update whenever I stop. Give it a try if you are reading my review. Everybody has different skin type and different reaction over certain skin care product. However, with this price it won&#x27;t hurt to give your face a chance to become baby skin again :) it works for me and hope it works for you!</li>
            <li> This product may work for some, but for me, it did nothing, nada, zip. I&#x27;ve applied it faithfully day and evening and see no results at all. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am biracial, African American/Caucasian. I have dark spots on my face from sun damage and acne scarring. I have tried MANY very expensive products and some prescriptions as well.  This has worked better than anything I have ever tried - I have been using this serum for only a week and have had significant improvement!  I am hopeful that with further use my skin will improve even more.</li>
            <li> No marks or tears when I opened the package. The product came fast and it was in excellent condition as expected. I am using it and it works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it and it made my skin way better and back to when I was a child.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This line has worked really well for me.  I have a lot of blotches on my face from freckles/sun exposure and its reduced the appearances a lot.</li>
            <li> Been using this product over 2 years.  Very satisfied with results</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I can use that moisturizes without causing breakouts.  As I&#x27;ve gotten older, this has been a great product for me.</li>
            <li> I only apply this on my blemishes and it really makes them less visible. It took its time and I don&#x27;t mind as long as it does its job.</li>
            <li> It made my skin very soft, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;I have tan skin and I get dark spots from acne.&lt;br /&gt;I used it once a day, but only sporadically (not every day).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think ANY serum you apply to reduce dark spots is going to completely get rid of them.  This lotion is pretty good, though.  I am very pale and got a number of dark splotches on my skin because I was not aware of a prescription side effect.  After about a year, these splotches are greatly reduced, though not totally gone.  This product does a great job, considering its reasonable price.  I guess the big lesson here is to wear hats and use sunscreen when you go outside.  It also helps to know the side effects of the prescriptions you&#x27;re on.  Hopefully, you won&#x27;t have to learn the hard way like I did!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now gone through two bottles of this and see no change in the dark spots.  Will try something else.</li>
            <li> Eh. Haven&#x27;t been seeing much spot (only one) reduction, but like the texture and will continue to use. Pleasant on skin.</li>
            <li> This item I purchased because of the brand name and it usually lives up to its name but not this time.  I tried this for several weeks and have yet to see any change, any difference, anything/sign that this is working!  Dark spots are still there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using it and seeing a difference little by little everyday. I apply it in the am and pm before bedtime. I only use the serum, not a combination pack.</li>
            <li> not the same as the product is not in conformity with regret bad seller</li>
            <li> I loved this product when I first started it as a sample it does the job spots go away quick</li>
            <li> It works! After using it just overnight. I can tell the difference. After a few days my age spots are diminishing.</li>
            <li> I work in the sun and have very olive tone skin, 3 kids later and 43 years, I&#x27;ve got several sun spots, especially near my eyes and jaw line.  This product has worked wonderfully, I&#x27;ve noticed diminishing and lightening of all of the spots.  It&#x27;s very light weight.  Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Amazing product noticed a difference after 3 days!! Love the fragrance as well, not overwhelming or irritating to my skin</li>
            <li> This product did not make a difference in my age spots. I will not purchase it again.  A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using product for almost 1 month and my dark spots are getting lighter in color and love the smell and how it feels on my face.</li>
            <li> Started applying from the day one when products arrived till today which will be a month already. Doesn&#x27;t seem any difference.</li>
            <li> Works great will buy again</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning and before bedtime. Haven&#x27;t seen any difference yet but I&#x27;ll stick to it for now.</li>
            <li> This product not only clears dark spots it makes the overall appearance of face beam with a healthy glow. Although I only slightly recognized a difference in the first couple days of use after a couple weeks now, everyday my skin seems to look better and better.</li>
            <li> I am very please with this L&#x27;Oreal product as well as several others. I have find L&#x27;Oreal to be of better quality than most other product brands in this beauty regime.</li>
            <li> Sneaky because it didn&#x27;t work overnight or perform miracles, but stop using it and see!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USUAL ROUTINE: Olay Wash, Olay 7, Bare Minerals powder foundation (not anymore!), Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Eraser Concealer spot treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I didn&#x27;t see much improvement bc I was focused on what it is SUPPOSED to do - the dark spots. , which weren&#x27;t budging. BUT, I used the whole bottle because it was a fine moisturizer and didn&#x27;t stink, wasn&#x27;t greasy, I didn&#x27;t break out, and it didn&#x27;t burn my eyes (HUGE plus bc some ALWAYS gets in my eyes!). I noticed my frown line was less, well, noticeable, and my face seemed to be having a good phase. I ran out and I returned to my usual Olay 7 (you can use both but for me that was begging for a breakout). After a month my skin was going through a rougher phase. Suddenly I was spot treating parts I&#x27;d forgotten having had to daily, actually needing foundation/powder all over the face again, the overall look was less luminous, the tone was uneven(er) and generally my face didn&#x27;t look so hot. Not horrible, but needed way more work. I&#x27;d forgotten about having to deal with this because the change had been gradual, I guess. Figured \\&quot;well, guess that Youth Code was doing SOMETHING\\&quot; and it certainly was. I returned to it and within a week, the skin was luminous again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So dark spots: m&#x27;eh. Overall look: YEAH! Again, no miracle, but it&#x27;s nice to not yell \\&quot;GAH!\\&quot; in the mirror in the morning and needing only spot treatments - not foundation. Moisturizes very nicely, spreads well and dries NOT greasy, no breakouts, safe eyes... I&#x27;d say try it and finish the bottle before judging. Not much to lose if you&#x27;ve purchased it anyway! And I&#x27;d say only YOU will notice bc you won&#x27;t need as much covering up, but I actually got a couple of comments on my skin looking \\&quot;healthier lately\\&quot; upon using it. So it just might sneak up on you!</li>
            <li> I give it one start because it made my skin feel amazing and very well hydrated.(I have dry-normal skin) I am African American,I have a brown skin tone similar to Zoe Saldana and I have alot of hyperpigmentation from past acne. I used the product twice daily after cleansing and toning my face and applied a sunscreen after letting the serum sink into my skin for about 10-15mins. After using this consistently for two months and finishing the product, I concluded it doesn&#x27;t work or at least on me. My hyperpigmentation is still here :-( but it did hydrate my skin and made it softer</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after seeing all of the great reviews. Instead of removing the dark spots on my face, I added a ton of new ones. I tried to give it a full week to work but each day I gained more than 2 new pimples.</li>
            <li> for me, it didnt work. It smells fine, but I think my skin broke out a little after using it for a week. I would pass on this. Look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> It truly works.  I like how smooth and illuminating it makes your face, and it corrects some small spots I have, when I use it everyday.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Too soon to fully evaluate the benefits of this - Will rate gain a few more months down the road!</li>
            <li> i gave this 3 stars because i havent used this product long enouth only a mounth, but my face feels so smooth with it on</li>
            <li> With in 2 weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a change in my skin. I have Eczema and dark spots had taken over my face. I can see my skin coming back to it&#x27;s naturaul color. Awesome product!  Q. Kosmides</li>
            <li> This product did not fade my dark areas due to sun damage.  it did not help with redness either.  it smelled nice though!.</li>
            <li> This did not change the appearance of my scars one bit.&lt;br /&gt;I have had acne scars for a very long time, and wanted something to get rid of them. This is not the product to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It went on smooth, and lasted longer than I though (at least 4-5 weeks) However, it ended up being just expensive face moisturizer. I bought one for myself and for my girlfriend. Neither of us had any noticeable results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend. Tired of companies that claim to do &amp;#34;wonders&amp;#34; when in reality they don&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I am not sure how long does it takes to work on dark spots but the product itself&lt;br /&gt;is very good. Leaves your skin feeling very soft. I use it day and night time. My skin is always super dry&lt;br /&gt;and this product leave my skin feeling smooth. Love it!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it. I am very fair with oily skin and after using this product I no longer even need to wear makeup base. I just put this on with an SPF 30 lotion on top and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews, I was expecting to love this but after using it only once a day for a week my face broke out in a unsightly rash.  I do have very sensitive skin and have had trouble with many other cosmetics as well. I quit using the product and the rash improved within 5 days or so but I definitely will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using this product for about two months now but we are not seeing improvements eventhough our brown spots are small and not really dark...</li>
            <li> This is a great serum! It goes on amazing and smells awesome! It could work as a primer too because my foundation and/or concealer go on quite nicely over this serum. As far as its efficacy in correcting dark spots, I am not 100% certain yet as I have only used it for 3 weeks and want to give it the full 8 weeks before I decide. I will say that my dark spots appear to be fading, but that could be because I am using other spot correcting products (e.g. face wash, toner, moisturizer) in addition to the serum. It&#x27;s worth a try if for no other reason than the smooth texture it gives your skin after application!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a 2 months now in the morning and the evening on a few sunspots or minor age spots on my forehead and have seen no real change.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well if your dark spot or brown spot is newly formed, as in less than 6 month. It works OK if they have been on your skin for a while like in a year or so. It shows minimal to almost none improvement on spots that are older than 5 years or longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is not the only solution you should seek. To save your skin, not only should you change to a healthier diet that works with your body type and live style, you also need to avoid sun damage and change medication if you are taking any. Medication like oral contraceptives can cause brown spot on some people, ask your doctor if you notice your skin change after taking medication.</li>
            <li> It smells nice I suppose, but broke me out horribly which resulted in more dark spots. Creating more of a problem than fixing the problem it&#x27;s suppose to fix-- how ironic.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product out, as I want to even out my complexion.  The smell was really nice and it felt great on my skin.  However, in one day, it made my face completely break out!  Unfortunately, it can&#x27;t be returned.  I won&#x27;t buy something like this on Amazon again; will buy at a local store so I can return it when it doesn&#x27;t work.  I will keep hunting for something better!  :(</li>
            <li> I am hooked on this product!  It has faded my dark spots enough that I don&#x27;t have to use foundation.  Since I am closer to 70 than 60, that is saying a lot!  After applying it to my face twice a day, I rub the rest on the backs of my hands. Even my husband noticed the difference when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all on brown skin!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff; have used for months and months and can&#x27;t say it is strong in the &amp;#34;dark spot correcting&amp;#34; column, but it does &amp;#34;illuminate&amp;#34;.  It definitely brightens my skin.  I use it with 2 other L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code items and am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> This product really works. It took me only a couple of days to see results. It keeps my face moisturizer as well as lightens the dark spots. It is also very affordable, and came quicker than I anticipated. I will def order from this seller again!</li>
            <li> Overpriced and underperforms... This &amp;#34;Youth Code&amp;#34; has done nothing for my age spots and I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 months now. Works like a moisturizer but does not work well enough to do what it claims. The Avon dark spot corrector (Banishing Creme) is more effective and less expensive. The Loreal product is watery and streaks as you put it on. It hasn&#x27;t given me a rash, but it does clog my pores and I am getting breakouts where I never did before. I&#x27;m not sure what the issue is except that it has way too much added water in the product. The Avon banishing creme is thick and non greasy, so I&#x27;ve been using them together until I run out of the Youth Code. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone for age spots, period.</li>
            <li> I was a  it unsure of this product when I purchased it and saw some reviews. However I must say I am quite pleased with the product and I have since re-ordered. I love the product because it works for me. My skin has been clear and is of an even tone. Really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> Helped brighten up dark/brown spots but not that much. If you&#x27;re tan skinned and have brown spots this is not the product for you. I recommend all natural products, such as castor oil and non-alcohol licorice extract. They are must cheaper than this. Although, if your dark spots are not that dark and just show a bit this is a product for you. I just didn&#x27;t think it helped me that much. BEEN USING SINCE JUNE 8TH (longer than the 4 week result showing system), and it just ran out but I see minimal results. Maybe if I buy another one it MIGHT help, but I&#x27;m not going for it. Not worth the price, buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> Excellent results, immediate difference. Skin brighter, dark spots not gone but improved.</li>
            <li> Started using this after seeing the review in Good Housekeeping. I use this every morning under my sunscreen &amp; moisturizer, and I can tell a real difference in the overall appearance of my skin. Since turning 40, I&#x27;ve noticed more fine lines and dark spots, and since I&#x27;ve started using this product, both have seemingly improved. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s psychological or if there really is a difference, but either way, I plan to keep using it.</li>
            <li> WHETHER IT WORKS FOR DARK SPOTS i AM NOT SURE, i USE IT AS A MAKEUP PRIMER AND FIND THAT IS MY FAVORITE. tHANKS!</li>
            <li> It really works to remove dark spots/sun spots on my face. I tried many products &amp; they are very harsh on my skin (for spot removal). Better than laser treatment which didn&#x27;t last very long for me. I now have a nice, even, smooth skin without too much work! Got nice compliments from coworkers. Even my husband said my skin has never looked this great and we&#x27;ve been married for 22 years!</li>
            <li> Okay so writing this on my BF&#x27;s account so excuse the name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review:&lt;br /&gt;  I have dark spots (only a few) but they do bother me. So, in search of a product to correct them I came across this wonderful product. Seriously, a hour after I applied it for the first time and I went into the bathroom to shower I noticed my face was glowing and was instantly lighter(of course my dark spots didn&#x27;t just disappear just then) but I was so surprised how it effected my skin so fast! It&#x27;s been about a week and a half and I noticed a difference in my dark spots as they have become lighter. The only downside to this product is that it has made my face break out.but only a little..and knowing my luck I&#x27;m most likely the only person who this has happens to lol! I would have reviewed this product with 5stars if I didn&#x27;t break out. But other wise I do recommend!</li>
            <li> Yes, it works in combine with the cream.  My dark spot is disappearing to just light brown.  I used to have laser removing the dark spot, but the dark spot appeared back even darker.  I will continue using this brand because it works!</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t worked well at all. The advertisements make it sound good.</li>
            <li> Not sure if its working for me or not.  Must wait a little while longer before I make up my mind</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, honestly. I figured I&#x27;d be buying a lot of this stuff to see any improvement in my acne scar dark spots. So, I put it on, and then I put on my SPF moisturizer, and next time I looked in the mirror my spots were almost gone. It looked as though I had put foundation on them. Amazing.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this, but it really does work!  There is a spa store where I work, and I had spent $40+ on some designer creme to fade dark spots, and not only did it not work, it made me get sick to my stomach every time I used it!  I formed dark spots after years of being on birth control, then having babies (probably my own fault for not using sunblock, but I digress).  I trusted the reviews of this product and gave it a shot.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 weeks now, and my dark spots have SERIOUSLY faded.  They are not gone, but they are very faint now.  Large portions of my forehead where discolored, and I have a big spot under my eye.  I don&#x27;t wear any makeup other than mascara, and I feel confident that my skin looks good for the first time in as long as I can remember!  Overall, my skin feels softer and happier, I highly recommend this creme!  Oh, and I use sunblock on my face now to prevent new spots from forming  ;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been three weeks now since i started using this and i see a little results.</li>
            <li> TREMENDOUS!!!  WILL BE ORDERING MORE MUY PRONTO!</li>
            <li> Well, good news, bad news. I was using the &amp;#34;other stuff,&amp;#34; the name and composition of which escapes me right now, to hide a large spot on my nose. I bought this because of the good reviews and the cheaper price. The spot was lighter right away! Unfortunately, when I finally made it to the dermatologist the &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34; was veins near the surface of the skin and the dermatologist told me I should NOT be using ANYTHING on it, that it was probably irritating the area! Typical, right! Two seconds at the dermatologist with the nitrogen or whatever it is and the &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34; is all but invisible now. The moral of the story is get your spots checked!</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it. Will be buying more so I&#x27;m told!!</li>
            <li> I just got over a bad breakout and was left with post, dark acne spots on my face. I have been using this product for a week now and it has made a noticeable difference. The dark marks have faded a bit, and my complexion does look more even. Considering this product is a drugstore spot corrector, It does works pretty good. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily, It goes on really smooth and light.</li>
            <li> I use this from Spring through early winter. My sun spots are fading and my skin looks more even toned.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now saw no diffarence in my skin it is really light weight and non- greasy just was not impressed with the product and didn&#x27;t fell like it helped with the areas it was supposed too</li>
            <li> I never write comments, but this product was that good.  I&#x27;m African-American and didn&#x27;t want to use anything that was going to be harsh to get rid of some recent acne dark spots, and am against any chemical peels.  I only gave it 4stars because it took longer than I expected.  I think after week 3/4 I started seeing improvements with my dark spots fading.  However, I must say that I saw improvement to the overall complexion of my skin within a few days.  It was more luminous. lol  I know that sounds weird, but you&#x27;ll have to experience it to understand.  Honestly, once my spots started fading, I would have to question if I scrubbed all my makeup off because my skin was very pretty (if I do say so myself).  I bought this after watching a youtube video about it.  Worth it.  :)</li>
            <li> I am extremely skeptical of the ridiculously over-hyped claims for most women&#x27;s beauty products. And I believe in aging gracefully and not being too image and youth-obsessed as so much of our culture today seems to be. So I nearly didn&#x27;t try this until I read some reviews and saw a couple of glowing testimonials on YouTube. I have to say I am so glad I tried it, because this stuff absolutely WORKS! I am very fair, with freckles, and I do a lot of gardening, so I had some sun damage and mottled brown patches on my skin. Also, because my complexion is pale, whenever I had a breakout, it left behind a red or a dark mark for a long time. I have been using this serum morning and evening under my moisturizer, on my face, neck and chest for about one month, and I am ASTONISHED at the remarkable difference it has made. My skin is VERY noticeably smoother, clearer, more even toned, glowing and healthy. It has completely faded brown spots and old acne spots, leaving me a creamier, smoother, more beautiful complexion than I have ever had in my life! I have received many compliments since using this. I hope it works as well for everyone else as it has for me!</li>
            <li> very little of the product in the container</li>
            <li> This was for my wife and it is working well for her.</li>
            <li> Really like this Dark Spot &amp; Illuminating Serum. I have had it for 3 weeks and I really see a difference. It is also not hurting my eyes like some of the other Dark Spot removal products.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman with hyper-pigmentation marks over my face from acne. It worked at only a little first after using it for about 3 months, but it seemed as if it stopped working. I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement past my 3 month mark. However, this did make my skin extremely smooth and I would always get compliments. For scars I recommend Tea tree oil and bentonite clay masks.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the other brand names face products and got little or no results. This Youth Code Spot Serum Corrector along with the mositurizer is the best, I am seeing results and will highly recommend it. It really works!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Nicole</li>
            <li> I was interested in this product, but will decline from purchasing it because L&#x27;Oreal continues to test their products on animals and to use ingredients tested on animals.    (...)    See also PETA.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stunned.  Nothing works on me so I can&#x27;t believe this thing actually works. I&#x27;ve been using it exactly one month and I can&#x27;t believe my sun spots are actually lightening up.  My two most problematic spots are showing the most improvement.  I don&#x27;t think my sun spots will ever completely fade away but I will keep using the product to see how light they can get. I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue this, I will need more soon.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my skin feel. When applied, there is a slight moment of mild sting that imparts a sense that it is working.  The only negative is that the container does not allow you to see when the product is running out...regardless, I would definitely purchase again.  At the risk of repeating myself, this product feels great immediately after application!</li>
            <li> I have wasted money on so many creams and products and none of them come close to this. I only bought this because it was affordable and at the checkout stand so i decided to give it a try. My expectations were low so I was very shocked when i saw results right away. My dry and dead skin wiped away after using it making it bright smooth! My skin tone has evened out too. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Works great! Glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> Smells good and feels nice.  I have only been using it for a week, watching my dark spots slowly fade away.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for approx 4 days and have yet to see a difference in brown spots.  Will get back with another review after 14 days.</li>
            <li> It does fade dark spots, but one can is not enough. It ran out before the treatment was completed. They should sell a larger size</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how much my husband and I love this product! We use it as a night time moisturizer as it does not have SPF. Get rid of dullness, shadows and any unsightly marks!</li>
            <li> First of all some background. I&#x27;m 29 and am starting to look for a skin care regimine for my changing skin. I have sun damage, aka freckles, fine lines, dark spots from acne, and a ruddy complexion.  My skin tone has never ever been even or anything close to even. I&#x27;m white with a mildly olive complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so on to the product. I love it!!!!  I wasn&#x27;t sure at first that it was working and got discouraged. I went from using it twice a day to only once. I thought it was breaking me out bc I have sensitive skin but seems like once I switched to night time only I started to see results,  I&#x27;m about two weeks in and there is a huge difference. My skin is evenly toned. Like  I&#x27;ve NEVER seen it before. My freckles are still there but most have lightened at least two shades. Dark spots from acne mostly gone and the ones that are left are getting lighter. Fine lines are less noticeable and seems to be disappearing?  Not sure if they actually disappear but that is where the \\&quot; I&#x27;m not sure exactly what this stuff is doing\\&quot; part comes in.  My skin feels amazing and looks amazing too. It has a glow that I&#x27;ve never had before. I usually wear tinted moisturizer to even things out but now I dont have to. It really has done wonders for me. I can&#x27;t wait to try other stuff in this line once I run out of my current moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past 2 months and it has not shown any signs of clearing my scars/spots from acne. I was really hoping that a product from the L&#x27;Oreal would be great, but this hasn&#x27;t worked for me. I&#x27;ve had medium acne for a few years and a few scars on the cheeks and forehead and this product has not helped.</li>
            <li> Although I am 73 yrs. old and live at the beach, Youth has removed all dark spots on my face and hands. Love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and I&#x27;m beginning to see a difference in my skin. The dark spots are lighter. I&#x27;ll continue to use it: I&#x27;m looking forward to even better results with continued use.</li>
            <li> I used this for several weeks on a few dark spots on my skin, and could tell no difference.</li>
            <li> Works well if I remember to use it!</li>
            <li> Love this. I started  using it and by about 1 weeks, I could tell a difference in my face.</li>
            <li> Didnt do anything for me...</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks, I noticed that dark spots on my face drastically faded.  I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll keep fading until they&#x27;re gone.  This stuff is awesome.  Its so hydrating and smells good.  Since using, my skin has cleared up (which isn&#x27;t the purpose of this but still) and is really soft and luminous.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help my dark spots from acne, and have used it for 3 weeks. Since i started using it i noticed a lot of tiny blackheads on my chin area and cheeks. I thought maybe it could be from something else, but then i stopped using it and within 2 days the blackhead were gone.  it didn&#x27;t even fade any of my marks. I started using the alba night cream, its all natural. wish me luck !</li>
            <li> Very smooth and lasts a long time!  Not greasy!  doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes like others do.  It is worth it</li>
            <li> i just looovve this product! love the scent of it and how it feels on my face. definitely see improvement</li>
            <li> Does really do anything for me. My dark spots are still there</li>
            <li> I accidentally purchased this when I meant to buy the youth code sunscreen. I was pleasantly surprised. In the winter, my skin is dry as heck and I need lots of moisture, but in spring/summer I go much lighter. The consistency of this product is very runny, but one pump is more than enough and it dries quickly (semi-matte to natural) which makes it a great base for other products, be it skincare or cosmetic. I have found that since using it on my cheeks and forehead, my skin seems a tiny bit plumper (thanks, peptides!), but my overall skin tone is definitely improved. I feel less ruddy, which was a problem that remained after my acne cleared up last year. If you want a thick, instant lifting product, don&#x27;t use this. This is great as a super light moisturizer when you don&#x27;t need a full surge, or as a night time product when layering your anti aging products.</li>
            <li> I received a sample from a magazine, so there was not much to use.  I got three days worth of product from the sample and I have to say that I do see a difference. I have problems with ingrown hairs leaving dark spots, it&#x27;s a major problem that has caused me to get medical strength skin lightener. L&#x27;oreal serum works faster then the prescription Tazorac I have been using for months and that says alot.</li>
            <li> I read some other reviews on here and thought i&#x27;d give this product a chance.  big mistake.  After a day or two of use, i began to get a RASH ON MY FACE...all over my face.  Turns out there&#x27;s something in there that i was allergic to, and i ended up having to go to the derm to get a steroid cream to correct the rash.  rash lasted for almost a week.  if you try this product, TEST IT FIRST before committing to your entire face, unless you like wearing big sunglasses and a hat every where you go.</li>
            <li> This is about the least effective product I have tried for dark spots. I have been using it for weeks, and it has made absolutely no difference. Useless? Yes! Don&#x27;t waste your money on it. There are better products on the market.</li>
            <li> The smell of this serum is pretty nice as well as how it glides on the skin. However, for someone with acne-prone skin trying to fade marks left behind this is not for you. It broke me out, in tiny little bumps all over my face. It might be due to an ingredient that is often used for anti-ageing purposes - Im not sure.</li>
            <li> Nice packaging. Creamy but not greasy, no annoying fragrance. Goes on under other makeup without problems. Does lighten the dark spots, but doesn&#x27;t obliterate them completely. This is a much better product to use than two others I&#x27;ve tried, more economical but smoother, easier to use dispenser,  and more effective. I think most people will like this product.</li>
            <li> Like many women my age I&#x27;m being driven a little crazy by the appearance of age spots on my face.  I&#x27;ve tried several products and as of yet have not found anything that effectively works to fade the dark spots.  I applied Youth Code Dark Spot Serum Corrector directly to the age spots every morning and night for several weeks with no apparent change, if anything the spots seemed to become a little more noticeable.  This product doesn&#x27;t contain any sunscreen and so recommends \\&quot;use with SPF 30 Day Cream to prevent the appearance of future dark spots\\&quot;. For the price of this product I think it should also include sunscreen to prevent recurrence of the problem the product is attempting to correct.  I had high hopes when I made my purchase but was very disappointed with the lack of results.</li>
            <li> I bought this to target age spots that have popped up all over my face.  I am on my fourth bottle, and I am addicted.  I&#x27;ve had red acne marks on my cheeks since my early twenties, and I thought they were just going to be there forever.  They have vanished entirely.  Some days, I skip my BB cream altogether and go au naturale- I feel that good about my skin.  Loreal is the budget version of Lancome, and this product is nearly identical to Lancome&#x27;s Genifique, for a fraction of the price.  My dark spots (sun spots, hyper-pigmentation)  have faded, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll ever be gone entirely.  Red marks, however, are gone. This product makes my skin glow, has evened tone significantly, and seems to help keep blemishes at bay.  You must give it at least three weeks, applying every day.  No serum works in just a few days.  Patience really pays off.  I now have a subscription here on Amazon- great price here.</li>
            <li> I do not see much if any lightening of the dark spots, of which there are many, on my face.  My dermotologist calls them sun spots. They do not need removal or treatment by a physician.  He suggested I use a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; dark spot corrector.  It has been 4 full weeks since I began using it.  I use L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect as my moisturizer over top of this Youth Code product.  I feel as if I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;good qality, good value</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I was a lil skeptical about this purchase. Even though the results aren&#x27;t as quick as I&#x27;d like it to be, I AM seeing results. Not to mention it arrive pretty quick, &amp; in one piece. So overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Wish I could bring this mess back. After coming across a promotional pack that sold this and the moisturizer, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I REALLY wish I could take it back. The sent is fine, I&#x27;m not allergic to it, and it feels nice on my skin. WHY WOULD I HATE THIS PRODUCT SO MUCH?  IT PEELS, LEAVING PIECES OF IT ALL OVER YOUR SKIN AND HAIRLINE.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not like I wear a full face of makeup, but, even if I did, this product SHOULD NOT DO THIS. I like to use my facial moisturizer on my face, neck, and chest. It peels on my neck and chest. at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if it the the serum, or the accompanying YOUTH CODE SPF30 MOISTURIZER, so I tried them separately.  THEY BOTH PEEL. I&#x27;ve tried changing the amount that I apply, thinking that I was applying too much- still rolled into little, unattractive white pieces.  Also, NOT CHANGE IN DARK SPOTS- NOPE NOTHING, and I&#x27;ve been USING IT FOR 6 WEEKS. UGH.&lt;br /&gt;I DO REALLY LIKE the LUMINESCENCE of the accompanying YOUTH CODE SPF 30 MOISTURIZER, BUT my SKIN ENDS UP LOOKING GROSS BECAUSE IT PEELS INTO VISIBLE WHITE PIECES.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. It works!!!!!!!! I&#x27;m not one to write reviews, but I decided to write one for this product. I used it with the the Youth Code Dark Day Cream, and they work beautifully. My skin is clear and it glows, I absolutely love the way the skin looks. The product does take a while to see significant results 2-3 months, which is about 1 bottle of the stuff; but it is worth the wait and money</li>
            <li> I have been useing for about three months but I have noticed that white residue is on the face after I applied it. I like it, except that residue.</li>
            <li> I often refer to my bathroom closet as my &amp;#34;cosmetic graveyard&amp;#34; once product reaches the shelves it remains there .. tons of money spent on products claiming amazing results only to dissapoint and frustrate me. I picked up a bottle of L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Dark Spot Correcting &amp; Illuminating Serum about 2 weeks ago and I finally found something that works. My dark spots have already begun fading dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;I rarely ever come back and leave reviews but this stuff is great and I thought it deserved it, I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to try to combat a lot of the dark spots I have on my face from too much time in the sun when I was younger and age.  They seem to be fading well and I like the &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; feel as the serum goes on my face.  I will order this again as it also works well with the other Loreal products but I was able to find it at a lower price on another web site so I will wait for a beauty sale to order it from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> This product does work if you follow directions.  I have used it day and night for ten weeks and find that the dark spots have lighten up a great deal.  I am happy with the product and will continue to use Youth Code....</li>
            <li> Experiencing acme for the first time in my life and I&#x27;m almost 36. Have used Loreal or Olay products exclusively for ever because of quality and cost. I was stunned to see how amazingly well this product worked. My face has not been this even since I was a child. It has been about 4 weeks since I started using it and will not stop. Amazing!</li>
            <li> Great product and great deal.</li>
            <li> After using this product every morning and every evening for two weeks, I really started noticing that my skin looked good! It has a glow and my complexion is more even. I even got a few compliments at work! I am really surprised that, for the price, this product works as well as it does.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I bought this several months ago, use it on a weekly basis and I still have enough in the bottle. This stuff doesn&#x27;t make me breakout and makes my skin glow. I am 27 and have acne-prone yet dry skin, so for me this works perfect. It has corrected my dark/acne spots and has become a must have for my skin care regimen. I bought this here off Amazon and had no problem with it. It is the actual product and I will buy again!</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Dark Spot Serum Corrector, 1 Fluid Ounce working good on my face dark spot look lightly, I will continue to used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used a spot corrector before, but had read so many good reviews on this that I thought it was worth a try.  Being an outdoor person and living on a ranch, my hands are exposed a lot of the time and I had a lot of dark, dark spots on top of my hands.  I started using this a month ago and love the results.  Spots are fading and they aren&#x27;t nearly as noticeable.  It&#x27;ll be interesting to see just how many of the spots disappear.  I like the product so much I gave it to my sister!</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work at all. Sorry...but it&#x27;s just a moisturizer and DOES NOT correct dark spots.  It&#x27;s not expensive but I recommend another more legitimate product like Clinique or even go prescription and get Tri Luma. They are A LOT more expensive but at least they work.</li>
            <li> Youth code makes your face feel real soft, I guess over time maybe some of the small wrinkles may go away. But I don&#x27;t expect any miracles.</li>
            <li> Have not used this long enough. I had a mila by my eve that i dug out and it left a hyperpigmented spot of sorts on my face. I used this a few times...it is moisturizing but i resorted to peels instead as i dont have the patience.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do much only made me breakout.</li>
            <li> This serum flakes/peels off.  It&#x27;s awful!  I can&#x27;t even get my makeup to work over it.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of acne marks on my cheeks, little red dots that make me look spotty even though I&#x27;m not! I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and I definitely see a reduction in the red. One of my cheeks is completely clear already! It leaves your skin glowing and feels amazing and fresh. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work don&#x27;t waist your money I feel like its fake go buy this item at the store instead</li>
            <li> this is working for me, its been over 6 weeks and I do notice the changes&lt;br /&gt;its slow so I would say do not expect miracles or overnight changes</li>
            <li> I bought this product along with the cleanser and day cream and it took me a few weeks to realize (but I did) that it was the cause of my face feeling itchy for days and days. As soon as I switched back to my regular brands, the itching stopped. I have sensitive skin and should&#x27;ve known better than to try it. It did fade some of the discolorations, but the itching was bad enough not to want to use this product further.</li>
            <li> This serum absolutely DELIVERS what it says - it is now one of my favorite serums ever.  It is light weight and absorbs into the skin without residue or balling up.  My skin is smooth, supple, glowing, EVEN &amp; RADIANT. Exceeded my expectations. It is a definite must-have. This product REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li> Ive noticed a difference. It works good and I have had compliments on my face. The only negative is that it is a little greasy but def will buy again</li>
            <li> I have tried the pricey Clinique and used it faithfully twice a day until it was gone...which was weeks, and saw absolutely no difference on the dark spots on my hands. I bought this one on a lark, just to try one more time, and within a week I noticed significant lightening of the spots. I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I am totally sold on this product and will continue to use it until they are substantially faded or gone. Thank you so much Youth Code. Finally...a product that does what it says it will do. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Have purchased this item before.  It really works, but you have to use it everyday!  It doesn&#x27;t dry your face out and is gentle enough to use under make up.</li>
            <li> Great product! A/A female with acne scars. The first night I used this, the next day my skin was peeling. For me, it started working immediately! I love this product line, will continue to buy Youth Code products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many weeks now and have seen zero results. My age spots are not even that dark to start with. Saw no improvement. Also useless as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year.  I&#x27;m 49 years old.  It doesn&#x27;t completely clear the skin, but it lightens everything quite a bit.  I would think if you want a completely unmarked face, you&#x27;d have to go to a dermatologist.  I&#x27;ve tried some other dark spot correctors and this one seems to beat the ones I&#x27;ve tried.  I also use Retin A.  If you can get a prescription for that, then you really don&#x27;t need anything else.</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t work like other products tried it for weeks with no success. other products are far better than this.</li>
            <li> Bought this and  L&#x27;Oreal Moisturizer (which is WONDERFUL). Even though I use a very small amount, when it is hot and I sweat, the product causes my eyes to burn and blur. Did not notice a smell until it &amp;#34;melted.&amp;#34; Not offensive, but not nice either.&lt;br /&gt;No dramatic results even though I stuck with it and this is my 3rd bottle. Will not buy the L&#x27;Oreal Dark Spot Corrector again.&lt;br /&gt;Clinique was worthless for me too.  Going to try Neutrogena next.</li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle faithfully on my face and hands.. where I am getting dark spots or liver spots.. and I thought after using the entire thing I would at least see some difference. But NOTHING at all.  I guess I will keep looking.  I know the NIA product line is good for cleansing scrub.. I&#x27;ll try their dark spot corrector instead and see how that works.</li>
            <li> Weird to have my review under our joint account name, oh well....&lt;br /&gt;I have developed hyperpigmentation along my jaw line where my golf visor or baseball cap didn&#x27;t shade.  I have been trying several treatments and products over the last 3-4 years to try to decrease the dark areas without much success.  I came across this product and decided to give it a try.  It took several months to start seeing a change and I wondered at first if it was just wishfull thinking, but 3 months in I can truly say it has made a significant difference.  Both areas are significantly less noticeable and some of the lighter areas are gone.  I will be continuing to use this and we&#x27;ll see where I am in another 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I continue to be happily surprised by this product.  My hyperpigmentation continues to fade and I&#x27;m starting to find that I have to look for it to notice the problem areas.  It is not gone, but significantly improved.  The big test will be next spring/summer when I&#x27;m back in the sun on a regular basis.  I use sunblock and it will be interesting to see how well the combination of this product and the SPF 30 moisturizer work to keep the spots away.  I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
            <li> 3 years ago I was working at a pool during the summer and developed dark spots on my upper lip and forehead. It was absurdly embarrassing and became even more embarrassing when other people started commenting on it asking me what I had on my upper lip. I tried to cover the spots up with make-up but for some reason it only made the dark spots look worse. I did a little research on dark reducing spot lotions going completely off of customer reviews. I don&#x27;t remember this particular lotion having the best reviews but it was a lotion that I could kind of afford so I bought it. I think the spots took around 2 to 3 weeks to fade completely but it got less noticeable every day. The lotion smelled so good, made my skin feel so soft, and my complexion so clear that I used it year round. I am now buying my 3rd bottle. This stuff is way too expensive for my usual taste but a bottle lasts over a year and is standing proof in my opinion that all lotions are not created equal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never write reviews but I figure since this is my 3rd time purchasing the same thing I should actually give it some kudos. Thanks L&#x27;Oreal. You stopped me from looking like a weird dude every summer.</li>
            <li> I am 61 and love being outside and on the water every chance I get. My dark spots have diminished and my complexion looks great. I go out now with hardly any makeup on. People my age are asking.......&amp;#34;when are you going to start to age like us&amp;#34;.....so there no other proof that I need....I love it !!!!</li>
            <li> Not too bad. Not to good.</li>
            <li> as good as any top selling product behind the makeup counters but half the price.</li>
            <li> I have some mild acne scars and uneven skin tone with slight redness on my cheeks and sides of my nose.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months.  It works ok as a serum, but I don&#x27;t observe improvement in the dark spots and redness.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and I&#x27;m Asian, so I can&#x27;t conclude that it won&#x27;t be effective for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth trying because it&#x27;s inexpensive, and as I said, works ok as a serum in general.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my face greasy and I broke out.  I have combination &amp;#34;t-zone&amp;#34; skin so maybe its just me but I wont be using it again.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a really great product. I would definitely recommend it to others, a very happy purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent addition to other products for reducing signs of aging. Helps keep my skin looking more refreshed and less &amp;#34;stressed&amp;#34;. Works best with other Youth Code products.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything to my uneven skin tone.  Acts as a good add to my moisturizer - and that is all.</li>
            <li> update dec 2014 been using this product for 5 months started out with a bang but clogged my pores gave me extreme acne over last few months was faithful in my use made no change in laugh line no change in crows feet. I saw some lightning of age spots but then that stopped still visible .I moved on to hyaluronic acid serum and started to see results in 2 weeks.I spent almost 5 months using this product and really seemed good in the beginning but never got any good results.I did use it day and night I stay faithful to skin care.I have given up on it getting rid of age spots it fades them a little but does not make them disappear and if you have skin that breaks out easy this does clog pores which I found out made my chin and sides of my nose break out with whiteheads at age 50.I bought 4 bottles gave it 5 months 3 purchases were from walmart because it was close and I was in the store.I tried to give this product enough time to do what It promises but age spots dont disappear they fade a little.it goes on smooth and thats what I loved about it but the acne from it clogging my pores was just to much for me.theres nothing like being 50 and walking into work with zits on your face</li>
            <li> I bought the full size because the free sample I got was amazing... i could see a change after just a few days!  I have used nearly all of the product and no further change has occurred.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past few weeks and have definitely noticed a difference in my dark acne scars! It is by no means a miracle solution and requires consistent use over a few weeks, but there is still a noticeable improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> Nice product, clean, non greasy, doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes which other products have.  My eyes are very sensitive so this is a good product.</li>
            <li> I use to sell Estée Lauder, I have spent hundreds of dollars on serums that didn&#x27;t work as well as this! I&#x27;m on my third bottle and never want to go without it!!!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this after finishing the last of my Clinique \\&quot;Even Better\\&quot; Dark Spot Corrector, with which I was very pleased. It&#x27;s expensive, though, and getting hard to find, so I decided to try L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s product since it&#x27;s a little less expensive and a lot easier to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works alright - not much better or worse than the Clinique product. Each depression of the pump dispenses enough of the cream for one side of my face, so using just two \\&quot;drops\\&quot; a day, it should last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaint, however, is the smell. It&#x27;s a strong heavy cloying smell. It&#x27;s obviously intended to be pleasant - it&#x27;s not a chemical smell. It smells more like they were going for a mixture of florals and a strong soap...and they got it. In spades. They&#x27;d have been better off not adding any fragrance at all. And it lasts -- the smell, I mean. Not only do I smell it while using it, but it seems to create a cloud around my face and I find myself getting whiffs of it all day long. Yecchh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others may not be bothered by the smell but it&#x27;s the exact opposite of the kinds of scents I like (light, grassy, clean). Because of that, I&#x27;ll continue to use it but only until I find some more of the Clinique or some other product that produces the same results without triggering a gag reflex.</li>
            <li> After 4 weeks of use, it looks like my dark spots are fading!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda strong so you have to watch if you have sensitive skin. But it did brighten my skin up in a couple weeks. I makes your skin kinda peel and regrown. My skin is more toned and even.</li>
            <li> I am happy I tried this product.  I never write reviews, but this product has done wonders with my old acne scars and it deserves a good review.  It works much better than Clinique products.</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle of this Aug 13, 2014 and just ran out of it on Valentine day. I used it every day. You only need a little  to make your skin feel soft and not dry. I didn&#x27;t notice any other changes in my skin appearance other than that. All the wrinkles and dark spots are still there. I just bought a cheap moisturizer to replace this and I must admit that I don&#x27;t like it at all. It&#x27;s winter here and after washing my face it feels like it is crawling off due to dryness. Using the new moisturizer my skin still feels dry and terrible but when I used this L&#x27;Oreal product it felt great so I&#x27;m going to order it again just because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update  May 2017...When I purchased this last it was $18.97. I am getting close to finishing my second bottle of this product that I bought it March of 2016. I use one pump every day and it is still the best moisturizer for MY skin that I have found. Considering the fact that it lasts over a year, the price is really not bad but I&#x27;m going to try another syrum product to see if I like that one just as well. It&#x27;s only 13.99 from l&#x27;oreal. I have not found this product to have removed the dark spots on my skin, I can still see them but I do not buy this for that purpose, I buy it because it feels amazing on my face. Here&#x27;s hoping a 13.99 bottle will feel just as nice or I certainly will be going back to this one.( I just can&#x27;t see spending $30.00+ on a bottle if I can find something just as good for half the price) I&#x27;ll let you know shortly</li>
            <li> Excellent skin product</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t handle extreme strong cheap perfume smell this isn&#x27;t the serum for you.  Had to give it to my mother.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t work on my dark spots at all.  I protected the spots from sun exposure and faithfully used several bottles of this lotion, but didn&#x27;t see even the slightest change.  For anyone who&#x27;s Asian, maybe this product isn&#x27;t effective for us?  I know Caucasian friends have used it successfully, so maybe it&#x27;s just me.  I gave it two stars because at the very least, it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I can&#x27;t say the same for other skin lighteners.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and was concerned about having a bad reaction. I eventually desided to take a risk because good house keeping listed this serum as one of this years anti-aging award winners. After using this serum for two weeks I haven&#x27;t had a single unwanted reaction.</li>
            <li> Hard to tell.  Maybe a little lighter but I&#x27;m in the sun a lot so I&#x27;ll be able to tell better this Fall.  Maybe a little lighter after a month.</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all. I will never waste money on this again.</li>
            <li> You will not see results overnight - it takes time.  Be sure to apply the serum first, before any moisturizer or sunscreen, so it can penetrate the skin.  It&#x27;s important to exfoliate regularly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 4 months and have seen a big improvement in the dark spots on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> smells good. Seems to be lightening some of my old acne red areas and some of my brownish sun spots. This has a nice light texture and smooths onto my skin nicely. I use it before my moisturizer in the AM and before I go to bed in the PM.</li>
            <li> So I bought this to avoid paying $75+ for Lancome Genifique. Supposedly this is the cheaper version. I do notice that my skin looks more cared for when I use this serum. I don&#x27;t know that it is changing my skin beyond the first skin layer. I keep using it. It hasn&#x27;t lighten my spots. I think I may need something stronger. It smells great and the price is reasonable on Amazon. I say try it if you have nothing but if you need a harder working serum then shell out more bucks. It will make a difference in your skin just depends on how much you need improved.</li>
            <li> This product worked me for me.  I had previously tried Clinique, Aveeno and Bremenn&#x27;s Clinical Dark Spot Correctors, all without any success. I was amazed by the results of this  serum on me.  My Mom noticed the difference in my skin as well. Not every discoloration is gone, but I am very happy with the results and continue to use it.</li>
            <li> it is very good!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have several age spots on my face and I noticed they were getting worse.  This product seems to be working in that my spots are slowly disappearing.  I will re-order another bottle and then  give it my best rating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months now and it really has evened out my skin tone!  I got brown spots on my face after pregnancy and this has greatly diminished them.  I can only hope that they will disappear completely soon!</li>
            <li> I broke out after a week of using the product and my dark spots are still there. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t see effect, pallet packing</li>
            <li> My dark spots have not changed. I will not reorder gonna stick with cocoa butter. Not sure if product was suppose to burn face. That was really scary</li>
            <li> I used this for a few weeks so probably not long enough to be able to tell whether or not it worked on dark spots. The reason I stopped using it after a few weeks is that I went in for a regular facial and was told my pores were now really clogged. When I told her what I had been using she said the Youth Code was bad for my skin and contained ingredients that I wouldn&#x27;t want on my skin. When I stopped using it and went back, my pores were all clear again. I threw it out after that. It does smell good, though, if you aren&#x27;t worried about clogging pores (although I don&#x27;t know how you couldn&#x27;t be ...)</li>
            <li> not bad, i&#x27;m almost invisble</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a light-complected, middle-aged woman.  When I was in my teen and early adult years, I was a major sun worshiper, always seeking to get the darkest tan I could.  I also used an indoor tanner on occasion.  All things considered, my skin looks pretty good.  The biggest problem I have with my skin is \\&quot;age spots,\\&quot; dark splotches on my face, hands, arms and legs.  (Luckily, with make-up, the ones on my face are barely noticeable.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this product advertised and decided to give it a try.  I like a lot of the L&#x27;Oreal products.  However, after using an entire bottle, I am disappointed to say I have not seen any improvement with my dark spots.  Their ad states that of the women using the product, \\&quot;86% saw less dark spots;\\&quot; I must be one of the unfortunate 14%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on reviews, many women seem to have good results with this product.  I wish I could claim the same.  However, everyone is different and each person has to find what works best for them.  I will continue to use the product since I had already purchased another bottle, but I am not optimistic that I&#x27;ll see any improvement at this point in time.  The first bottle lasted me approximately 4 months, using a light amount each morning and evening. Should I notice any improvement after finishing up the second container, I will change my review.</li>
            <li> Sure it moisturizers, but did not diminish dark spots...at least not for me.</li>
            <li> not really sure how well it works cause I didn&#x27;t use it as much as they reccomended. but i do like the smell and it leaves a nice glowy look on your skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome shipment time! Awesome product!</li>
            <li> The cream stunk like straight sunscreen, this smells wonderful, the cream left my skin greasy, shiny &amp; oily actually causing more breakouts &amp; therefore more dark spots because my blemishes heal &amp; leave dark marks. This serum soaks in really well not making my skin shiny/oily. I have noticed a slight fade in my dark marks already so I can tell it works.</li>
            <li> Youth code did my my skin look more radiant but It also clogged my pores and gave me more acne. I washed my face well and only put on a thin layer I still got more acne. I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> Though I am not sure it works because I haven&#x27;t seen any changes in over two months, I give it four starts because it has a nice texture and a great smell. It is quickly absorbed by your skin and leaves it feeling fresh. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week and I really can tell a difference. I&#x27;ve used much more expensive products with no results. I want to avoid using makeup but the older I get (62) the more blotchy my skin but this product is leaving my skin radiant. I think this is going be my new skin care regime. I never bad mouth any product because not everything works for everyone, but I do rave about it when it does and I am raving after the first week.</li>
            <li> I really like the product, It works you can see the difference on your face immediately but, I do hope the product would not be so&lt;br /&gt;expensive for the amount of fluid. I thought i finished it fast...But, it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> I like how light and fast absorbing this serum is! It has light scent but it didn&#x27;t effect the dark spots!</li>
            <li> This made my skin really smooth, and I could see results within the first two weeks I used it. It did faded my acne marks pretty visibly. I think it did its job. However, I am still looking for something more moisturizing, but I would recommend trying it at least once. I personally am on the market for another serum.</li>
            <li> Did nothing. Nice and light texture but no Noticeable changes here.</li>
            <li> Light crime with a satin shine.</li>
            <li> It works! I was impressed</li>
            <li> I am from indian (not Native American) descent, so my skin is a bit tanner than most causian females, but I am on the \\&quot;fair\\&quot; end of my type of people. My skin is usually oily, and acne prone. I have the skin type where Proactive works the best to treat my acne. Over the years proactive kind of stopped working for me (Ive been using it for about 6 years) and my acne came back with vengance and the fact that since I was in college I was too poor to afford proactive and I have habit of picking at my skin and it lead to the my scarring my skin.  I used to have such good skin and it made me really insecure that now I couldn&#x27;t just leave the house with no make up on. I decided to do something about it, instead of covering it up. I tried to go back on Proactive and it got rid of my acne but not the scars, so to treat the dark spots I invested in Clinque dark spot corrector and WOW...that was such a waste of money, I broke out even more and I started getting cold sores on my lips. Since I am a biology major I looked up the ingredients and its effects on the skin, and it turns out clinque made my skin really sensitve and prone to UV light....well this shit isnt ideal for a normal person that doesnt live in cave. SO bottom line it will work...if you are a hermit and live in a basement for the period you try it, but once your exposed to sun, it WILL CAUSE MORE SUN SPOTS and after that I was just left scarred and was becoming desperate. So i decided to give this L&#x27;oreal serum a try and ITS AMAZING! after just 4 days I noticed my dark spots were fading and every morning I would have a glow on my face. I used this twice a day and MAKE SURE TO APPLY SUN SCREEN. However, if you have my skin type the serum does make your skin a little greasy and sticky (but not to a annoying level) thruought the day...nothing a little face powder cant fix. When your using this, please be gentle with your face, your skin is trying to \\&quot;turn-over\\&quot; (look it up on Wikipedia) so baby your skin and treat it gently...using gentle cleansers. I still use my proactive cleansers but I mix it with cetaphil or Purity cleanser and massage my skin....dont try to microderm or any heavy grinding on your face. Sorry this was long...but I know when I read reviews I want people to include these details.t gently...using gentle cleansers.

            <li> Hard to tell right now, but it does feel really good on my skin.  I see the potential in this product!  I will keep you posted!</li>
            <li> I started using this product about a month ago, and I have not notice any difference whatsoever with my dark spots.  I know that the minimum, or optimal, amount of time would be to allow 4 weeks, but there is NO difference I have seen within that amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 2 stars solely because it is a decent moisturizer, but that is about all the praise I can award to this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also using this in conjuction with Pond&#x27;s Clarant B3, so I will come back to repost on that particular product, but this Youth Code serum just didn&#x27;t do it for me and I will not recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, for the $ you can&#x27;t go wrong!?! I prefer other products a little more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I accidentally purchased this product - I was waiting for my doctor&#x27;s office to get in the new Illuminizer from SkinMedica, however, they&#x27;ve run out. My boyfriend was shopping at the drugstore, and I went with him. Bored, I went to the cheap-o makeup products section, when I accidentally came across this product. I had very little hope for this product, but it was so cheap, I did an impulse buy. I can&#x27;t remember the last time I purchased a beauty product from the drugstore - maybe when I was 14? I just remember there were \\&quot;Big promises, very little delivery\\&quot; when I was young and I&#x27;d constantly walk away disappointed. Fast forward, yes, I was scared to put this on my face - yes, I was hesitant, yet I still approached it with a \\&quot;why not\\&quot; attitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OMG - immediately saw a difference! My skin was smoother, illuminated, and beautiful. I am very impressed with the amount of technology that has since gone into over-the-counter products in the past decade. Beauty can be affordable and there is hope in a bottle again! My boyfriend is saying how much improvement my skin has, and he is now a strong believer that \\&quot;expensive isn&#x27;t always better.\\&quot; It is because of this product that I am warming up to possibly trying out other L&#x27;Oreal products in the future. I am still scared to trust OTC, but L&#x27;Oreal is pulling me in with their prices and delivery on their promises. Will I use this forever? Probably no - I&#x27;m afraid any chemical product would age my face - but, for now, I am happy with the strong visible improvement on my dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside about this product is the smell. The fragrance was soooooo strong, it literally knocked me out, and I passed out for about an hour. After I woke up, I was still dizzy, so I washed off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was scared to use this again, but I did little spots to build up to the strong odor. I don&#x27;t use it around my nose or under my nose, but I use it on my forehead and parts of my cheeks, so I don&#x27;t have to smell the product. For being super cheap in comparison to professional products, I definitely see a difference - even better than I expected - even better than many products out there. If they made this product fragrance free, I&#x27;d give it a 10 star rating.the product.

            <li> the price is good, but when i received it, the package looks not very good, so, it&#x60;s hard to give my friend as a gift</li>
            <li> I have been a user of Clinique&#x27;s Dark Spot Corrector for a few years.  I was sincerely tired of paying the high price, though, so I decided to give this a shot.  It really fades acne spots and evens out skin tone effectively, right on par with Clinique&#x27;s product.  I will be buying this from now on.</li>
