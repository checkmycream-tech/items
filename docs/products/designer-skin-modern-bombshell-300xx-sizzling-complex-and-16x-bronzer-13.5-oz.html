            <li>yes it&#x27;s worth it!</li>

            <li>its lotion and looks like a bottle of lysergic acid diethylamide induced post synaptic overload in the 70&#x27;s full color.</li>
            <li>Hot tingle with the more natural bronzers in it made for this to be one of my favorite tingler.</li>
            <li>After that was over, my skin was left with really nice color.</li>

            <li>I bought my first bottle here on Amazon, and I was amazed with the results.</li>
            <li>I love this product abd definitely recommend it.</li>

            <li>If you like tingle you really need to try this.</li>
            <li>Because the item got to me really fast.  </li>

            <li>it isn&#x27;t that intense for me either.</li>
            <li>Provides a deep, rich tan.</li>
            <li>Modern Bombshell is the ultimate tanning lotion if you like the hot, tingle products!  </li>
            <li>in the winter time, this product has a high &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; factor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for beginning tanners or people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It hurts, and it&#x27;s pretty embarrassing how red I am for the next hour or so.</li>

            <li> it smells good and the after smell is not too bad.</li>
            <li> But make sure you have a base tan first.</li>
            <li> This lotion really helped me get past that and start getting darker again.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say that I get dark, but I am tan enough that I don&#x27;t feel the need to sunbathe on my deck.</li>
            <li> I have a nice base tan.</li>
            <li> I usually use Australian Gold Hearts Desire, but they have discontinued this product.  </li>
            <li> So when you tan you are getting extremely faster results.  </li>
            <li> I wished I had just used my other tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> As some other lotions don&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> I used to use the 50x sizzling tanning lotion that is a step or two down from this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one for heavy bronzers.</li>
            <li> A lot of people stated not to use this unless you have a base tan and if you enjoy tanning lotion that tingles.</li>
            <li> like I wasted my time tanning today with it.</li>
            <li> I have caused a few people to have tingle without a tan.</li>
            <li> Just if I had bought it at the salon just half the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally pale</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion in the past and it has become one of my favorites...</li>
            <li> I hate the idea of hosiery when the weather starts warming up, and this adds just enough color to my legs so that extraneous clothing is not necessary.  </li>
            <li> But I am completely addicted to this lotion...</li>
            <li> I am sad to report that this lotion did not tingle at all</li>
            <li> I recommend for people who already have a base tan.</li>
            <li> This product might have worked well but the fragrance was horrible.  </li>

            <li> Great!!! Fast delivery</li>
            <li> I used to use the 50x sizzling tanning lotion that is a step or two down from this. I needed a step up, and boy was this a step up! This stuff works great! Will buy again</li>
            <li> Same product as in salons. Provides a deep, rich tan. Feels so nice to tan with it, even more so in the winter time, this product has a high &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; factor. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I usually use Australian Gold Hearts Desire, but they have discontinued this product.  I found this to be semi-comparable.  It does not have a bronzer, so I use it with Australian Gold Vintage Gold in combination to achieve the effect that I want without having to tan more times a week (I really try not to tan more than 3 times a week).  I hate the idea of hosiery when the weather starts warming up, and this adds just enough color to my legs so that extraneous clothing is not necessary.  I won&#x27;t say that I get dark, but I am tan enough that I don&#x27;t feel the need to sunbathe on my deck.</li>
            <li> Modern Bombshell is the ultimate tanning lotion if you like the hot, tingle products!  It smells great and goes on evenly.  I recommend this lotion to anyone who asks me why I&#x27;m so tan.  Well played, Designer Skin, well played...</li>
            <li> I love a Bombshell...</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion. It has the tingle that I like and it really works great.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion in the past and it has become one of my favorites...if you like tingle lotions, I recommend it. Smells like baby lotion, too!</li>
            <li> The lotion smells really good, but the bronzer in it makes you turn orange. I like the original bombshell much better!</li>
            <li> its lotion and looks like a bottle of lysergic acid diethylamide induced post synaptic overload in the 70&#x27;s full color.</li>
            <li> This product might have worked well but the fragrance was horrible.  I didnt even put it on.  Sent it back</li>
            <li> Hot tingle with the more natural bronzers in it made for this to be one of my favorite tingler. Is much different compared to Designers skins Modern Bombshell. The scent is more fresh the tingle is MUCH hotter and the color achieved is darker with a lot more of a bodaboom effect. Do not use if you&#x27;ve never used a tingle before let alone one of this heat. Otherwise if you&#x27;ve reached that dreaded plato of lotions GET THIS ONE!!</li>
            <li> I love this I use it all the time</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!  And my purchasing experience was completely satisfying. A mistake was made, but the seller made it right immediately!!!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like any kind of lotions that tingle, at all. It hurts, and it&#x27;s pretty embarrassing how red I am for the next hour or so. But I am completely addicted to this lotion... I get dark SUPER fast, and it lasts! I bought my first bottle here on Amazon, and I was amazed with the results. I&#x27;m naturally pale but I tan VERY easily, I just plateaued... This lotion really helped me get past that and start getting darker again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and not only did it arrive on time it smells just like the salons, and makes your skin burn like its supposed to of course. Fast shipping and great products for a great price!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this Lotion and Love it. I have kept my tan all summer. If you like tingle you really need to try this. But make sure you have a base tan first. This also has a delayed bronzer in it, so after you shower. it does seem like it comes off on the towel. It does not turn you orange at all. The lotion is a light pink color. I&#x27;m not one for heavy bronzers.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Recommend it to anyone that loves the burn! Lol. Getting great results and looking much darker! Was shipped to me right on time with no problems! :)</li>
            <li> Because the item got to me really fast.  The product worked great, I love it and plan on using it more.</li>
            <li> This tanning oil is great because it contains both tingle and bronzer.  So when you tan you are getting extremely faster results.  I love this product abd definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this tanning lotion I read ALL of the reviews as I do for every product before I purchase it. A lot of people stated not to use this unless you have a base tan and if you enjoy tanning lotion that tingles. I am an experienced tanner. I have a nice base tan. And I love tanning lotion that tingles. I am sad to report that this lotion did not tingle at all and I felt like I wasted my time tanning today with it. I wished I had just used my other tanning lotion. My other tanning lotion is Insanely Black it tingles more than this product did and it is a bronzer as well 60x. I did enjoy the smell of this tanning lotion as others have posted it smells like baby lotion and even after tanning it still smells good. As some other lotions don&#x27;t do that. I am just disapointed that I did not turn red at all. And my tan looks the same as it did before I even tanned today. I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite lotion to use. it smells good and the after smell is not too bad. yes it&#x27;s a tingle. yes I got red. yes it&#x27;s worth it! it&#x27;s very relaxing to feel the heat. it isn&#x27;t that intense for me either. I do not use this tingle on my face but rather use a bronzer and the baked by pro tan.</li>
            <li> Its been 3 hours since i tanned...i am still on fire and beet red. really hope its worth the pain. i would recommend this lotion for experienced tanners though...smells real good also.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews online, I decided to buy and try this lotion. It came on time and completely packaged. The smell is pretty good. I didn&#x27;t think the tingles were that hot at all while I was in the bed. After I got out of the bed for about an hour, my skin was so itchy and red. After that was over, my skin was left with really nice color. If your looking for a great tingle lotion that give you great color, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing! It tingles great and really gets me tan. I will always use this. I recommend for people who already have a base tan.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for beginning tanners or people with sensitive skin.  I use this once or twice every couple of weeks and it gets me pretty dark! Make sure you have time to let it set after you tan but try not to touch anybody else! I have caused a few people to have tingle without a tan. I recommend this for sure for experienced tanners.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is awesome. Just if I had bought it at the salon just half the price!</li>
