            <li>I&#x27;d get it with the spray/spritz cap because it&#x27;s great when you&#x27;re in a rush in the morning or come home from a night out and can&#x27;t be bothered to wash your face.</li>

            <li>Originally I thought this face wash was on the pricy side.</li>
            <li>Great face wash that won&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I liked the Anthony logistics face wash better because it feels almost the same, but is a bit cheaper.</li>

            <li>Smells great and would use it everyday forever if not for the fact</li>
            <li>This face wash produces a GREAT lather for me with just a small amount.</li>
            <li>Your skin after use does not feel tight nor greasy; It just feels clean &amp; nice to the touch.</li>
            <li>Firstly, I ended up needing a good little amount to get it to &amp;</li>
            <li>After many years of trying a multitude of drug store and luxury brands, I&#x27;ve finally found a face wash I never want to give up.</li>
            <li>First off, there isn&#x27;t a price on a clean face and clear skin.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get enough of it and will DEFINITELY order more!</li>
            <li>Got a sample of this with the shaving cream and found myself much happier with this than the shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>When my boyfriend uses it, it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as it does with me.</li>
            <li>Not so much peppermint</li>
            <li>She loves the smell just as much as I do.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll feel cleaner and ready for bed.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>And it really delivers results.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out my skin and allows my skin to feel clean.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve never felt such squeaky clean, while leaving my face moisturized still.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because he doesn&#x27;t wash his face as vigorously or the same as me, but nonetheless he claims his face feels just as clean as mine.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to give this as high a rating</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a very natural scent.</li>
            <li>But still too much love, therefore planning to alternate this in with the other cleanser which moisturizes.</li>

            <li>I have pretty clear skin, with the occasional break out.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say definitively that it cleans my face any better than something less expensive, but it&#x27;s a nice way to start the day.</li>

            <li> After switching to Ursa Major, I haven&#x27;t had a single break out.</li>
            <li> You only need like a teaspoon of the product on your face &amp; it lathers a lot so one bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> but I went ahead and bought a second bottle when I was halfway done with the first so that must mean something.  </li>
            <li> You only need to use a little so the bottle last a long time.</li>
            <li> Second, a little actually does go a LONG way.</li>
            <li> Bottle lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars by judging the product independently of my opinions of other face washes.</li>
            <li> As other reviews mentioned, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so don&#x27;t be deterred by the price.</li>
            <li> I prefer less scent</li>
            <li> I thought it was a little overpriced.</li>
            <li> Just a few sprays on your face</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s almost all natural, a bit expensive</li>
            <li> ; I never noticed any dramatic effects from using this over any other face wash.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s hard to explain.</li>
            <li> If however you&#x27;re a man who&#x27;s used to deodorant scents that are so common in men&#x27;s body washes</li>
            <li> it unfortunately dries out my face to the point of scaly skin.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of the price.</li>
            <li> As someone with oily skin, it&#x27;s difficult to find something that helps alleviate the oil and not overdry my skin, but this wash does the trick.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My problem with men&#x27;s washes is that they are too drying. This face wash is obviously coding a great job but my skin can&#x27;t handle it&#x27;s stripping effect.  It&#x27;s a great product but not for me. Big fan of their face balm.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Perfect wash, removed skin oil but didn&#x27;t over dry, just enough suds and fragrance is heavenly!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to give this as high a rating as I did- I thought it was a little overpriced. Well, I recently re-ordered another bottle. This is my primary face wash because it works well, smells good, rinses clean and makes my skin feel healthier. As other reviews mentioned, it goes a long way. My first bottle lasted a good six months of once-daily use. All told, my initial reservations about the price were unfounded. It&#x27;s really good and the kind of thing I will probably buy a lot of in case they stop making it for some reason. It&#x27;s become one of those products that I will miss if it&#x27;s gone. Four stars because five gets thrown around a lot and gets devalued. Let&#x27;s call it 4.5.</li>
            <li> Bought this direct from Ursa Major after being introduced via Uncrate. Smells great and would use it everyday forever if not for the fact it unfortunately dries out my face to the point of scaly skin. But still too much love, therefore planning to alternate this in with the other cleanser which moisturizes. Or maybe I just gotta use the balm afterward...</li>
            <li> Great face wash.  Smells good and my face feels clean after using it.</li>
            <li> Excellent wash and smells great.</li>
            <li> Scent is very powerful and somewhat overwhelming to me. If however you&#x27;re a man who&#x27;s used to deodorant scents that are so common in men&#x27;s body washes then you will be pleased.  I prefer less scent</li>
            <li> Great product,Ordered my second bottle</li>
            <li> Great face wash that won&#x27;t dry out your skin. Bottle lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> Very Masculine Smelling, Finally I can have a face wash that doesn&#x27;t look too girly!</li>
            <li> My husband read about the Ursa Major face wipes in GQ Magazine and he ordered those.  Then I got him the face wash and he also loves this product.  The smell is amazing!</li>
            <li> Been using this for a while and easily my favorite face wash. I have sensitive skin and this does the job. Plus, the gf loves the smell of it (as do I) so that&#x27;s a bonus too.</li>
            <li> Outdoorsy without being obnoxious â€” a good, fresh scent. On my second bottle and will continue to buy this one.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Ursa Major&#x27;s &amp;#34;fantastic face wash.&amp;#34; I have to say, I was slightly underwhelmed. No doubt, the face wash was good, but it was not $26.00 good. Firstly, I ended up needing a good little amount to get it to &amp;#34;sud up.&amp;#34; I never noticed any dramatic effects from using this over any other face wash. Honestly, I liked the Anthony logistics face wash better because it feels almost the same, but is a bit cheaper. Given the option again, I&#x27;d probably buy that. I gave it four stars by judging the product independently of my opinions of other face washes.</li>
            <li> This Face wash is absolutely the best that I have ever bought.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Really enjoy the refreshing flavor, and my skin condition seems to be little better since I start to use it.</li>
            <li> This is a great face wash.  It smells great and leaves no residue.  You only need to use a little so the bottle last a long time.</li>
            <li> Love it, but expense.  Still I buy it, because I can&#x27;t stop myself.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff with a nice fragrance.  I can&#x27;t say definitively that it cleans my face any better than something less expensive, but it&#x27;s a nice way to start the day.</li>
            <li> Best face wash in the market. I&#x27;ve tried many face washes &amp; can confidently tell you this is the best face wash in the market now. Ursa Major has a great product for a good price. You only need like a teaspoon of the product on your face &amp; it lathers a lot so one bottle will last a long time. Your skin after use does not feel tight nor greasy; It just feels clean &amp; nice to the touch. I use it every day &amp; does not dry up my skin. Ingredients are all natural--- nothing synthetic. They also have a face tonic that I recommend but is not required.</li>
            <li> Got a sample of this with the shaving cream and found myself much happier with this than the shaving cream.  Since then I stopped using the shaving cream but have picked up the face wash.  It has a great outdoors scent to it giving it a outdoors rugged appeal.  Essential for those mornings where you find yourself stuck in the city.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 22 year old male, just for reference.  I have a problem with buying any new face wash I see on the shelf. I&#x27;ve gone through just about every face wash you can think of. When I bought this face wash I was skeptical because of the price. To shorten things up, BUY IT. If you need come convincing, read on.  My arsenal of face wash has gotten so big that it&#x27;s grown out of the bathroom and I have a designated shelf in the closet. This face wash can replace all of those.   - Value: Originally I thought this face wash was on the pricy side. I now realize that it&#x27;s an amazing value. First off, there isn&#x27;t a price on a clean face and clear skin. Second, a little actually does go a LONG way. The bottle has lasted me 10 months or so and I use it twice a day.   - Cleansing Abilities: I&#x27;ve never felt such squeaky clean, while leaving my face moisturized still. I don&#x27;t wear makeup so I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s great for removing makeup but it does leave my skin brighter and clean feeling. It uses natural fruit acids to gently exfoliate. (Which is such a plus considering micro-beads just end up on the bottom of our lakes and oceans and NEVER decompose.) This face wash produces a GREAT lather for me with just a small amount. When my boyfriend uses it, it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as it does with me. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because he doesn&#x27;t wash his face as vigorously or the same as me, but nonetheless he claims his face feels just as clean as mine.  - Smell: It&#x27;s a very natural scent. I think it&#x27;s hard to explain. The best I can describe it is an earthy, citrus, tea tree type of smell. Not so much peppermint but it does have that cooling feeling on my face which is why I say tea tree.  - Completion: I have pretty clear skin, with the occasional break out. After switching to Ursa Major, I haven&#x27;t had a single break out. I do get the sporadic zit but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s avoidable. My skin seems more predictable, clearer, and overall smoother.  I see some people ask if this product isjust for men. I believe the company originally formatted the product for men but my mother, who&#x27;s extremely picky about what she puts in and on her body, LOVES this stuff. She loves the smell just as much as I do. I don&#x27;t think it has a gender and honestly gender specified products are just marketing BS.  I recommend the [[ASIN:B006K1I26C Ursa Major 4-in-1 Essential FACE TONIC 8oz]] as well. I&#x27;d get it with the spray/spritz cap because it&#x27;s great when you&#x27;re in a rush in the morning or come home from a night out and can&#x27;t be bothered to wash your face. Just a few sprays on your face and you&#x27;ll feel cleaner and ready for bed. This isn&#x27;t a necessity but very worth it. The [[ASIN:B0080G9BY2 Ursa Major Fortifying FACE BALM 2.5oz]] was very nice. I actually really liked it. But it&#x27;s value wasn&#x27;t enough for me. I ran out of it after a month.  MOST IMPORTANT NOTE!!!!!!!!! On the companies website (UrsaMajorVt.com), you can purchase the Happy Camper Sample Set. It comes with the face wash, [[ASIN:B00DRHKPHQ Ursa Major Essential FACE WIPES - 20 PACK]], [[ASIN:B0080G9BY2 Ursa Major Fortifying FACE BALM 2.5oz]], and [[ASIN:B004MNZ6DW Ursa Major Stellar SHAVE CREAM 5.3oz]]. If you sign up for their newsletter, they&#x27;ll immediately email you a $5 credit towards their website. THE SAMPLE SET IS ONLY $4.95. So if you&#x27;re on the fence I highly recommend doing this. It&#x27;s what I did to get a taste and I ended purchasing every part of the set.  Please if this review was of any help, please let me know by hitting &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin type, I like this almost all natural face wash.  It cleans well and it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.  I like that it&#x27;s almost all natural, a bit expensive but I went ahead and bought a second bottle when I was halfway done with the first so that must mean something.  It didn&#x27;t perform miracles for my oily skin type but I think it&#x27;s a very effective face wash and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This face wash is the best I have ever used, even counting high-line cosmetic products.  Leaves your skin sparkling clean without drying and seems to work well on blemishes,too.  A little goes a long way so don&#x27;t be deterred by the price.</li>
            <li> YES YES YES. A gentle and rich-feeling face wash that&#x27;s comprised of natural and organic ingredients. It smells refreshingly herbal and earthy. And it really delivers results. Friends comment on how clear, smooth, and healthy my skin looks. After many years of trying a multitude of drug store and luxury brands, I&#x27;ve finally found a face wash I never want to give up. You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I subscribe to Birchbox and received a trial size of this face wash and I haven&#x27;t looked back. As someone with oily skin, it&#x27;s difficult to find something that helps alleviate the oil and not overdry my skin, but this wash does the trick. It leaves my face feeling clean and fresh and eliminates all the oil from my skin without overdrying. Can&#x27;t get enough of it and will DEFINITELY order more!</li>
            <li> Smells and feels great. I know this is a men&#x27;s brand but my dermatologist recommended it to me as I have really sensitive skin. Does not dry out my skin and allows my skin to feel clean.</li>
