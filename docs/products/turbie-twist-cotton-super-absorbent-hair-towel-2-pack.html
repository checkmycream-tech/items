            <li>I absolutely love these Turbie Twists.  </li>
            <li>It is healthier that it&#x27;s better than a towel tugging at your hair and swaying on top of your head.</li>

            <li>Love these things.  </li>
            <li>I had one for many many years and wore it out.  </li>
            <li>Simply the best.</li>
            <li>They resemble more of a cheap knockoff</li>
            <li>The elastic loop makes them easy to hang on a hook.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very large to cover hair adequately and nice plush material.  </li>
            <li>They stayed securely wrapped</li>
            <li>There are a few types of turbies, and I have found that the 100% cotton are the best.</li>

            <li>You&#x27;ll recognize the 1980&#x27;s style packaging when you&#x27;ve found the right one.</li>
            <li>I first bought Turbie Twist at a big box store and really liked them for use while camping.  </li>
            <li>Way better than a towel to dry your hair.</li>

            <li>fortunately I had only bought one.</li>
            <li>I really like these.  </li>
            <li>The material is quite absorbent and the small elastic loop is handy for inserting the end of the towel.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This one is much shorter, with a visually different logo, and is made out of a cheaper material that isn&#x27;t very absorbent.</li>
            <li>Easy to dry my hair while doing other things</li>
            <li>A little more expensive, but the original ones are made to last.</li>
            <li>Small, soft, gentle on hair.</li>
            <li>However, if you have lots of hair, or large head, the towel may be tight or possibly not cover your entire head.</li>

            <li> I got these prior to having surgery which limited my mobility. They stayed securely wrapped so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about balancing a towel on my head. There are a few types of turbies, and I have found that the 100% cotton are the best. They absorb well. The turbies work whether you bend forward to wash your hair or if you wash it in the shower, with your hair hanging down your back. These are thick and the colors are vibrant. They work well for children too. The elastic loop makes them easy to hang on a hook.</li>
            <li> The material is quite absorbent and the small elastic loop is handy for inserting the end of the towel. However, if you have lots of hair, or large head, the towel may be tight or possibly not cover your entire head. Cute colors and pattern!</li>
            <li> Love this. very absorbent.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and design.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love about these cotton turbies? I bought these for coming out of pool in our condo complex.&lt;br /&gt;It can be a breezy walk &amp; these keep head dry.&lt;br /&gt;Plus I have them in both showers. Guests are always asking where I got them.&lt;br /&gt;I tried a similar product- fortunately I had only bought one. Nowhere near as good.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these Turbie Twists.  I was afraid they came in microfiber (which I hate), and I was thrilled when I saw they also came in cotton terry cloth.  They are thick and plush and made well.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I first bought Turbie Twist at a big box store and really liked them for use while camping.  Tried a different product which was very thin material.  These Turbie Twists are absolutely wonderful!  Very large to cover hair adequately and nice plush material.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> When I received my 2-pack, one of the towels had already begun to fray and come undone. These certainly aren&#x27;t the same Turbie Twist Towels you might have used in the past. They resemble more of a cheap knockoff I&#x27;m sorry to say :(  Returned this pack and searched on Amazon for the &amp;#34;Original Turbie Twist Towel&amp;#34;. You&#x27;ll recognize the 1980&#x27;s style packaging when you&#x27;ve found the right one. A little more expensive, but the original ones are made to last. These aren&#x27;t even the same absorbent material. Save your money....this isn&#x27;t the same Turbie.</li>
            <li> I really like these.  They are made out of a thick cotton/terry cloth and not microfiber.  They seem to be good quality.  I love the color!</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my daughter, who had long hair. They are comfortable and easy to use. She loves them!</li>
            <li> Way better than a towel to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> Works great, all the girls in the family have one! Small, soft, gentle on hair.</li>
            <li> It is healthier that it&#x27;s better than a towel tugging at your hair and swaying on top of your head. But, they just don&#x27;t absorb that well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years now and stay on as long as you want without falling off!</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and these towels absorb enough water so drying time is cut in half</li>
            <li> These are great and love the colors.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Might have to get more.</li>
            <li> Love these things.  I had one for many many years and wore it out.  I am thrilled to get new ones.</li>
            <li> This is not like the Turbie Twist you can get at Bed, Bath, and Beyond. This one is much shorter, with a visually different logo, and is made out of a cheaper material that isn&#x27;t very absorbent.</li>
            <li> Simply the best. Easy to dry my hair while doing other things</li>
