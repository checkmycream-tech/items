            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>They look more like hair extensions.</li>
            <li>but if your only looking for a temporary thing i guess it&#x27;s OK at best</li>
            <li>The quality is just fine for the price and it is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>they are awesome and  stay in for a long time...</li>
            <li>Considering most hair salons charge close to $10 to put feathers in your hair, this was a fantastic alternative....</li>
            <li>First off let me say that I am very satisfied with how the feathers look and feel.</li>
            <li>and it was easy to do.  </li>
            <li>I used these at a Touch A Truck event and the little girls absolutely loved them!!  </li>
            <li>it was so cheap for what I got.</li>
            <li>, I was so excited to receive these since I&#x27;m going into the hair business.</li>

            <li>Cool.</li>
            <li>But for the price, this is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty and cool but  once they&#x27;re in</li>
            <li>Overall I am 100% pleased with this purchase and product.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>There was one thing I didn&#x27;t like a few of the feathers are not feathers that can go in your hair but there good for some arts and crafts though.</li>
            <li>bought these for my little sister :) they are easy to use (just hairspray about 30 strands of hair together and apply)</li>
            <li>Will have them for a long time!! :-)</li>
            <li>The tool I got with it is very helpful to get the bead on my hair, and It came before the shipping date given to me.</li>
            <li>I started looking around for feather kits after seeing how much it would cost to get just one feather in my daughters hair.  </li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>The longer feathers aren&#x27;t really feathers.  </li>
            <li>They never came and I was very upset about that.</li>
            <li>Have only used a few of them but love that they also came with the tool to put them in and</li>
            <li>an would be difficult to make them look great in my hair because the feathers are small.</li>

            <li> well it did take a really long time to come.</li>
            <li> The product arrived two weeks before the expected date with all items intact.  </li>
            <li> If you go to bed with a wet head, the feather colors bleed onto the pillowcase.</li>
            <li> My one complaint though is that the grizzly feathers are fairly fragile and not meant for long term use</li>
            <li> You need a hair clamp to press you hair beads down.</li>
            <li> You can purchase them at hobby lobby or any other craft store!</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t easy to hide :(</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller and they immediately shipped the missing parts.</li>
            <li> They are really small</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t last long :(</li>

            <li> I like them. They came on time. They look good on peoples hair. I want one on my hair. Cool.</li>
            <li> Was not the kind of feathers I was expecting. They are really small an would be difficult to make them look great in my hair because the feathers are small. But still an ok product.</li>
            <li> I love it... it was so cheap for what I got. The tool I got with it is very helpful to get the bead on my hair, and It came before the shipping date given to me. Which was grate. My daughter loves them. I would recomend to others. I got a lot of beads with it, and you can use the feathers over and over. There was one thing I didn&#x27;t like a few of the feathers are not feathers that can go in your hair but there good for some arts and crafts though.</li>
            <li> bought these for my little sister :) they are easy to use (just hairspray about 30 strands of hair together and apply) they are awesome and  stay in for a long time... My one complaint though is that the grizzly feathers are fairly fragile and not meant for long term use</li>
            <li> I started looking around for feather kits after seeing how much it would cost to get just one feather in my daughters hair.  I found this kit on amazon.com and purchased.  The product arrived two weeks before the expected date with all items intact.  The quality is just fine for the price and it is very easy to use.  Overall I am 100% pleased with this purchase and product.</li>

            <li> The longer feathers aren&#x27;t really feathers.  They look more like hair extensions.</li>
            <li> This product arrived weeks earlier than scheduled and we are thrilled with it. Considering most hair salons charge close to $10 to put feathers in your hair, this was a fantastic alternative....</li>
            <li> I got my order after only 14 days, but i discovered it was incomplete. I contacted the seller and they immediately shipped the missing parts. Also this package arrived after 2 weeks. Great service!!! The feathers are beautiful and the microrings are good quality!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Not the best quality of feathers, but for the price it works</li>
            <li> Got these for my girls after we went to a salon and paid $5 a piece for them. Have only used a few of them but love that they also came with the tool to put them in and also the crimpy beads to match the color of hair. Will have them for a long time!! :-)</li>
            <li> I used these at a Touch A Truck event and the little girls absolutely loved them!!  I will do it again next year.</li>
            <li> First off let me say that I am very satisfied with how the feathers look and feel. Now, I received the 10 18\\&quot; feathers and the 10 solid colors as well as the hook and beads.. But, where are my 5 roster and my 5 fashion feathers? They never came and I was very upset about that. Also it states that the beads come in 4-5 different colors.. I only got 1 color ! It doesn&#x27;t match my hair color so it isn&#x27;t easy to hide :( I really do hope what I&#x27;m missing gets sent to me, I was so excited to receive these since I&#x27;m going into the hair business.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t satisfy me at all the ends of the feathers were way to big, an they were totally different from what I thought they were gonna be.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty and cool but  once they&#x27;re in they don&#x27;t last long :( but if your only looking for a temporary thing i guess it&#x27;s OK at best</li>
