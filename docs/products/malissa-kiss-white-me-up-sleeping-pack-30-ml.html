            <li>I&#x27;ve heard this product for long time ago the magic it brings to the skin</li>

            <li>Very neat and sanitize.</li>
            <li>, I have not broken out from it yet.</li>
            <li>I did not see any results much about reducing the pore size though.</li>
            <li>I noticed my skin was much brighter and whiter after just one use.</li>

            <li>Just plain amazing&lt;br /&gt;Works like magic</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a month now and not a single change in my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the feeling of it the next morning when I wake up, also my pimples or redness would fade a little and I can feel that my complexion does gets brighter than usual.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This cream didn&#x27;t break me out.. That&#x27;s the only good thing. I have been using it for a month now and not a single change in my skin. Pores are still the same. Probably it worked for many people but for me it was waste of money. I don&#x27;t have much scaring I only have pores which I wanted to look smaller with the use of this cream which didn&#x27;t happen at all. And there is no change in my complexion as well. Overall not a good experience and not what I thought.</li>
            <li> The seller fufu.fahthai did awesome job by delivering the product much before expected time and also gave the product for lesser price . The product is gud but it did not clear my acne marks over night like a miracle . My skin did improve gradually but my acne marks are still present</li>
            <li> Its helping me with my dark spots. I love it</li>
            <li> Please bring back the previous formula of kiss me up and not the white me up you&#x27;re now sending. This smells different and caused breakouts around my mouth and eyes and several people I know had the same problem!</li>
            <li> Great.  Does whiten. Does tighten pores.  Complexion looks great.  Love it.  Will re-order.</li>
            <li> baby skin, no pore&lt;br /&gt;use in mask at night and good results at the morning, it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for me</li>
            <li> This is my second order. It is very effective.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s just been 2 weeks, i dont see any difference. But i can see my pores are minimized a little.</li>
            <li> I like how you don&#x27;t have to dip your finger in the bottle to get the cream, instead you just press the top and the cream will squirt out. Very neat and sanitize. I only use this cream mask twice a week, or when I have acne skin. I love the feeling of it the next morning when I wake up, also my pimples or redness would fade a little and I can feel that my complexion does gets brighter than usual. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> The day after the night i have used it, my face is glowing and lightened up a bit.</li>
            <li> Excelent!!! I love it!!</li>
            <li> The seller gave excellent customer service. They answered all my questions in a timely manner and they also shipped my items Express mail, so I received my purchases earlier then expected.&lt;br /&gt;So far I LOVE this cream, I have not broken out from it yet. I have only been using it for a few days now and I have already seen dramatic results. I use to have horrible hormonal cystic acne and I have tried EVERYTHING under the sun.. My acne has calm down ALOT!!! since using this kiss cream, and my skin has a nice glow to it. Friends and Family say my skin has a supple and youthful glow and I know they are not lying because my skin has never been supple or youthful until now. My mom is now using the kiss cream with me and she also loves it as well. . I highly recommend this cream.&lt;br /&gt;-Komol</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!! Just plain amazing&lt;br /&gt;Works like magic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard this product for long time ago the magic it brings to the skin and I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Amazingly, it surprised me for the first day I used. The next morning my skin looked flawless and smooth. I&#x27;ve been using many skincares, moisterizers but none of those gave me a big surprise like the K.I.S.S. I didn&#x27;t have any makeup on my face. Some people looked at my face and gave a compliment on my skin. It does a great job to help regenerate my skin that I&#x27;ve been wanted to have.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to my friends or whoever wants to have a flawless, white skin.</li>
            <li> I only used it twice within a week and my skin looked brighter in the following morning. I heard someone got acne after using it, not sure where they bought and how they used it. I&#x27;m still happy with my product and my skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin soft and smooth and weighing light as soon as you wake up. I did not see any results much about reducing the pore size though.</li>
            <li> I ordered the kiss collagen mask and it was so good, my all skin problems in 2 month are solved only after 2 night using the kiss mask. Thanks AMAZE SOLDOUT for good product</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin was much brighter and whiter after just one use. I don&#x27; have large pores so can&#x27;t comment if it actually reduces pore size. Will definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> Really helps with controlling acne and leaves your skin with radiance!</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service, I will continue purchasing from this seller. Love this cream really reduces hyperpigmentation, reduces pore size &amp; refines texture. A must have for me.</li>
            <li> Does make my face white and sparkling with aura only half of the day, next day I got all black heads and acne all over my face....</li>
