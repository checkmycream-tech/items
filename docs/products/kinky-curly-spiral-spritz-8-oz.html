            <li>I love all Kinky curly  products.</li>
            <li>and I totally love this product.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love.</li>
            <li>It was just ok bc</li>
            <li>I love the curling custard so tried this as well.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Kinky-Curly&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s chemical free.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things!  </li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy 2C hair and follow the Curly Girl method of not using any sulfates or silicones on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I am over 50 and my wavy hair is quite fine.</li>
            <li>I have 4B S-shaped, fine and frizzy curls</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey since it works best when you saturate the hair</li>
            <li>I can smooth it on from roots to ends, scrunch and let it air dry, and I&#x27;m good!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light weight product.</li>
            <li>something that is a light mist, with the hold that the Carol&#x27;s Daughter leave-in conditioner mist</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the product defines curls without making them sticky, and leaves them light and bouncy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the product defines curls without making them sticky, and leaves them light and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I originally thought it was for African-American hair, but after checking the Kinky Curly website, I realized I could use it on my hair too.</li>
            <li>but the way it spirals my curls makes it totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Will just stick with the original custard from now on.</li>
            <li>I wash with the come clean shampoo and then condition with Knot Today.</li>
            <li>Liked that is was natural and free of allergen for me.</li>
            <li>Product is fine, I like the smell, good for my random curls &amp; waves- not as great as the custard though</li>
            <li>This is true to 100%.</li>
            <li>Liked thisproduct as I have naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li>Because it really did curl my afro and it made it look so much better.</li>
            <li>only thing the pump feature is good for, is conserving product...</li>
            <li>and it helped make the waves both more pronounced and more lasting.</li>
            <li>I purchased this spiral spritz looking for something quick to revive my second-day hair...</li>
            <li>This product has prevented me from returning, in frustration, to the hair stylist too soon and asking her to do something about the flat area before I actually need a trim on the rest of the hair, and I am REALLY happy about that!</li>
            <li>and  makes her hair so pretty!</li>
            <li>I have wavy fine white/silver hair which I can wear  either straight or curly.</li>
            <li>Not only does it make my hair feel soft, but it does a great job holding my waves and curls.</li>
            <li>I used fresh out of the shower and</li>
            <li>flakes just a tiny bit when combined, but it&#x27;s worth it for the nice curl definition.</li>
            <li>I love this natural product.  </li>
            <li>For the price there are to many other products that work a lot better.</li>
            <li>it is a great product for the final step on my fixing my curly hair (most likely it would not be strong enough to use alone though</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I did, because it provides great hold, doesn&#x27;t leave much residue because a little goes a long way, and does not impart crunch.</li>
            <li>When I air dry, I get great, soft curls</li>
            <li>This stuff is so light and leaves my hair in soft curls, not crunchy at all.</li>
            <li>, it needs a cream or mousse first)</li>
            <li>I really love this entire line.</li>
            <li>This product also did absolutely nothing for my mother&#x27;s 3b/c hair!</li>
            <li>I get lovely curls that are bouncy, touchable and only need to have one scrunch to remove any crunch that might be lingering.</li>
            <li>My hair was soaking wet, and I blowdried it, it looked nice.</li>
            <li>I then use another gel for the areas with tighter curls, and in about five minutes I can have AWESOME second, third, fourth, etc day curls.</li>
            <li>I then use another gel for the areas with tighter curls, and in about five minutes I can have AWESOME second, third, fourth, etc day curls.</li>
            <li>I am Caucasian and I have long, super fine, low porosity (healthy) wavy 2b/2c combination hair.</li>
            <li>tight curls at the very top of my head, and lose, smoother curls around the crown.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it keeps my hair from getting frizzy and feels soft and natural.</li>
            <li>They gave me ZERO FRIZZ, super soft, defined, shiny, bouncy curls!</li>
            <li>Also, gently spreading if over my hair resulted in a million straight hairs and frizz!</li>
            <li>This is actually a great product if used properly, but those who could benefit from it would never know due to the improper description and naming.</li>
            <li>Then I comb it through and use a cotton t shirt to scrunch it to get most of the water out and let it air dry the rest of the way.</li>
            <li>I bought the Kinky Curly Curling Custard about a year ago and love it, but whenever I use it, it takes forever for my hair to dry, so I thought I would try this Spritz</li>
            <li>The Gel does not work as well as this spritz for between washings although I love the Gel for the first, wet hair, curl set.</li>
            <li>Since my hair is long (just about mid-back), it&#x27;s not an economical product to use as my main product since I&#x27;d have to use a lot of it, but it works fine layered over a curl</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not encouraging over-use, but since I have fairly dry, fine, older girl hair on which I use mostly DevaCurl products and wash my hair only twice a week, I have to re-style my hair almost every day.</li>
            <li>I bought this product at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>being that my hair is very springy and spirally (type 4a/b),</li>
            <li>This product has no silicone and really does the trick for me.  </li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Price is also reasonable.</li>
            <li>I have Caucasian, dyed and sometimes highlighted, very wavy, layered, semi-thick hair that is curlier underneath.</li>
            <li>I bought this at Whole Foods, on a whim.</li>
            <li>The next day I woke up and my hair wasn&#x27;t as defined, and it was kind of coarse.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down</li>
            <li>It was much easier to make my own curling spritz, with conditioner, water, and a little aloe!  </li>
            <li>No more touching!</li>
            <li>As with any product, there&#x27;s a period of trial and error in regards to how much is needed for my hair, but that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>In order for you to get the full effect of this, you will need to use the entire line.</li>
            <li>My hair is a wavy/curly combination, which changes in degree depending on its mood on any particular day (I&#x27;m caucasian).</li>
            <li>product uses natural ingredients and is 100% cruelty free too, which is a really big deal for me.</li>
            <li>Makes the second and third day frizzy curls behave so much better.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t give me \\&quot;second day curls\\&quot;, didn&#x27;t make my hair soft, and goes way to fast!!!  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly</li>
            <li>and I also use Ouidad when the humidity is extremely high</li>
            <li>Using spiral spritz to slick and groom my hair, on top of products that keep my hair moist works like an absolute charm.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely pricey, and you really need to love it to continue paying so much for so little (which I</li>
            <li>I am always searching for a product that will tame my curly hair, and I LOVE this.  </li>
            <li>I usually spritz on a little more of this Spiral Spritz to redefine a bit more and air-dry.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product.  </li>
            <li>hence my search for a new product.</li>
            <li>(I keep a hair journal when I try out new products.)</li>
            <li>Now I use just a little of this Spiral Spritz sprayed directly onto the section, gently work it in with a couple of light fingertips, and sort of guide the desired shape of the wave.</li>
            <li>I quickly realized this product really isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;spritz\\&quot; in the traditional sense; it&#x27;s more of a thin gel.</li>
            <li>Personally, I&#x27;ve never \\&quot;revived\\&quot; my curls by spraying anything on them on the days following a wash/deep condition/styling to a standard that I can confidently do anything other than a quick trip to the store or something of that nature...</li>
            <li>ah, this alone is its sole positive factor.</li>
            <li>Next I put a little bit of water on my hands and then pat that on top.</li>
            <li>For me, I spray it directly into my hands, and spread it evenly between them before i run it through my damp hair.</li>
            <li>I dislike my natural pattern</li>
            <li>This product does not leave any residue and makes my hair feel natural to the touch.  </li>
            <li>The day before I had used a Tresemme Mousse and my curls came out bouncy, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>directly-</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T spray it directly on your hair, squirt it into your palm and distribute through hair.</li>
            <li>It holds in curls for a soft, curly look.</li>
            <li>Also, just saw it at Target considerably cheaper about 3 days ago.</li>
            <li>Would totally recommend for very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>And actually looks cute air dried and/ or in a braid/ twist out style.</li>
            <li>Given that my natural 4a-c hair is dry and brittle at baseline, I now keep my hair very moist (not greasy)</li>
            <li>It has little shrinkage, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It has little shrinkage, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>But if the product had a different consistency it might not work as well as it does or it may fail to provide a good hold for my curls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural my entire life (25) years and have very defined spiral curled African American hair.</li>
            <li>I have very thick 4b/c hair and my hair responded okay to this when I used it by itself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product that I have found so far</li>
            <li>Tried the same routine today and my hair came out dry, frizzy, poofy and wavy (almost straight).</li>
            <li>The kccurling custard is a bit tricky to work with because it&#x27;s so thick and my hair is really short and fine and coily</li>
            <li>Because I don&#x27;t use a heavy gel, like the Curling Custard (in which case I would end up with sticky clumps), I can completely saturate my hair and get the curls really defined, and</li>

            <li>and when I blow dry with a diffuser, I get voluminous waves that are soft and bouncy!  </li>
            <li>have 3a, 3b hair that is very fine and difficult to work with.</li>
            <li>and I needed a natural styling product that didn&#x27;t have chemicals to dry my hair but still worked.</li>
            <li>I actually stood in the bathroom staring at the bottle for a few seconds after my first pump, totally befuddled.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried this product by spraying it in my hand and distributing a little at a time by gentle patting-</li>
            <li>I purchased this product from target after reading numerous reviews (good and bad) on it.</li>

            <li> I can smooth it on from roots to ends, scrunch and let it air dry, and I&#x27;m good!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light weight product.</li>
            <li> something that is a light mist, with the hold that the Carol&#x27;s Daughter leave-in conditioner mist</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the product defines curls without making them sticky, and leaves them light and bouncy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the product defines curls without making them sticky, and leaves them light and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I originally thought it was for African-American hair, but after checking the Kinky Curly website, I realized I could use it on my hair too.</li>
            <li> but the way it spirals my curls makes it totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Will just stick with the original custard from now on.</li>
            <li> I wash with the come clean shampoo and then condition with Knot Today.</li>
            <li> Liked that is was natural and free of allergen for me.</li>
            <li> Product is fine, I like the smell, good for my random curls &amp; waves- not as great as the custard though</li>
            <li> This is true to 100%.</li>
            <li> Liked thisproduct as I have naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li> Because it really did curl my afro and it made it look so much better.</li>
            <li> only thing the pump feature is good for, is conserving product...</li>
            <li> and it helped make the waves both more pronounced and more lasting.</li>
            <li> I purchased this spiral spritz looking for something quick to revive my second-day hair...</li>
            <li> This product has prevented me from returning, in frustration, to the hair stylist too soon and asking her to do something about the flat area before I actually need a trim on the rest of the hair, and I am REALLY happy about that!</li>
            <li> and  makes her hair so pretty!</li>
            <li> I have wavy fine white/silver hair which I can wear  either straight or curly.</li>
            <li> Not only does it make my hair feel soft, but it does a great job holding my waves and curls.</li>
            <li> I used fresh out of the shower and</li>
            <li> flakes just a tiny bit when combined, but it&#x27;s worth it for the nice curl definition.</li>
            <li> I love this natural product.  </li>
            <li> For the price there are to many other products that work a lot better.</li>
            <li> it is a great product for the final step on my fixing my curly hair (most likely it would not be strong enough to use alone though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I did, because it provides great hold, doesn&#x27;t leave much residue because a little goes a long way, and does not impart crunch.</li>
            <li> When I air dry, I get great, soft curls</li>
            <li> This stuff is so light and leaves my hair in soft curls, not crunchy at all.</li>
            <li> , it needs a cream or mousse first)</li>
            <li> I really love this entire line.</li>
            <li> This product also did absolutely nothing for my mother&#x27;s 3b/c hair!</li>
            <li> I get lovely curls that are bouncy, touchable and only need to have one scrunch to remove any crunch that might be lingering.</li>
            <li> My hair was soaking wet, and I blowdried it, it looked nice.</li>
            <li> I then use another gel for the areas with tighter curls, and in about five minutes I can have AWESOME second, third, fourth, etc day curls.</li>
            <li> I then use another gel for the areas with tighter curls, and in about five minutes I can have AWESOME second, third, fourth, etc day curls.</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian and I have long, super fine, low porosity (healthy) wavy 2b/2c combination hair.</li>
            <li> tight curls at the very top of my head, and lose, smoother curls around the crown.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it keeps my hair from getting frizzy and feels soft and natural.</li>
            <li> They gave me ZERO FRIZZ, super soft, defined, shiny, bouncy curls!</li>
            <li> Also, gently spreading if over my hair resulted in a million straight hairs and frizz!</li>
            <li> This is actually a great product if used properly, but those who could benefit from it would never know due to the improper description and naming.</li>
            <li> Then I comb it through and use a cotton t shirt to scrunch it to get most of the water out and let it air dry the rest of the way.</li>
            <li> I bought the Kinky Curly Curling Custard about a year ago and love it, but whenever I use it, it takes forever for my hair to dry, so I thought I would try this Spritz</li>
            <li> The Gel does not work as well as this spritz for between washings although I love the Gel for the first, wet hair, curl set.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is long (just about mid-back), it&#x27;s not an economical product to use as my main product since I&#x27;d have to use a lot of it, but it works fine layered over a curl</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not encouraging over-use, but since I have fairly dry, fine, older girl hair on which I use mostly DevaCurl products and wash my hair only twice a week, I have to re-style my hair almost every day.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> being that my hair is very springy and spirally (type 4a/b),</li>
            <li> This product has no silicone and really does the trick for me.  </li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Price is also reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have Caucasian, dyed and sometimes highlighted, very wavy, layered, semi-thick hair that is curlier underneath.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Whole Foods, on a whim.</li>
            <li> The next day I woke up and my hair wasn&#x27;t as defined, and it was kind of coarse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super light and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down</li>
            <li> It was much easier to make my own curling spritz, with conditioner, water, and a little aloe!  </li>
            <li> No more touching!</li>
            <li> As with any product, there&#x27;s a period of trial and error in regards to how much is needed for my hair, but that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> In order for you to get the full effect of this, you will need to use the entire line.</li>
            <li> My hair is a wavy/curly combination, which changes in degree depending on its mood on any particular day (I&#x27;m caucasian).</li>
            <li> product uses natural ingredients and is 100% cruelty free too, which is a really big deal for me.</li>
            <li> Makes the second and third day frizzy curls behave so much better.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t give me \\&quot;second day curls\\&quot;, didn&#x27;t make my hair soft, and goes way to fast!!!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it highly</li>
            <li> and I also use Ouidad when the humidity is extremely high</li>
            <li> Using spiral spritz to slick and groom my hair, on top of products that keep my hair moist works like an absolute charm.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely pricey, and you really need to love it to continue paying so much for so little (which I</li>
            <li> I am always searching for a product that will tame my curly hair, and I LOVE this.  </li>
            <li> I usually spritz on a little more of this Spiral Spritz to redefine a bit more and air-dry.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product.  </li>
            <li> hence my search for a new product.</li>
            <li> (I keep a hair journal when I try out new products.)</li>
            <li> Now I use just a little of this Spiral Spritz sprayed directly onto the section, gently work it in with a couple of light fingertips, and sort of guide the desired shape of the wave.</li>
            <li> I quickly realized this product really isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;spritz\\&quot; in the traditional sense; it&#x27;s more of a thin gel.</li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;ve never \\&quot;revived\\&quot; my curls by spraying anything on them on the days following a wash/deep condition/styling to a standard that I can confidently do anything other than a quick trip to the store or something of that nature...</li>
            <li> ah, this alone is its sole positive factor.</li>
            <li> Next I put a little bit of water on my hands and then pat that on top.</li>
            <li> For me, I spray it directly into my hands, and spread it evenly between them before i run it through my damp hair.</li>
            <li> I dislike my natural pattern</li>
            <li> This product does not leave any residue and makes my hair feel natural to the touch.  </li>
            <li> The day before I had used a Tresemme Mousse and my curls came out bouncy, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> directly-</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T spray it directly on your hair, squirt it into your palm and distribute through hair.</li>
            <li> It holds in curls for a soft, curly look.</li>
            <li> Also, just saw it at Target considerably cheaper about 3 days ago.</li>
            <li> Would totally recommend for very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> And actually looks cute air dried and/ or in a braid/ twist out style.</li>
            <li> Given that my natural 4a-c hair is dry and brittle at baseline, I now keep my hair very moist (not greasy)</li>
            <li> It has little shrinkage, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It has little shrinkage, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> But if the product had a different consistency it might not work as well as it does or it may fail to provide a good hold for my curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural my entire life (25) years and have very defined spiral curled African American hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick 4b/c hair and my hair responded okay to this when I used it by itself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product that I have found so far</li>
            <li> Tried the same routine today and my hair came out dry, frizzy, poofy and wavy (almost straight).</li>
            <li> The kccurling custard is a bit tricky to work with because it&#x27;s so thick and my hair is really short and fine and coily</li>
            <li> Because I don&#x27;t use a heavy gel, like the Curling Custard (in which case I would end up with sticky clumps), I can completely saturate my hair and get the curls really defined, and</li>
            <li> Because I don&#x27;t use a heavy gel, like the Curling Custard (in which case I would end up with sticky clumps), I can completely saturate my hair and get the curls really defined, and</li>
            <li> I have super dry, tight curls</li>
            <li> and when I blow dry with a diffuser, I get voluminous waves that are soft and bouncy!  </li>
            <li> have 3a, 3b hair that is very fine and difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> and I needed a natural styling product that didn&#x27;t have chemicals to dry my hair but still worked.</li>
            <li> I actually stood in the bathroom staring at the bottle for a few seconds after my first pump, totally befuddled.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried this product by spraying it in my hand and distributing a little at a time by gentle patting-</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from target after reading numerous reviews (good and bad) on it.</li>
            <li> also seems to not want to grow past a certain length, so</li>
            <li> You are forced to finger work, or risk walking around with huge blobs of product in your hair where the jet streams landed and dried.</li>
            <li> I reapplied a tiny bit of the spritz and custard and let it dry.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend spraying it directly onto hair, but rather into your hands and distributing just a little all over.</li>
            <li> If I have a limp, flat section, I&#x27;ve normally gotten it wet with water and a Deva spray gel, which will frizz the section.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the results of my roller sets and cold rod sets with KC Spiral Spritz.</li>
            <li> I avoid using sulfates, alcohol, or harsh synthetics on my hair and have been natural for some time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep buying it for as long as Kinky Curlycontinues to make it.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product like this for a long time.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t have a lot of tangles, it should get you through an additional day or two, as needed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not a light mist that will revive your second day curls, but it can add days between washes and deep conditioning if used in a different way.</li>
            <li> other reviewers have mentioned, this is definitely a gel.  </li>
            <li> I was essentially using it w/no other products.  </li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry for about 20 minutes, while I eat breakfast or put my make-up on.</li>
            <li> I let my hair dry.</li>
            <li> I agree with a previous reviewer in that the product doesn&#x27;t last long, I believe that is tied to how the product sprays out.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair, wring out the extra water, turn my head upside down and put this stuff on the ends.</li>
            <li> but it is purple in color and is an actual greasy, oily liquid) that I had previously been using.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I diffuser blow dry it a little if it&#x27;s windy outside.</li>
            <li> The product squirts out in a stream vs your typical spray bottle spray, so if you&#x27;re one who doesn&#x27;t like to manipulate your hair much with your hands like myself, it&#x27;s hard to spread the product around.</li>
            <li> It also weighed my hair down and made it look flat.</li>
            <li> Some products make the hair hard, but this is completely natural.</li>
            <li> A big glob of gook shot straight into in your hair, and because it&#x27;s a gel texture, it&#x27;s difficult to spread around once that happens.</li>
            <li> As my hair grows the custard becomes harder to work with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it that way, too, and like it; I wet my hands, add this to my palms, and then scrunch it in to revive my waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If the product drips on your clothing, it will leave white residue where it dripped and dried.</li>
            <li> I spray it into my hand to apply and I&#x27;ve used it on my wet hair.</li>
            <li> My very thick, long combo wavy/curly hair is normally very silky and voluminous with no product at all (except a little organic argan oil), but sometimes goes a little flat on day 3 or 4.</li>
            <li> I assumed that this product might tame my second day curls-</li>
            <li> It is very slightly sticky initially</li>
            <li> Just went short again and wanted to try this to tame my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my hair when I blow dry my hair and it cuts my blow drying time in half.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was a total waste of money!  </li>
            <li> My hair is very fragile from heat styling in the past</li>
            <li> Day two, the bottle was almost half empty after two uses and my curls were not revitalized.</li>
            <li> after the product dried, I looked in the mirror and had white spots from where the product had dripped and dried all on my shoulders and chest.</li>
            <li> Like the other ladies here, just squirt a little in your hand and scrunch around on wet hair.</li>
            <li> It tames frizz and resets any loose curls without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> This product holds well without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> If I leave my hair down at the beach on a windy day, it breaks.</li>
            <li> If I have the time, I&#x27;ll use a diffuser for a bit, but I usually just let it air dry.</li>
            <li> It cuts my blow drying time in half.</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s why one less star).</li>
            <li> A little bit of this can hold or refresh curls without weighing them down or drying them out.  </li>
            <li> The downfall is the price and the fact that the description and name sets the wrong expectation.h for a new product.</li>
            <li> You just need to play around with this stuff a little.</li>
            <li> extreme dryness, which I have noticed has happened in the past with another aloe containing product.</li>
            <li> Just slippery and crunchy once they dried.</li>
            <li> Its also not cheap, which irks me.</li>
            <li> I few squirts in the palm of your hand does the trick.</li>
            <li> I usually deliberatly mess up my curls after I&#x27;ve gotten out from under the dryer anyways, so this is not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was worried it would be sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> There is a bit of crunch but a small bit of water takes that away.</li>
            <li> The spritzer does the job but leaves flakes after it dries, so use it sparingly (which is just as well as it&#x27;s not cheap!).</li>
            <li> No more &amp;#34;big hair&amp;#34; days.</li>
            <li> I keep this on hand at all times and carry a small spray bottle of it in my purse.</li>
            <li> My hair is moisturized, slick, and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It particularly trashed the 4a curls, while only slightly devastating the type b curls.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not sure what I mean, find a bottle of household cleaner and turn the nozzle to stream...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard either.</li>
            <li> My hair was crunchy and hard.</li>
            <li> The product feels like a watery oil when you are rubbing it between your fingers, but once it&#x27;s in your hair and dries, it leaves a crunchy feel to your hair, at least it did on mine.</li>
            <li> But it absolutely sucks when used by itself.</li>
            <li> It is just too thick to spray-</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it here at the ridiculous $17 price</li>
            <li> Frustrated with flattening issues here and there in my curly, layered bob (curls and waves going flat in a section of my hair on one side)</li>
            <li> The downfall is the price and the fact that the description and name sets the wrong expectation.</li>
            <li> I find myself doing roller sets and perm rod sets or cold rod sets (wrapping my hair around spiral rods and sleeping with them in) quite often.</li>
            <li> Received envelope package but nothing was inside. :-(</li>
            <li> No curls, no definition and no softness :( Will be returning!</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t the worst</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this on my hair after I wash it and it is great stuff. I also use it on my hair when I blow dry my hair and it cuts my blow drying time in half. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard either. It&#x27;s a light weight product.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have super dry, tight curls and I use the wen cleansing conditioner (which works wonders btw!) and I needed a natural styling product that didn&#x27;t have chemicals to dry my hair but still worked. This stuff is so light and leaves my hair in soft curls, not crunchy at all. It lasts me 6 months since I only have to use 3-4 sprays per time. I wash my hair, wring out the extra water, turn my head upside down and put this stuff on the ends. I use it in conjunction with a conditioning Moroccan/Argon oil mix on my ends. Then I comb it through and use a cotton t shirt to scrunch it to get most of the water out and let it air dry the rest of the way. It smells like lavender too!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Whole Foods. I originally thought it was for African-American hair, but after checking the Kinky Curly website, I realized I could use it on my hair too. My hair is wavy in some places and curly in others. I am of Eastern European descent. I love this produt. Not only does it make my hair feel soft, but it does a great job holding my waves and curls. It cuts my blow drying time in half. You just need to play around with this stuff a little. For me, I spray it directly into my hands, and spread it evenly between them before i run it through my damp hair. I scrunch my hair, then I run a wide-toothed comb through it, to make sure the product gets distributed evenly. Then I scrunch it again, paying extra attention to the parts where the hair is straighter. I let my hair air dry for about 20 minutes, while I eat breakfast or put my make-up on. Then, I literally spend two minutes blow drying it with a diffuser on a medium setting. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> i love this spray gel/shine spray. it is a great product for the final step on my fixing my curly hair (most likely it would not be strong enough to use alone though, it needs a cream or mousse first)</li>
            <li> I quickly realized this product really isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;spritz\\&quot; in the traditional sense; it&#x27;s more of a thin gel. So I actually will spray some into my hands, rub them together, then run it through my hair. Once it&#x27;s distributed, I scrunch the parts that need it. If I have the time, I&#x27;ll use a diffuser for a bit, but I usually just let it air dry. My hair is a wavy/curly combination, which changes in degree depending on its mood on any particular day (I&#x27;m caucasian). This product holds well without weighing my hair down. I love that it&#x27;s chemical free. As with any product, there&#x27;s a period of trial and error in regards to how much is needed for my hair, but that&#x27;s normal. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> I really love this entire line. The kccurling custard is a bit tricky to work with because it&#x27;s so thick and my hair is really short and fine and coily/curly. As my hair grows the custard becomes harder to work with. I wash with the come clean shampoo and then condition with Knot Today. I leave in about the size of a quarter of the knot today and then spray with water. Then I use about the same size of the curling custard. Then I use this product the spiral spritz  to refresh for day 2 and 3 and 4 day hair and even more. I squirt 6 squirts between my palms rub together and then rub into my hair. Next I put a little bit of water on my hands and then pat that on top. And if there is time I will hit it with the diffuser for about 30 seconds or blot with a t shirt or paper towel and off I go. No more touching! My hair is short.  There is a bit of crunch but a small bit of water takes that away. I do this as a refresher throughout the week and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy 2C hair and follow the Curly Girl method of not using any sulfates or silicones on my hair.  I bought the Kinky Curly Curling Custard about a year ago and love it, but whenever I use it, it takes forever for my hair to dry, so I thought I would try this Spritz out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have mentioned, this is definitely a gel.  I spray it into one palm, rub it into both hands, and then scrunch it into my hair. I use it more as a serum to help control frizz and flyaways.  Since my hair is long (just about mid-back), it&#x27;s not an economical product to use as my main product since I&#x27;d have to use a lot of it, but it works fine layered over a curl cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kinky Curly website has a how-to video showing how to use their products, and they recommend this as a second-day hair refresher.  I&#x27;ve been using it that way, too, and like it; I wet my hands, add this to my palms, and then scrunch it in to revive my waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a Holy Grail product for me (hence the four stars instead of five), but I do like it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. In order for you to get the full effect of this, you will need to use the entire line. You would use this to refresh your hair.  All of Kinky Curly products smell great!</li>
            <li> This products smells really nice and helps to refresh my hair after I use the kinky curly knot today and the curling custard. Dont hesitate to buy.</li>
            <li> The spritzer does the job but leaves flakes after it dries, so use it sparingly (which is just as well as it&#x27;s not cheap!).</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from target after reading numerous reviews (good and bad) on it. I&#x27;ve been natural my entire life (25) years and have very defined spiral curled African American hair. The product squirts out in a stream vs your typical spray bottle spray, so if you&#x27;re one who doesn&#x27;t like to manipulate your hair much with your hands like myself, it&#x27;s hard to spread the product around. You are forced to finger work, or risk walking around with huge blobs of product in your hair where the jet streams landed and dried. I agree with a previous reviewer in that the product doesn&#x27;t last long, I believe that is tied to how the product sprays out. Day two, the bottle was almost half empty after two uses and my curls were not revitalized. Just slippery and crunchy once they dried. There was no frizz, because the curls were too crunchy to frizz. The product feels like a watery oil when you are rubbing it between your fingers, but once it&#x27;s in your hair and dries, it leaves a crunchy feel to your hair, at least it did on mine. Also, beware if using this product while you are in an outfit you planned to wear out. If the product drips on your clothing, it will leave white residue where it dripped and dried. I used fresh out of the shower and after the product dried, I looked in the mirror and had white spots from where the product had dripped and dried all on my shoulders and chest. Overall, I would not recommend this product for curl maintenance.</li>
            <li> This product should be called frizzy spritz! I tried combing it through the sides of my hair and the result was that my hair became as floofy as a long-haired bunny. Lovely... if you&#x27;re a bunny. Also, gently spreading if over my hair resulted in a million straight hairs and frizz! I assumed that this product might tame my second day curls-being that my hair is very springy and spirally (type 4a/b), but no it did nothing at all. It particularly trashed the 4a curls, while only slightly devastating the type b curls. It smells interesting though- ah, this alone is its sole positive factor. This product also did absolutely nothing for my mother&#x27;s 3b/c hair! She does not even notice a difference. Please check out the reviews on various websites of this product before purchasing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can think of one purpose for this product. Try using it instead of the curling custard as soon as you come out of the shower. Perhaps then you&#x27;ll have better luck? It might suit type 3a hair. It might also be nice if you don&#x27;t have to worry about your curls getting mushed or falling out- a daily product perhaps?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;positives: interesting smell&lt;br /&gt;negatives: turns 4a/b into frizz or does nothing and has no effect upon 3c</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used! I have short, wavy, died Caucasian hair. Like the other ladies here, just squirt a little in your hand and scrunch around on wet hair. Smells lovely. No more &amp;#34;big hair&amp;#34; days.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product.  It is a little pricey since it works best when you saturate the hair and I go through about a bottle a month especially in summer.  but the way it spirals my curls makes it totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Kinky Curly Spiral Spritz at Target for $11.99 for the 8oz bottle. Don&#x27;t buy it here at the ridiculous $17 price, that is outrageous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 3a, 3b hair that is very fine and difficult to work with. I do not like my curl pattern and my hair also seems to not want to grow past a certain length, so I find myself doing roller sets and perm rod sets or cold rod sets (wrapping my hair around spiral rods and sleeping with them in) quite often. I dislike my natural pattern that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product to replace the alcohol laden wrapping lotion from Sallys ( I don&#x27;t remember the name but it is purple in color and is an actual greasy, oily liquid) that I had previously been using. On the bottle it clearly states that the product can be used for perfect roller sets and bouncy curls. This is true to 100%. I am so pleased with the results of my roller sets and cold rod sets with KC Spiral Spritz. I get lovely curls that are bouncy, touchable and only need to have one scrunch to remove any crunch that might be lingering. I usually deliberatly mess up my curls after I&#x27;ve gotten out from under the dryer anyways, so this is not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product uses natural ingredients and is 100% cruelty free too, which is a really big deal for me. I avoid using sulfates, alcohol, or harsh synthetics on my hair and have been natural for some time. I do not like the smell,  which is a bit citrusy for my taste. I also do not like the pump dispenser. It should be in a spritz bottle for easier distribution but since it is a watery gel like consistency, that might not work so well. I have to use two pumps per section of hair and as a result, I am getting quite low on product. Its also not cheap, which irks me. But if the product had a different consistency it might not work as well as it does or it may fail to provide a good hold for my curls. So I&#x27;m not complaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff. I&#x27;ll keep buying it for as long as Kinky Curlycontinues to make it.</li>
            <li> I bought this spiral spritz from Amazon made by Kinky Curly, and I didnt like the results on my hair. My hair was crunchy and hard. Im sure it&#x27;s not made for my too kinky hair. I use it to refresh my twists out and I didnt like the results. I think it works best on curly hair to maintain the curls.</li>
            <li> I have wavy fine white/silver hair which I can wear  either straight or curly. I thought this produce would enhance my curls, but the only thing it did for me was turn my hair yellow. My hairdresser said &amp;#34;what did you do to your hair?!&amp;#34; She asked me if I was using a different product and I said &amp;#34;yes, I am using the Kinky Curly Spritz and gel&amp;#34;. I had to have a toner rinse put on my hair to counteract the yellow tones which worked for about a week. I have also tried using baking soda. So, back on the shelf this goes along with the custard.</li>
            <li> Received envelope package but nothing was inside. :-(</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it keeps my hair from getting frizzy and feels soft and natural.</li>
            <li> Liked thisproduct as I have naturally wavy hair and it helped make the waves both more pronounced and more lasting.</li>
            <li> This is the best product to use to refresh your Kinky Curly Custard style.. I love it ! It softens your curl adds shine and bounce.to your hair .</li>
            <li> This product works wonders. It&#x27;s the only product that I have found so far that blends my fine/ low porosity hair with my heat damaged hair. And actually looks cute air dried and/ or in a braid/ twist out style.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was a mist sort of curl refresher. When it arrived I saw that it had a thicker consistency and I was worried it would be sticky or stiff. I am over 50 and my wavy hair is quite fine. This spray is amazing!  I spray it into my hand to apply and I&#x27;ve used it on my wet hair. When I air dry, I get great, soft curls and when I blow dry with a diffuser, I get voluminous waves that are soft and bouncy!  I have been searching for a product like this for a long time. My search is over!</li>
            <li> This product does not leave any residue and makes my hair feel natural to the touch.  Some products make the hair hard, but this is completely natural.</li>
            <li> Because it really did curl my afro and it made it look so much better. I would recommend it highly</li>
            <li> I use this as a refresher between hair washings when I&#x27;m using the Kinky Curly Gel. It tames frizz and resets any loose curls without being too heavy. The Gel does not work as well as this spritz for between washings although I love the Gel for the first, wet hair, curl set. I make sure I never run out of either product.</li>
            <li> Love this. Makes the second and third day frizzy curls behave so much better.</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t the worst but bit wasn&#x27;t the greatest either. For the price it didn&#x27;t work like I felt it should. For the price there are to many other products that work a lot better. Some of these products are even cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, curly/coily hair and follow the DEVA system (no laureth sulfates, so no shampoo - just co-wash) and I also use Ouidad when the humidity is extremely high or it&#x27;s raining.  So like almost all curlies, on days I don&#x27;t co-wash, I have to figure out how to contend with second, or third, day hair and the creeping frizz factor!  This product has no silicone and really does the trick for me.  I can smooth it on from roots to ends, scrunch and let it air dry, and I&#x27;m good!  As long as you don&#x27;t have a lot of tangles, it should get you through an additional day or two, as needed.  I keep this on hand at all times and carry a small spray bottle of it in my purse.</li>
            <li> I love this kinky Curly spiral spritz. My kids are mix with curly hair, this stuff makes their hair, beautiful shiny and bouncing curl I love all Kinky curly  products.</li>
            <li> This product is good for me when I want to refresh my kinky curly curling custard wash n go set. But it absolutely sucks when used by itself. I have very thick 4b/c hair and my hair responded okay to this when I used it by itself. My hair was soaking wet, and I blowdried it, it looked nice. The next day I woke up and my hair wasn&#x27;t as defined, and it was kind of coarse. I didn&#x27;t like that. This product gets 3 stars because it is excellent as a refresher for my kcc set, but I would not use it by itself ever again.</li>
            <li> I have 4B S-shaped, fine and frizzy curls and I totally love this product. Makes my curls look great and is NOT sticky. It is very slightly sticky initially but once you run your hands over it your hair is smooth and feels great. Love, love, love.</li>
            <li> The Kinky-Curly marketing team has work to do. This is actually a great product if used properly, but those who could benefit from it would never know due to the improper description and naming. I would have given it five stars, if not for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have african-american hair and a combination of curl patterns...tight curls at the very top of my head, and lose, smoother curls around the crown. I purchased this spiral spritz looking for something quick to revive my second-day hair...something that is a light mist, with the hold that the Carol&#x27;s Daughter leave-in conditioner mist I&#x27;ve been using doesn&#x27;t provide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this is not a spritz AT ALL...it does not mist or spray, it STREAMS. If you&#x27;re not sure what I mean, find a bottle of household cleaner and turn the nozzle to stream...that&#x27;s what you get. A big glob of gook shot straight into in your hair, and because it&#x27;s a gel texture, it&#x27;s difficult to spread around once that happens. I was dumbfounded by the fact that they describe it so incorrectly... I actually stood in the bathroom staring at the bottle for a few seconds after my first pump, totally befuddled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing the pump feature is good for, is conserving product... I know that it takes five pumps to manipulate each section of my hair. It is convenient in that regard, but still, I use this product daily and it has lasted me only about a month. It is definitely pricey, and you really need to love it to continue paying so much for so little (which I do)...which again is why they need to market it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a light mist that will revive your second day curls, but it can add days between washes and deep conditioning if used in a different way. Personally, I&#x27;ve never \\&quot;revived\\&quot; my curls by spraying anything on them on the days following a wash/deep condition/styling to a standard that I can confidently do anything other than a quick trip to the store or something of that nature...hence my search for a new product. I&#x27;ve found that, because this spiral spritz is basically a diluted version of the Kinky-Curly Curling Custard, I can loosen my curls with water and leave-in conditioner, then use this spritz to style the ares of my hair where the curls are loser. I then use another gel for the areas with tighter curls, and in about five minutes I can have AWESOME second, third, fourth, etc day curls. Because I don&#x27;t use a heavy gel, like the Curling Custard (in which case I would end up with sticky clumps), I can completely saturate my hair and get the curls really defined, and it air dries very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product defines curls without making them sticky, and leaves them light and bouncy. It has little shrinkage, and dries quickly. The downfall is the price and the fact that the description and name sets the wrong expectation.h for a new product.

            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it enough to say yet.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things!  A little bit of this can hold or refresh curls without weighing them down or drying them out.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend spraying it directly onto hair, but rather into your hands and distributing just a little all over.</li>
            <li> No, just no! Just went short again and wanted to try this to tame my curly hair. Liked that is was natural and free of allergen for me. The day before I had used a Tresemme Mousse and my curls came out bouncy, shiny and soft. Tried the same routine today and my hair came out dry, frizzy, poofy and wavy (almost straight). No curls, no definition and no softness :( Will be returning!</li>
            <li> I thought this product was a total waste of money!  It didn&#x27;t give me \\&quot;second day curls\\&quot;, didn&#x27;t make my hair soft, and goes way to fast!!!  It was much easier to make my own curling spritz, with conditioner, water, and a little aloe!  Save your money, make it yourself!</li>
            <li> My very thick, long combo wavy/curly hair is normally very silky and voluminous with no product at all (except a little organic argan oil), but sometimes goes a little flat on day 3 or 4. I tried this product by spraying it in my hand and distributing a little at a time by gentle patting- no finger-forking or spraying directly- and all that happened was frizz, and extreme dryness, which I have noticed has happened in the past with another aloe containing product. I thought aloe was supposed to hydrate but for me it dries my hair and skin. It also weighed my hair down and made it look flat. I don&#x27;t need any suggestions on how to use it better, I know what is good on my hair and what&#x27;s not. I haven&#x27;t used products besides argan oil for several years now. I also don&#x27;t use heat whatsoever because immediately I get split ends - even if it is on the cooler setting and using a diffuser - my hair just doesn&#x27;t like air. If I leave my hair down at the beach on a windy day, it breaks. My hair is very fragile from heat styling in the past and so I have to baby it now. This product may work for some others but it wasn&#x27;t good for me. It also left white flakes all throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> I am always searching for a product that will tame my curly hair, and I LOVE this.  It&#x27;s super light and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down and it&#x27;s perfect for fighting frizz.  Pro tip: DON&#x27;T spray it directly on your hair, squirt it into your palm and distribute through hair.</li>
            <li> Has been great foru granddaughter&#x27;s curly hair.  No frizz and  makes her hair so pretty!</li>
            <li> This is lightweight and not greasy. It holds in curls for a soft, curly look. I few squirts in the palm of your hand does the trick. Price is also reasonable. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I had this product for over a yr.  It was just ok bc I was essentially using it w/no other products.  I stopped using it b/c while it helped w/curl definition, it occasionally left a white film.  It consistently left my hair feeling dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since revamped my hair regimen after seeing a trichologist.  Given that my natural 4a-c hair is dry and brittle at baseline, I now keep my hair very moist (not greasy) w/curl activator...believe it or not.  Using spiral spritz to slick and groom my hair, on top of products that keep my hair moist works like an absolute charm.  My hair is moisturized, slick, and shiny.  There is never a white film, even if I use it daily. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have Caucasian, dyed and sometimes highlighted, very wavy, layered, semi-thick hair that is curlier underneath. Frustrated with flattening issues here and there in my curly, layered bob (curls and waves going flat in a section of my hair on one side) I bought this at Whole Foods, on a whim. I&#x27;m very glad I did, because it provides great hold, doesn&#x27;t leave much residue because a little goes a long way, and does not impart crunch. I&#x27;m not encouraging over-use, but since I have fairly dry, fine, older girl hair on which I use mostly DevaCurl products and wash my hair only twice a week, I have to re-style my hair almost every day. If I have a limp, flat section, I&#x27;ve normally gotten it wet with water and a Deva spray gel, which will frizz the section. Now I use just a little of this Spiral Spritz sprayed directly onto the section, gently work it in with a couple of light fingertips, and sort of guide the desired shape of the wave. Sometimes I diffuser blow dry it a little if it&#x27;s windy outside. I get instant repair and definition of the wave or curls I use this on. This product has prevented me from returning, in frustration, to the hair stylist too soon and asking her to do something about the flat area before I actually need a trim on the rest of the hair, and I am REALLY happy about that! I now use this mixed with Deva Arc Angel throughout my hair after No-Pooing and One-Conditioning. I am able to 80% blow-dry with a diffuser with great results. I usually spritz on a little more of this Spiral Spritz to redefine a bit more and air-dry. I recommend this product, and I am REEEALLY picky.</li>
            <li> These pieces are very good for my hair like it very well as low-priced thank you amazon very much love it</li>
            <li> I love the curling custard so tried this as well. Product is fine, I like the smell, good for my random curls &amp; waves- not as great as the custard though (that&#x27;s why one less star). The reason I docked another star is:  it is not a &amp;#34;spritz&amp;#34;. It is just too thick to spray- it comes out in a solid stream. I squirt it into my hand and apply that way. Also, just saw it at Target considerably cheaper about 3 days ago. Will just stick with the original custard from now on.</li>
            <li> i used this combined with curling custard and it has great slip.  flakes just a tiny bit when combined, but it&#x27;s worth it for the nice curl definition.</li>
            <li> I love this natural product.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Not for me.  Chemicals in product were itchy</li>
            <li> Humidity is not a problem anymore. I am Caucasian and I have long, super fine, low porosity (healthy) wavy 2b/2c combination hair. I use the curly girl method. I washed with Alberto VO5 moisture milk, and conditioned with Suave Naturals. I applied a quarter sized dollop of Kinky-Curly Knot Today as a leave-in conditioner to damp hair. Then, I applied Kinky-Curly Spiral Spirtz (8 pumps) and Kinky-Curly Curling Custard (a pea size) to damp hair. I let my hair dry. I reapplied a tiny bit of the spritz and custard and let it dry. (I keep a hair journal when I try out new products.) I have been trying to find something to battle the humid Texas summers. It was 102◦F, 78% humidity, and the dew point was 70◦F. I LOVE Kinky-Curly&#x27;s products. They gave me ZERO FRIZZ, super soft, defined, shiny, bouncy curls! My hair was not crunchy, wet-looking or oily! I will buy all the Kinky-Curly products again!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Would totally recommend for very curly hair.  i use this in between shampoos and it works wonders. I also use the Kinky Curly Custard.  Thrilled with all their product.</li>
