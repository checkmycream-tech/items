    <ol>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li>Best wash out there.  </li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>Product smells and feels great.</li>
            <li>This has that great tea tree smell and feeling after washing.  </li>
            <li>Great body wash.</li>
            <li>Smells great.  </li>
            <li>It smells great.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s great for anyone who does MMA</li>
            <li>It arrived in great condition and the scent is really good.  </li>
            <li>I love all their products and their body wash is great, I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a great product.</li>
            <li>large bottle for a good price, and it smells great.</li>
            <li>Cost more than CVS brand, but you will get more washes per bottle and not end up smelling like your heading out to go clubbing!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fairly mild but pleasant.</li>
            <li>I sometimes worry that these don&#x27;t actually clean you and that they just smell good</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and my skin feels healthy.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has much better deals than the salons on these products.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>You get a reasonable amount for the price and it lathers up great.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of this body wash.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the most cost-effective I found.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, its natural clean smelling, and makes you feel great with your morning shower/bath.</li>
            <li>I used this, it smelled ok and didn&#x27;t cause me to get a rash like some cheaper body washes do, but I didn&#x27;t feel like it made me all that clean</li>
            <li>so the price is justified.</li>
            <li>I use it after the gym for a refreshed clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised how much I liked it.</li>
            <li>This is another good product from American Crew.</li>
            <li>It pairs great with the other Crew products including the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, has a very nice lather, and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>I liked it so well, I&#x27;ve purchased several full sized items for myself and others, here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Tea Tree has worked well for me in other products and the body wash is very invigorating first thing in the morning and a great size to bring to the gym.</li>
            <li>I like them both, but this is a favorite, especially after a hot day or after exercise.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean smell, somewhat antiseptic, but not heavy in odor like the Tea Tree wash I have also tried.</li>
            <li>I would describe it if I could, but it doesn&#x27;t have a specific herbal fragrance, just a clean and fresh smell.</li>
            <li>good size, and last a long time.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty decent.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>Lathers very well.  </li>
            <li>This body wash really cleans and disinfects the germs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also cheaper than most of the other Tea Tree products.</li>
            <li>The scent is unique but not overwhelming and manages to blend the (often strong) scent of tea tree oil</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not masculine, with a men&#x27;s cologne fragrance, so it&#x27;s perfectly fine for both men and women.</li>
            <li>However, I did not like it as well as the classic body wash.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself to have an abnormal degree of slime on my skin, just the normal stuff a guy gets from going about his day and doing yard work, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this is my favorite body wash in the past 5 years.</li>
            <li>I bought a small sample of this on the Minimus site (a very fun samples site).</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle, and I don&#x27;t plan on switching to anything else in the near future.  </li>

            <li> Lasts long.</li>
            <li> After learning about the dangers of overusing antibacterial soap, and dealing with dry, itchy skin, I decided to try this body wash.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really dry out skin.  </li>
            <li> Having oily skin and working a dirty job are a recipe for breakouts, but this stuff gets you squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> only small complaint is the fragrance doesn&#x27;t linger very long.</li>
            <li> A little hard to get it out of bottle.</li>
            <li> The packaging I received it in was pretty cruddy, but that&#x27;s a separate issue from the product.  </li>
            <li> And while it may seem a little expensive, the 15.2 Ounce size lasts for months.</li>
            <li> Very irritating if you get it in your eyes.</li>

            <li> Product smells and feels great. I bought this along with the American Crew shave oil and I&#x27;m very happy. This is definitely a step up from your basic CVS brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this is my favorite body wash in the past 5 years. It smells great, has a very nice lather, and a little goes a long way so the price is justified.</li>

            <li> bought this for my son, for Christmas, who says that he loves it and would continue to use it. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product.  Doesn&#x27;t really dry out skin.  I use it too.  Smells great.  I recommend this to men</li>
            <li> This is another good product from American Crew. However, I did not like it as well as the classic body wash.</li>
            <li> It smells great. Lasts long. I was very surprised how much I liked it. I will be ordering more of this body wash.</li>
            <li> I used this, it smelled ok and didn&#x27;t cause me to get a rash like some cheaper body washes do, but I didn&#x27;t feel like it made me all that clean, I still felt like a lot of the sweat and body oil was still present after I got out of the shower.  I&#x27;m not a porn star, oiled up body builder, or oil rig worker, so I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself to have an abnormal degree of slime on my skin, just the normal stuff a guy gets from going about his day and doing yard work, etc.</li>
            <li> Best wash out there.  A small amount goes a long way.  Cost more than CVS brand, but you will get more washes per bottle and not end up smelling like your heading out to go clubbing!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, its natural clean smelling, and makes you feel great with your morning shower/bath. I will keep buying the American Crew brand of products.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this body wash!  Having oily skin and working a dirty job are a recipe for breakouts, but this stuff gets you squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> A little hard to get it out of bottle.</li>
            <li> good size, and last a long time.</li>
            <li> It arrived in great condition and the scent is really good.  Tea Tree has worked well for me in other products and the body wash is very invigorating first thing in the morning and a great size to bring to the gym.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and it&#x27;s the most cost-effective I found.  Lathers very well.  Tea tree oil is known for killing bacteria/viruses/fungus so it&#x27;s great for anyone who does MMA</li>
            <li> I have had Bacne for my entire life.  My dermatologist recommended using a wash that had Tea Tree Oil in it to help.  This body wash really cleans and disinfects the germs.</li>
