            <li>I am satisfied with this product thus far.</li>
            <li>I tried every cream, balm, lotion and potion on the market without success.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing cream is so smooth, non-greasy and makes your hands and face smooth and soft, without using a large amount.  </li>
            <li>We have tried many different samples of medications given to us by the dermatologist, and none have worked.  </li>
            <li>It is the first thing I&#x27;ve found that has cleared up the redness and scaliness on my nose and forehead.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this to everyone!!</li>
            <li>For the first time in years, my skin no longer itched in the winter months.</li>
            <li>still love this cream, especially when used with the serum.</li>
            <li>We saw improvements immediately and it really helped get them adopted!</li>
            <li>I use it daily as a moisturizing cream on my face and it feels so light!  </li>
            <li>This is really and truly a must-have product for both humans and pets - dogs and cats!  </li>
            <li>Dry spots, age spots, hot spots on the puppies, burns from hot oil, burns from touching a hot stove, sunburns, bug bites, hives, severely chapped hands, cuts &amp; scrapes.</li>
            <li>I have used ResQ repeatedly for various ailments that my dogs have had, including hot spots, and it clears them up very quickly.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when it arrived as early as it did and was able to try in on myself that very day.</li>
            <li>His right ear was completely normal color and texture.</li>
            <li>Five minutes later the area was still moisturized with a healthy looking glow and her only comment was how cool and soothing it felt.</li>
            <li>Finally, we got the Skin Treatment cream and after applying it twice a day for only FOUR DAYS, her skin was completely healthy!  </li>
            <li>All their products have a high grade aloe as the first ingredient.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed my skin is smoother and sun spots are much lighter.</li>
            <li>Very agreeable to use as it goes on</li>
            <li>Elbows, knees are totally irritation free since applying their product every 1 to 2 days.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to ResQ</li>
            <li>It also really helped with our dog&#x27;s ear where he had mosquito bites.  </li>
            <li>We have a paralyzed family member who developed a severe case of dermatitis over several weeks -- her skin was bright red, swollen and blistering.  </li>
            <li>My dog was attacked by another and ResQ Organics healed his wounds so fast.  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and healing.  </li>
            <li>RESQ Organics is really a miracle cream.  </li>
            <li>My hands are now almost back to normal, no swelling, no itching and no flaking dead skin that comes off taking the first layer of good skin with it.</li>
            <li>I have used this for so many different things, besides just daily skin care.</li>
            <li>The price looks a bit high, but after a month&#x27;s use, I can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this cream all over your body.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend ResQ Organics with Manuka Honey.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend it and you can&#x27;t go wrong with this great product.  </li>
            <li>It also says something about how well it works that despite the stench we just ordered a new 8oz jar.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough to use on my face during summer, but moisturizing enough for me to use it in harsher weather.</li>
            <li>I call this the miracle lotion - and it&#x27;s ALL NATURAL!  </li>
            <li>The next day she reported no ill effects and her shoulder</li>
            <li>It makes your skin really soft all the time and is addicting!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or wet feeling only smooth and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Some, like Metrogel, actually made his face much</li>
            <li>/&gt;We bought a 2oz jar of this cream early this month</li>
            <li>I met ResQ organics nearly 1 year ago.  </li>
            <li>All natural.</li>
            <li>Faded marks and scars on my body from, scratches, old bug bites, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I just bought the baby eczema treatment from their website to try to clear up my 3 month old baby&#x27;s eczma.</li>
            <li>I use this on my dogs to heal minor cuts &amp; wounds, hot spots, rashes, sores on paws and even on a ruptured anal gland.</li>
            <li>I used the cream for a couple days and the sore was completely healed.</li>
            <li>It truly is &amp;#34;a complete solution for every skin problem&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It completely changed my skin tone (and helped with scars and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>ResQ when applied has no stinging sensation and provides near immediate relief for itching.  </li>
            <li>Using it only on my left arm to see if it reduces the age spots compared to my right arm.</li>
            <li>Used it on a mysterious scabby skin condition on my horse and it went away in 3 days - important in Florida where skin problems get serious fast!  </li>
            <li>I started using this cream, several times a day, and in just a few weeks my skin was soft and smooth again.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face and neck and it has tightened my neck like no other.  </li>
            <li>The owners behind this cream are passionate about healthy living and animals - they also make a version of this cream for pets!</li>
            <li>I proceeded to massage her entire shoulder with just a finger tip of the cream and it covered her from left to right shoulder and upper back.</li>
            <li>No dry skin for me!</li>
            <li>A wound doctor and his nurse couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it worked, plus it decreased the pain better than any other topical.</li>
            <li>This product rocks..  smells a bit funky, but for every dry patch, bumps, scrapes and now on my new tattoos it works.  </li>

            <li> At first it didn&#x27;t seem to do much, but I&#x27;ve used it about 4 times a day for a month and am extremely pleased with these results!  </li>
            <li> I use it on eczema on foot and it clears it right up!  </li>
            <li> I have full confidence that it will.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bonus - It smells sweet like</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about this product, it truly works extremely well, it is everything they promised and more.  </li>
            <li> This is a 2nd order for me of the same product - which is the best review I can give.</li>
            <li> this soothed it and it quickly healed.</li>
            <li> I use it for my face, neck and around my eyes, and it absorbs  quickly.</li>
            <li> Heals up wounds quickly.  </li>
            <li> ResQ Organics is an amazing cream that helped many of our dogs that came in with burns and other skin issues.</li>
            <li> The cream went on with an excellent glide and absorbed into the skin leaving it feeling clean and glistening with a glow I had never experienced from over the counter creams or oils before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product has soothed my skin eruptions, treated severe dry skin AND goes to a good cause.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this product thus far.</li>
            <li> I tried every cream, balm, lotion and potion on the market without success.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing cream is so smooth, non-greasy and makes your hands and face smooth and soft, without using a large amount.  </li>
            <li> We have tried many different samples of medications given to us by the dermatologist, and none have worked.  </li>
            <li> It is the first thing I&#x27;ve found that has cleared up the redness and scaliness on my nose and forehead.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this to everyone!!</li>
            <li> For the first time in years, my skin no longer itched in the winter months.</li>
            <li> still love this cream, especially when used with the serum.</li>
            <li> We saw improvements immediately and it really helped get them adopted!</li>
            <li> I use it daily as a moisturizing cream on my face and it feels so light!  </li>
            <li> This is really and truly a must-have product for both humans and pets - dogs and cats!  </li>
            <li> Dry spots, age spots, hot spots on the puppies, burns from hot oil, burns from touching a hot stove, sunburns, bug bites, hives, severely chapped hands, cuts &amp; scrapes.</li>
            <li> I have used ResQ repeatedly for various ailments that my dogs have had, including hot spots, and it clears them up very quickly.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when it arrived as early as it did and was able to try in on myself that very day.</li>
            <li> His right ear was completely normal color and texture.</li>
            <li> Five minutes later the area was still moisturized with a healthy looking glow and her only comment was how cool and soothing it felt.</li>
            <li> Finally, we got the Skin Treatment cream and after applying it twice a day for only FOUR DAYS, her skin was completely healthy!  </li>
            <li> All their products have a high grade aloe as the first ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed my skin is smoother and sun spots are much lighter.</li>
            <li> Very agreeable to use as it goes on</li>
            <li> Elbows, knees are totally irritation free since applying their product every 1 to 2 days.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to ResQ</li>
            <li> It also really helped with our dog&#x27;s ear where he had mosquito bites.  </li>
            <li> We have a paralyzed family member who developed a severe case of dermatitis over several weeks -- her skin was bright red, swollen and blistering.  </li>
            <li> My dog was attacked by another and ResQ Organics healed his wounds so fast.  </li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing and healing.  </li>
            <li> RESQ Organics is really a miracle cream.  </li>
            <li> My hands are now almost back to normal, no swelling, no itching and no flaking dead skin that comes off taking the first layer of good skin with it.</li>
            <li> I have used this for so many different things, besides just daily skin care.</li>
            <li> The price looks a bit high, but after a month&#x27;s use, I can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this cream all over your body.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend ResQ Organics with Manuka Honey.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly, highly recommend it and you can&#x27;t go wrong with this great product.  </li>
            <li> It also says something about how well it works that despite the stench we just ordered a new 8oz jar.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light enough to use on my face during summer, but moisturizing enough for me to use it in harsher weather.</li>
            <li> I call this the miracle lotion - and it&#x27;s ALL NATURAL!  </li>
            <li> The next day she reported no ill effects and her shoulder</li>
            <li> It makes your skin really soft all the time and is addicting!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or wet feeling only smooth and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Some, like Metrogel, actually made his face much</li>
            <li> /&gt;We bought a 2oz jar of this cream early this month</li>
            <li> I met ResQ organics nearly 1 year ago.  </li>
            <li> All natural.</li>
            <li> Faded marks and scars on my body from, scratches, old bug bites, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I just bought the baby eczema treatment from their website to try to clear up my 3 month old baby&#x27;s eczma.</li>
            <li> I use this on my dogs to heal minor cuts &amp; wounds, hot spots, rashes, sores on paws and even on a ruptured anal gland.</li>
            <li> I used the cream for a couple days and the sore was completely healed.</li>
            <li> It truly is &amp;#34;a complete solution for every skin problem&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It completely changed my skin tone (and helped with scars and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> ResQ when applied has no stinging sensation and provides near immediate relief for itching.  </li>
            <li> Using it only on my left arm to see if it reduces the age spots compared to my right arm.</li>
            <li> Used it on a mysterious scabby skin condition on my horse and it went away in 3 days - important in Florida where skin problems get serious fast!  </li>
            <li> I started using this cream, several times a day, and in just a few weeks my skin was soft and smooth again.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and neck and it has tightened my neck like no other.  </li>
            <li> The owners behind this cream are passionate about healthy living and animals - they also make a version of this cream for pets!</li>
            <li> I proceeded to massage her entire shoulder with just a finger tip of the cream and it covered her from left to right shoulder and upper back.</li>
            <li> No dry skin for me!</li>
            <li> A wound doctor and his nurse couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it worked, plus it decreased the pain better than any other topical.</li>
            <li> This product rocks..  smells a bit funky, but for every dry patch, bumps, scrapes and now on my new tattoos it works.  </li>
            <li> I use this on bug bites (specifically mosquito bite- since I am allergic and this makes the itching stop immediately), on minor cuts &amp; burns, skin rashes, and just as a hand/body lotion to hydrate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> One jar lasts a long time as well.</li>
            <li> If you are even remotely considering buying any skin care products, definitely get this.</li>
            <li> Keeps my dry skin fully hydrated all day long.  </li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of other products and always come back to ResQ.  </li>
            <li> One jar lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Still testing it out but it has cleared my dry skin patches after about a month.</li>
            <li> In the winter, my hands are incredibly dry.  </li>
            <li> Are you looking for an organic skin cream for your dry skin?  </li>
            <li> In the winter, my skin gets so dry, and itchy.</li>
            <li> Still the winter weather took a toll on my dry flakey skin.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s face was so dry and itchy and this cream made it feel like a face again.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for everything from skins burns (me), dry skins and acne bumps</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time outdoors and was finding my skin getting dry and rough.</li>
            <li> It cleared up some little bumps I had for several months.  </li>
            <li> I put it on after the shower and then use it many times throughout the day when things are bad.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped both of my dogs bleeding skin overnight and hair was even growing back - in less than one day!  </li>
            <li> next day I used a small amount on a client who has a patch of dry scaly skin on her shoulder.</li>
            <li> I always get really dry skin in the winter, and a few days after using this cream my dry skin was gone!</li>
            <li> Re ordered the moisturizer but am anxious to visit the booth at the Women&#x27;s Show next week for additional products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on other skin problems that I&#x27;ve had, including burns, sunburns, etc.</li>
            <li> After my initial small jar I ordered the 8 oz.</li>
            <li> I threw away all other lotions.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the lower ranking users didn&#x27;t use it properly or what</li>
            <li> I suffer from eczema which gets flared up a lot due to staph.  </li>
            <li> I then introduced this cream to my husband who has dry skin on the bottom of his feet year round.</li>
            <li> I use it on bug bites, cuts, burns, dry skin just to mention a few.  </li>
            <li> My wrinkles are getting less pronounced and the age spots on my hands have almost disappeared.  </li>
            <li> I am doing a little experiment with my arms.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it was expanding a little.</li>
            <li> The skin in the ear was a dark color with small bumps like it</li>
            <li> I rubbed the cream in his ear for a few days and noticed improvement.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and would never be without it.  </li>
            <li> This is a very painful condition with lots of blisters that just cause itching, swelling and then more blisters and raw skin.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;d been scratching it until it was raw</li>
            <li> The odor lingers for at least half an hour after application (maybe longer...</li>
            <li> I waited a few minutes to see if she would have a negative reaction and there was none.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a small patch of skin that just wasn&#x27;t from a pimple over a year ago.  </li>
            <li> No more stinging angry red akin, hallelujah !!!!!</li>
            <li> This cream has saved me a few trips to the vet and doctor already which makes it well work the price!</li>
            <li> This past winter, my daughter bought me ResQ Organics Skin Treatment - with Manuka Honey &amp; Aloe Vera.  </li>
            <li> The drugs made my skin VERY sensitive and painful, like a burn!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t too late I would return this product.</li>
            <li> The product immediately provided Piper with relief from the itchiness, and the small bumps gradually diminished!  </li>
            <li> I hate greasy creams and this leaves your skin so soft with no greasy feel.</li>
            <li> 6 month old had terrible baby eczema rashes and within 48 hours, they disappeared completely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No clue what was wrong with his ear</li>
            <li> NO GOOD!!!!</li>
            <li> Yes it is expensive</li>
            <li> He has a terrible skin issue with his hands...and this product brings him instant relief!  </li>
            <li> know it sounds crazy, but its true!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got a rash out of nowhere, and it was itching like crazy.</li>
            <li> Now his ear looks like nothing was ever wrong with it!</li>
            <li> biggest complaint about this cream is that it smells horrible!  </li>
            <li> No one else seems to be complaining about the smell here, so I wonder if we got a bad batch or something.  </li>
            <li> I promise you will NOT be disappointed!</li>

            <li> I spend a lot of time outdoors and was finding my skin getting dry and rough. I started using this cream, several times a day, and in just a few weeks my skin was soft and smooth again. I now use this every day. Great texture with wonderful results.</li>
            <li> I call this the miracle lotion - and it&#x27;s ALL NATURAL!  It&#x27;s helped both of my dogs bleeding skin overnight and hair was even growing back - in less than one day!  Have recommended this to everyone I know and have heard rave reviews from them all - story after story of how this helped their skin or their pet&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to ResQ Organics last year and can say I am lost without it.  The moisturizing cream is so smooth, non-greasy and makes your hands and face smooth and soft, without using a large amount.  Re ordered the moisturizer but am anxious to visit the booth at the Women&#x27;s Show next week for additional products.  Don&#x27;t hesitate.  Order all these amazing products. Good ingredients that are good for your skin.  Very satisfied customer.  Congrats to ResQ Organics.  The serum does diminish brown spots also.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  Keeps my dry skin fully hydrated all day long.  I am doing a little experiment with my arms.  Using it only on my left arm to see if it reduces the age spots compared to my right arm.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both suffer from rosacea.  We have tried many different samples of medications given to us by the dermatologist, and none have worked.  Some, like Metrogel, actually made his face much worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We bought a 2oz jar of this cream early this month and we have both been using it faithfully morning and night. It is the first thing I&#x27;ve found that has cleared up the redness and scaliness on my nose and forehead.  His skin has noticeably improved (although it still is red).  The cream is non-greasy, and absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our biggest complaint about this cream is that it smells horrible!  Like it has gone rancid or rotten.  No one else seems to be complaining about the smell here, so I wonder if we got a bad batch or something.  The odor lingers for at least half an hour after application (maybe longer... but by then I&#x27;m probably just used to smelling it).  It says something about how well the cream does work that we&#x27;ve stuck with it and still use it despite the stink.  It also says something about how well it works that despite the stench we just ordered a new 8oz jar.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it on my face and it leaves my skin feeling refreshed!  Many of my friends have commented on how my skin looks healthy. I am so grateful to find a quality product that doesn&#x27;t contain Mineral Oil, Sulfates, and Parabens.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrific , use it all the time!</li>
            <li> This is the very best lotion or cream for helping heal our lifelong problematic skin we have ever used, eczema, allergic reactions, etc.  My daughter and I have been using it for a year now and we have been so blessed with the healing results.  We absolutely love it and use it every day!  I highly, highly recommend it and you can&#x27;t go wrong with this great product.  I also use the facial and body cleanser, it very nice also.  All their products have a high grade aloe as the first ingredient.  No gluten, soy, parabens.</li>
            <li> Weeks ago I ordered the 8oz size ResQ Organics All Day Moisturizing Skin Treatment Cream. I was surprised when it arrived as early as it did and was able to try in on myself that very day. The cream went on with an excellent glide and absorbed into the skin leaving it feeling clean and glistening with a glow I had never experienced from over the counter creams or oils before.&lt;br /&gt;The next day I used a small amount on a client who has a patch of dry scaly skin on her shoulder. I waited a few minutes to see if she would have a negative reaction and there was none. Five minutes later the area was still moisturized with a healthy looking glow and her only comment was how cool and soothing it felt. I proceeded to massage her entire shoulder with just a finger tip of the cream and it covered her from left to right shoulder and upper back. The next day she reported no ill effects and her shoulder still felt refreshed and moisturized. All I can say is this is an amazing product that I intend to keep on my menu for massage and skin treatment in the future.&lt;br /&gt;B.D.</li>
            <li> I have been using ResQ Moisturizing Cream  for over a year.  I have noticed my skin is smoother and sun spots are much lighter. The best outcome is my face. I use the serum at night and cream in am and pm. My face is tighter/firmer, wrinkles have been minimized and color is even. I love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I heard about its wide variety of impressive results.  I&#x27;ve had a small patch of skin that just wasn&#x27;t from a pimple over a year ago.  I tried a dozen things &amp; still no healing.  In fact, it was expanding a little. I ordered RESQ and YAY!!! &#x3D; the skin is now healing!!  At first it didn&#x27;t seem to do much, but I&#x27;ve used it about 4 times a day for a month and am extremely pleased with these results!  The price looks a bit high, but after a month&#x27;s use, I can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;ve used it.  You only need a tiny bit, and it helps so many things, that it is a very good investment!  YAY, RESQ for healing and for joining Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Used it on a mysterious scabby skin condition on my horse and it went away in 3 days - important in Florida where skin problems get serious fast!  Also canceled a dermatologist appointment for myself after using the product on my face for two weeks. It cleared up some little bumps I had for several months.  Now if it could only make me lose weight .....</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. My skin absorbs this product with ease. No dry skin for me!</li>
            <li> Still testing it out but it has cleared my dry skin patches after about a month. I am satisfied with this product thus far.</li>
            <li> This is a 2nd order for me of the same product - which is the best review I can give. Very agreeable to use as it goes on and does not leave your skin feeling greasy or sticky. Ingredient list is refreshingly free of synthetic/chemical products with un-pronouncable names!</li>
            <li> I met ResQ organics nearly 1 year ago.  My psoriasis is totally committed to them.  Elbows, knees are totally irritation free since applying their product every 1 to 2 days.  No more stinging angry red akin, hallelujah !!!!!</li>
            <li> ResQ Organics has cleared my skin from brown spots and blemishes.  My wrinkles are getting less pronounced and the age spots on my hands have almost disappeared.  Love this product!  Thank you - you have indeed resq&#x27;d my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used ResQ repeatedly for various ailments that my dogs have had, including hot spots, and it clears them up very quickly. I&#x27;ve also used it on other skin problems that I&#x27;ve had, including burns, sunburns, etc. It&#x27;s a great product, but more importantly a great company and small business. All natural. Organic. Definitely will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> We (myself, my husband &amp; my mom) have used this product on many ailments and have always had fantastic results! Dry spots, age spots, hot spots on the puppies, burns from hot oil, burns from touching a hot stove, sunburns, bug bites, hives, severely chapped hands, cuts &amp; scrapes. It&#x27;s my go-to in the medicine cabinet. Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> You are not going to believe how many uses I have found for this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;All successful! I was undergoing drug therapy for Hep C. The drugs made my skin VERY sensitive and painful, like a burn!&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t put anything on my face or body! I treated my skin from head to toe with Res Q cream. It was the ONY thing that worked (including many prescription creams and ointments from the Dr)&lt;br /&gt;It also works great as a hemorrhoid cream. Eliminates foot fungus. Faded marks and scars on my body from, scratches, old bug bites, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Also, my skin has never been softer or looked better!&lt;br /&gt;I know it sounds crazy, but its true!&lt;br /&gt;If I could only have ONE product, it would be this cream.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a skin rash I occasionally get, I have not gotten to try it for this yet. The moisturizing benefits are nice, my skin feels firmer and softer. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product rocks..  smells a bit funky, but for every dry patch, bumps, scrapes and now on my new tattoos it works.  All organic, the manuka honey and healing properties are the best you will find anywhere. .  They also have one for pets!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this skin cream. I always get really dry skin in the winter, and a few days after using this cream my dry skin was gone! I highly recommend using this cream all over your body. It makes your skin really soft all the time and is addicting!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I hate greasy creams and this leaves your skin so soft with no greasy feel. We are an eczma family and this works wonders on me and my sons. I just bought the baby eczema treatment from their website to try to clear up my 3 month old baby&#x27;s eczma. I have full confidence that it will. I have tried dozens of creams, ointments,  lotions and types of medicine. I&#x27;ve seen the quickest results with this product. Discovered it at a Pet Show of all things but I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> I initially ordered the 2oz pet cream to see if it would help my Dyshidrotic excema. I have had the skin condition, caused by stress, off and on for years. I tried every cream, balm, lotion and potion on the market without success. Doctors suggest steroids, which i did not want to do. There had to be another way. ResQ came to my rescue!  After my initial small jar I ordered the 8 oz. and have had continued healing. My hands are now almost back to normal, no swelling, no itching and no flaking dead skin that comes off taking the first layer of good skin with it. This is a very painful condition with lots of blisters that just cause itching, swelling and then more blisters and raw skin.  Thanks to ResQ, I finally have a partner in the fight!  i would recommend this to anyone with skin issues, and it is a miracle worker on pet skin issues as well. Hope has helped so many rescues and pets with this wonderful cream. If you are considering this cream, go for it! You will not regret the purchase.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!! In the winter, my hands are incredibly dry.  Even the best lotions don&#x27;t help.  I use the product as stated, 3 times a day and my hands are so much better. Its great on my feet and legs as well.  Winter is now bearable. I threw away all other lotions. It has a very light scent of honey. It is not greasy at all. Once you work the cream in, you don&#x27;t realize that you put anything on your skin. It&#x27;s perfect!!!</li>
            <li> This product is incredible!!!&lt;br /&gt;My 6 month old had terrible baby eczema rashes and within 48 hours, they disappeared completely.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus - It smells sweet like honey!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use the body wash now too and nothing is better for her skin!</li>
            <li> Amazing high quality product! HIGHLY recommend this to everyone!! This cream can be used for so many things! It has replaced several items in my medicine cabinet. I use this on bug bites (specifically mosquito bite- since I am allergic and this makes the itching stop immediately), on minor cuts &amp; burns, skin rashes, and just as a hand/body lotion to hydrate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I also have three dogs as well as foster for a local rescue. I use this on my dogs to heal minor cuts &amp; wounds, hot spots, rashes, sores on paws and even on a ruptured anal gland. My current foster dog (rat terrier chihuahua mix) that I recently got from the shelter had a sore on his paw. I used the cream for a couple days and the sore was completely healed. Also this same foster dog had something going on with his left ear. The skin in the ear was a dark color with small bumps like it was irritated. His right ear was completely normal color and texture. I rubbed the cream in his ear for a few days and noticed improvement. I continued to use the cream daily on his ear for a week. Now his ear looks like nothing was ever wrong with it! No clue what was wrong with his ear but this cream totally healed it! This cream has saved me a few trips to the vet and doctor already which makes it well work the price! Try this cream for yourself and your pets! I promise you will NOT be disappointed! Miracle cream indeed!</li>
            <li> Are you looking for an organic skin cream for your dry skin?  In the winter, my skin gets so dry, and itchy. I&#x27;ve tried cream, after cream, and many oils. Still the winter weather took a toll on my dry flakey skin. This past winter, my daughter bought me ResQ Organics Skin Treatment - with Manuka Honey &amp; Aloe Vera.  Instant relief! For the first time in years, my skin no longer itched in the winter months. I then introduced this cream to my husband who has dry skin on the bottom of his feet year round. With in 3 days, he had relief. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t too late I would return this product. NO GOOD!!!! waste of money.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s face was so dry and itchy and this cream made it feel like a face again.  It also really helped with our dog&#x27;s ear where he had mosquito bites.  He&#x27;d been scratching it until it was raw and he was yelping - this soothed it and it quickly healed.</li>
            <li> This cream is miraculous. Not sure if the lower ranking users didn&#x27;t use it properly or what but I have had warts on my leg for about 10 years and have tried multiple times to freeze them off (both at home and at the doctor&#x27;s) and just 3 days of using this cream and they are already VISIBLY smaller!</li>
            <li> This is my second jar of this cream. I use it for my face, neck and around my eyes, and it absorbs  quickly. It eliminates the need for separate creams and lotions and makes my life a lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;I still love this cream, especially when used with the serum. One jar lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  I use it everyday and would never be without it.  For me it has replaced prescription creams that never even worked as well as this product.  So happy that I discovered this fabulous cream!</li>
            <li> This is the best skin lotion I have ever used!  Love it so much!  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the price.  Yes it is expensive and I don&#x27;t know if everyone would be willing to spend that kind of money on it, but it is a super nice product.  It feels so nice and goes on great.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or wet feeling only smooth and moisturized.  I apply it on my face at night time and use it on my hands mostly, but my son finds great relief with this product.  He has a terrible skin issue with his hands...and this product brings him instant relief!  He was so thankful that I had resupplied him with his favorite lotion of all time!</li>
            <li> ResQ Organics is an amazing cream that helped many of our dogs that came in with burns and other skin issues. We saw improvements immediately and it really helped get them adopted!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 years, and I love it!  Not only is it a fabulous moisturizer, its great for so many things.  I use it on bug bites, cuts, burns, dry skin just to mention a few.  It is a fabulous treatment for people and animals!</li>
            <li> I suffer from eczema which gets flared up a lot due to staph.  I was looking for something to fight staph, which led me to manuka honey, which led me to this product.  I have been using it for about 6 months now and I am VERY happy with this product.  It provides a great rejuvenation for the skin and really does help to fight staph.  I put it on after the shower and then use it many times throughout the day when things are bad.  Otherwise it helps to keep things at bay.  Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> This product has been a godsend!  Great texture, but most of all -- it works!!!  It has soothed my skin, reduced itching from allergies, and it has improved the overall texture of my skin.  I have also used it on my cat&#x27;s ear tips when she broke out with a bumpy rash recently.  The product immediately provided Piper with relief from the itchiness, and the small bumps gradually diminished!  I have several jars (in my bathroom, in my desk at work, and in my purse) because I don&#x27;t like to be without it!</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing short of amazing!  I have been using it for a year and have had incredible results!  We have a paralyzed family member who developed a severe case of dermatitis over several weeks -- her skin was bright red, swollen and blistering.  We tried everything, but nothing helped.  Finally, we got the Skin Treatment cream and after applying it twice a day for only FOUR DAYS, her skin was completely healthy!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  We now just call it the &amp;#34;magic cream&amp;#34; and use it for everything!  It provides immediate pain relief from burns and cuts.  I use it daily as a moisturizing cream on my face and it feels so light!  It has definitely diminished my frown lines and wrinkles!  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this cream. First, the smell is amazing. You can actually smell a hint of honey in it! It&#x27;s light enough to use on my face during summer, but moisturizing enough for me to use it in harsher weather. One jar lasts a long time as well. The owners behind this cream are passionate about healthy living and animals - they also make a version of this cream for pets! I&#x27;ve seen the before and after pictures that show that this cream is nothing short of miraculous! Hope and Terry, the owners of this company, know the healing powers of Manuka honey and they&#x27;ve found a way to harness them into this jar.</li>
            <li> I LOVE ResQ Organics!  I use it on my face and neck and it has tightened my neck like no other.  I also use it on my dogs.  My dog was attacked by another and ResQ Organics healed his wounds so fast.  It&#x27;s great on hot spots too!!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about this product, it truly works extremely well, it is everything they promised and more.  It truly is &amp;#34;a complete solution for every skin problem&amp;#34;.  I highly recommend ResQ Organics with Manuka Honey.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few months and it is great!  I use it on eczema on foot and it clears it right up!  I have also usedit on my kids for rashes.  It clears up all kind of skin problems.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used this for so many different things, besides just daily skin care. I got a rash out of nowhere, and it was itching like crazy. I out the creme on and it stopped immediately and the rash went away with in 2 also gashed my leg on a piece of metal. Yes it was bleeding and bruised. i put the creme on, and it began healing immediately. The bruising was&#x27;t  even bad...and the pain went away with in a minute.&lt;br /&gt;Plus ladies, what its doing for my face and hands is incredible. It completely changed my skin tone (and helped with scars and wrinkles.  I never leave home with out some in purse , just in case.</li>
            <li> This is a truly amazing product.  I have had a series of skin problems, some that have confounded dermatologists.  This product has soothed my skin eruptions, treated severe dry skin AND goes to a good cause. I&#x27;ve also used it to treat my daughter&#x27;s eczema.  Nothing suspect in terms of additives, perfumes, parabens, etc.  If you are even remotely considering buying any skin care products, definitely get this.</li>
            <li> Amazing cream!  Heals up wounds quickly.  A wound doctor and his nurse couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it worked, plus it decreased the pain better than any other topical. This is the real deal. Don&#x27;t wait. Buy ReqOrganics today!</li>
            <li> I love love love this skin cream.  I use it day and night and my skin is smooth, blemish free and radiant.  I also have a cocker spaniel who has skin problems (allergies). And, I use it on her.  It is very soothing and healing.  Thank you ResQ Organics!!</li>
            <li> ResQ is a Terrific product.  I have tried dozens of other products and always come back to ResQ.  it has helped to stabilize a dermatitis/eczema condition that was continually flaring up.  ResQ when applied has no stinging sensation and provides near immediate relief for itching.  The redness does not immediately go away but with continued use, the redness is reduced over several days to a week in my case.  The ingredients are great as the feel and smell when applying suggest only the best ingredients are used.  I don&#x27;t write many reviews but in the case of this exceptional product I wanted to share my success with using it.</li>
            <li> RESQ Organics is really a miracle cream.  I have used this amazing product for over a year.  It is an awesome moisturizer. It works wonders on my husbands psoriasis and is beyond incredible on burns.  I have used it twice on burns. The pain was gone instantly.  Where there should have been severe blistering, there was none.  No pain, no blisters, no scars-absolutely incredible. This is the bet product for all skin problems.</li>
            <li> This is really and truly a must-have product for both humans and pets - dogs and cats!  I have used it for everything from skins burns (me), dry skins and acne bumps (me again:) to rashes &amp; scratches on my dog or cats.  I love that if the pets lick it, it is completely safe for them.  We always have a jar (or two) on hand.</li>
