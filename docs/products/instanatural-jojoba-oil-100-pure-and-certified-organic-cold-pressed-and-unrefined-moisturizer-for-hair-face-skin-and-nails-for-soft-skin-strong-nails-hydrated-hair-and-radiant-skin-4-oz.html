            <li>The first thing I noticed was how large this bottle is!  </li>
            <li>far as this particular brand, I would rate them in the top 3 that I have tried.</li>
            <li>her hairline is all frizzy; this time, it was still moisturized and looking pretty.  </li>
            <li>Even if I only used this Jojoba Oil for just one of the many things you can do with it--</li>
            <li>Love using it with essential oils and on my nails.</li>
            <li>The product is light..easy to absorb and my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I received this to review because I can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff!</li>
            <li>first then work your way up.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face daily and love it.</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really very versatile and useful to have in your home beauty repertoire.  </li>
            <li>I have Instanatural&#x27;s Facial Oil Cleanser, which I LOVE &amp; thought I would try the Jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>This helps seal in moisture, leaving skin soft and smooth without an oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;4.AFTERSHAVE -Apply to beard or desired area before and after shaving.</li>
            <li>Helps prevent razor burn and leaves skin smooth, soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;5.USE</li>
            <li>It definitely keeps my curls more defined and keeps the frizz away.</li>
            <li>First off the packaging on this product is great because the bottle is thick.</li>
            <li>My hair dries so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>InstaNatural Jojoba Oil is a multipurpose oil for so many different things.</li>
            <li>line: Scrub, Serum, and Lotion with care and made sure to read the instructions and suggestions prior to use.</li>
            <li>love the big bottle this comes in along with a dropper so that there is no contamination !!  </li>
            <li>First thing I did when I received this</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with jojoba oil</li>
            <li>This is the second product I&#x27;ve purchased from InstaNatural, and am just as pleased with this, as I am with their Aloe Vera Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love to use it for multiple things.</li>
            <li>The only product that was better was Focalex,a product that i could buy it from Germany,a hassle to get it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the fact that they didn&#x27;t add any extra fragrance to it!</li>
            <li>I like to wash my face with oil pretty often</li>
            <li>Directions says to use 3 drops which is enough for my hands but need more for my feet.</li>
            <li>I really like this Jojoba oil, feels great on my skin and goes on so smoothly, usually these serums break me out</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The oil came just in time for my hair wash,I used the jojoba as a scalp treatment and to mix with my other DIY Hair recipes,a pleasant smell left my hair very soft and manageable,I am in love with this brand.</li>
            <li>I use this daily to help with my dry skin and it works great.</li>
            <li>would not hesitate to purchase this again, and will most certainly purchase the aloe vera again from this same company.</li>
            <li>My only caution is to put a paper towel, newspaper, or something similar under the bottle because it&#x27;s easy to spill a drop or more when moving the dropper from bottle to body.</li>
            <li>Overall a good quality oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list as stated in the back of the bottle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice for adding young living essential oils and using as a carrier oil</li>
            <li>Overall keep up the good work on these products, it&#x27;s a definite recommend.</li>
            <li>The thought of oil on my hair did not sound very appealing, but I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>Also, it worked really well as a hot oil treatment to prepare the skin for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so im not sure how good it is</li>
            <li>I used this on my super dry ends to replenish, rehydrate and smooth</li>
            <li>I love this manufacturer they have an awesome line of all natural products and they actually stand behind their products with a full money back gaurantee</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve been using it on my split ends, and can tell that my hair looks so much healthier, and has much less static, thank goodness!  </li>
            <li>I have some dry patches on my elbows and that is where I was mostly using this for, but after using it on my elbows</li>
            <li>It makes my skin super soft without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil, I have been using it in my hair and on my nails, and it really has helped eliminate much of the dryness I was experiencing in my nail beds!  </li>
            <li>My nails are super peely and soft, and I work with my hands, often with soapy water and isopropyl.</li>
            <li>I have been using the jojoba oil on this area regularly and it is allowing my skin to become more normal.  </li>
            <li>Mostly I use it on my hands because they are extremely dry.</li>
            <li>My hair tends to get more dry at the bottom</li>

            <li>I tried it ony hair really didn&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li>The InstaNatural Jojoba oil is very replenishing to my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil makes my hair gently.</li>
            <li>clearer skin thanks to jojoba‚Äôs anti-microbial properties.</li>
            <li>Within one week of use, not only my hair felt soft and smooth and my frizz was reduced, but my dandruff was 90% gone!  </li>
            <li>A definite winner, love the results so far.</li>
            <li>Truthfully, I liked the idea of the dropper because the coconut oil was extremely messy to use.</li>
            <li>First off, I LOVE the fact that there is absolutely NO SCENT!!</li>
            <li>The most important thing to know about this product is 100% organics, which mean there is no added chemical to it.</li>
            <li>many other</li>
            <li>so my ends dry easily.  </li>
            <li>It hydrates and locks in the moisture that can so easily be lost in the dry Colorado climate.</li>
            <li>So far, I have used it for DIY anti acne masks, as a facial moisturizer after clay masks, hair oil treatment, aftershave, leave in conditioner, cuticle oil, and to treat dry skin on my heels with good results.</li>
            <li>I love jojoba oil because of all the benefits it offers for relieving dry and itchy skin.</li>
            <li>For my hair full strength ,as a carrier oil when I use my essential oils , and as a body oil.</li>
            <li>I love that this one is organic and comes in a dark glass bottle, to protect it from getting rancid.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Speaking of hair, if yours is pretty knotty, dry, or super curly, try adding a couple drops of jojoba oil onto your towel-dried tresses.</li>
            <li>It has a light feel to it and a clean scent which is something I look for as I have found some natural oils can have a little too earthy of a scent for me.</li>
            <li>I love the Essential Oils and use them very regularly</li>
            <li>Lotions never work, because most have additives that don&#x27;t agree with his allergies, or they simply don&#x27;t prevent drying well enough.</li>
            <li>But I will not, I will just tell you the main ways I use it.</li>
            <li>Love this for my skin and nails mixed with essential oils.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for quality.</li>
            <li>The amber bottle and glass dropper are high quality.</li>
            <li>I got a high discount code for this product.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality product that I would defiantly recommend.</li>
            <li>High quality oil.</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>high quality</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I try to buy all natural products and refuse to use most lotions because of parabens and other chemicals added.</li>
            <li>I like that the bottle is a decent size and the dropper works well and is not hard to use.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a little bit more than a week on my face, hair and all over my body.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this product because my skin is extremely dry.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I have VERY sensitive skin that will break out if the product is not very natural and clean.  </li>
            <li>-Smooth a quarter-sized amount over wet hair, focusing on ends</li>
            <li>and wow u can really feel the difference.</li>
            <li>I was considering adding some essential oil to it to help calm my stress levels but have not done so as of yet.</li>
            <li>I use it for everything since Jojoba is very close to the natural moisture skin has.</li>
            <li>The dark glass is much better for storage than clear plastic.  </li>
            <li>This oil is technically not an oil, but a wax ester which is the most similar natural compound to the oil produced by our skin (sebum).</li>
            <li>I normally use Argan Oil on my skin, but decided to use JoJoBa Oil</li>
            <li>Add a few drops to favorite body lotion</li>
            <li>Apply a few drops with a cotton ball and dab it around your eyes, mouth, and neck to achieve a more youthful glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunburn</li>
            <li>Been using over a week and still looks like a new bottle (dropper included</li>
            <li>Live this product.</li>
            <li>I use it somewhat traditional, after I wash my hairs I put a few drops on my hair and scalp, massage my hair, and then I cover my head with a warm towel for 20-30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Just be careful not to put too much in your hair because this stuff is powerful.</li>
            <li>I use it on my hair and my hair is very soft.</li>
            <li>that I was very surprised to even see it.</li>
            <li>He is wearing boots in the summer because of his work,and he is very sensitive to oils,he might be allergic to one,so i will wait to consult his doctor.</li>
            <li>The excess oil I rub on my face and hands - so there is no waste!</li>
            <li>but my skin turning to a dark instead of light.</li>
            <li>It makes my nails and hands so soft!  </li>
            <li>Jojoba Oil - 100% Pure &amp; Certified Organic is very  light, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at the size of the bottle - I was not expecting such a large amount for the money, so that was a bonus!</li>
            <li>I also live that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>Argan,Jojoba,Coconut and Black Jamaican Castor Oil).I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>This bottle is huge and will last a long time!  </li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of jojoba oil especially during winter when my skin gets dry.</li>
            <li>Just 3 drops to my hair after it starts to dry after getting the shower has left me with silky smooth hair all day.</li>
            <li>The bottle will also last a long time seeing as you only need a couple of drops for it to be effective (I have waist length thick,curly hair and only use 5 drops on it along with coconut oil.)</li>
            <li>I have dry skin on my legs, and I put this on my legs right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>It is too early to see a positive result, but the oil is easy to use and does not have a strong or unpleasant aroma.</li>
            <li>I added some 100% Pure Certified Organic Jojoba oil when using it as a mask for a deep cleanse/conditioning.</li>
            <li>I also find this particular jojoba oil lighter in consistency, so it absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave an oil slick on your face (or body, or wherever else you see fit).  </li>
            <li>My son is extremely allergic--to well everything really, but he still has very dry skin that tends to look very grey and not so nice in all seasons (even summer) .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped clear up my &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34; elbows in just a week.  </li>
            <li>Goes on clear.</li>
            <li>This process will clear away all the impurities that the oil extracts from the surface of your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil is a all natural moisturizer which  strengthensand moisturize making your skin, nails and hair feel and look healthier.</li>

            <li>I have gotten into a habit of using natural oils skin and scalp to moisturize and aid in growth.</li>
            <li>This Jojoba oil leaves your hair feeling soft and non greasy .</li>
            <li>After 8 yrs of wearing the face mask nightly my skin has developed a bit of skin issue where the mask sits on my face (bumps, redness etc).  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li>It makes my face and heels so soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>apply it on my arms and leg and it made my leg so soft</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>but I have sensitive skin that is acne prone</li>
            <li>I have been using this on my face, hair, and feet makes everything so soft</li>
            <li>As I never used a serum before I wonder if the filmsy texture after it dries is a natural occurance of using a serum?</li>
            <li>I am going thru a &amp;#34; natural product &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Skin is so soft after , and bug be gone.</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil has been on my list of natural items to buy for quite some time now.</li>
            <li>I tried this on my hair so far</li>
            <li>Within 2 days the burn was completely gone.</li>
            <li>And my toe nail was better,not completely healed.</li>
            <li>I have added it to my conditioner for my hair and it enhanced it leaving my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by how well it works.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I have used this oil as a moisturizer after showering, for removing makeup, and for keeping the ends of my hair soft and silky looking.</li>
            <li>Use it to add shine and naturally soften your hair, or in place of an anti-frizz product to manage unruly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, use jojoba as a natural alternative to cuticle oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Athlete‚Äôs foot infections, warts, and toenail fungus don‚Äôt stand a chance against this oil‚Äôs natural anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anti</li>
            <li>I like that the oil is packaged with a dropper so that we can apply the oil directly to the scalp</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not messy.</li>
            <li>I added this to my conditioner and it makes my hair soft and not too oily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After only a few uses, I noticed that my skin was more moisturized</li>
            <li>(little bit goes a long way - this will last a very long time) and had no problems - in fact my skin looked great</li>
            <li>probably wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for this when you can something of comparable quality for less.</li>
            <li>use a small amount on my feet before I go to bed and it transforms my feet to soft and smooth overnight.</li>
            <li>: the first few times I used way too much, now I use it one pump at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li>The main thing I have used it for is as a carrier oil for all my essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Makes skin very soft and scalp&amp; hair not dry at all.</li>
            <li>I love using this oil, it&#x27;s thick, but fast absorbing with a non heavy greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil is also very stable, so it can be kept for a long time without it going rancid or losing its antioxidant</li>
            <li>In the past I had to put in the sun light or scoop out what I needed and heat in microwave to turn into oil.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to use it to deep condition my hair, and the myriad of other uses!</li>
            <li>InstaNatural Jojoba Oil has also helped calm down irritation after I shave.  </li>
            <li>Only been using this for a few days now but it has my skin feeling more refreshed than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li>because  this is a  little more  pricy than my other brand,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just use a few drops like it says and your hair will look nice and tame.</li>
            <li>I have tried other jojoba in the past but this is far better.  </li>
            <li>My skin pores have become a little clogged from the mask and the jojoba oil, being so much like our skins natural sebum is allowing the pores to clear and become unclogged.  </li>
            <li>I usually use another high dollar product while my hair is wet to make it smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have nothing bad to say about this great product.</li>
            <li>The only reason I don&#x27;t use it for my face site because I have sensitive skin and any type of oil seems to make me break out that is not to say it will do that to anyone else.</li>
            <li>After only one use on my hands, my skins went from ew to wow.</li>
            <li>Use it directly on my hair &amp; mixed some in my shea butter mix!!</li>
            <li>Natural is the only way to go.</li>
            <li>I spent all day picking off decals by hand, and really put my nails to the test today.</li>
            <li>Lock in the hydration benefits by adding a layer of a natural cream, such as shea or cocoa butter, over the jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>I used the oil on my hair for 30 minutes as a deep conditioner and it seemed  to calm the frizz down.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who has dry anything, anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this on my little girls hair which is extremely curly and tends to dry out very easy.  </li>
            <li>I also use it on my legs after shaving, so soft and smooth, no more dry itchy shins.</li>
            <li>I have such dry skin and this has really helped a lot.</li>
            <li>Apply a few drops of the oil right after a bath or shower.</li>
            <li>love this bottle of jojoba oil by InstaNatural because it&#x27;s 100% pure, cold pressed and unrefined.</li>
            <li>Just pull up a little in the dropper, as you don&#x27;t need very much at all.</li>
            <li>Apply directly to skin, hair or nails for an intense spa-like heavy moisturizing session.</li>
            <li>Other oils I&#x27;ve used, such as another brand of fractionated coconut oil that is not supposed to be greasy, leaves a large oil mark on my laptop where I rest my arms, even after 30 minutes of it having been &amp;#34;absorbed&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I generally buy  jojoba oil in smaller bottles from the hippie food store.</li>
            <li>I have thick course hair and get split ends very easy, so I put a few drops on my hands and massage thru my hair .</li>
            <li>For the past week, I have been using the Jojoba Oil in my hair right after getting out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t wait to use this oil on my dry natural hair.</li>
            <li>Absorbs well, not super fast</li>
            <li>I use this on my face for moisturizer and it has really been helping cut down on my chin acne!</li>

            <li> far as this particular brand, I would rate them in the top 3 that I have tried.</li>
            <li> her hairline is all frizzy; this time, it was still moisturized and looking pretty.  </li>

            <li> first then work your way up.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face daily and love it.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really very versatile and useful to have in your home beauty repertoire.  </li>
            <li> I have Instanatural&#x27;s Facial Oil Cleanser, which I LOVE &amp; thought I would try the Jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> This helps seal in moisture, leaving skin soft and smooth without an oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;4.AFTERSHAVE -Apply to beard or desired area before and after shaving.</li>
            <li> Helps prevent razor burn and leaves skin smooth, soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;5.USE</li>
            <li> It definitely keeps my curls more defined and keeps the frizz away.</li>
            <li> First off the packaging on this product is great because the bottle is thick.</li>
            <li> My hair dries so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> InstaNatural Jojoba Oil is a multipurpose oil for so many different things.</li>
            <li> line: Scrub, Serum, and Lotion with care and made sure to read the instructions and suggestions prior to use.</li>
            <li> love the big bottle this comes in along with a dropper so that there is no contamination !!  </li>
            <li> First thing I did when I received this</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with jojoba oil</li>
            <li> This is the second product I&#x27;ve purchased from InstaNatural, and am just as pleased with this, as I am with their Aloe Vera Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love to use it for multiple things.</li>
            <li> The only product that was better was Focalex,a product that i could buy it from Germany,a hassle to get it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the fact that they didn&#x27;t add any extra fragrance to it!</li>
            <li> I like to wash my face with oil pretty often</li>
            <li> Directions says to use 3 drops which is enough for my hands but need more for my feet.</li>
            <li> I really like this Jojoba oil, feels great on my skin and goes on so smoothly, usually these serums break me out</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The oil came just in time for my hair wash,I used the jojoba as a scalp treatment and to mix with my other DIY Hair recipes,a pleasant smell left my hair very soft and manageable,I am in love with this brand.</li>
            <li> I use this daily to help with my dry skin and it works great.</li>
            <li> would not hesitate to purchase this again, and will most certainly purchase the aloe vera again from this same company.</li>
            <li> My only caution is to put a paper towel, newspaper, or something similar under the bottle because it&#x27;s easy to spill a drop or more when moving the dropper from bottle to body.</li>
            <li> Overall a good quality oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list as stated in the back of the bottle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice for adding young living essential oils and using as a carrier oil</li>
            <li> Overall keep up the good work on these products, it&#x27;s a definite recommend.</li>
            <li> The thought of oil on my hair did not sound very appealing, but I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> Also, it worked really well as a hot oil treatment to prepare the skin for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so im not sure how good it is</li>
            <li> I used this on my super dry ends to replenish, rehydrate and smooth</li>
            <li> I love this manufacturer they have an awesome line of all natural products and they actually stand behind their products with a full money back gaurantee</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve been using it on my split ends, and can tell that my hair looks so much healthier, and has much less static, thank goodness!  </li>
            <li> I have some dry patches on my elbows and that is where I was mostly using this for, but after using it on my elbows</li>
            <li> It makes my skin super soft without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil, I have been using it in my hair and on my nails, and it really has helped eliminate much of the dryness I was experiencing in my nail beds!  </li>
            <li> My nails are super peely and soft, and I work with my hands, often with soapy water and isopropyl.</li>
            <li> I have been using the jojoba oil on this area regularly and it is allowing my skin to become more normal.  </li>
            <li> Mostly I use it on my hands because they are extremely dry.</li>

            <li> Jojoba oil makes my hair gently.</li>
            <li> clearer skin thanks to jojoba‚Äôs anti-microbial properties.</li>
            <li> Within one week of use, not only my hair felt soft and smooth and my frizz was reduced, but my dandruff was 90% gone!  </li>
            <li> A definite winner, love the results so far.</li>
            <li> Truthfully, I liked the idea of the dropper because the coconut oil was extremely messy to use.</li>
            <li> First off, I LOVE the fact that there is absolutely NO SCENT!!</li>
            <li> The most important thing to know about this product is 100% organics, which mean there is no added chemical to it.</li>
            <li> many other</li>
            <li> so my ends dry easily.  </li>
            <li> It hydrates and locks in the moisture that can so easily be lost in the dry Colorado climate.</li>
            <li> So far, I have used it for DIY anti acne masks, as a facial moisturizer after clay masks, hair oil treatment, aftershave, leave in conditioner, cuticle oil, and to treat dry skin on my heels with good results.</li>
            <li> I love jojoba oil because of all the benefits it offers for relieving dry and itchy skin.</li>
            <li> For my hair full strength ,as a carrier oil when I use my essential oils , and as a body oil.</li>
            <li> I love that this one is organic and comes in a dark glass bottle, to protect it from getting rancid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Speaking of hair, if yours is pretty knotty, dry, or super curly, try adding a couple drops of jojoba oil onto your towel-dried tresses.</li>
            <li> It has a light feel to it and a clean scent which is something I look for as I have found some natural oils can have a little too earthy of a scent for me.</li>
            <li> I love the Essential Oils and use them very regularly</li>
            <li> Lotions never work, because most have additives that don&#x27;t agree with his allergies, or they simply don&#x27;t prevent drying well enough.</li>
            <li> But I will not, I will just tell you the main ways I use it.</li>
            <li> Love this for my skin and nails mixed with essential oils.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for quality.</li>
            <li> The amber bottle and glass dropper are high quality.</li>
            <li> I got a high discount code for this product.</li>

            <li> high quality</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I try to buy all natural products and refuse to use most lotions because of parabens and other chemicals added.</li>
            <li> I like that the bottle is a decent size and the dropper works well and is not hard to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a little bit more than a week on my face, hair and all over my body.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this product because my skin is extremely dry.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have VERY sensitive skin that will break out if the product is not very natural and clean.  </li>
            <li> -Smooth a quarter-sized amount over wet hair, focusing on ends</li>
            <li> and wow u can really feel the difference.</li>
            <li> I was considering adding some essential oil to it to help calm my stress levels but have not done so as of yet.</li>
            <li> I use it for everything since Jojoba is very close to the natural moisture skin has.</li>
            <li> The dark glass is much better for storage than clear plastic.  </li>
            <li> This oil is technically not an oil, but a wax ester which is the most similar natural compound to the oil produced by our skin (sebum).</li>
            <li> I normally use Argan Oil on my skin, but decided to use JoJoBa Oil</li>
            <li> Add a few drops to favorite body lotion</li>
            <li> Apply a few drops with a cotton ball and dab it around your eyes, mouth, and neck to achieve a more youthful glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunburn</li>
            <li> Been using over a week and still looks like a new bottle (dropper included</li>
            <li> Live this product.</li>
            <li> I use it somewhat traditional, after I wash my hairs I put a few drops on my hair and scalp, massage my hair, and then I cover my head with a warm towel for 20-30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful not to put too much in your hair because this stuff is powerful.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair and my hair is very soft.</li>
            <li> that I was very surprised to even see it.</li>
            <li> He is wearing boots in the summer because of his work,and he is very sensitive to oils,he might be allergic to one,so i will wait to consult his doctor.</li>
            <li> The excess oil I rub on my face and hands - so there is no waste!</li>
            <li> but my skin turning to a dark instead of light.</li>
            <li> It makes my nails and hands so soft!  </li>
            <li> Jojoba Oil - 100% Pure &amp; Certified Organic is very  light, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at the size of the bottle - I was not expecting such a large amount for the money, so that was a bonus!</li>
            <li> I also live that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> Argan,Jojoba,Coconut and Black Jamaican Castor Oil).I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> This bottle is huge and will last a long time!  </li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of jojoba oil especially during winter when my skin gets dry.</li>
            <li> Just 3 drops to my hair after it starts to dry after getting the shower has left me with silky smooth hair all day.</li>
            <li> The bottle will also last a long time seeing as you only need a couple of drops for it to be effective (I have waist length thick,curly hair and only use 5 drops on it along with coconut oil.)</li>
            <li> I have dry skin on my legs, and I put this on my legs right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> It is too early to see a positive result, but the oil is easy to use and does not have a strong or unpleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> I added some 100% Pure Certified Organic Jojoba oil when using it as a mask for a deep cleanse/conditioning.</li>
            <li> I also find this particular jojoba oil lighter in consistency, so it absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave an oil slick on your face (or body, or wherever else you see fit).  </li>
            <li> My son is extremely allergic--to well everything really, but he still has very dry skin that tends to look very grey and not so nice in all seasons (even summer) .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped clear up my &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34; elbows in just a week.  </li>
            <li> Goes on clear.</li>
            <li> This process will clear away all the impurities that the oil extracts from the surface of your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This Jojoba oil leaves your hair feeling soft and non greasy .</li>
            <li> After 8 yrs of wearing the face mask nightly my skin has developed a bit of skin issue where the mask sits on my face (bumps, redness etc).  </li>

            <li> apply it on my arms and leg and it made my leg so soft</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> but I have sensitive skin that is acne prone</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face, hair, and feet makes everything so soft</li>
            <li> As I never used a serum before I wonder if the filmsy texture after it dries is a natural occurance of using a serum?</li>
            <li> I am going thru a &amp;#34; natural product &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Skin is so soft after , and bug be gone.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil has been on my list of natural items to buy for quite some time now.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my hair so far</li>
            <li> Within 2 days the burn was completely gone.</li>
            <li> And my toe nail was better,not completely healed.</li>
            <li> I have added it to my conditioner for my hair and it enhanced it leaving my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how well it works.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I have used this oil as a moisturizer after showering, for removing makeup, and for keeping the ends of my hair soft and silky looking.</li>
            <li> Use it to add shine and naturally soften your hair, or in place of an anti-frizz product to manage unruly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , use jojoba as a natural alternative to cuticle oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Athlete‚Äôs foot infections, warts, and toenail fungus don‚Äôt stand a chance against this oil‚Äôs natural anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anti</li>
            <li> I like that the oil is packaged with a dropper so that we can apply the oil directly to the scalp</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not messy.</li>
            <li> I added this to my conditioner and it makes my hair soft and not too oily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After only a few uses, I noticed that my skin was more moisturized</li>
            <li> (little bit goes a long way - this will last a very long time) and had no problems - in fact my skin looked great</li>
            <li> probably wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for this when you can something of comparable quality for less.</li>
            <li> use a small amount on my feet before I go to bed and it transforms my feet to soft and smooth overnight.</li>
            <li> : the first few times I used way too much, now I use it one pump at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li> The main thing I have used it for is as a carrier oil for all my essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Makes skin very soft and scalp&amp; hair not dry at all.</li>
            <li> I love using this oil, it&#x27;s thick, but fast absorbing with a non heavy greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is also very stable, so it can be kept for a long time without it going rancid or losing its antioxidant</li>
            <li> In the past I had to put in the sun light or scoop out what I needed and heat in microwave to turn into oil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to use it to deep condition my hair, and the myriad of other uses!</li>
            <li> InstaNatural Jojoba Oil has also helped calm down irritation after I shave.  </li>
            <li> Only been using this for a few days now but it has my skin feeling more refreshed than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li> because  this is a  little more  pricy than my other brand,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just use a few drops like it says and your hair will look nice and tame.</li>
            <li> I have tried other jojoba in the past but this is far better.  </li>
            <li> My skin pores have become a little clogged from the mask and the jojoba oil, being so much like our skins natural sebum is allowing the pores to clear and become unclogged.  </li>
            <li> I usually use another high dollar product while my hair is wet to make it smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about this great product.</li>
            <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t use it for my face site because I have sensitive skin and any type of oil seems to make me break out that is not to say it will do that to anyone else.</li>
            <li> After only one use on my hands, my skins went from ew to wow.</li>
            <li> Use it directly on my hair &amp; mixed some in my shea butter mix!!</li>
            <li> Natural is the only way to go.</li>
            <li> I spent all day picking off decals by hand, and really put my nails to the test today.</li>
            <li> Lock in the hydration benefits by adding a layer of a natural cream, such as shea or cocoa butter, over the jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> I used the oil on my hair for 30 minutes as a deep conditioner and it seemed  to calm the frizz down.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who has dry anything, anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this on my little girls hair which is extremely curly and tends to dry out very easy.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my legs after shaving, so soft and smooth, no more dry itchy shins.</li>
            <li> I have such dry skin and this has really helped a lot.</li>
            <li> Apply a few drops of the oil right after a bath or shower.</li>
            <li> love this bottle of jojoba oil by InstaNatural because it&#x27;s 100% pure, cold pressed and unrefined.</li>
            <li> Just pull up a little in the dropper, as you don&#x27;t need very much at all.</li>
            <li> Apply directly to skin, hair or nails for an intense spa-like heavy moisturizing session.</li>
            <li> Other oils I&#x27;ve used, such as another brand of fractionated coconut oil that is not supposed to be greasy, leaves a large oil mark on my laptop where I rest my arms, even after 30 minutes of it having been &amp;#34;absorbed&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I generally buy  jojoba oil in smaller bottles from the hippie food store.</li>
            <li> I have thick course hair and get split ends very easy, so I put a few drops on my hands and massage thru my hair .</li>
            <li> For the past week, I have been using the Jojoba Oil in my hair right after getting out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to use this oil on my dry natural hair.</li>
            <li> Absorbs well, not super fast</li>
            <li> I use this on my face for moisturizer and it has really been helping cut down on my chin acne!</li>
            <li> Some people have mentioned it to be too thick for their faces, however I have found that if you gently press the product into your skin and give yourself a couple minutes it completely absorbs and your skin is happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its really moisturizing and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I also like slathering it on my dry and gross feet because it is the only thing that softens the skin enough so I can buff them.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is big and will last a really long time.</li>
            <li> it could be that my face had hit a &amp;#34;product plateau&amp;#34; and using new ones gave it a little something extra?</li>
            <li> but I find that when you use pure beauty oils they usually don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair and it is really frizzy but this oil helps to tame it down.</li>
            <li> Will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> it is long lasting and isn&#x27;t too greasy for me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had one in such a long time,</li>
            <li> Tried to use on my face and developed a slight reaction.</li>
            <li> I add this jojoba oil to my hair moisturizer and to my facial lotion on days when my skin feels a bit dry.</li>
            <li> My face always gets dry especially after I shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of creams and lotions but my skin gets dry again shortly after.</li>
            <li> It has helped my dry hair immensely</li>
            <li> I tried it on dry, non-moist skin and it did take quite a bit of rubbing in before it wasn&#x27;t oily - definitely recommend using when skin is moist.  </li>
            <li> This jojoba oil is lightweight, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling behind.</li>
            <li> It is a serum that is not too thick or too thin and apply s nicely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anytime I see &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; on a product I think of the crazy celebrities that bleach their skin to truly ugly and quickly noticeable results, that act like they look great</li>
            <li> I personally use for my nails and hands because my hands are always very dry, as are my cuticles.</li>
            <li> High quality oil with a convenient dropper for mixing small amounts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with my skin being uneven and sensitive, as well as oily and blackhead prone--</li>
            <li> a long way.consider trying this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;  distribute through hair, leave as long as overnight, shampoo out.</li>
            <li> I recently got a chance to review a few different brands of jojoba oil and this is definitely one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> This is a much thicker and less messy alternative.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from dandruff and dry skin for a long time, and my friend recommended that I try Jojoba Oil for my dandruff.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since a little goes SUCH a long way, this 4 oz bottle will last quite a while, even using it for everything under the sun.</li>
            <li> Also, as far as my cuticles-- they were a dry mess!  </li>
            <li> that means it will carry other essential oils&#x27;</li>
            <li> I will definitely reorder and try their other products.</li>
            <li> It can also be mixed with other oils or used in a diffuser.</li>
            <li> This was bigger than the other oils i have ordered.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that it took me so long to discover Jojoba Oil!</li>
            <li> I have VERY long and course hair.  </li>
            <li> I like to use this oil for my dry skin and my nails.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t have split ends and doesn&#x27;t feel nor look dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had dry hair.  </li>
            <li> but I do see some dry skin flaking on my forehead and the side of my nose.</li>
            <li> It does improve the skin texture and the dry flaky skin is gone.</li>
            <li> After I wash my hair and towel dry, I put couple drops of oil on my hand and rub it into my hair and then blow dry.</li>
            <li> After shaving my legs are always SO dry and feel like alligator skin.</li>
            <li> My cuticles aren&#x27;t dry and pulling away, and I almost have zero hang nails.</li>
            <li> I use this for stronger nails, shiny hair, dry hands and face.</li>
            <li> I purchased it to use with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to others with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I started to notice that my hair was course and dry feeling during and after using conditioner.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural&#x27;s Jojoba Oil was just what I needed for my dry, cracked, brittle toenails.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too fuzzy and dry.</li>
            <li> Used it on my dry skin and it worked well.</li>
            <li> The last few months i started to use different oils to improve my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The oil has long been used in ancient medicine to treat sunburn, heat rash, and other minor skin irritations.</li>
            <li> so the ends aren&#x27;t exposed and securing loosely.  </li>
            <li> you only need a little bit to go a long way.</li>
            <li> My cuticles ate always dry but not anymore!</li>
            <li> I use it as a deep conditioner once or twice a week and almost daily I use a small amount as to help with my frizzy hair on humid days.</li>
            <li> The oil may initially leave a slight sheen, but just blot away residual oil to reduce excess moisture.</li>
            <li> My hair is roughly halfway down my back.</li>
            <li> If your hair is very dry try using this oil</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I use it on my very dry hair every day after showering.</li>

            <li> I put a few drops of this in my lotion or even by itself and it brings my legs back to life.</li>
            <li> and I have absolutely no issue rinsing it out.</li>
            <li> I am really curious if any of the reviewers have tryed the Jojoba oil for their nail fungus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thicker oil but absorbs into the skin in a few minutes then simply apply makeup over it.</li>
            <li> I can see the different after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> and it has absolutely no smell.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin all around and after using which by the way a few drops goes a long way.</li>
            <li> So before using this, I had very dry skin due to drinking a lot of coffee.</li>
            <li> You get a lot for the small price you pay, this bottle is going to last you a very long time!</li>
            <li> Since it is all natural, there is no more itching and the oil is thick enough that he was sufficiently moisturized head to toe (even under a layer of sunscreen, ocean and beach sand).</li>

            <li> This multipurpose carrier oil is great for hair, nails and skin.I have thick course hair and get split ends very easy, so I put a few drops on my hands and massage thru my hair . Wrap in a towel  for about an hour than I take my shower and rinse my hair and my hair is so smooth and shiney. I use as facial moisturizer and I use on my hands and nails to moisturize and strenghten my nails. Its a light  weight and fast absorbing. It also helps with dandruff, heat damage. Jojoba oil is a all natural moisturizer which  strengthensand moisturize making your skin, nails and hair feel and look healthier. I received this gift for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Good hair treatment and surprising makeup remover for my wife</li>
            <li> I like to use this oil for my dry skin and my nails. The only reason I don&#x27;t use it for my face site because I have sensitive skin and any type of oil seems to make me break out that is not to say it will do that to anyone else. I like that the bottle is a decent size and the dropper works well and is not hard to use. A few drops goes a long way. It has a pleasant smell to it so my skin doesn&#x27;t smell funky when I use it. It also absorbs nicely. These are my own honest opinions after having tried this product.</li>
            <li> The most important thing to know about this product is 100% organics, which mean there is no added chemical to it. key ingredient jojoba! that&#x27;s it.  I use jojoba oil for my hair.  It help thicken the hair strain. you can use it in daily basis or 2-3 times a week. I use it somewhat traditional, after I wash my hairs I put a few drops on my hair and scalp, massage my hair, and then I cover my head with a warm towel for 20-30 minutes.  After 20-30 minutes, I rinse my hair.  It makes my hair glowing.</li>
            <li> I love Jojoba oil, and love that this is from InstaNatural! Works great for hair, skin and nails. I personally use for my nails and hands because my hands are always very dry, as are my cuticles. If you do use in your hair you only need a little bit to go a long way. You get a lot for the small price you pay, this bottle is going to last you a very long time! A few drops is all you need for almost every use.</li>
            <li> After having used this item for a couple of days I have to say its great. There is no smell so its easy to use on the face without being overwhelmed with a scent you either like or dont like. It is a serum that is not too thick or too thin and apply s nicely. It does not leave a sticky feeling and rubs in easily. I recommend this to all people who need attention with their skin, hair and nails.</li>
            <li> Large bottle of unscented pure oil.  This oil is light and absorbs very quickly into the skin without a greasy feel.  Will last a long time.  Good for dry skin, as a carrier oil, or as a massage oil.  I use this to dilute essential oils so I can use them as perfume.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this on my little girls hair which is extremely curly and tends to dry out very easy.  I used as I did her hair in the morning, I usually use lotions and various leave in treatments.  The difference was amazing!!!  Usually when I pick her up from school her hairline is all frizzy; this time, it was still moisturized and looking pretty.  So excited to have this product!  Thanks for the opportunity to test</li>
            <li> Good quality oil.  its a very good size also ... will last a long time.  A little goes a long way.  very smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I have an incredibly oily face and jojoba oil is one of the oils that closely resembles the oil produced by our face. As such, I&#x27;ve been using it as a moisturizer day and night and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in the oiliness of my face. My makeup last longer now and I don&#x27;t have to constantly pat my face to remove excess oil. This jojoba oil soaks into my skin and provides enough moisture.</li>
            <li> This amazing product has done so many wonderful things for my skin, hair, and nails!  I&#x27;ve always had issues with my skin being uneven and sensitive, as well as oily and blackhead prone--but once I introduced this Jojoba Oil into my regimen, everything is evening itself out! I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased! Also, I&#x27;ve been using it on my split ends, and can tell that my hair looks so much healthier, and has much less static, thank goodness!  Also, as far as my cuticles-- they were a dry mess!  I&#x27;ve kept the bottle beside my bedside and have been applying a few drops at night to my hands and feet (nail beds and cuticles) and have seen a vast improvement! They look so soft and smooth now!  Even if I only used this Jojoba Oil for just one of the many things you can do with it-- I would still be completely satisfied! :)</li>
            <li> I have been using jojoba oil for some time now and I have purchased from several companies. I really like using jojoba oil especially when I do my at-home chemical peels, it is the perfect product to soothe my skin afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as this particular brand, I would rate them in the top 3 that I have tried. the absorption rate is terrific and it is an added plus that it is certified organic! That is especially good for those who make creams, butters, oils etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, you are getting a healthy amount of oil too. I would recommend this product easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instanatural provided this oil for my review and feedback.</li>
            <li> I LOVE that this has no scent!  I hate oils that are heavily scented!  I have dry skin on my legs, and I put this on my legs right out of the shower.  I do not use it in my hair as I have fine hair.  I love how strong it makes my nails, and how soft my hands and legs are with this oil!  Jojoba oil is the best!</li>
            <li> Ive used this for a few days and already see a big difference in my skin. Has my skin so soft and radiant</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I apply it to my face before bed and it makes my skin feel softer and moisturized.  I also massage it into my hands and nails.</li>
            <li> I use this oil everyday for everything!!! Not too oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> Organic oil which is good, i just go for organic things, it has the organic certification logo printed on the bottle. good for essential oild blends as a carrier oil. Has no smell at all and leave your sking soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft</li>
            <li> Love this oil!  It&#x27;s helped clear up my &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34; elbows in just a week.  Love that is offers so many uses.  My teen uses it on the ends of her hair.  Been using over a week and still looks like a new bottle (dropper included helps prevent unecessary waste! )</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my hair.  Found a few ways to use it on Pinterest. If your hair is very dry try using this oil</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I used it in my hair and combined with my body lotion for all day moisture. Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, even on second day hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to use this. I will keep you posted on how great I hope my skin and hair will feel after using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil on my hair and have noticed a difference in its softness and manageability.  The excess oil I rub on my face and hands - so there is no waste!</li>
            <li> Made a nice difference on my dry legs. Tried to use on my face and developed a slight reaction. Goes on oily at first but then quickly absorbs into skin and lasts for hours o leave legs looking smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It might be good. I wouldn&#x27;t know, because it arrived leaking into the envelope. #wasteofmoney.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural Jojoba Oil - Tried this on a promotion and I have to say it is a really nice go to multi purpose oil for moisturizing and nourishing hair, skin and nails.  It has a light feel to it and a clean scent which is something I look for as I have found some natural oils can have a little too earthy of a scent for me. This is cold pressed and unrefined so it is completely natural and at the peak of its nutritional life. I have been using it as a cleanser to remove my make-up and it really does a great job dissolving mascara as well as foundation leaving your skin clean and soft not stripped like other cleansers can. After cleansing I am using their Vitamin C Toner and my skin honestly has never looked better since I switched over to this all natural line by this manufacturer. I am also using it on the ends of my hair very light after shampooing but before blow drying and my hair looks shiny and smooth.  I love this manufacturer they have an awesome line of all natural products and they actually stand behind their products with a full money back gaurantee so I feel like how can you go wrong trying any and all of their skincare line. Really good sized bottle as well.</li>
            <li> great product! I most definetly will be back for more!</li>
            <li> Great to moisturize hair from frizz but don&#x27;t use too much.. It will leave it very oily. Also great as a skin moisturizer.. No need for lotion.</li>
            <li> A big part of the appeal of jojoba oil is the variety of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it on my nails and finding them stronger and my cuticles more moisturized. Really enjoying the results.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for you skin.  I use it at night so it works into my skin overnight.  Also I add it as a treatment to my hair and it also helps keep well moisturized..</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT,GREAT PRICE,FAST SHIPPING, GREAT SELLER!!!</li>
            <li> A super hydrating oil and makes you feel like you have baby skin.. It keeps you moisturized all day and feels great.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Everyone uses it differently but I have been researching and using it in different ways and I love it! I would recommend for anyone that buys to look up uses for this oil and try out all different ways.</li>
            <li> I love jojoba oil because of all the benefits it offers for relieving dry and itchy skin. It is ideal for mixing with other butters and cream like she&#x27;s and almond butter and has a light, almost undetectable scent. This company is great in that it produces this oil in a purified way, so you know the product is of top quality.</li>
            <li> I love this product,  it makes my hair feel so soft</li>
            <li> Love using it with essential oils and on my nails. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Makes your skin feel soft &amp; silky after you use it. I use it on everything..hands, feet, arms &amp; legs. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days now. But I used it on my husbands cuticles and my face and it wasn&#x27;t oily on my face at all really soaked in the skin nice and my husbands cuticles seem to be looking better than they did before.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from dandruff and dry skin for a long time, and my friend recommended that I try Jojoba Oil for my dandruff.  The thought of oil on my hair did not sound very appealing, but I gave it a try.  I mixed a small drop with my hair conditioner.  Within one week of use, not only my hair felt soft and smooth and my frizz was reduced, but my dandruff was 90% gone!  I have also used a small drop and massaged it on my scalp before bed, and my hair nor scalp do not feel oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The InstaNatural Jojoba Oil has also helped calm down irritation after I shave.  It has made my legs smooth to the touch, and this product is not greasy at all, so no oil will ever rub off on my favorite pair of pants or skirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy that InstaNatural has finally came up with a 100% pure and organic Jojoba Oil!  I have been searching for a very good quality Jojoba Oil, and have tried a few, and I must say that the InstaNatural Jojoba Oil is definitely top quality!</li>
            <li> Goes on clear. Have a slight smell but not over powering</li>
            <li> I am completely loving this oil. It&#x27;s made a difference in just the few days I&#x27;ve had it. Can&#x27;t wait to use it in some of my homemade skin and hair care stuff that I use</li>
            <li> Stops the itching and makes beard feel nice</li>
            <li> A definite winner, love the results so far.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is the best oil for your skin because it&#x27;s one of the few oils your skin (and nails)  can actually absorb  unlike other oils like olive oil or sesame oil,which are common oils used for moisturizing. I was so excited to receive this product because my skin is extremely dry. After only one use on my hands, my skins went from ew to wow. I am so happy with this product! My cuticles ate always dry but not anymore! Plus I love that this comes with a dropper for easy application!!</li>
            <li> Have used this on my hair, my feet, my hands, my face!! A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have to edit my review because it did end up breaking me out and horribly but it took about a week. I hadn&#x27;t changed anything else skin wise. I had heard such good things so I wish it would have worked for me :(</li>
            <li> I am using the jojoba oil in my hair periodically at night, then washing it out in the morning.  My hair is noticeably shiner and healthier!</li>
            <li> What a beautiful oil! I use this morning and night! It absorbs quickly and lasts all day! I even rub it in my scalp at night on the rest on my cuticles. It is helping my color treated hair stay health, and my nails are long, healthy and beautiful! I recommend this to everyone! I received this in return for my unbiased opinion. Thank you InstaNatural! You turned my life around! I have my friends and family using your products now :)</li>
            <li> Great quality. I use this on my face for moisturizer and it has really been helping cut down on my chin acne!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several weeks now. I have noticed that my cuticles and nails are in much better shape than before I was using the product I use it about once a day.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I have been using it in my hair, to remove my makeup, and as a moisturizer! It works great!</li>
            <li> I love anything that strengthen my hair &amp; great for my skin. this product is so easy to use. Its all up to you on how shiny you want her hair &amp; skin</li>
            <li> I love this oil. The product is light..easy to absorb and my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> not too thick, but extremely moisturizing. my hair is LOVING this product!</li>
            <li> LOVE this.  Very hydrating for skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I use it as a carrier oil for my essential oils that I use as a facial moisturizer. I also use this as a leave-on conditioner for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love using this oil, it&#x27;s thick, but fast absorbing with a non heavy greasy feeling. I have some dry patches on my elbows and that is where I was mostly using this for, but after using it on my elbows I found my hands feeling amazingly soft and supple. I now use this on my feet, hands, neck, elbows, face. It really is a great product, and the scent is super mild. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair yet, but hope to soon.</li>
            <li> (I received a discount for my review.)  I generally buy  jojoba oil in smaller bottles from the hippie food store. It (and coconut oil) are the only things that don&#x27;t break me out! I have oily/acne-prone skin and I only moisturize as-needed (yes, I know oil needs oil, etc., my skin doesn&#x27;t agree).  This bottle is huge! It&#x27;s going to last forever. I really like that it has a dropper, so I don&#x27;t have to put my finger on the bottle. The dark glass is much better for storage than clear plastic.  It is the only Instanatural product that doesn&#x27;t have like, 40 things in it! It works just like a jojoba oil should. If it ever runs out, I&#x27;d probably get this brand again for the bottle.</li>
            <li> Loving this product. I use this in my hair every other night. Makes my hair shine.</li>
            <li> Great size for the price. Nice oil for multi purpose moisturizing</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It is amazing. I have used it for my hair, skin, and nails. It makes my skin super soft without feeling greasy. I actually used this to shave my legs in the shower and it worked well. I use it on my hair and my hair is very soft. I use it on my face (just 1 drop) and it adds enough moisture without going over to the greasy side. I actually tend to get oily skin but, this really helps keep that in control. My skin looks matte after is absorbs and stays that way for awhile. Lasts all day on face and body. There is no scent, so it doesn&#x27;t bother any allergies either.</li>
            <li> Added this to my growing collection of InstaNatural oils. Added this to my growth mixture.</li>
            <li> Works great to keep my cuticles in decent shape. I seen a price at $50 though. I would never pay that much for it.</li>
            <li> Great product! I love it! This works great I use it for my hair and skin it is a great moisturizer for my skin and leaves my hair looking shiny and healthy</li>
            <li> i tied this just once so im not sure how good it is but i did notice it does make my skin softer</li>
            <li> I have issues with dry and itchy skin, so I was very excited to try this. After only a few uses, I noticed that my skin was more moisturized and I did not have nearly as much skin flaking off. I have been dealing with my problem skin for years, and though it&#x27;s not 100% better, it&#x27;s a 100% improvement!</li>
            <li> I used the Jojoba Oil on my finger nails and cuticles.  Absolutely would recommend.  My cuticles are terrible but just a couple of drops and they felt and looked much better.</li>
            <li> I love this line&#x27;s products! I knew the jojoba oil wouldn&#x27;t disappoint! my hair feels so fresh! I use it on the tips of my hair, since that&#x27;s where I usually get a lot of split ends. Sometimes I&#x27;ll add extra drops in my hair and keep it on overnight or til the next time i shower.</li>
            <li> This is another InstaNatural product I like. I use this jojoba oil on my hair. It makes my hair silky,&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and healthy looking. Good amount doesn&#x27;t make your hair oily after shampooing. My hair doesn&#x27;t have split ends and doesn&#x27;t feel nor look dry. I&#x27;m happy with this product and would recommend it to others!!!</li>
            <li> I thought this product was great but my skin turning to a dark instead of light.</li>
            <li> I love using this oil for my hair. Keeps it very healthy and great looking</li>
            <li> Awesome it make my skin so soft</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my mom who has severe psoriasis.  Although, it doesn&#x27;t take the psoriasis away, it does alleviate the itchiness that she gets from it, especially, her scalp. It&#x27;s much better than all those chemically enhanced products in the market and and excellent alternative that won&#x27;t make her skin issues worse!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing, great quality and many uses!</li>
            <li> Great for making tattoos look fresh again.</li>
            <li> Nice texture and smell.  I use it on my face and it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.  Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I received this oil yesterday.  Very fast shipping!  I feel like it worked almost instantly.  I put some on my face and hair.  I have very dry skin and  my face felt smooth after one application. For my hair I followed the directions and left it in for 30 min.  I then washed it out.  I am so in love.  My hair is silky smooth.  I can run my fingers through them without a problem. This oil has so many uses I can&#x27;t wait to use it on my nails and face also.  It is very easy to apply.  It has a glass dropper which is very precise.  The serum itself is not sticky nor does it leave an oily residue.  Will be recommending to all my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> Large bottle of pure Jojoba oil. I have been using this product on my nails and face and have not noticed any adverse reactions. It goes on smooth and works its way into your skin without leaving a greasy feeling. It is too early to see a positive result, but the oil is easy to use and does not have a strong or unpleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> The bottle came safely packaged in its own plain cardboard box and the shipping was fast.The oil is a nice golden color, naturally odorless, and non-comedogenic. The bottle is amber colored glass and the dropper is also glass. There is also a sticker on the bottom of the bottle that tells you the &amp;#34;best if used by&amp;#34; date (mine says December 2017).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba oil is one of my favorite oils because it gets absorbed quickly by the skin and does not leave you feeling greasy.This oil is technically not an oil, but a wax ester which is the most similar natural compound to the oil produced by our skin (sebum). So in theory (This has not been proven as of yet), jojoba oil can trick the skin into producing less oil, thus balancing out oil production on the skin and scalp. Jojoba oil is also very stable, so it can be kept for a long time without it going rancid or losing its antioxidant properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The uses for this oil are almost endless! So far, I have used it for DIY anti acne masks, as a facial moisturizer after clay masks, hair oil treatment, aftershave, leave in conditioner, cuticle oil, and to treat dry skin on my heels with good results. This, along with argan oil, rose hip oil and coconut oil, are some of the oils I try to always keep handy for their versatility and usefulness! The bottle will also last a long time seeing as you only need a couple of drops for it to be effective (I have waist length thick,curly hair and only use 5 drops on it along with coconut oil.) Overall a good quality oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list as stated in the back of the bottle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% pure and certified organic cold-pressed Jojoba Oil (Simmondsia Chinensis)</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to use this oil on my dry natural hair. Use it directly on my hair &amp; mixed some in my shea butter mix!! I love this light weight oil</li>
            <li> I like it, I mixed it in with my coconut oil</li>
            <li> I really like this oil, I have been using it in my hair and on my nails, and it really has helped eliminate much of the dryness I was experiencing in my nail beds!  Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Really nice nightly routine addition.  I highlight my hair and it&#x27;s thin so my ends dry easily.  I&#x27;ve been putting a dime sized amount on the ends before bed, rolling it up into bun so the ends aren&#x27;t exposed and securing loosely.  This helps keep them from drying out!  Also used on my cuticles, hands and lips.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes well. It is a huge bottle with dropper.  Great value for the money.</li>
            <li> Natural is the only way to go. This is good product. The moisture is really great.</li>
            <li> I have gotten into a habit of using natural oils skin and scalp to moisturize and aid in growth. A friend suggested that I try Jojoba oil on my facesince I like coconut oil so much. Coconut oil works great but can leave me shine when I first put it on. the convenient dropper on this bottle of oil helps me to not apply too much and yet I don&#x27;t find myself to be super shiny. nor does my face feel under moisturized.</li>
            <li> This bottle is huge and will last a long time!  The oil is smooth, with a pleasant fragrance.  Good for skin, hair, nails, or if you like to make home made natural body products!</li>
            <li> My nails and cuticles are always on the rough side, so I was excited to try out this product to improve them - and I am so glad I did! I have already noticed a great difference in my cuticles and my nails seem to be gaining strength as well.</li>
            <li> This bottle is huge! Great price for a bottle this size. The dropper is equally as big. I thought the smell from the oil in the bottle would bother me. Surprisingly once I applied about three drops, there was no smell. I use it on my hands and cuticles. Absorbs well, not super fast but I use a generous amount before bed.</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks. It is a great all around moisturizer and you can really use it from the top of your head to your tippy toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite new use is to use it instead of shaving cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I received this to review because I can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil on my hair and I love it! I&#x27;ve always had dry hair.  This Jojoba oil leaves your hair feeling soft and non greasy . I apply most of it at the ends . A little goes a long way so always make sure you put your fingers through the bottom of your hair first then work your way up. i haven&#x27;t tried it on my face yet.</li>
            <li> Nice big bottle.  No scent that I can tell.  When I apply it to my arms, it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel, soaks right in.  Perfect for adding with essential oils.  Totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been putting this on my finger nails for 3 days now, and already I am noticing a difference. My nails are super peely and soft, and I work with my hands, often with soapy water and isopropyl. I spent all day picking off decals by hand, and really put my nails to the test today. Not a single broken nail and while I CAN see dents in the edges of my nails, none have peeled or broken. My nails haven&#x27;t hardened up, but maybe they will with continued use.</li>
            <li> The products seems to have many uses - scalp, hair, skin, cuticles, etc. Thus far, I have used it on my dry face after washing it and it moisturizes it nicely. I rub the product that is leftover on my hand and put it on my arms for moisture. Especially love that it&#x27;s a natural product and works so well. Only issue I had was removing the protective seal on the bottle, but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal at all!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice oil for hair, skin and nails.</li>
            <li> This is only the second brand of Jojoba oil I have tried but I love it just as much as the first. I use it on my face daily and love it.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Love this brand and love their customer service. 10 stars!!!</li>
            <li> My skin  and hair absolutely love this! Great for my excema .</li>
            <li> After having a baby, my hair went all kinds of crazy.  I used this on my super dry ends to replenish, rehydrate and smooth and it kept it tamed while I waited for a haircut. I also love that it has no smell.  It&#x27;s packaged in a nice sturdy glass bottle and is a generous amount.  I like that this oil can be used for all kinds of remedies!</li>
            <li> Excellent Moisturizer! :-)</li>
            <li> I love the Essential Oils and use them very regularly</li>
            <li> I mix this with aloe vera gel and use it as a body lotion. It has a nice smell and makes my skin feel soft. I like that it comes in a bottle with a dropper because it&#x27;s easy to drop the amount I need into the aloe bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 67 yrs. old &amp; it&#x27;s been incredible to use just a bit on my fingernails, cuticles &amp; hands. It&#x27;s reducing the vertical lines on my nails &amp; keeping cuticles and hands much softer. I also use it on my face &amp; body--a little bit goes a long way. It absorbs within a minute or two. My only caution is to put a paper towel, newspaper, or something similar under the bottle because it&#x27;s easy to spill a drop or more when moving the dropper from bottle to body. Just pull up a little in the dropper, as you don&#x27;t need very much at all. You can also apply a few drops to scalp or hair ends after washing your hair. I don&#x27;t wash it off my ends, but you might want to rinse from your scalp. I highly recommend this to anyone who has dry anything, anywhere on your body. Great price, too!</li>
            <li> Great oil for hair, skin, etc. Love this!</li>
            <li> great product. absorbs quickly. no odor</li>
            <li> Love!  Bottle is HUGE!  So many uses - no smell so great for anyone to use!  Quick absorption and hydrating!  Will def buy again!</li>
            <li> I am very excited to have this product.  I will be using it in my essential oil blends that I use daily.  Jojoba is very good for many things skin, hair, etc. Good quality and great size (4 oz). Update....I have sleep apnea and use a c pap machine nightly. After 8 yrs of wearing the face mask nightly my skin has developed a bit of skin issue where the mask sits on my face (bumps, redness etc).  I have been using the jojoba oil on this area regularly and it is allowing my skin to become more normal.  My skin pores have become a little clogged from the mask and the jojoba oil, being so much like our skins natural sebum is allowing the pores to clear and become unclogged.  This is a very good thing because I will  ALWAYS have to sleep with this machine.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast. I just loved this deal! Item was exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Perfect its just what i wanted. Its really moisturizing and a little goes a long way. I use it on my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> A great product. I use it for my hair a lot. It leaves my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> Wonderful! My hair, skin and nails look great!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the results of this amazing product!</li>
            <li> Love this product! A great oil!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, and a great natural alternative to lotion. I try to buy all natural products and refuse to use most lotions because of parabens and other chemicals added. This moisturizers better, and I know what the ingredients are! Great buy!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing, great quality and many uses...works wonders on hair...I also found a few other ways to use this item on Pinterest.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Product works well.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil to add to hair products and to use on skin. I add this jojoba oil to my hair moisturizer and to my facial lotion on days when my skin feels a bit dry. This makes my skin feel great!</li>
            <li> Great oil for hair and skin.</li>
            <li> My hair is roughly halfway down my back. Just 3 drops to my hair after it starts to dry after getting the shower has left me with silky smooth hair all day. Works great! I have also used it as aftershave. I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed.</li>
            <li> Love to use this on my face in the morning before applying make up, absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling</li>
            <li> Jojoba is a wonderful carrier oil, easily absorbs into skin and hair.  Use it as a base for your aromatherapy blends.  Mix it with coconut oil for a light massage oil.  It&#x27;s really very versatile and useful to have in your home beauty repertoire.  It has zero smell, which is always a plus - that means it will carry other essential oils&#x27; smells much better.  The dropper packaging is convenient for measuring out oil into blended products.</li>
            <li> I have Instanatural&#x27;s Facial Oil Cleanser, which I LOVE &amp; thought I would try the Jojoba oil. OMG, it is AMAZING! My favorite uses are: hands, chest (esp. in a.m. when waking to get rid of the boob crease), face, and tips of hair. Seriously, it&#x27;s amazing! Doesn&#x27;t have odor so don&#x27;t worry about reactions to fragrances. The seller is highly communicative-I&#x27;m always taken care of- prompt &amp; courteous!</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is one of my favorite moisurizers becasue it is long lasting and isn&#x27;t too greasy for me. This is no exception, I continue to be pleased with Insta Natural products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my nails and they are notably stronger! I love any product that instanatural makes!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my sister as a gift and she swears by it. She has thrown her other face moisturizers away.</li>
            <li> Nice for adding young living essential oils and using as a carrier oil</li>
            <li> Arrived on time as described. It&#x27;s a great carrier oil for essential oils it&#x27;s also a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product; I love it! I also received excellent tips from the seller, as well. I am very pleased! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I love this for my hair nails and skin. I also use this on my son&#x27;s eczema, great improvement!</li>
            <li> I love essential oils and jojoba is great.I use a lot InstaNatural products and i have loved all of them . Jojoba Oil is ideal for healthily hydrating skin and hair because it mimics the natural oils our bodies produce.Below are its uses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.CONDITIONING TREATMENT -Smooth a quarter-sized amount over wet hair, focusing on ends and you can also apply to damp hair to help smooth frizz.&lt;br /&gt;2.MAKEUP REMOVER-Add a few drops of jojoba oil to fingers or to a cotton ball and wipe over eyes and face. Rinse off with water and follow with regular cleanser&lt;br /&gt;3. MOISTURIZER&lt;br /&gt;Apply Jojoba Oil immediately after shower or bath, while skin is still damp. This helps seal in moisture, leaving skin soft and smooth without an oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;4.AFTERSHAVE -Apply to beard or desired area before and after shaving. Helps prevent razor burn and leaves skin smooth, soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;5.USE IN THE OIL DIFFUSER- few drops.&lt;br /&gt;6.BODY &amp; SCALP MASSAGE-A perfect oil for sensitive skin. Massage into body at home or at the spa for moisture and relaxation. Massage into scalp to help relieve dryness.&lt;br /&gt;and many other i am not aware of.But i am impressed with this oil and glad to  received this in exchange of my honest unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. My face always gets dry especially after I shave. I&#x27;ve used all kinds of creams and lotions but my skin gets dry again shortly after. Just a few drop of this rubbed into my face and the dry skin is eliminated. I also use it on my feet or wherever I feel I need it. Works great in hair too. A little bit of this stuff goes a long way. Use just a few drops.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on and off for a couple of weeks and it seems to be doing a good job. Mostly I use it on my hands because they are extremely dry. I have applied to feet and legs as well. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> This oil is great for my hair. I have natural curly hair and it is really frizzy but this oil helps to tame it down. I simply massage it into the scalp and pull through my hair. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my lotion. It hydrates and locks in the moisture that can so easily be lost in the dry Colorado climate. I also live that it&#x27;s natural. I feel much better about applying this to my skin than I do lotion.</li>
            <li> my friends told me about this jojoba oil. they said its good for skin and hair. so I tried it as soon as I received it. and wow u can really feel the difference. looking forward for more changes in my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I love that its organic</li>
            <li> Really like the texture and the moist I get from it. I am not crazy about the smell. Great to put some in your conditioner.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and the quality is great. Other Jojoba oils made me breakout , this one hasnt yet! It makes my face and heels so soft. I also mix this with Rosehip oil and whip it up with my Shea butter as a night cream. I will definitely reorder and try their other products. I do use their eye gel and love it. Instanatural hasnt disappointed me yet.</li>
            <li> Love it so much!! Its organic and the texture is so good! Didn&#x27;t have any allergic reaction on me. Will buy it again!!</li>
            <li> Jojoba is a light weight much-purpose moisturizing oil. 120ml cold pressed pure Jojoba oil makes my day!</li>
            <li> This product is great straight out of the bottle and in my homemade personal products.  I love it!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;one man&#x27;s trash is another man&#x27;s come up&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this from my friend who paid for it and didn&#x27;t like it. However, this oil is working for me. I have been using it for a little bit more than a week on my face, hair and all over my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil has a thin, runny texture. It has a light golden color and I can&#x27;t notice any smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start off with my face. I have combination skin with oily t zone but I do see some dry skin flaking on my forehead and the side of my nose. My t zone is so oily and it shocked me when I see the dry flaky skin on forehead. So I added this oil into the moisturizer. It does improve the skin texture and the dry flaky skin is gone. BUT!!! my nose is still oily, not as oily as before but I was hoping it would do some magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did a nice job to my hair. After I wash my hair and towel dry, I put couple drops of oil on my hand and rub it into my hair and then blow dry. My hair is so soft and shiny. It didn&#x27;t weight down my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it on my arms and leg and it made my leg so soft; I can&#x27;t tell any different of my arm so I will save it and will be using the oil for my face and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin absorbs the so well if I exfoliate my skin before I use it. Otherwise it does take a while for my skin to absorb it. Overall, I like it. It&#x27;s a good oil for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of jojoba oil especially during winter when my skin gets dry. It works during summer as well even when the skin gets oil as thi soil is skin balancing oil and is great for any skin type. Love it!</li>
            <li> I wouldnt recommend putting it in your hair unless you want it to look oily... but a GREAT moisturizer!</li>
            <li> great applicator, nice product</li>
            <li> Great product! Perfect for skin care! I use it in almost all my DIY skin care products. Can&#x27;t get enough!</li>
            <li> Love this oil leaves my skin so soft!!!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse, curly hair. I have tried every product under the sun to keep the frizz at bay. I really like this jojoba oil. I have used Argan oil for months; I switched to give the jojoba oil a try. It works just as well, if not better. When I first get out of the shower I put a dropper full  around my head, close the scalp, and around the ends. I comb it through and style as usual. It definitely keeps my curls more defined and keeps the frizz away. I was given the opportunity to test and try this product in my home. Would I recommend it? Absolutely. Great for curls.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!!! I went to get Botox but was using this 3 times a week for two weeks. Doctor said I had no lines! I love will buy more when I&#x27;m out for sure</li>
            <li> First off the packaging on this product is great because the bottle is thick. I also like that it has a dropper. The product is definitely not the greatest smelling but I find that when you use pure beauty oils they usually don&#x27;t. I used the oil on my hair for 30 minutes as a deep conditioner and it seemed  to calm the frizz down. I have chemically treated hair and was having a lot of issues with taming it. The instructions say to shampoo your hair and then use the oil but instead I used the oil and then shampooed because I am not too fond of the smell. Overall, I would say it helped make my hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Great oil, great consistency. I really enjoy the benefits of using this oil on my hair and skin. Great moisturizer. The only down side is that shortly after purchasing it the bottle got broken.  :(</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. Just be careful not to put too much in your hair because this stuff is powerful. You really do just need a few drops. I thought since my hair is long and thick that I needed about a quarter-size...no. Just use a few drops like it says and your hair will look nice and tame. It makes my nails/cuticles soft, and I even use it on my feet on the nasty rough patches before I go to bed, and it feels much better when I wake up.</li>
            <li> Love jojoba oil and this is no exception!</li>
            <li> I have VERY long and course hair.  I usually use another high dollar product while my hair is wet to make it smooth.  For the past week, I have been using the Jojoba Oil in my hair right after getting out of the shower.  My hair dries so smooth and soft.  I can tell it is making my hair stronger and healthier.  I highly recommend this product and I will be buying it again!</li>
            <li> love it for my nails!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE all purpose oils like this!! You can literally use this oil for soooo many things!!! It&#x27;s a great conditioner for your hair, it gives it a nice shiny, glow!! It&#x27;s great for any dry skin! Right now my legs are still dry from the winter, so it acts as a great lotion/moisturizer for my legs! It&#x27;s great for my husbands rough hands as well! And it smells really nice! But it doesn&#x27;t give you a greasy feeling at all which is soooo important for me!!</li>
            <li> I use it for my daughters&#x27; hair and it works great!</li>
            <li> I love multipurpose products and this is no exception!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a small amount on my feet before I go to bed and it transforms my feet to soft and smooth overnight. I have used this for cuticle oil, and on rough elbows.  It absorbs quickly and smells nice. My next experiment with it is to use it in my hair.</li>
            <li> jojoba oil is one of my favorite moisturizers, and this is no exception. Works great and very handy dropper.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural Jojoba Oil is a multipurpose oil for so many different things. I have used it in my hair, on my nails, and on my skin. It makes my hair look and feel healthy. It makes my skin feel so soft and hydrated. It helps moisturize my cracked cuticles. This jojoba oil is lightweight, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling behind. I tried this oil on my face as a moisturizer. It was okay but I have sensitive skin that is acne prone and I did develop some breakouts due to it. My favorite use for this oil is on my legs though. After shaving my legs are always SO dry and feel like alligator skin. I put a few drops of this in my lotion or even by itself and it brings my legs back to life. They look and feel so much healthier thanks to this oil. They are no longer itchy and don&#x27;t have irritation. This oil is definitely a keeper for me! *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
            <li> Very high quality jojoba oil.  I have been using this on my son&#x27;s scars and it has helped them heal quicker with much less sensitivity.  I have also used this on my skin and hair with great results.  Great price for the quantity also!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for about a month now on my nails. They are so brittle and thin that I figured trying this can&#x27;t hurt. The nail beds seem to be thicker now. My cuticles aren&#x27;t dry and pulling away, and I almost have zero hang nails. I really love the moisturizing properties of this jojoba oil. I was considering adding some essential oil to it to help calm my stress levels but have not done so as of yet. But, this is a good moisturizer and I hope it helps my nails totally grow in stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> large bottle with a dropper. I use it for everything since Jojoba is very close to the natural moisture skin has. I use this for stronger nails, shiny hair, dry hands and face. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face, hair, and feet makes everything so soft</li>
            <li> Love this it&#x27;s great for everything and the bottle is huge much more than I expected!!!</li>
            <li> This is a versitile  product. I use it on my skin, hair, and nails.</li>
            <li> re: Vitamin C Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;100% Pure Certified Organic Jojoba oil&lt;br /&gt;10% Glycolic Acid Cream&lt;br /&gt;Skin Brightening Scrub&lt;br /&gt;Skin Bfightneing Serum&lt;br /&gt;Skin Brightening Lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great line of products. I created my own routine with them and it&#x27;s working out great. Look forward to sampling other items. I used the Vitamin C Cleanser twice a day; morning and night. It left my face really light and moisteurized. The lather is quite leathery so it does not drip so I also used it as a five minute mask. I added some 100% Pure Certified Organic Jojoba oil when using it as a mask for a deep cleanse/conditioning. The jojoba oil has a trace of scent; some companies remove the scent completely, but it&#x27;s good it smells some, that way I know what jojoba smells like, or kind of, since I&#x27;ve never seen jojobas up close. Also, it worked really well as a hot oil treatment to prepare the skin for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit concerned about the orange color of the 10% Glycolic Acid Cream, until I read the &amp;#34;tips and directions&amp;#34; email, which stated that&#x27;s the color it&#x27;s supposed to be. my concern was I didn&#x27;t wanna look like I got a fake tan. Then I read the part about the sun exposure, at which point I decided to rinse it out after ten minutes. Its absorbed quickly and the orange does go away. This cream is great because it&#x27;s not too heavy when applied, and even after rinsing it out my skin felt moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Anytime I see &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; on a product I think of the crazy celebrities that bleach their skin to truly ugly and quickly noticeable results, that act like they look great and nothing&#x27;s wrong. So I approached the &amp;#34;Skin Brightening&amp;#34; line: Scrub, Serum, and Lotion with care and made sure to read the instructions and suggestions prior to use. The Skin Brightening Scrub I used twice a week, and the Skin Brightening Serum and the Skin Britghtening Lotion every other day, twice a day. because I have recurring acne I found the scrub a bit strong, though it does have a pleasant citrus scent, as does the serum. The lotion also has a trace of citrus scent. In combination, I found the line to help recede the acne noticeably after each use. As I never used a serum before I wonder if the filmsy texture after it dries is a natural occurance of using a serum? Or did I use too much? a little goes a long way on the lotion: the first few times I used way too much, now I use it one pump at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Since I got each of these products for review at a $1 each, I&#x27;d imagine that paying the full retail value would run quite steep, also considering I am used to pharmacy brand and Neutrogena products. For the time I&#x27;ve been using them, I did find these to work really well for me. it could be that my face had hit a &amp;#34;product plateau&amp;#34; and using new ones gave it a little something extra? Overall keep up the good work on these products, it&#x27;s a definite recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I purchased it to use with dry skin. It&#x27;s wonderful. I would recommend it to others with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Multi purpose moisturizer that&#x27;s certified organic. I love that it has so many uses. Great for hair, skin, face, nails. It is quickly absorbed  and it is an effective moisturizer.  I live that it is free from fragrances and chemical free. It&#x27;s a nice sized bottle to that should last awhile.</li>
            <li> Love love love in my  frizzy hair...on my face...not greasy at all!</li>
            <li> I have always like jojoba oil and this is a asset to the oil , liking it</li>
            <li> I normally use Argan Oil on my skin, but decided to use JoJoBa Oil and I love both!  I love using this in my hair, face and nails.  I have acne prone skin and this oil does not make me breakout!  I also love this particular brand.  High quality products for sure.  I also used this recently on my scalp.  My scalp was dry and itchy and even flaking from what I believe is our hard water problem.  This oil helped reduce this problem tremendously.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. Absorbs really well. Hopefully it will help my skin stay hydrated.!!</li>
            <li> Awesome oil. Can&#x27;t wait to keep using it!!</li>
            <li> InstaNatural is a great company with an excellent product line of natural products.  I&#x27;m so tired of drug store brands of products with god knows what in them.  I trust InstaNatural with my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I love using this before I go to bed after I shave my legs.  It is a light enough oil that it doesn&#x27;t soak through my pjs or stain them.  It really moisturizes my skin and prevents razor burn.  I also like slathering it on my dry and gross feet because it is the only thing that softens the skin enough so I can buff them.  I would highly recommend this product for quality.</li>
            <li> I love this Jojoba oil! It;s done wonders for my hair</li>
            <li> this oil is light and I love the way it soothes my skin. If it is humid I can run a little through my hair and tame the frizzies I get. The bottle is big and will last a really long time. Very good value for the price!</li>
            <li> I just received this product in the mail.  I have tried other jojoba in the past but this is far better.  In the past I had to put in the sun light or scoop out what I needed and heat in microwave to turn into oil.  I just thought that is how this comes.&lt;br /&gt;I love how this is done for you.  This is a miracle lotion for my skin.  Nothing is better in my book.  I love to have skin that is radiant and full of moisture that literally feels has soft as it looks.&lt;br /&gt;I love the big bottle this comes in along with a dropper so that there is no contamination !!  First thing I did when I received this was jump in the shower, did my skin brushing and then applied to my skin.  I love this product and grateful that Amazon recommend this to me.  I will be a customer forever and next time I reorder I will be getting two bottles.  I never want to be without this Jojoba Oil.  Fantastic.</li>
            <li> I use in my hair and on my body. So light and feels gret. Smells light I can still wear my favorite perfume. I mix with lemon oil sometimes for a different experience. I did receive for review.</li>
            <li> I love that this is organic. I use it to seal my hair after moisturizing. The moisturizing lasts all day. Very good oil.</li>
            <li> this product is the best</li>
            <li> Only been using this for a few days now but it has my skin feeling more refreshed than it has in a long time. Only takes a little and no strong smells</li>
            <li> I am going thru a &amp;#34; natural product &amp;#34; phrase.  Using more and  more  natural products. I love this is Organic. I mix this with the bug repellant essential oil , and  it  really work  great- Skin is so soft after , and bug be gone. Will never  g o back to  deet  spray... Only  taken off one star  because  this is a  little more  pricy than my other brand,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a chance to try  thiswit h discount. But my opinion is  all  mine- Honest and unbiased.</li>
            <li> good product , use it for my scalp</li>
            <li> I love this. My son is extremely allergic--to well everything really, but he still has very dry skin that tends to look very grey and not so nice in all seasons (even summer) . Lotions never work, because most have additives that don&#x27;t agree with his allergies, or they simply don&#x27;t prevent drying well enough. This oil was a HUGE success! Since it is all natural, there is no more itching and the oil is thick enough that he was sufficiently moisturized head to toe (even under a layer of sunscreen, ocean and beach sand).</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with jojoba oil and I must say that I am pleased.  There are several ways you can use the oil but I purchased it primarily for my nails.  The oil is light weight and absorbs quickly.  This winter I will also be using it as a moisturizer.  I don&#x27;t believe that it would work in my hair but would consider using it on my face.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil has been on my list of natural items to buy for quite some time now. This is the second product I&#x27;ve purchased from InstaNatural, and am just as pleased with this, as I am with their Aloe Vera Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many ways you can use jojoba oil.  You can use it as a carrier oil, for making soaps, lotions, shampoos, facial creams, or just by itself. I have been using it on my hands and arms, and even a skin tag.  It has made the skin tag darken, so I am going to keep using it on it, and hope it shrinks or falls off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has no noticeable scent after it&#x27;s absorbed, but if I put my nose to the opened bottle, I can detect the slightest bit of a smokiness. I think that is just how jojoba smells, but it is so very very light, I am sure most people would never even notice it. I did use it on a pimple, and it helped it go away very quickly. I haven&#x27;t had one in such a long time, that I was very surprised to even see it. I think my hormones are changing as I am in perimenopause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an oil, so it is oily, but it does absorb quickly on my skin, and does not leave residue where my skin touches things.  For instance, the metal area on my laptop next to the integrated mouse pad.  Other oils I&#x27;ve used, such as another brand of fractionated coconut oil that is not supposed to be greasy, leaves a large oil mark on my laptop where I rest my arms, even after 30 minutes of it having been &amp;#34;absorbed&amp;#34;. This does not. It might just be my skin type needs this one over the other, I don&#x27;t know, but this works for me much better. I love that for me, it does not leave a residue or feel like I&#x27;ve put something on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not hesitate to purchase this again, and will most certainly purchase the aloe vera again from this same company. I really have enjoyed using both products I&#x27;ve purchased from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;* USDA Organic certification (This means at least 95% of ingredients are organic)&lt;br /&gt;* Made in USA&lt;br /&gt;*Multiple uses&lt;br /&gt;*Absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;*Just one ingredient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Honestly haven&#x27;t found one yet.

            <li> Great product and fast shipping. Reordering soon!</li>
            <li> I love it on my face after washing and it replenishes the moisture on my face. Being a senior that is important for less wrinkles, but it also leaves your skin silky smooth. It soaks in quickly so buy and enjoy all the benefits. If you have read any of the reviews you know by now they are plentiful.</li>
            <li> Love this oil, I use it in my hair and it makes it soft and manageable</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it for everything and so does my family. I put a little in my hair too. I love it</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely and absorbs quickly. Good as a carrier oil or just as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes my skin feel amazong!</li>
            <li> I tried this on my hair so far and it is great!  After shampooing I put 5 drops in my hands and rubbed the Jojoba oil into my scalp, easy as that. I could tell the difference already when brushing through my hair after the shower. My hair tends to get more dry at the bottom and I don&#x27;t feel that after the oil. Will definitely keep in the shower and use regularly.</li>
            <li> Really like this oil. You can use it for multiple things. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> i love natural oils! this stuff is great!</li>
            <li> Love this oil! I use it on my very dry hair every day after showering. It is really helping with the look of my hair. No more dry fly-away ends and much less frizz. I also use it on my legs after shaving, so soft and smooth, no more dry itchy shins. Absorbs quickly and leaves  no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product for use as a moisturizing oil. Apply directly to skin, hair or nails for an intense spa-like heavy moisturizing session. It can also be mixed with other oils or used in a diffuser. Well packaged in a seemingly leak-proof bottle. Very easy to use. Would make a good carrier oil too.</li>
            <li> I love this Jojoba Oil!! Huge fan!!!!</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase again. The oil is great as a facial moisturizer. The amber bottle and glass dropper are high quality.</li>
            <li> I started to notice that my hair was course and dry feeling during and after using conditioner. I add a couple drop off jojoba oil to the conditioner in my hand and I no longer have that problem. It seems to work really well and I have absolutely no issue rinsing it out. I have also tried this with castor oil which was too thick and wouldn&#x27;t rinse out.</li>
            <li> This was bigger than the other oils i have ordered. I love to use it for multiple things. Hair, body, face. It does a great job at the oil cleansing method. Also, I had a pretty bad sunburn and I mixed this with black tea and applied to the burnt areas and it almost instantly took away the itchiness/pain. Within 2 days the burn was completely gone. This is a great addition to any oils or moisturizers. Will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> The last few months i started to use different oils to improve my skin and hair.I ordered the Jojoba Oil from Instanatural&#x27;s website and i was excited to try it out after i read the reviews here on amazon. I use it for my hair as a leave in conditioner with the Argan oil(i mix Argan,Jojoba,Coconut and Black Jamaican Castor Oil).I noticed a huge difference.But my review is not about my hair. I stopped going to a nail salon for my pedicure and manicure after i noticed that every time i would go(even different ones)i would get nail fungus.I know that it takes many months to treat your nail.For a dermatologist appointment i have to wait 4 months.I tryed many brands from the store and nothing was working for me.The only product that was better was Focalex,a product that i could buy it from Germany,a hassle to get it.And my toe nail was better,not completely healed. One day i mixed jojoba oil,coconut oil,few drops of tea tree oil and levander oil,to use it for my skin and my back acne.I didn&#x27;t liked the smell at all,i wanted to use all of the mixed oils so i applied what was left on my toe nails.Next day i noticed the nail fungus was gone.Completelly gone!!I couldn&#x27;t believe it.I am really curious if any of the reviewers have tryed the Jojoba oil for their nail fungus.If yes please reply. I am thinking to use the same for my husband.He is wearing boots in the summer because of his work,and he is very sensitive to oils,he might be allergic to one,so i will wait to consult his doctor.</li>
            <li> I am using more natural oils on my hair and skin so I was happy to find a coupon for this one. I have added it to my conditioner for my hair and it enhanced it leaving my hair soft and manageable. I am eager to use it for other benefits as well. Jojoba oil is one of those must haves in terms of skin and scalp care.</li>
            <li> Jojoba Oil is marvelous and this one is some of the best I&#x27;ve had. I won&#x27;t hesitate to return and buy it again.</li>
            <li> NICE moisturizer!  I love Jojoba oil!</li>
            <li> It there were 100 stars for a review I would give this jojoba oil that many. I am a big fan of this oil. There are so many uses for it that I could write a book. But I will not, I will just tell you the main ways I use it. For my hair full strength ,as a carrier oil when I use my essential oils , and as a body oil. Jojoba oil is considered the closes oil to natural skin oil and is very good for you. A little goes a long way.consider trying this.&lt;br /&gt;This is my honest opinion and review</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product. It will last you forever. It has a great smell and left my hair feeling silky. Reduced the amount of frizz and looked great after flat ironing it.</li>
            <li> This jojoba oil is amazing. I LOVE the fact that they didn&#x27;t add any extra fragrance to it! It has helped my dry hair immensely and I&#x27;ve also been putting it on my legs. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> This is honestly the best oil for my face. I use this daily to help with my dry skin and it works great. My skin looks youthful without looking oily.</li>
            <li> Joboba Oil has a lot of different uses.&lt;br /&gt;1. skin softener&lt;br /&gt;2. facial cleanser and moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;3. bod moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;4. lip conditioner&lt;br /&gt;5. nail and cuticle treatment&lt;br /&gt;6. make-up remover&lt;br /&gt;7. shaving prep and after-shave&lt;br /&gt;8. carrier oil&lt;br /&gt;and much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this bottle of jojoba oil by InstaNatural because it&#x27;s 100% pure, cold pressed and unrefined. It&#x27;s light-weight and non-greasy. It works great as a moisturizer and an everyday cleanser. Just a few drops is all that is need. This is a pretty nice size bottle. It will last me a while. I purchased this bottle at a promotional value to product test. InstaNatural is a great brand. I&#x27;ve been using a lot of their products on an everyday basis and I&#x27;m absolutely happy with their products.</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my skin and nails and I also use it to cut other oils. Very good quality oil. No odor and top grade product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Great Product. I use this with my essential oils as a carrier oil!</li>
            <li> High quality oil with a convenient dropper for mixing small amounts.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is a more than one use. I have been pitting it on on my skin, cuticles, face, after I dermaroller my skin and it feels baby fine. I have nothing bad to say about this great product. I suggest you give it a try. It&#x27;s awesome! I did get this as a discount to give my honest opinion to you. I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have never seen anything like this product!! First off, I LOVE the fact that there is absolutely NO SCENT!! Also, I have a few places on my body that are prone to serious dry, flaky skin and after using this for a week, I no longer have that problem. I also have acne and I&#x27;ll admit that I was VERY wary of putting oil on my face but this seemed to just absorb into my skin and didn&#x27;t leave an oily residue on my face. My makeup even seemed to apply more evenly after using it. This will always be a staple in my beauty routine!!! I can&#x27;t believe that it took me so long to discover Jojoba Oil!</li>
            <li> I love this oil- so pure and clean.  I works fantastic as a carrier oil to mix with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> So before using this, I had very dry skin due to drinking a lot of coffee. After about a week of using it, I have noticed a huge difference! I love that it is not oily since I have oily skin. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love it. I got a high discount code for this product. I use this on my face and hair. it makes my face more smooth. My hair is smooth too.</li>
            <li> Just used it last night. Like the fact that it is certified organic, list ingredients, good directions and uses. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I use this lovely oil for everything:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Removing makeup (even tough eye makeup)&lt;br /&gt;- Facial cleansing&lt;br /&gt;- Carrier oil for essential oils&lt;br /&gt;- Massaging into cuticles&lt;br /&gt;- Soothing treatment for itchy, flaky scalp (Massage about a teaspoon into scalp,&lt;br /&gt;  distribute through hair, leave as long as overnight, shampoo out. Itch &amp; flakes GONE!)&lt;br /&gt;- Add a few drops to favorite body lotion&lt;br /&gt;- Massage a drop onto scrapes, cuts, etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since a little goes SUCH a long way, this 4 oz bottle will last quite a while, even using it for everything under the sun.</li>
            <li> Use this as my everyday routine, for my hair, skin and cuticles.  Best part it is organic and I see improvements in my hair and skin tones.</li>
            <li> I mix this oil with Shea butter and it is perfect for my hair and skin. By far, the best oil I have used!</li>
            <li> This is great for moisturizing. I bought it primarily for my face but I&#x27;m using on my hair to prevent split ends and even for a carrier oil for my essential oils. I was pleasantly surprised by how well it works.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. I love that this one is organic and comes in a dark glass bottle, to protect it from getting rancid. Jojoba oil is great for so many things, I&#x27;ve used it for removing make up, shaving, and for moisturizing dry skin. This is a high quality product that I would defiantly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very nice oil to use along with/trade out with my Argon oil.  I like to wash my face with oil pretty often and this is a very nice consistency and so helpful for my dry skin.  I&#x27;m very happy with it and i received it quickly and in perfect condition.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this oil! I use it at night on my hands, elbows and nails. It has no odor, non greasy and leaves my skin hydrated and healthy. Best of all, it&#x27;s organic! I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I have dry skin all around and after using which by the way a few drops goes a long way. Does not leave greasy film on skin.I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I read so much great reviews about this oil and I must agree with the reviewers. I use it for everything. Face, lips, hair, etc. Its so good. I&#x27;m definitely getting another bottle soon.</li>
            <li> This oil is great for getting tangles out of hair. I was surprised at the size of the bottle - I was not expecting such a large amount for the money, so that was a bonus! Pleasant scent and easy to use dropper/applicator keeps it mess free.</li>
            <li> Great product, would buy again!</li>
            <li> InstaNatural&#x27;s Jojoba Oil was just what I needed for my dry, cracked, brittle toenails. I spend a lot of time in high heels, which have been shown to be the worst shoes for circulation to Toes/toenails. Within a week or so of using This Jojoba Oil, my toenails started to repair, heal and strengthen. Jojoba Oil isvalso good for hair and as a moisturizer for your skin but my primary focus for it was my nails. I cannot wear polish on my toes for the first time in years!</li>
            <li> Just love it. Makes my hair soft. I use it as a leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> Great oil love that i was able to get it for cheaper it just sweetened the deal for me. I have used it in many ways already.</li>
            <li> Feels nice in the skin. A little dab goes a long way. Haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair but that will be next.</li>
            <li> This oil is great for many purposes, and I really appreciate the fact that like all Instanatural products, the ingreidents are all natural. I have used this oil as a moisturizer after showering, for removing makeup, and for keeping the ends of my hair soft and silky looking. It works great as a moisturizer for lips as well. I usually put a little extra on my knees and elbows, which I have noticed have been less dry since I started using this. The best part is you only need a few drops. It is very moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
            <li> it feel great on my skin. No greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Awesome, works really well! Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> High quality oil. I Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> In love with the way this oil makes my skin feels! I recently got a chance to review a few different brands of jojoba oil and this is definitely one of my favorites. This came in a nice size bottle and even comes with it&#x27;s own glass dropper. I&#x27;ve noticed no smell with this one which is nice so that I don&#x27;t mix too many scents while I get ready. I&#x27;ve been using this to moisturize my skin and it feels great. I love this so much more than using lotion as this absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy. I have permanently made the switch from lotion to oil after trying this and a couple other types of oils like argan and rosehip oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I tried it ony hair really didn&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was how large this bottle is!  I am very impressed.  InstaNaural sends out &amp;#34;tips&amp;#34; on how to use the product - I haven&#x27;t been able to try everything listed for the Jojoba oil, yet!  This stuff is amazing.  I specifically love putting this on when I get out of the shower, still moist, the dropper is wonderful, and this oil soaks in and doesn&#x27;t leave me oily. I tried it on dry, non-moist skin and it did take quite a bit of rubbing in before it wasn&#x27;t oily - definitely recommend using when skin is moist.  I&#x27;ve used it on my face as a moisturizer (little bit goes a long way - this will last a very long time) and had no problems - in fact my skin looked great and I only wore mascara.  I&#x27;m excited to use it to deep condition my hair, and the myriad of other uses!</li>
            <li> Live this product. It&#x27;s a thicker oil but absorbs into the skin in a few minutes then simply apply makeup over it.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Instantly smooths and softens my skin. I have such dry skin and this has really helped a lot.</li>
            <li> Works awesome with my d≈çTERRA oils</li>
            <li> Very good for the price, really liked it, got this product on a discount.</li>
            <li> Use it all over my hole body including my hair. Very light weight.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Got it at a great discount will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Great carrier oil. Love this for my skin and nails mixed with essential oils.</li>
            <li> Product as described. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> This bottle of Jojoba oil is my new favorite product!  I use this on my hairto combat flyaways and dryness. I also massage it into my cuticles and nails.  It makes my nails and hands so soft!  I also apply this to my clean face at night to keep my skin moisturized and looking wonderful. The main thing I have used it for is as a carrier oil for all my essential oils.  It works wonderfully for that purpose~!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is 100% pure and certified organic.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hands and feet moisturized. Directions says to use 3 drops which is enough for my hands but need more for my feet. Bottle size was bigger than what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Great size product with many uses!</li>
            <li> I purchased this with a discount code for review.  The InstaNatural Jojoba oil is very replenishing to my hair. It helps moisturize and soften my hair and my skin. I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Use it for my hair cause it&#x27;s too fuzzy and dry. I can see the different after a few uses.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Jojoba Oil, and InstaNatural puts out a good version of it. Jojoba oil is one of my staples for carrier oil when using essential oils so it&#x27;s important to me to find one that is cost effective. However, my Jojoba must be Organic and the Ingredients list must only say &amp;#34;Jojoba Oil&amp;#34; and this oil passed the test. I also like that the label gives directions on how to use it for skin, hair, and nails. I really love Jojoba as a moisturizer and will never buy moisturizer with a bunch of chemicals in it again!</li>
            <li> This jojoba oil really moisturizers my skin and gives it a healthy glow. I like to put in on my face, neck, and entire body before I go to sleep. I wake up refreshed! It&#x27;s also great to mix with your lotions- and it has absolutely no smell.</li>
            <li> I love it. I put a little on the ends of my hair and the frizz is instantly gone!</li>
            <li> Love it! I previously bought some less expensive brand, and will never do that again! This is the real deal, clean &amp; pure to the touch &amp; smell.</li>
            <li> I love this.  It is good quality.</li>
            <li> Love this oit, also makes a great carrier oil to mix with other essential oils. Great on the skin, light and easy absorbed.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it as a deep conditioner once or twice a week and almost daily I use a small amount as to help with my frizzy hair on humid days. It works wonders!</li>
            <li> Non greasy and feels great on my face and skin.</li>
            <li> The oil came just in time for my hair wash,I used the jojoba as a scalp treatment and to mix with my other DIY Hair recipes,a pleasant smell left my hair very soft and manageable,I am in love with this brand.I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED FEEDBACK.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Best jojoba oil I&#x27;ve used.  First, the glass dispenser is great, so you can easily control how many drops you need compared to other brands, which typically use plastic holders with pour spouts.  I also find this particular jojoba oil lighter in consistency, so it absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave an oil slick on your face (or body, or wherever else you see fit).  GREAT!!</li>
            <li> Used it on my dry skin and it worked well. Haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair yet but if it works as well there as it did on my skin, it&#x27;ll be perfect!</li>
            <li> I really like this Jojoba oil, feels great on my skin and goes on so smoothly, usually these serums break me out but this one doesn&#x27;t, my skin looks better too!</li>
            <li> high quality product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i use this on my elbows, knees and feet. they make my skin so soft and smooth! also great to use on the neck. i dont use it on my face because I have oily skin. It protects the skin from drying. I also use it as a leave-in for the ends of my dried out hair. works so well. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;TIPS from the company:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;‚Ä¢Moisturizer - Jojoba Oil is a terrific, fast-absorbing moisturizer for the skin. After cleansing your face, massage a few drops of Jojoba Oil on your face and neck every morning and night. It protects the skin from drying and makes it radiant for a more youthful appearance. Works great for all skin types.&lt;br /&gt; ‚Ä¢Leave-in Conditioner - Massage a few drops of Jojoba Oil in your wet hair and scalp after showering to hydrate your hair and strengthen the follicles. This is especially useful for people who have dry or damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt; ‚Ä¢Scalp Treatment - If you happen to have a dry and flaky scalp, Jojoba Oil can penetrate deep into the skin to provide incredible hydration and nourishment to achieve great looking results. Massage a generous amount on your scalp for 15 minutes and leave in for at least 30 minutes, or as needed. Then, wash off and follow-up with a mild shampoo. Do this twice a week to get healthy, non-itchy scalp. This treatment is beneficial for both hair and scalp at the same time.&lt;br /&gt; ‚Ä¢Nail Care - Weak and brittle nails can be strengthened with Jojoba Oil. Massage a few drops of Jojoba Oil on your nails to fortify them, as well as to prevent peeling or cracking. Jojoba Oil also works great as a cuticle softener. Massage the cuticle along with nails to make them nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt; ‚Ä¢Shave Preparation &amp; Aftershave - Applying a liberal amount of Jojoba Oil to areas of skin that undergo razor shaving can help soften and moisturize the skin, as well as prevent razor bumps and irritation from occurring.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback</li>
            <li> Love this oil! I use it on my cuticles before bed. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have put it mixed jojoba oil to hair lotions. Jojoba oil makes my hair gently.</li>
            <li> I find the oil very useful.  I use it on both my hair and skin.  I have noticed my hair extra shiny since I started using it and my skin stays hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil has so man benefits. I am still testing this product.&lt;br /&gt;Benefits:&lt;br /&gt;Face moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider using jojoba as your daily or overnight facial moisturizer. The oil may initially leave a slight sheen, but just blot away residual oil to reduce excess moisture. Use 4-6 drops on your skin for a daytime moisturizer, increase the amount for an overnight hydrating skin mask, or try it out as a lip balm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replenish moisture and improve the texture of your hair with jojoba. The oil is great for dry scalps and will get rid of dandruff. Use it to add shine and naturally soften your hair, or in place of an anti-frizz product to manage unruly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facial cleanser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similar to coconut oil, you can use jojoba as your daily face wash. Apply a few drops onto dry skin, let it set, and then simply rinse your face with water. This process will clear away all the impurities that the oil extracts from the surface of your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scar and stretch mark minimizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unsightly skin issues including scabs, scars, and stretch marks may be reduced by massaging the vitamin-E rich oil into the problem areas.

            <li> This oil has dramatically helped manage my son&#x27;s scalp eczema issue. I like that the oil is packaged with a dropper so that we can apply the oil directly to the scalp and it&#x27;s not messy. The seller delivered the oil on time and followed up to ensure that I was satisfied with my purchase. I am truly pleased with the product and service I received. I will definitely continue to buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> Jojoba Oil - 100% Pure &amp; Certified Organic is very  light, and a little goes a long way.  I use a little on hands,feet,scalp, elbows and knees.  Makes skin very soft and scalp&amp; hair not dry at all. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I added this to my conditioner and it makes my hair soft and not too oily.&lt;br /&gt;I probably wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for this when you can something of comparable quality for less.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.. my complexion is wonderfully smooth..Great Product.. I use once in the AM only. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this jojoba oil make my skin so soft. This oil is 100%pure oil so i can even put on my baby&#x27;s skin and hair. Really happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> One of my favorite oils. I use for bath and body care. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product to use in place of fractionated coconut oil for diluting essential oils. Truthfully, I liked the idea of the dropper because the coconut oil was extremely messy to use. This is a much thicker and less messy alternative.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have VERY sensitive skin that will break out if the product is not very natural and clean.  That being said, I have literally never had clearer, more radiant skin than since I started using this oil as my face moisturizer.  I have tried oils that were organic from competitors but none have been so successful for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no offensive smell to this product and it is the right consistency.  Some people have mentioned it to be too thick for their faces, however I have found that if you gently press the product into your skin and give yourself a couple minutes it completely absorbs and your skin is happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to try other IstaNatural oils to see how they are as well.  I think I may also try their serums, could be my new go to for natural, clean beauty products.</li>
            <li> Great product. I recommend for people who hate having dry skin, knees, ankles, or elbows. I also use it on my cuticles and nails.</li>
            <li> I needed this for my EOS</li>
