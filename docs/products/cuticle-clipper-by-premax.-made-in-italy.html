            <li>Like many of you I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for a replacement for my Lacrosse slanted edge cuticle clippers.  </li>
            <li>I love this style clipper.</li>
            <li>but they are okay and have a lifetime guarantee</li>
            <li>I was glad I did.</li>
            <li>Love them.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to have found it online.</li>
            <li>when i read made in Italy i thought it would have been better quality.</li>
            <li>Love them.  </li>
            <li>Am now looking for a better product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find angled cuticle clippers in stores for years.  </li>
            <li>I plan to purchase more.</li>
            <li>i decided to try and pay more</li>
            <li>and im glad i didnt pay for being a cheapskate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are pretty good cuticle nippers.</li>
            <li>These are very good, similar to the ones you used to be able to buy at the drug store years ago</li>
            <li>Excellent construction, excellent cutting edge</li>
            <li>Everyone should own this type of clipper (this particular brand is really nice).</li>
            <li>Very well made of good steel.</li>
            <li>Nothing else is as easy and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>They seem to be strong and cut smooth.</li>
            <li>So, how great to see that they are available again (I had looked online a bunch of times over the last decade).  </li>
            <li>The reviews of cheap clippers were discouraging.  </li>
            <li>I hunted everywhere for a clipper like this and was excited to find this one.  </li>
            <li>These get underneath and are very sharp, so cut well and are of very good quality.  </li>
            <li>I think they would be sharper than they are-so the cut isn&#x27;t as clean as I hoped.</li>
            <li>After buying cheap nippers that broke apart in my hand, I decided to look for better quality nippers that were more ergonomically comfortable than your regular cuticle nippers.  </li>
            <li>Great quality and sharper than expected.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thankful I checked back to see if there were any new ones available to buy and got brave enough to take another chance on ordering some more of this type of cuticle clipper that I love and depend on.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Great clippers and very sharp.  </li>
            <li>It works so much better than the traditional nail clipper since it hav a straight top instead of curves.  </li>
            <li>Still convenient for the purse because they&#x27;re nice and compact, but I would not replace a pair of standard design cuticle clippers unless I wanted portability.</li>
            <li>I wish the end was a bit more wider, but I guess I can&#x27;t complan since its pretty clear</li>
            <li>Many Amazon customers seemed to be in the same situation.  </li>
            <li>This clipper works really well and worth the price.</li>
            <li>These are exactly what I was looking</li>
            <li>Was pleasantly surprised by the amount of options available online.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly as described .  </li>
            <li>They are super handy for for getting at the little bits that pop up between the side of the nail and the skin.</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li>However the blades are not sharp enough to cut cuticles so it kind of defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li>An additional benefit is being able to cut loose skin that pops up around the nails from time to time.</li>
            <li>but these are a fine enough replacement.</li>
            <li>It will eventually give out from metal fatigue if you use it as much as I do, but it&#x27;s cheap enough to keep a backup.  </li>
            <li>and they did not cut very well.</li>
            <li>So much easier to trim my cuticles with the design of this clipper.</li>
            <li>Those clippers work very well -</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love how sharp this clipper is</li>
            <li>This product was decent and arrived in a reasonable time frame.  </li>
            <li>I certainly believe they are worth the ten dollars or so.  </li>
            <li>I recommend them highly if you need this type of clipper.  </li>
            <li>Definitely high quality, made in Italy</li>
            <li>Would highly reccomend these.</li>
            <li>Although they are much more expensive, they are of fine quality.  </li>
            <li>These clippers are not very user friendly.  </li>
            <li>Very sharp and precise</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp unlike other cuticle clippers I have bought.</li>
            <li>I had used a Revlon cuticle trimmer for years, but had the misfortune to lose it, and had tried various large clippers</li>
            <li>I use this clipper for my 3 year old sons nails.  </li>
            <li>the blades are sharp not so big like on cheap cuticle clippers.</li>
            <li>The only places I know to get these are Columbus Cutlery in San Francisco and Amazon, and sometimes you can&#x27;t even find one on Amazon, so you&#x27;ll definitely want a backup if you get to like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>Strong thick steel.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked a two dollar lower price point, but seeing I have been unable to locate this item in stores</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive for cuticle clippers, though.</li>
            <li>Been looking for a slanted clipper, I already own a couple by La Cross from a few years back which are very sharp.</li>
            <li>These work really well and unlike the other types</li>
            <li>One is sharp and excellent and the other one is only sharp on the very tip if the cutting area.</li>

            <li> so I hope that they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this nifty little tool.  </li>
            <li> While durably crafted, mine sliced through my skin like little knife edges and is on its way back.</li>
            <li> For the price, I expected them to be a bit nicer</li>
            <li> I went for the expensive version made in Italy, and I think it was the right choice.</li>
            <li> The Premax clippers are sharp and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> This thing is sharp as heck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had luck with the other types of cuticle nippers.</li>
            <li> Sharp too.  </li>
            <li> Sharp and work like they are suppose to.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp, so be careful.  </li>
            <li> going to have to buy a better one...not very sharp :(</li>
            <li> Hard to believe people are claiming this wasn&#x27;t sharp enough.  </li>
            <li> A little too sharp.</li>
            <li> They are really sharp and sturdy!</li>
            <li> This pair is very sharp and sturdily made.</li>
            <li> I choose the Premax product based on previous reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have hard, dry cuticles that need a lot of attention.</li>
            <li> This was a big waste was not good at all</li>
            <li> does not seem to be as sharp as others I have purchased in the past</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will dull down soon.</li>
            <li> It lets you trim cuticles and dead skin neatly without the usual cuticle nipper awkwardness.  </li>
            <li> but they were so unwieldy compared to the small version.  </li>
            <li> how small the tip is gon</li>
            <li> That ridiculous fact aside, I slowly got down to just two rather dull pairs.</li>
            <li> They are hard to hold even when you have small hands like I do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought some other cheaper versions on this site in the past and they were useless and ended up in the trash.  </li>
            <li> It was a little expensive</li>
            <li> I bought this for my travel case but these not so sharp disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> very weak, it does not even cut my toe nails.</li>
            <li> They are difficult to grip.</li>
            <li> u see those big versions - which i hate!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this slanted clipper. I bought one once and could never find it again until I went on amazon and there it was. Very pleased with this purchase and best of all. The price was. Awesome!</li>
            <li> A friend wanted this tapered fingernail clipper and I couldn&#x27;t find one anywhere, even at walmart. So, where else to look? Amazon !!!  I use this clipper exclusively for clipping my cuticles and it works great. Plus, I carry it with me at all times in my pocket along with my swiss army knife. They go together like love and marriage. It was a little expensive but I needed it for my friend. Plus I ordered a spare for myself.</li>
            <li> I use this clipper for my 3 year old sons nails.  It works so much better than the traditional nail clipper since it hav a straight top instead of curves.  I only use these clippers when clipping all of our nails.</li>
            <li> Very, very happy with these.  I was used to mom&#x27;s push style cuticle removers, but couldn&#x27;t find one.  These get underneath and are very sharp, so cut well and are of very good quality.  An additional benefit is being able to cut loose skin that pops up around the nails from time to time.</li>
            <li> Like many of you I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for a replacement for my Lacrosse slanted edge cuticle clippers.  Many Amazon customers seemed to be in the same situation.  The reviews of cheap clippers were discouraging.  Well, here&#x27;s great news.  The Premax clippers are sharp and sturdy.  Although they are much more expensive, they are of fine quality.  I certainly believe they are worth the ten dollars or so.  I recommend them highly if you need this type of clipper.  Several days later, I bought another pair.</li>
            <li> Found this after a time-consuming search of the local Walgreens, Wal Mart, CVS, etc., etc.  Great quality.  Will probably be ordering another.</li>
            <li> A very handy tool for nipping off hang nails.  Nice and sharp.  Clips off snags perfectly.</li>
            <li> Cuticle clippers are ok-not great. I think they would be sharper than they are-so the cut isn&#x27;t as clean as I hoped.</li>
            <li> I love this style clipper. I bought 2 because I lost the one that I had for years (I still miss it) but these are a fine enough replacement.</li>
            <li> Had one like this for years, but lost it.  Nothing else is as easy and comfortable to use.  Precision tool.</li>
            <li> Great clippers and very sharp.  Excellent quality!</li>
            <li> Hard to believe people are claiming this wasn&#x27;t sharp enough.  While durably crafted, mine sliced through my skin like little knife edges and is on its way back.</li>
            <li> I once had about seven of these clippers, made by Trim and sold by CVS. After 2001, some were actually taken by the TSA at the airport, &#x27;cause they didn&#x27;t know what it was!  That ridiculous fact aside, I slowly got down to just two rather dull pairs. So, how great to see that they are available again (I had looked online a bunch of times over the last decade).  This pair is very sharp and sturdily made. I went for the expensive version made in Italy, and I think it was the right choice.</li>
            <li> I had used a Revlon cuticle trimmer for years, but had the misfortune to lose it, and had tried various large clippers but they were so unwieldy compared to the small version.  This clipper works really well and worth the price.</li>
            <li> I need to be ambidextrous in order to use these. They are difficult to grip. Still convenient for the purse because they&#x27;re nice and compact, but I would not replace a pair of standard design cuticle clippers unless I wanted portability.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good cuticle nippers. For the price, I expected them to be a bit nicer but they are okay and have a lifetime guarantee so I hope that they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Everyone should own this type of clipper (this particular brand is really nice). They are super handy for for getting at the little bits that pop up between the side of the nail and the skin. They are also good for hang nails and any excess skin/callus at the corners of the nail after trimming them. I use them all the time.</li>
            <li> These are very good, similar to the ones you used to be able to buy at the drug store years ago but no longer can.  I&#x27;ve bought some other cheaper versions on this site in the past and they were useless and ended up in the trash.  These did not go in the trash.  I&#x27;m thankful I checked back to see if there were any new ones available to buy and got brave enough to take another chance on ordering some more of this type of cuticle clipper that I love and depend on.  I bought 2 pairs, I&#x27;m glad I did, I was definately happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent construction, excellent cutting edge slant making the Amazon Prime customer service just the frosting on the cake!  Take a minute when you get them to familiarize yourself with the way the slant works (intuitive only AFTER use).  I was glad I did.</li>
            <li> This thing is sharp as heck. A little too sharp. Hopefully it will dull down soon.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work well...going to have to buy a better one...not very sharp :(</li>
            <li> Been looking for a slanted clipper, I already own a couple by La Cross from a few years back which are very sharp. I bought this for my travel case but these not so sharp disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had luck with the other types of cuticle nippers. I have hard, dry cuticles that need a lot of attention. These work really well and unlike the other types, I can usually do a good job without making myself bleed</li>
            <li> what can I say, its a simple cuticle clipper.  I wish the end was a bit more wider, but I guess I can&#x27;t complan since its pretty clear how small the tip is gonna be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love how sharp this clipper is, it definitely gives a solid cut.</li>
            <li> Love them.  Bought the same thing at Wal-Mart for $2 and they did not cut very well.</li>
            <li> This a good tool for trimming cuticle.</li>
            <li> This product was decent and arrived in a reasonable time frame.  I would have liked a two dollar lower price point, but seeing I have been unable to locate this item in stores I was glad to have found it online.</li>
            <li> This was a big waste was not good at all when i read made in Italy i thought it would have been better quality.</li>
            <li> Love them.  I will never use another kind of clipper/cuticle remover</li>
            <li> This cuticle clipper is built to last!! Sharp too.  Strong thick steel.  Honestly for the price it should be this good.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was kind of iffy buying these. I did however, and I&#x27;m so glad I did! These are great! They are really sharp and sturdy!</li>
            <li> These clippers are not very user friendly.  They are hard to hold even when you have small hands like I do.  Am now looking for a better product.</li>
            <li> very weak, it does not even cut my toe nails. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this nifty little tool.  It lets you trim cuticles and dead skin neatly without the usual cuticle nipper awkwardness.  It&#x27;s simple and inexpensive.  God bless Italian design.  It will eventually give out from metal fatigue if you use it as much as I do, but it&#x27;s cheap enough to keep a backup.  The only places I know to get these are Columbus Cutlery in San Francisco and Amazon, and sometimes you can&#x27;t even find one on Amazon, so you&#x27;ll definitely want a backup if you get to like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> After buying cheap nippers that broke apart in my hand, I decided to look for better quality nippers that were more ergonomically comfortable than your regular cuticle nippers.  These are exactly what I was looking for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Definitely high quality, made in Italy&lt;br /&gt;2. Very sharp and precise&lt;br /&gt;3. Shaped like regular nail clippers, but with angled nippers on the end.  I find this shape the easiest to hold.&lt;br /&gt;4. Compact&lt;br /&gt;5. Foldable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No cons.  I love these nippers!</li>
            <li> This product appears to be sturdier than the product you can buy in the local stores.  However the blades are not sharp enough to cut cuticles so it kind of defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> I hunted everywhere for a clipper like this and was excited to find this one.  It wouldn&#x27;t cut.  Threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> So much easier to trim my cuticles with the design of this clipper.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find angled cuticle clippers in stores for years.  Was pleasantly surprised by the amount of options available online.  I choose the Premax product based on previous reviews.  Great quality and sharper than expected.  I plan to purchase more.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described .  Very well made of good steel. Shipped quickly and arrived quickly. I  will be buying another one soon..</li>
            <li> They seem to make it easier for me to trip myself and my husband&#x27;s nails.  They seem to be strong and cut smooth.</li>
            <li> Those clippers work very well - the blades are sharp not so big like on cheap cuticle clippers. Kind of expensive for cuticle clippers, though.</li>
            <li> does not seem to be as sharp as others I have purchased in the past</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp unlike other cuticle clippers I have bought.</li>
            <li> These are great cuticle nippers.  They are very sharp, so be careful.  They are well made and sturdy and I suspect they will last for years.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent cuticle clipper. Sharp and work like they are suppose to. Would highly reccomend these. Good quallity.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these.  One is sharp and excellent and the other one is only sharp on the very tip if the cutting area.</li>
            <li> Wei am left handed so the cuticle cutter with the curved blade works best foe me! Lost mine and had a heck of a time locating this replacement!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say just few things to the point - high quality and satisfaction guaranteed.&lt;br /&gt;Its one of the best I ever had a chance to purchase. And yes, it wasnt only $1 or $3 bux - i decided to try and pay more and im glad i didnt pay for being a cheapskate.&lt;br /&gt;Like, others comments I agree that u cant find these cuticle nippers anywhere, eg. La Cross. Instead now everywhere u see those big versions - which i hate! so bulky and not comfy at all.&lt;br /&gt;But now - im one happy gal!</li>
