            <li>works great...</li>
            <li>This powder is great to create volume to your hair.  </li>
            <li>so glad I found it on Amazon!!</li>
            <li>It truly is a remarkable product...adding volume to the hair.</li>
            <li>Good product .</li>
            <li>and I fell in LOVE with it!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>AMAZING PRODUCT FOR VOLUME~</li>
            <li>Love these products</li>
            <li>This stuff is my favorite volumizer.  </li>
            <li>love this....</li>
            <li>The best thing about it, later in the day, you just rub your finger tips into the roots again and it rejuvenates.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase again :D</li>
            <li>My Daughter-in-law who is a stylist gave me a can of this &amp; after using it once, I ordered through Amazon because I wanted to make sure that I had a back-up.</li>
            <li>I contacted the manufacturer, and they confirmed this powder would be fine to keep in the car in all weather conditions.</li>
            <li>This product is (in one word) FABULOUS.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few lifting powder products, but like this one the best.  </li>
            <li>Such a shame as I was hoping it would work great.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve figured out how much to apply and where (very light dusting along my part and in the back of my hair for volume and texture), I have great texture and volume literally all day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find locally, so am very happy that I can get it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>is that I can keep it in my car for quick touch-ups when needed.</li>
            <li>Key to successful use is applying at the roots-- if you put it on your hair (in a more general sense)</li>
            <li>The texture and volume it gives to fine, limp hair is simply amazing!  </li>
            <li>Most importantly,  however,  was the fact that it was advertised as .75 ounces, but what I got was only .68 ounces.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Quick, easy use product on my low maintence hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product - took me a few applications to figure out the right balance for my fine, shorter hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this texturizing powder!</li>
            <li>I really like about it too</li>
            <li>Standing over me they could see how much was going on and where.</li>
            <li>your hair will be kind of sticky and heavy.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended and I can&#x27;t style with out this powder.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s to fine to apply well and dulls the hair.</li>
            <li>I have thin hair and it does a good job creating volume.</li>
            <li>Made my fine hair feel sticky and weighted down.  </li>
            <li>If you stay with the roots, you will be able to tease your hair with very little effort in to whatever shape you like at the crown.  </li>
            <li>First, the packaging was not the amber-colored bottle, but a narrower basic gray bottle.  </li>
            <li>My hair is normally straight, fine &amp; limp and this product really helped...for several hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and it is hard to  find.  </li>
            <li>I recommend starting out with a light application, as too much can make the hair chalky, piece-y, and dirty looking; you can always add more, but you can&#x27;t take away what you&#x27;ve already applied.  </li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that if you add too much then your hair will get a greasy look and feel to it.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair, and usually do a lot of back coming to give my hair some volume.  </li>
            <li>The inner box the bottle was nestled in, supposedly from the manufacturer, was almost completely torn off on the bottom.  </li>

            <li> Found it to be no different than any of the other volume powders.  </li>

            <li> It gives you a bit of height with just a very small amount, so leaves your hair feeling very natural.  </li>

            <li> Just takes a little.</li>
            <li> Can feel a little heavy if you run your fingers through it but not a huge issue.</li>
            <li> It is also a little difficult to wash out of your hair.  </li>

            <li> This product is (in one word) FABULOUS.  It is weightless, as the title suggests, and provides volume.  Key to successful use is applying at the roots-- if you put it on your hair (in a more general sense) your hair will be kind of sticky and heavy.  If you stay with the roots, you will be able to tease your hair with very little effort in to whatever shape you like at the crown.  Want to be Amy Winehouse (other than the deceased part)?  No problem.  A little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few lifting powder products, but like this one the best.  It gives you a bit of height with just a very small amount, so leaves your hair feeling very natural.  I use it all the time.  It&#x27;s hard to find locally, so am very happy that I can get it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The product delivered was not what was offered. First, the packaging was not the amber-colored bottle, but a narrower basic gray bottle.  The inner box the bottle was nestled in, supposedly from the manufacturer, was almost completely torn off on the bottom.  Most importantly,  however,  was the fact that it was advertised as .75 ounces, but what I got was only .68 ounces. What is that, a nearly ten percent discrepancy? The product does what it says, but I did not get what I paid for!!</li>
            <li> This powder holds my bangs perfectly</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used for volume. I was really impressed. A little goes a long way! One bottle should last about 6 months. Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Bought this at the salon after my stylist used it.  She told me &#x27;it&#x27;s only sold only at salons&#x27;...so glad I found it on Amazon!! It&#x27;s $7 cheaper! and I will buy it on Amazon next time.  I have baby fine hair, and usually do a lot of back coming to give my hair some volume.  I don&#x27;t need any back combing while using this product!  my hair has held it&#x27;s lift all day!  It is Amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Works great!!!! Quick, easy use product on my low maintence hair. Highly recommended and I can&#x27;t style with out this powder.</li>
            <li> Good product . Just takes a little. Too much makes hair feel heavy. Should last a long time. Love these products</li>
            <li> Found it to be no different than any of the other volume powders.  It&#x27;s to fine to apply well and dulls the hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and it is hard to  find.  I like to tease my hair because I feel it needs a lift.  This dry powder gets it a lift without making it look like a lot of product.</li>
            <li> Works great adding flexible volume to your roots. Can feel a little heavy if you run your fingers through it but not a huge issue.</li>
            <li> Love this product - took me a few applications to figure out the right balance for my fine, shorter hair.

            <li> This has to be used correctly.  Sprinkle a tiny amount on crown of head and then rub it in with finger tips.  Instant volume. This stuff is my favorite volumizer.  I have natural curly hair.</li>
            <li> Made my fine hair feel sticky and weighted down.  Such a shame as I was hoping it would work great.</li>
            <li> love this....works great...a little goes a long way..</li>
            <li> My stylist used this on my hair at the salon and I fell in LOVE with it!  The texture and volume it gives to fine, limp hair is simply amazing!  A little goes a LONG way!  Just a dusting on my roots at my crown and I get all the lift I need.  The best thing about it, later in the day, you just rub your finger tips into the roots again and it rejuvenates.  Also about $10 cheaper through Amazon than salon</li>
            <li> A little bit of this powder goes a long way. It truly is a remarkable product...adding volume to the hair. I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Discovered this product when my Stylist used it for my last haircut appointment. I was amazed at how long it lasted! My hair is normally straight, fine &amp; limp and this product really helped...for several hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like about it too is that I can keep it in my car for quick touch-ups when needed. I contacted the manufacturer, and they confirmed this powder would be fine to keep in the car in all weather conditions. Will definitely purchase again :D</li>
            <li> I found it a little hard to control how much I applied and where it went. It would have been easier for someone else to put it on for me. Standing over me they could see how much was going on and where. It did make my hair feel thicker.</li>
            <li> My Daughter-in-law who is a stylist gave me a can of this &amp; after using it once, I ordered through Amazon because I wanted to make sure that I had a back-up. My D-I-L told me the price I was paying is great! AMAZING PRODUCT FOR VOLUME~</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. It sticks your hair in place without making it wet or greasy. I love this stuff!</li>
