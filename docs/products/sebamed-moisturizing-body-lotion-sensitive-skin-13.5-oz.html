            <li>I love how my skin feels with SebaMed.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I was leery of buying something I wasn&#x27;t sure of.</li>
            <li>I have been using it together with Sebamed washing fluid for more than 10 years and it works wonderful for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Has a nice scent and really makes your skin feel good.</li>
            <li>I love the face and body wash and purchased the lotion to try it out.  </li>
            <li>Good product and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>It has taken my dry, cracked heels to the best condition since I was a child.  </li>
            <li>Too watery and had to apply a lot, the frangrance was too strong for me</li>
            <li>Its a wonderful skin care product -a little pricey, but it&#x27;s quality.  </li>
            <li>The best all round body lotion you will ever use.</li>
            <li>Get some and enjoy.</li>
            <li>My son has eczema, so I have purchased several of your creams and lotions and they have been great for him, so I tried some of them.  </li>
            <li>Now everyone gets to enjoy moisturized and smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find it here after my local drugstore stopped carrying it (made room for a &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; lotion).  </li>
            <li>This lotion is nice and light, not thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li>It does however, feel refreshing when u first put it on.</li>
            <li>The best lotion EVER especially if you have sensitive skin or eczema!</li>
            <li>It suds up (which is important to me), and the scent is light and fresh.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>Fresh scent, absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave a person greasy and keeps my skin comfortable all day.  </li>
            <li>and so this doesn&#x27;t quite give me the adequate moisture I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert and my skin felt better within 2 days of using just the product</li>
            <li>When I ran out, I tried to find a new supply of my favorite Body Wash, Lotion and Cream.</li>
            <li>(I live in Illinois) and contacted MyMedExpress to see if they would be able to help.</li>
            <li>The only thing that works on psoriasis better than any prescription cream or pill!</li>
            <li>Fast Absorbing,soft and smooth after feel.love the scent.</li>
            <li>I am grateful to have found this product - well worth the price.</li>
            <li>A simple and highly effective product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This and non-soap facial and bath are best among other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to do the right thing for my skin and use a lotion that was pH balanced.</li>
            <li>So this cost $16.48 right now</li>
            <li>yeah right.</li>
            <li>but it is absorbed very fast.</li>
            <li>However, I contacted Sebamed company and was assured that the product was the same great product I was used to just packaged differently for the US</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis and this helps me so very much.</li>
            <li>leave skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>you just have to be consistent with use.</li>
            <li>I am so very grateful!</li>
            <li>Although not cheap, it is really a good product.</li>
            <li>I also use the Sebamed face cream for sensitive skin and fragrance free hydrating gentle skin cleanser for the face and body.</li>
            <li>It spreads easily, soaks up very quickly so no sticky feeling and it makes my skin super soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy, absorbs quickly, and keeps your skin soft for hours.  </li>
            <li>Plus it softens your skin very well.</li>
            <li>I think it was because this is such a light lotion, and my skin must have gotten drier as winter settled in.</li>
            <li>sometimes i put too much on my hand</li>
            <li>Skin feels really smooth the next day and improves over time.  </li>
            <li>and it really helps</li>
            <li>Healing your itchy skin fast.</li>
            <li>I just like this lotion if I still feel dry on my legs before bed, but it isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough on its own.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes very well almost all day long, and leaves a very nice subtle scent.  </li>
            <li>This product has taken my skin to a new level of health.  </li>
            <li>It leave&#x27;s your skin very soft and not oily.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin &amp;</li>
            <li>Far exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Keeps skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li>The skin looks completely healed,</li>
            <li>says it&#x27;s for sensitive skin,</li>
            <li>Have dry skin and the lotion didn&#x27;t help it much.</li>
            <li>I really like it for my son who has really dry skin</li>
            <li>It spreads well and doesn&#x27;t dry up too fast.  </li>
            <li>Finally my skin is back to normal again from head to toe.</li>
            <li>the other product I used during this period of healing is called MetaDerm and is also very healing.</li>
            <li>I live in Canada and weather is quite dry here.</li>
            <li>this works wonders in the dry climate I live in.  </li>

            <li> switched to sebamed to help with dry itchy skin, apply twice daily</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> If you are having bouts of dry patches of skin, give this a try.  </li>
            <li> Moisture for very dry skin without being greasy</li>
            <li> I am in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li> Terrible name for a great product.</li>
            <li> I tried a few moisturizers, but Sebamed was the only one that restored my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not for your face, as this may be a bit heavy, but they have a product line especially for your face, too.</li>
            <li> maybe needs to be a little thicker.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become my year round lotion.  </li>
            <li> I have used Sebamed products for the past 7 years.</li>
            <li> no more inflammation or the feeling of having fallen into a nest of fire-ants or stinging nettles.</li>
            <li> Very few stores hand this product in stock.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lotion is very thin and doesn&#x27;t moisturize for very long.</li>
            <li> I hate thick lotions that get sucked up or dry too fast, making it difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> People with dry skin living in cold weather might choose something heavier in the winter.</li>
            <li> During the cold Chicago winters, I would have a form of dry skin on my forearms.  </li>
            <li> and conditioner, however, not good.</li>
            <li> Also the bottle is a little dirty.</li>
            <li> sorry I ordered it.</li>
            <li> ( in case someone is suffering as badly as I did just 11 days ago.)</li>
            <li> After burning, itching, painful skin with blisters and sleepless nights, Sebamed moisturizer and soap, soothed my skin and my symptoms are 95% healed.</li>
            <li> and today I saw on rite aid that they sell this lotion for 12.99. :(</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this lotion. It spreads easily, soaks up very quickly so no sticky feeling and it makes my skin super soft and healthy looking. I will keep on using this and nothing else for the body. I also use the Sebamed face cream for sensitive skin and fragrance free hydrating gentle skin cleanser for the face and body. Finally my skin is back to normal again from head to toe.</li>
            <li> This product has taken my skin to a new level of health.  I am a believer in the proper pH for our entire body, inside and out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Moisturizing Body Lotion for about 2 months.  It has taken my dry, cracked heels to the best condition since I was a child.  They no longer snag on hose when I put them on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a lightweight skin moisturizer with a very light scent.  I am grateful to have found this product - well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the fragrance. The lotion is very thin and doesn&#x27;t moisturize for very long. Over priced. I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I had received a sample of this lotion, and I was impressed from the very beginning.  It moisturizes very well almost all day long, and leaves a very nice subtle scent.  Very impressed and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> So this cost $16.48 right now but when i bought it was $19.94... and today I saw on rite aid that they sell this lotion for 12.99. :( Also the bottle is a little dirty.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizing body lotion.</li>
            <li> I have used RainBath for years - I love how my skin feels with SebaMed.  It suds up (which is important to me), and the scent is light and fresh.</li>
            <li> I had to wait but I finally received the lotion.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin &amp; this works wonders in the dry climate I live in.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer goes immediately into your skin.  No greasy or oily feeling.</li>
            <li> Moisture for very dry skin without being greasy</li>
            <li> Too watery and had to apply a lot, the frangrance was too strong for me</li>
            <li> I really like it for my son who has really dry skin</li>
            <li> Product as described.</li>
            <li> I love this product. One problem is the dispenser is to short for the container.</li>
            <li> Always use this product, it&#x27;s great....My husband has a lot of skin problems and this is all he uses after his shower.</li>
            <li> smells great and goes on really smoothly</li>
            <li> I hate thick lotions that get sucked up or dry too fast, making it difficult to apply.  This lotion is nice and light, not thick and creamy.  It spreads well and doesn&#x27;t dry up too fast.  Skin feels really smooth the next day and improves over time.  A simple and highly effective product.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but I like this stuff anyway.  It&#x27;s become my year round lotion.  People with dry skin living in cold weather might choose something heavier in the winter.</li>
            <li> I have used Sebamed products for the past 7 years. I moved to the US a year ago and came with a supply of the products. When I ran out, I tried to find a new supply of my favorite Body Wash, Lotion and Cream. I found Sebamed here but the packaging was different. I was leery of buying something I wasn&#x27;t sure of. However, I contacted Sebamed company and was assured that the product was the same great product I was used to just packaged differently for the US market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only giving this 4 stars because it smells just a tad different than what I&#x27;m used to.  However, I admit that it could just be me. I will buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> My son has eczema, so I have purchased several of your creams and lotions and they have been great for him, so I tried some of them.  I just like this lotion if I still feel dry on my legs before bed, but it isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough on its own.</li>
            <li> Good product and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> seems to soak into skin and not coat it.  been using for several years.</li>
            <li> switched to sebamed to help with dry itchy skin, apply twice daily and it really helps</li>
            <li> The best lotion EVER especially if you have sensitive skin or eczema! I cannot go a day without it or I break out!</li>
            <li> Although not cheap, it is really a good product.</li>
            <li> Good lotion  does what they say it will do  you just have to be consistent with use.</li>
            <li> This product makes my feel skin wonderful, silky smooth. I wanted to share this product with my family so I ordered a couple to share with everyone. I wanted to share with relatives in Michigan (I live in Illinois) and contacted MyMedExpress to see if they would be able to help. They were very quick to respond and offer their help in making sure that this wonderful product was shipped to the right address. Now everyone gets to enjoy moisturized and smooth skin. Highly recommend to everyone. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was told this is THE best...not by me...maybe needs to be a little thicker. I am in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li> Just a bit over price. Healing your itchy skin fast. Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This and non-soap facial and bath are best among other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo and conditioner, however, not good.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for any sensitive skin.  I have been using it together with Sebamed washing fluid for more than 10 years and it works wonderful for my skin.  Keeps skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This is one of two products which healed my sever eczema attack in only 11 days. After burning, itching, painful skin with blisters and sleepless nights, Sebamed moisturizer and soap, soothed my skin and my symptoms are 95% healed. The skin looks completely healed, no more inflammation or the feeling of having fallen into a nest of fire-ants or stinging nettles. I am so very grateful! D.H.&lt;br /&gt;p.s. the other product I used during this period of healing is called MetaDerm and is also very healing. ( in case someone is suffering as badly as I did just 11 days ago.)</li>
            <li> This lotion is great.  I was happy to find it here after my local drugstore stopped carrying it (made room for a &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; lotion).  It isn&#x27;t greasy, absorbs quickly, and keeps your skin soft for hours.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> This wash burned my face....says it&#x27;s for sensitive skin, yeah right. I am returning it to Costco.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. Never greasy</li>
            <li> I could not stand the smell of this product.  sorry I ordered it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this wash</li>
            <li> Has a nice scent and really makes your skin feel good.</li>
            <li> I love the face and body wash and purchased the lotion to try it out.  I have really dry skin and so this doesn&#x27;t quite give me the adequate moisture I&#x27;m looking for. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s excellent for people with normal skin.</li>
            <li> During the cold Chicago winters, I would have a form of dry skin on my forearms.  I tried a few moisturizers, but Sebamed was the only one that restored my skin.  Now, I use daily and all over.  Its a wonderful skin care product -a little pricey, but it&#x27;s quality.  If you are having bouts of dry patches of skin, give this a try.  It&#x27;s not for your face, as this may be a bit heavy, but they have a product line especially for your face, too.</li>
