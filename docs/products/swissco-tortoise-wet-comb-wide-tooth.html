            <li>I&#x27;m most grateful for the astonishingly smooth texture of these combs.these are beautiful combs</li>
            <li>I examined the comb closely to make sure there were no rough edges, as another reviewer mentioned having a problem with this, but the comb is perfect.</li>
            <li>However, I do like that this comb fits nicely in a purse, and it&#x27;s easy to carry around for midday touch ups.  </li>
            <li>BEWARE: When this comb arrived, I took it out of the packaging to examine it to make sure that it didn&#x27;t have any kinds of edges or ridges.  </li>
            <li>i love this comb.</li>
            <li>love this for getting tangle out</li>

            <li>Love this comb.</li>
            <li>I was extremely impressed by the fact that this one was listed at around the same price.</li>
            <li>(the Mason Pearson is MUCH better for that).  </li>
            <li>My search will continue because this did not get through it easily.</li>
            <li>The Swissco is a good comb and does a good job doing what its description suggests, combing wet hair.  </li>
            <li>It definitely helps detangle my hair easily, and they are beautifully made.  </li>
            <li>However, this is a fine substitute</li>
            <li>Well-made, works wonders for fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>I had to use a nail file to smooth out the edge.  </li>
            <li>If you hit any areas that don&#x27;t feel smooth, consider refraining from using the comb.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It travels smoothly through my hair and doesn&#x27;t catch or snag any hairs along the way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using it every day.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for for my fine, curly hair!</li>
            <li>This is a great wide toothed comb.</li>
            <li>It feels good in my hand, just enough heft.  </li>
            <li>Definitely not bad for the money.</li>
            <li>I tried washing it with a mild soap thinking it might just be some product buildup on the comb, and that didn&#x27;t help either.</li>
            <li>It feels pretty good going through your hair and doesn&#x27;t scratch the scalp, but after ONE use it has become discolored on the ends of the teeth (looks kind of like hard water spots).  </li>
            <li>Sturdy construction and also pretty!</li>
            <li>I never thought that I would enjoy a comb so much.</li>
            <li>i have been looking for a really good wide tooth comb for a while</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This comb is as nice as the one I ordered from across the pond, for a third of the price.</li>
            <li>Very much so worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>These combs are really great especially if you have natural hair</li>
            <li>I originally found another comb by the same brand in TJ Maxx and feel in love with it.</li>
            <li>Please examine the comb after it arrives and make sure that there are no pieces of plastic that were left on the comb unintentionally.  </li>
            <li>It has a smooth, seamless hand finish and will not snag or break your hair.</li>
            <li>This comb is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>These combs are wide toothed, and compact sizes, they fit easily into a purse compartment</li>
            <li>This Swissco Tortoise Wide tooth Comb is the best comb of its kind around other than the more expensive Mason Pearson version at twice the price.</li>
            <li>It is seamless and smooth, but the teeth are more pointed than the tortoise shell comb I was using previously.</li>
            <li>This comb is cheaper, but I am now very cautious about using it at all, given the way that it arrived (unfinished).</li>
            <li>it doesnt snag and it is gentle.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I would suggest it to anyone with curly hair who needs a gentle de-tangling comb.</li>
            <li>I have never pulled more hair out of my head than with this comb, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for wet brushing</li>
            <li>It is clear from the picture that the comb is made in Switzerland -- exactly the comb that I have at home.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a wide tooth comb to comb through her hair easily after washing it instead of using a brush.</li>
            <li>Definitely plan on buying more later.</li>
            <li>It works ok when her hair is dry, just not wet.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>This comb is what I would normally use after washing my hair in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Great for detangling thick, long, kinky textured hair.  </li>
            <li>At an average of $12, it may seem a little pricey for some, but it is a very worthwhile investment.  </li>
            <li>My whole family of all girls loves this product and uses it daily.</li>
            <li>It is seamless</li>
            <li>I like to leave natural curl in my hair, and this detangles without flattening the curls.</li>
            <li>This is a great comb that glides threw my waist length thin hair!!</li>
            <li>Great comb for combing out my thick, long hair when it is wet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price, but if the choice is between a Mason Pearson Rake Comb (also Wide Tooth, with longer slimmer teeth and MUCH higher quality) and the Swissco, and the extra money is not a factor, I would definitely choose the former.</li>
            <li>No rough edges at all!  </li>
            <li>I use it on my wet or damp hair to gently detangle.  </li>
            <li>Upon arrival, I noticed it is not really wide tooth at all.</li>
            <li>This comb was exactly what I was looking for to untangle wet hair without pulling - will definitely buy another one.</li>
            <li>Obviously, this comb has big, widely space teeth, which is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>The prongs are pretty close together compared to my other wide tooth combs.</li>

            <li> The prongs are pretty close together compared to my other wide tooth combs.</li>
            <li> The comb that I received is made in India and is larger, and clearly not the same quality.  </li>
            <li> I use this for my curly long weave and for my beard.</li>
            <li> My wife is always poaching this comb from my drawer because it works so well on long hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second comb because eventually a tine breaks from the pressure of my fingers on it as I pull it through my wet hair.</li>
            <li> It detangles wet hair, reduces static and  breakage when used on dry hair, and helps get knots out of thick, curly or delicate hair.  </li>
            <li> I am trying to improve the overall health of my hair and wanted a comb that does not have any seams or sharp edges that might break my hair.</li>
            <li> There is no substitute for a wide tooth comb when you have long hair, and this comb does the job.</li>
            <li> They are handcrafted and very smooth, they look expensive, and I&#x27;ve owned 1or 2 of these by this company in the past.</li>
            <li> This comb is well crafted and glides through hair, wet or dry, with ease.  </li>
            <li> This wide tooth comb is made with quality.</li>
            <li> I specifically bought it for detangling my hair after a shower/to help comb through a hair serum I use, and I expected it to stand up to that process.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend to all looking for a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> Thought this would be wide tooth as stated.</li>
            <li> I got this comb because I read that it&#x27;s safer to use a wide-tooth comb on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> If you use a comb with a sharp edge, you can be literally stripping the cuticle off of your hair strands each time you use it.  </li>
            <li> Swissco&#x27;s combs are quite helpful in de tangling my thick, coarse textured hair.</li>
            <li> The manufacture had left a very thick piece of sharp plastic on one of the teeth.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick, long, curly hair.</li>
            <li> (mine is very coarse and thick)!</li>
            <li> No more tangles</li>
            <li> had a hard time finding a quality comb until buying this Swissco Comb.</li>
            <li> Just the answer I was looking for to distribute conditioner through my extra-long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I found this rather annoying because I bought this comb because is supposed to be without ridges and edges that can tear hair.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and will not order from you again.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this comb.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent product and speedy delivery. I examined the comb closely to make sure there were no rough edges, as another reviewer mentioned having a problem with this, but the comb is perfect. Thank you.</li>
            <li> BEWARE: When this comb arrived, I took it out of the packaging to examine it to make sure that it didn&#x27;t have any kinds of edges or ridges.  The manufacture had left a very thick piece of sharp plastic on one of the teeth. I had to use a nail file to smooth out the edge.  I found this rather annoying because I bought this comb because is supposed to be without ridges and edges that can tear hair.  If you use a comb with a sharp edge, you can be literally stripping the cuticle off of your hair strands each time you use it.  Please examine the comb after it arrives and make sure that there are no pieces of plastic that were left on the comb unintentionally.  Test the comb by going over the edges of your teeth with the tip of your fingernail.  If you hit any areas that don&#x27;t feel smooth, consider refraining from using the comb.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this comb along with the Mason Pearson rake comb, and there is no comparison between the two.  This comb is cheaper, but I am now very cautious about using it at all, given the way that it arrived (unfinished).</li>
            <li> This is a good product for the price.  It detangles wet hair, reduces static and  breakage when used on dry hair, and helps get knots out of thick, curly or delicate hair.  The reason I gave it 4 stars (instead of 5) is only because I&#x27;ve been &#x27;spoiled&#x27; by the Mason Pearson Rake Comb I recently purchased, which I prefer to this one.  The Swissco is a good comb and does a good job doing what its description suggests, combing wet hair.  It&#x27;s well worth the price, but if the choice is between a Mason Pearson Rake Comb (also Wide Tooth, with longer slimmer teeth and MUCH higher quality) and the Swissco, and the extra money is not a factor, I would definitely choose the former.</li>
            <li> I bought this comb and 2 smaller ones just like it made by the same company, Swissco, for the purpose of carrying in a purse, sometimes just leaving it in the purse when I switch out my purse for a different outfit.  These combs are wide toothed, and compact sizes, they fit easily into a purse compartment so I never find myself w/ wind blown hair or messed up hair following  a massage and stuck w/o a comb. They are handcrafted and very smooth, they look expensive, and I&#x27;ve owned 1or 2 of these by this company in the past. (One landed up in the river when we capsized!)  Provided you don&#x27;t lose them, they&#x27;ll last a lifetime.  They don&#x27;t break. They are awesome!</li>
            <li> I never thought that I would enjoy a comb so much. I use this for my curly long weave and for my beard. Nice quality comb.</li>
            <li> This comb is what I would normally use after washing my hair in the morning.  But man, some days it just rips out the hair.  I have shoulder length coarse hair.  I like the color I guess.  Still searching for a good comb to use after a wash.</li>
            <li> i love this comb. i have been looking for a really good wide tooth comb for a while and this one is perfect. it doesnt snag and it is gentle. use it every day.</li>
            <li> Just the answer I was looking for to distribute conditioner through my extra-long, thick hair. Beautifully made, to boot.</li>
            <li> This wide tooth comb is made with quality. It travels smoothly through my hair and doesn&#x27;t catch or snag any hairs along the way.&lt;br /&gt;I had a hard time finding a quality comb until buying this Swissco Comb. I would suggest this comb to anyone!</li>
            <li> The described comb that I ordered, is not the comb that I received.  It is clear from the picture that the comb is made in Switzerland -- exactly the comb that I have at home.

            <li> FABULOUS COMB!!!!! Goes through my hair without splitting. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Definitely not bad for the money. It is seamless and smooth, but the teeth are more pointed than the tortoise shell comb I was using previously. However, this is a fine substitute and I like that it&#x27;s not an animal product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this comb.  It feels pretty good going through your hair and doesn&#x27;t scratch the scalp, but after ONE use it has become discolored on the ends of the teeth (looks kind of like hard water spots).  I specifically bought it for detangling my hair after a shower/to help comb through a hair serum I use, and I expected it to stand up to that process.  I tried washing it with a mild soap thinking it might just be some product buildup on the comb, and that didn&#x27;t help either.</li>

            <li> Swissco&#x27;s combs are quite helpful in de tangling my thick, coarse textured hair. The spacing between the teeth works&lt;br /&gt;for me. I&#x27;m most grateful for the astonishingly smooth texture of these combs.these are beautiful combs</li>
            <li> Great for detangling thick, long, kinky textured hair.  I use it on my wet or damp hair to gently detangle.  It has a smooth, seamless hand finish and will not snag or break your hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick, long, curly hair. I was looking for a wide tooth comb to comb through her hair easily after washing it instead of using a brush. My search will continue because this did not get through it easily. It works ok when her hair is dry, just not wet.</li>
            <li> This is a great comb that glides threw my waist length thin hair!! No more tangles and it don&#x27;t break or cause damage to your hair.. Also reduces static!! Well made and looks nice!</li>
            <li> It definitely helps detangle my hair easily, and they are beautifully made.  A functional piece of artwork, I leave them on my bathroom counter on-top of a towel, it makes me feel like a stylist.</li>
            <li> love this for getting tangle out</li>
            <li> I am trying to improve the overall health of my hair and wanted a comb that does not have any seams or sharp edges that might break my hair. This comb is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price. Keeps my longer hair tidy after a shampoo. Love the design, hoping it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful comb and so smooth on my scalp.  No rough edges at all!  It feels good in my hand, just enough heft.  I really enjoy using it every day.  This is my brand now.</li>
            <li> works like a comb.  lines your hair up in organized rows for spraying applications</li>
            <li> Obviously, this comb has big, widely space teeth, which is exactly what I wanted.  My wife is always poaching this comb from my drawer because it works so well on long hair.  Excellent at detangling.  Highly recommend.  Superb quality.</li>
            <li> This is a great wide toothed comb. My whole family of all girls loves this product and uses it daily.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for for my fine, curly hair! After using this comb my hair is much more manageable. Sturdy construction and also pretty! Would recommend to all looking for a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> This comb works great</li>
            <li> This is the best comb I have ever owned. I can now comb my hair without it tangling and getting caught in between the teeth of the comb.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for products which will work well with my hair texture.  That&#x27;s a tall order when you have kinky curly hair.  This product lived up to all of my expectations.  At an average of $12, it may seem a little pricey for some, but it is a very worthwhile investment.  I would suggest it to anyone with curly hair who needs a gentle de-tangling comb.</li>
            <li> This comb is well crafted and glides through hair, wet or dry, with ease.  Can be used to detangle, to distribute hair product, such as conditioner, and to style.  This comb is as nice as the one I ordered from across the pond, for a third of the price.</li>
            <li> Great comb. Very much so worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> This Swissco Tortoise Wide tooth Comb is the best comb of its kind around other than the more expensive Mason Pearson version at twice the price. There is no substitute for a wide tooth comb when you have long hair, and this comb does the job. Great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this comb. It is seamless so it doesn&#x27;t stress my hair and well priced.</li>
            <li> Great comb for combing out my thick, long hair when it is wet.  I only wish I could find it with a handle.  I&#x27;m on my second comb because eventually a tine breaks from the pressure of my fingers on it as I pull it through my wet hair.</li>
            <li> I originally found another comb by the same brand in TJ Maxx and feel in love with it. I was extremely impressed by the fact that this one was listed at around the same price. These combs are really great especially if you have natural hair (mine is very coarse and thick)! These are the only combs I will ever use on my hair again! Definitely plan on buying more later.</li>
            <li> Thought this would be wide tooth as stated. Upon arrival, I noticed it is not really wide tooth at all. The prongs are pretty close together compared to my other wide tooth combs.</li>
            <li> I got this comb because I read that it&#x27;s safer to use a wide-tooth comb on wet hair.  I have never pulled more hair out of my head than with this comb, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for wet brushing (the Mason Pearson is MUCH better for that).  However, I do like that this comb fits nicely in a purse, and it&#x27;s easy to carry around for midday touch ups.  I like to leave natural curl in my hair, and this detangles without flattening the curls.</li>
