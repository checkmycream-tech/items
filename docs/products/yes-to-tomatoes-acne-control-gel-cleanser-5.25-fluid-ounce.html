            <li>Better than anything else I have tried</li>
            <li>I was having some acne on my forehead that spawned more acne in a never-ending cycle.</li>
            <li>Love this to control my acne.</li>
            <li>I also love tomatoes.</li>
            <li>A trial that turned into one of our favorite products.  </li>
            <li>When you squeeze some out, you get more than you want.</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser -</li>
            <li>This product allowed me to go off antibiotics, which I was on for many years.</li>
            <li>LOVE this whole line!!!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and it makes your skin super smooth.</li>
            <li>When a product is something that can so easily run out, why would you put the opening on the bottom of the container?  </li>
            <li>It is still a good wash and the price seems to be decent on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It has a STRONG floral perfume smell that to me is an &amp;#34;old lady perfume&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
            <li>This is the exact kind of cleanser</li>
            <li>I had them use Burts Bees tomato products with fantastic results.</li>
            <li>but I think the smell is very fresh (some people do not, from what I can see in the reviews).  </li>
            <li>I very rarely review anything</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I am no longer able to use this product.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this product.</li>
            <li>Love this face wash so much!</li>
            <li>took 20 minutes to clean).  </li>
            <li>whole company is cruelty-free, and this Yes to Tomatoes cleanser works better than anything we&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>It clears my skin quickly, tightens my pores, and makes my skin glow.  </li>
            <li>and I love that it is more natural than most facial products.</li>
            <li>My kids&#x27; faces (and backs and shoulders--they use it in the shower, too) are clearer than they&#x27;ve ever been, all with no weird carcinogenic chemicals, and NO ANIMAL TESTING!  </li>
            <li>I love this product works so well and leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>When you say cleanser, I think of some kind of facial scrub/cream that you spread on your face and then wash off - it often removes makeup as well.</li>
            <li>this stuff isnt worth it to me.</li>
            <li>love this keeps my face clean without making it too dry.</li>
            <li>It goes on feeling nice and thick, but lathers and rinses off without any problem (another problem I&#x27;ve had with harsher soaps and face washes, since most soap residue makes me break out in hives).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my oily acne-prone skin needs in the hot August summer of the south.</li>
            <li>Please create a proper bottle with closure on the top</li>
            <li>This is more like a cleanser (actual scrub that you then wash off).</li>
            <li>I wonder if anyone has a product made from hot peppers.</li>
            <li>the back of it says to thoroughly clean face first than apply this product to a clean face.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin soft and clean and doesn&#x27;t overdry.</li>
            <li>I always used to use a load of different products to clean my skin but this one works a treat all by itself!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other brands ( pro-active, Murad, clean and clear, dove, burts bees, kiss my face and many others)  to gain &amp;#34;control&amp;#34; of my skin and this one actually WORKS!</li>
            <li>I really think you will.</li>
            <li>I have very oily/acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I phoned the company and the Customer Service department was very accommodating.  </li>
            <li>Really like the product and the people too.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very grainy.  </li>
            <li>REALLY when to get all the grainy pieces off.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re familiar with Proactiv&#x27;s 3-step system, this is like the toner step that you use after washing the actual cleanser off your skin.</li>
            <li>I love their other products though.</li>
            <li>The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it full stars was because it didn&#x27;t seem to help that much with my acne.</li>
            <li>I used to use it all the time, however since getting older and a shift in my PH balance</li>
            <li>You spread it across your face after washing and then apply whatever else is in your normal routine (e.g., the [[ASIN</li>
            <li>I just wanted to post this first review of the Gel Cleanser to clear up the confusion since many of the other reviews seem to treat this particular product as an actual cleanser and are a bit misleading.</li>
            <li>They are sending me a new tube to rectify the situation.  </li>
            <li>While I still have a couple of breakout spots, after using this cleanser the redness is dramatically less and easily covered.</li>
            <li>I have combination-oily sensitive skin and most non-oil cleansers are too harsh for me.</li>
            <li>My skin is clear and so soft!</li>
            <li>is natural too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with acne since I was about 12 years old.</li>
            <li>I am an adult with acne, rosacea.</li>
            <li>packaging and instructions are quirky and fun, and I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to others with combination or oily faces!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very budget friendly, as you only need a little.</li>
            <li>This helped me break the cycle and a little after a week I started using it, my acne has pretty much cleared up.</li>
            <li>This face wash cleans off makeup like no other!</li>
            <li>: / Also the directions make it sound like a leave on  treatment, not a face wash.</li>
            <li>First, I want to just say that this is not the cleanser I expected.</li>
            <li>As far as keeping my face clear, I haven&#x27;t notice it making a big difference.</li>
            <li>This product is the only face wash I have found that helps keep my skin clear without drying me out.</li>
            <li>To Tomatoes Clear Skin Deep Pore Scrub, 4 Ounce]].</li>
            <li>I use it with the entire Yes To Tomatoes line, and it has reduced my breakouts and helped to fade some old acne marks.</li>

            <li> face to dry.</li>
            <li> You are applying this product to your face/acne and then letting it sit there and dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff stings,smd leaves my face really dry.</li>
            <li> Last night, I didn&#x27;t get the cap down tight enough.  </li>
            <li> (ie, it crept out of the bottom of the Tomatoes bottle and underneath all of my other bottles and tubes --</li>
            <li> Gives that slightly tingly feeling</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather at all, so it&#x27;s a little odd to wash my face with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding that its a little watery.</li>
            <li> Do a cheesy move in front of the mirror, as you admire your clear skin.</li>
            <li> It had obvious finger prints on it, it was sticky, and part of the cap that attached to the product was broken.</li>
            <li> Cover the entire affected area with a thin layer one to three times daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a few days of applying this to my face twice a day (once in the morning, once at night), it started to control my acne.</li>
            <li> To make matters worst, when I squeezed all of the air out of the tube, the cleanser appeared to be only half full.</li>
            <li> I hated having to use two different cleansers (one for makeup to get that junk off and the other to help clear my acne, oh plus a scrub some nights).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get past the smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this is marketed as a cleanser, and in fact, the directions to use this on the Amazon page are WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Totally clears up acne like the expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> I use it at least once - sometimes twice - a day and still no problems with over-dryness.</li>
            <li> Any product I&#x27;m considering AUTOMATICALLY gets at least a trial purchase if they don&#x27;t test on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I definitely would still recommend this for acne sufferers and makeup wearers because you don&#x27;t have to buy a stupid makeup remover and then also buy an acne cleanser.</li>
            <li> Which has me really confused</li>
            <li> weird</li>
            <li> It has a wrong directions and information on the product.</li>
            <li> Afraid to try because I received acne control gel cleanser</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really annoying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed with the cleanser that was sent to me by the seller Etailz.</li>
            <li> When my kids were going thru those terrible teens</li>
            <li> What I think is awful is the packaging.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE this whole line!!! I&#x27;ve tried many other brands ( pro-active, Murad, clean and clear, dove, burts bees, kiss my face and many others)  to gain &amp;#34;control&amp;#34; of my skin and this one actually WORKS! It&#x27;s very budget friendly, as you only need a little. Lathers nicely and smells wonderful! My skin is clear and so soft! Try it, buy it, love it...I really think you will.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with acne for about 15 years. I have tried every product that comes on the TV, all the expensive beauty counter products and this has worked better and faster than anyone of those. I use the pore scrub about 3 days a week before washing with this cleanser. I have less large/ deep blemishes and few and far between little ones when normally I have lots. I have also started taking Primrose as a supplement and those 3 together are a blessing! Love this product!</li>
            <li> Cleared up my skin after 2 uses! I love that is is natural too.</li>
            <li> When I opened it out of the package, it appeared to be a defective product. It had obvious finger prints on it, it was sticky, and part of the cap that attached to the product was broken. It came in a plastic bag but I think someone had use it before and returned it back to the seller who is trying to pass it off as an unused product by putting it in a plastic bag. To make matters worst, when I squeezed all of the air out of the tube, the cleanser appeared to be only half full. The cleanser should not be half empty when I haven&#x27;t even used it yet because I have bought this cleanser in the store before and the tube was completely filled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed with the cleanser that was sent to me by the seller Etailz.</li>
            <li> This face wash cleans off makeup like no other! I hated having to use two different cleansers (one for makeup to get that junk off and the other to help clear my acne, oh plus a scrub some nights). Another thing I liked about it was that it seemed to minimize the appearance of my acne scars, weird but I&#x27;m not complaining. The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it full stars was because it didn&#x27;t seem to help that much with my acne. I definitely would still recommend this for acne sufferers and makeup wearers because you don&#x27;t have to buy a stupid makeup remover and then also buy an acne cleanser. It still saves you process time and also helps a bit with the appearance of acne scars.</li>
            <li> The yes to websites states the direction as, Squeeze a dollop into hands and lather with warm water. Rinse. Do a cheesy move in front of the mirror, as you admire your clear skin. So you are not to leave this on you face to dry. I love this product works so well and leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed. ....it&#x27;s a keeper</li>
            <li> Afraid to try because I received acne control gel cleanser but it has a different packaging label in the back. It has a wrong directions and information on the product. I know because of the picture in amazon is different from what i received. It&#x27;s really annoying.</li>
            <li> This is the exact kind of cleanser my oily acne-prone skin needs in the hot August summer of the south.</li>
            <li> I bought this on accident thinking it was the exfoliating scrub. It is still a good wash and the price seems to be decent on Amazon. I prefer the exfoliating version, but will use this one up.</li>
            <li> When my kids were going thru those terrible teens I had them use Burts Bees tomato products with fantastic results. Now 15 yrs. later I have grandchildren, and discovered the Yes to Tomatoes. It does a wonderful job of clearing up &amp; preventing breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have very oily/acne prone skin. This product is the only face wash I have found that helps keep my skin clear without drying me out.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite cleanser. It smells GREAT. And better yet, it works.</li>
            <li> My skin broke out in a rash,  I was bummed. : / Also the directions make it sound like a leave on  treatment, not a face wash.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  No, doesn&#x27;t smell like tomatoes but I think the smell is very fresh (some people do not, from what I can see in the reviews).  What I think is awful is the packaging.  Last night, I didn&#x27;t get the cap down tight enough.  This morning, I had gel all over my shelf (ie, it crept out of the bottom of the Tomatoes bottle and underneath all of my other bottles and tubes -- took 20 minutes to clean).  I lost 1/3 of the bottle of product.  When a product is something that can so easily run out, why would you put the opening on the bottom of the container?  This is not lotion...it is a runny gel, and one misstep creates a soapy, viscous nightmare.  On my last bottle, the cap broke.....that, too, created a perilous situation.  Please create a proper bottle with closure on the top and I will gladly change my review to 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I phoned the company and the Customer Service department was very accommodating.  They are sending me a new tube to rectify the situation.  So, I will give this 4 stars (rather than 3).....and when that bottle changes someday, I will give it five.  Really like the product and the people too.  Just needs an improved container.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am no longer able to use this product. I used to use it all the time, however since getting older and a shift in my PH balance it doesn&#x27;t work for me anymore.</li>
            <li> I think it works, but who knows?</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get past the smell.  It has a STRONG floral perfume smell that to me is an &amp;#34;old lady perfume&amp;#34; smell.  I bought this for myself and my son, but we can&#x27;t stand the fragrance.</li>
            <li> love this keeps my face clean without making it too dry.</li>
            <li> works so well for my post-baby acne! it makes my skin soft and clean and doesn&#x27;t overdry. I use it with the entire Yes To Tomatoes line, and it has reduced my breakouts and helped to fade some old acne marks. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Better than anything else I have tried</li>
            <li> First, I want to just say that this is not the cleanser I expected. When you say cleanser, I think of some kind of facial scrub/cream that you spread on your face and then wash off - it often removes makeup as well. I&#x27;m not sure why this is marketed as a cleanser, and in fact, the directions to use this on the Amazon page are WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual directions:&lt;br /&gt;Clean the skin thoroughly before applying this product. Cover the entire affected area with a thin layer one to three times daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, you never wash this off. You are applying this product to your face/acne and then letting it sit there and dry. If you&#x27;re familiar with Proactiv&#x27;s 3-step system, this is like the toner step that you use after washing the actual cleanser off your skin. The consistency of this Yes to Tomatoes products is kind of like a watery gel. You spread it across your face after washing and then apply whatever else is in your normal routine (e.g., the [[ASIN:B004NG0QJ2 Yes To Tomatoes Acne Treatment Spot Stick, 0.5 Fluid Ounce]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I give this product 5 stars because it WORKS. After a few days of applying this to my face twice a day (once in the morning, once at night), it started to control my acne. I was having some acne on my forehead that spawned more acne in a never-ending cycle. This helped me break the cycle and a little after a week I started using it, my acne has pretty much cleared up. I use this in conjunction with the Acne Treatment Spot Stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are actually looking for a cleanser from Yes to Tomatoes, then I think you want the [[ASIN:B004NFYU8Q Yes To Tomatoes Clear Skin Deep Pore Scrub, 4 Ounce]]. This is more like a cleanser (actual scrub that you then wash off). I haven&#x27;t tested the scrub with makeup removal yet, however. I just wanted to post this first review of the Gel Cleanser to clear up the confusion since many of the other reviews seem to treat this particular product as an actual cleanser and are a bit misleading.</li>
            <li> this \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product contains Propanediol which is another name for Propylene Glycol .Yes, Antifreeze. Shame on Yes. Some of Yes products are good - not this one. Need to scrutinize the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I just started using the Yes to Tomatoes gel cleanser. It smells nice (I would have loved for it to smell like tomatoes, but it doesn&#x27;t). I have combination-oily sensitive skin and most non-oil cleansers are too harsh for me. This one has the acne fighting acid, but doesn&#x27;t trigger my eczema. I use it at least once - sometimes twice - a day and still no problems with over-dryness. It goes on feeling nice and thick, but lathers and rinses off without any problem (another problem I&#x27;ve had with harsher soaps and face washes, since most soap residue makes me break out in hives).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging and instructions are quirky and fun, and I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to others with combination or oily faces!</li>
            <li> Love this to control my acne. I also love tomatoes. I wonder if anyone has a product made from hot peppers.</li>
            <li> I very rarely review anything but I had to review this. This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve struggled with acne since I was about 12 years old. And I&#x27;ve tried everything! Prescription medication to every otc product there is. I have only been using this about 3 days and have already noticed a big change in the size of my pores, skin tone, &amp; breakouts. While I still have a couple of breakout spots, after using this cleanser the redness is dramatically less and easily covered. And even though my skin is very oily, a lot of other products are really harsh &amp; dry my skin out where it&#x27;s flaky..but not this one! I am so please with this I&#x27;m about to order all of the yes to tomatoes line!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I actually purchased it on accident. I thought I was buying the face scrub, but ended up grabbing the gel cleanser. It smells amazing and it makes your skin super smooth. I noticed an improvement in my acne in just one use and I love that it is more natural than most facial products. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My kids&#x27; faces (and backs and shoulders--they use it in the shower, too) are clearer than they&#x27;ve ever been, all with no weird carcinogenic chemicals, and NO ANIMAL TESTING!  Any product I&#x27;m considering AUTOMATICALLY gets at least a trial purchase if they don&#x27;t test on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This whole company is cruelty-free, and this Yes to Tomatoes cleanser works better than anything we&#x27;ve used.  AND it smells amazing.  I sometimes wash my hands with it just so I can sniff them, no joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Win, win, win.  A trial that turned into one of our favorite products.  Got it coming two a month on Sub and Save.</li>
            <li> When you squeeze some out, you get more than you want. I&#x27;m finding that its a little watery. It&#x27;s also very grainy.  I know it&#x27;s suppose to be because its a scrub but you need to rinse your face REALLY when to get all the grainy pieces off.  As far as keeping my face clear, I haven&#x27;t notice it making a big difference. I&#x27;m still getting break outs here and there.  I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again. I love their other products though.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It clears my skin quickly, tightens my pores, and makes my skin glow.  I wish that I had found it sooner!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this product. But I was totally bummed that it would not get sudsy enough for me. It doesn&#x27;t lather at all, so it&#x27;s a little odd to wash my face with.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser - I always used to use a load of different products to clean my skin but this one works a treat all by itself! Gives that slightly tingly feeling so you know its working, and tightens my skin in a good way! Really happy, great before the moisturiser.</li>
            <li> got this for my girlfriend, she loves it, though I think as a cleanser, a simple exfoliator towel and some coconut oil would do the same as this stuff.</li>
            <li> Iris is correct...i bought this stuff..the back of it says to thoroughly clean face first than apply this product to a clean face. Which has me really confused cause it says its a cleanser...but no directions on the bottle to use it as one. But than when you go to their website it says to squeeze a dallop out and cleanse..so i use it both ways lol AND&lt;br /&gt;Propanediol is not anti freeze...seriously..why are you trying to deter people from buying a product when you have no clue about science.&lt;br /&gt;but about the actual effects...i dont think i like this &amp;#34;cleanser&amp;#34; i hsve combinstion skin, i have grt a.n oily t zone. I was having multipal breakouts to something i used so i thought id try thisnto clesr them up. This stuff stings,smd leaves my face really dry. And may hsve even caused.dome.cystic break outs..im sticking with my neutrogena anti blemish anti wrinkle wash and pore refining toner.. this stuff isnt worth it to me.</li>
            <li> a great product!!!! I will continue to use it forever. I am an adult with acne, rosacea. This product allowed me to go off antibiotics, which I was on for many years. Whatever is in it , kills the bacteria that causes acne. Thank you, for inventing this product!</li>
            <li> Love this face wash so much! Totally clears up acne like the expensive stuff.</li>
