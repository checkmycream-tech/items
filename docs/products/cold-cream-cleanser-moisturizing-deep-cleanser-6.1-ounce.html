            <li>It&#x27;s 3:21am, so I need to get to bed, but I will do my best to provide the references I used in deciding how to treat them, and what to say here.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a great eye makeup remover!</li>
            <li>Pond&#x27;s is a great cleanser that&#x27;s why the company is still around.  </li>
            <li>still have good skin, so</li>
            <li>It also is a very nice moisturizer and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>AMAZING.</li>
            <li>AND I&#x27;M LOVING IT.</li>
            <li>Wonderful cream, makes your face feel so cleansed and soft</li>
            <li>I made a huge mistake by stopping to use this product!</li>
            <li>I love it, it is outstanding for a make-up remover.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>However, during the summer, I found that the moisturizer is too much on top of using the cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Love this cream.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s why I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Over all, this product is a proven cleanser that you will love once you try it.  </li>
            <li>Helps give me a softer face and the razor glides easily with it.</li>
            <li>It was very quick getting here.</li>
            <li>Easy on and easy off.</li>
            <li>I was happy with its mild smell and texture while making my skin feel really relaxed and clean before bed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it was factory sealed, and the cream looked like it was filled by hand.</li>
            <li>Just wish it had the original ingredients.</li>
            <li>Great cleanser for dry skin.</li>
            <li>and I have no energy to clean my face.</li>
            <li>Why don&#x27;t I get that old time favorite cleanser that I&#x27;ve used for so many years?  </li>
            <li>I got this for full face shaving.</li>
            <li>arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>But, my skin glows and looks and feels young and healthy.  </li>
            <li>If a beauty product has survived as long as Ponds has, then most of the time that means something! 2)</li>
            <li>Eyeliner and Mascara from any brand and any color just come right off with ease.</li>
            <li>This is a quality product, you just decide if it&#x27;s right for you and choose a size.</li>
            <li>They are most often found in the eyelashes, but apparently head out onto your skin to replicate and can cover 8 to 16 centimeters per hour during the night.</li>
            <li>This is, by far, the best bang for your buck especially if you tend towards dry or combination skin.  </li>
            <li>I can remove makeup, clean my face, enjoy the &amp;#34;aromatherapy,&amp;#34; and not have to use extra moisturizer when I&#x27;m finished.</li>
            <li>Definitely two thumbs up from me :)</li>
            <li>FIRST TIME I EVER TRIED IT</li>
            <li>I just turned 50 and am glad I went back to basics with Pond&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>LEAVES MY SKIN SO SOFT AND CLEAN.</li>
            <li>The cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>Thank goodness the company wasn&#x27;t overcome by the typical &amp;#34;New Coke&amp;#34; madness and has left this product the same wonderful thing that it has always been.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need that much moisture.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>made my skin very oily and made me break out.</li>
            <li>Thanks to a Facebook friend, I became reacquainted with the skin parasite Demodex.</li>
            <li>i really like it</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and is very moisturizing for my skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff takes off all my makeup, even my waterproof mascara, and is really moisturizing.</li>
            <li>really great for taking makeup off but definitely not for oily skin -- use only if your skin is dry.</li>
            <li>As someone else stated, this is a classic.  </li>
            <li>Item received quickly and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Highly fragrant but didn&#x27;t break out yet using for (1) week.</li>
            <li>Good at removing make up and only take a small amount to get the job done.</li>
            <li>So, I am using a different (OTC) moisturizer right now.  </li>
            <li>I started using it because my skin was always so dry and most cleansers made my skin feel tight and made my skin even more dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>My skin has been so much better since I started using the cold cream, I don&#x27;t use anything else :)</li>
            <li>Cold Cream is one the the most common treatments I have read about, and is safe in use in the eyelashes and safe to eyes.</li>
            <li>After cleaning my face, with special attention to all hair follicles, I then use a Sea Buckthorn moisturizer to provide a second, and lasting killing attack.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It removes makeup easily and leaves skin moisturized - a bargain, since the constant application and removal of makeup can be very rough on the skin.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin really soft and no need for me to moisturize at night.</li>
            <li>the only reason why this got any stars is because it really does remove make up well</li>
            <li>It just wasn&#x27;t the same ingredients stated which was the reason I bought it to begin with, however, arrived really well</li>
            <li>Just make sure the cotton pads have no more traces of make-up on it, so you avoid getting zits the next day or two.</li>
            <li>This cold cream is amazing!</li>
            <li>I have bounced and cringe when I think of how much money I have spent on skincare.</li>
            <li>Takes a full face of theatrical makeup off in seconds without hard scrubbing.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using the cold cream as a pre-bedtime ritual, it&#x27;s very soothing.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this for full face shaving. Helps give me a softer face and the razor glides easily with it. It hasn&#x27;t broken out my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it was factory sealed, and the cream looked like it was filled by hand. No cover on the cream when 1st opened</li>
            <li> I was happy with its mild smell and texture while making my skin feel really relaxed and clean before bed. Definitely two thumbs up from me :)</li>
            <li> I love it, it is outstanding for a make-up remover. Eyeliner and Mascara from any brand and any color just come right off with ease. And I have gotten a little in my eye when taking off the eyeliner and it doesn&#x27;t even hurt, but I&#x27;m not saying go ahead and rub it all over your eyes. If you accidentally get it in you don&#x27;t have to flip out.</li>
            <li> really great for taking makeup off but definitely not for oily skin -- use only if your skin is dry.</li>
            <li> Item received quickly and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This has lasted me about three months. It removes makeup easily and leaves skin moisturized - a bargain, since the constant application and removal of makeup can be very rough on the skin. This is a quality product, you just decide if it&#x27;s right for you and choose a size.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin feel.  It was very quick getting here.</li>
            <li> FIRST TIME I EVER TRIED IT AND I&#x27;M LOVING IT. LEAVES MY SKIN SO SOFT AND CLEAN.</li>
            <li> Cleans without dryness.  Thank you,</li>
            <li> As someone else stated, this is a classic.  I have gone through years and years of overpriced makeup removers, cleansers and moisturizers.  No more.  I finally got fed up with waiting around the counters in the local department store for those overly made up women to wait on me as if they were doing me a favor (at $30-40 a jar cleanser).  So, I stumbled across Pond&#x27;s on a &#x27;if you like this&#x27; recommendation.  Thank goodness!  This is, by far, the best bang for your buck especially if you tend towards dry or combination skin.  I bought this and the moisturizer.  However, during the summer, I found that the moisturizer is too much on top of using the cleanser.  I don&#x27;t need that much moisture.  So, I am using a different (OTC) moisturizer right now.  Come dry skin winter time, I know I will need the Pond&#x27;s Moisturizer, so I&#x27;ll pull it back out.  The cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.  I do, occasionally, have to wait a minute after use to put on my base makeup/foundation.  But, my skin glows and looks and feels young and healthy.  I just turned 50 and am glad I went back to basics with Pond&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try it and now I will adopt it! My friends, who never comment on such things, have asked, &amp;#34; What are you using on your face and where are your wrinkles?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Excellent makeup remover</li>
            <li> Love this cream. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> made my skin very oily and made me break out. It didnt even remove make up well</li>
            <li> arrived quickly.  Love this product</li>
            <li> Highly fragrant but didn&#x27;t break out yet using for (1) week.</li>
            <li> Thanks to a Facebook friend, I became reacquainted with the skin parasite Demodex. D. folliculorum and D. brevis are the mites specific to humans. They are most often found in the eyelashes, but apparently head out onto your skin to replicate and can cover 8 to 16 centimeters per hour during the night. They have been implicated in conditions known as demodicosis or Demodex mite bite, characterised by itching, inflammation and other skin disorders. Blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelids) can also be caused by Demodex mites.  The total lifespan of a Demodex mite is several weeks. The dead mites decompose inside the hair follicles or sebaceous glands. Recent research has indicated that the common skin malady rosacea may be caused by the decomposing mites,[3] possibly due to the bacterium Bacillus oleronius found in their bodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what does that have to do with Cold Cream? Cold Cream is one the the most common treatments I have read about, and is safe in use in the eyelashes and safe to eyes. Tea Tree Oil literally melts these things, but you should never use it on eyelashes as it can irreversibly damage the eyes. As a man, I am not using the Cold Cream to remove makeup or the like, but rather as a two part attack. After cleaning my face, with special attention to all hair follicles, I then use a Sea Buckthorn moisturizer to provide a second, and lasting killing attack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are your eyebrows and eyelids itching? LOL! Even my mustache and beard itch just thinking about these critters. It&#x27;s 3:21am, so I need to get to bed, but I will do my best to provide the references I used in deciding how to treat them, and what to say here.</li>
            <li> i really like it and i would buy again!!</li>
            <li> Easy on and easy off. Makes my skin really soft and no need for me to moisturize at night. Good at removing make up and only take a small amount to get the job done.</li>
            <li> the only reason why this got any stars is because it really does remove make up well but on the days that i dont wear make i dont use this but it leaves me with a dark spot on my skin and it wont fade for the longest time but if your just stop washing your face completely the dark spot will start to peel just bad</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and never want to change. It cleans well&lt;br /&gt;and is very moisturizing for my skin.</li>
            <li> Pond&#x27;s is a great cleanser that&#x27;s why the company is still around.  I still remember the time when I used to use it to remove my make-up after a long day at work.  I was so tired that I just apply it to my face, wipe it off and apply it again and wipe it off again with cotton pads.  But, this I use in emergencies, when I am tired and I have no energy to clean my face. And now, it came back to me.  Why don&#x27;t I get that old time favorite cleanser that I&#x27;ve used for so many years?  So here we are!  The plus side is, it moisturizes the skin as well, that&#x27;s why I love this cleanser. Just make sure the cotton pads have no more traces of make-up on it, so you avoid getting zits the next day or two. Over all, this product is a proven cleanser that you will love once you try it.  I&#x27;m still using it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful cream, makes your face feel so cleansed and soft plus it smells divine.</li>
            <li> I like this cold cream because it easily removes my makeup. It also is a very nice moisturizer and has a nice scent. If some accidently gets in your eye it will not hurt but it will make your vision a little foggy for a short period of time. It does remove make-up nicely, but it sometimes has a harder time with water-proof mascara, but with a little rubbing even the worst of it will come off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for so long and it&#x27;s a great eye makeup remover!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using cold cream for a while now. I started using it because my skin was always so dry and most cleansers made my skin feel tight and made my skin even more dry and flaky. This stuff takes off all my makeup, even my waterproof mascara, and is really moisturizing. My skin has been so much better since I started using the cold cream, I don&#x27;t use anything else :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream for 40+ years -- every evening and every morning.  I&#x27;m 68 still have good skin, so I will certainly continue using Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream!</li>
            <li> I made a huge mistake by stopping to use this product! This is an amazing product. 1) If a beauty product has survived as long as Ponds has, then most of the time that means something! 2) When I have people from all walks of life telling me that this will not only improve my skin but also will help my future skincare, I also have a tendency to listen. I have bounced and cringe when I think of how much money I have spent on skincare. This cold cream is amazing! I am 25 with acne/dry prone skin. This has not only helped with my acne but it has also helped with my severe skin dryness. I don&#x27;t believe every skin care product works for everyone. However if you have an issue with dryness or even combination skin, I recommend at least trying this product. And it is so inexpensive!</li>
            <li> Takes a full face of theatrical makeup off in seconds without hard scrubbing. AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This is the same Pond&#x27;s cold cream I remember from my childhood - texture, fragrance, everything. Thank goodness the company wasn&#x27;t overcome by the typical &amp;#34;New Coke&amp;#34; madness and has left this product the same wonderful thing that it has always been. I can remove makeup, clean my face, enjoy the &amp;#34;aromatherapy,&amp;#34; and not have to use extra moisturizer when I&#x27;m finished. I enjoy using the cold cream as a pre-bedtime ritual, it&#x27;s very soothing.</li>
            <li> It just wasn&#x27;t the same ingredients stated which was the reason I bought it to begin with, however, arrived really well and after all it is a cream that still works. Just wish it had the original ingredients.</li>
