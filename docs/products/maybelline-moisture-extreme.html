            <li>This glossy, silky lipstick in Silver Plum is the perfect shade for me.  </li>
            <li>The case is also attractive.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful lipstick and it&#x27;s a tragedy that it is no longer available in stores.  </li>
            <li>I love the silky feel of the lipstick as well as the beautiful color.</li>
            <li>I also love Maybelline mascara, still love Great Lash.</li>
            <li>&quot; is what I would call a purple-y neutral--a rare find!!!  </li>
            <li>I love Maybelline lipstick.</li>
            <li>I might buy more Maybelline cosmetics if there were.</li>
            <li>I was able to stock up.</li>
            <li>that you look as though you have dragged a purple magic marker across your lips.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite lipstick for spring and summer.  </li>
            <li>When worn with a brown or nude lipliner it looks even better.  </li>

            <li>So glad this is still available on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>So pleased I found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Lovely color for just about any skin tone.  </li>
            <li>My four daughter also love this color.  </li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>This is my favorite color from Maybelline</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I can still get it through here.</li>
            <li>Orangey lipcolors don&#x27;t look good with predominantly purpleattire or with gem-tone cool colors such as emerald greens or brilliant sapphire blues.</li>
            <li>Just what I have come to expect from this particular lipstick - a great colour with moisturising qualities.  </li>
            <li>however everything else was good and exactly as advertised and well packed.</li>
            <li>Not only did I find it on Amazon, but also the price was very good.</li>
            <li>Easy, easy, easy!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product was as described and shipped very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Plum\\&quot; is a part of, is a discontinued product line--but thankfully still available on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t available in the stores anymore.  </li>
            <li>It has a sweet ate to it.</li>
            <li>Its consistency is a nice balance between sheer and creamy.  </li>
            <li>of orange-y or peach-y shades are available from multiple manufacturers, including most of the lipcolors billed as \\&quot;neutrals.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I love other shades too, but this is and has been my favorite shade.</li>
            <li>Very creamy, and rich on the lips.  </li>
            <li>It will look like your lips, only better--a little more purple-y than your lips would be (for just a hint of magic).  :)</li>
            <li>Many of their lipsticks don&#x27;t have the extra moisture feature.  </li>
            <li>The color has a pretty frosted nature to it as well.  </li>
            <li>so your lips aren&#x27;t dried out, glides on well and provides good coverage.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;And of course the shimmery quality, also, helps diffract light in all directions, further concealing chapped or flaky areas of skin on your lips.</li>
            <li>Its a straight out pinkberry color.</li>
            <li>I really like this lipstick</li>
            <li>My favorite Mabelline Moisture Extreme lipstick.  </li>
            <li>Shimmer comes into and goes out of fashion, but it sure makes a lipstick more flattering to your lips, especially if they are dry and/or deeply</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy and sheer, and stays fresh looking.  </li>
            <li>live (the existing supplies of) Maybelline Moisture Extreme--and</li>
            <li>Having just a bit of brown in it, it is closer to the natural color of your lips.  </li>
            <li>with all the lipcolors in the Moisture Extreme product line, \\&quot;Silver Plum\\&quot; glides on smoothly (because of the moisturizers in the formula) and is sheer enough that you don&#x27;t have to have a high level of skill or a lot of time on your hands to get it artfully applied.</li>
            <li>Just light enough, not to dark.  </li>
            <li>You can apply just one coat for sheer coverage, if you like, or you can apply several coats, say, to better conceal chapped or uneven skin on your lips.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ve a major clean-up operation on your</li>

            <li> Maybelline Moisture Extreme, the product line \\&quot;Silver</li>
            <li> As other reviewers mentioned, it has lots of moisturizers in it</li>

            <li> I love Maybelline lipstick. I just wish I could still find silver plum shade in store. I love other shades too, but this is and has been my favorite shade. I also love Maybelline mascara, still love Great Lash. I wish there were coupons for Maybelline cosmetics though. I might buy more Maybelline cosmetics if there were.</li>
            <li> My wife was looking for this specific shade. Not only did I find it on Amazon, but also the price was very good.</li>
            <li> This glossy, silky lipstick in Silver Plum is the perfect shade for me.  It&#x27;s creamy and sheer, and stays fresh looking.  Unfortunately it appears it has been discontinued, but thanks to Amazon &amp; their partners I was able to stock up.</li>
            <li> Maybelline Moisture Extreme, the product line \\&quot;Silver Plum\\&quot; is a part of, is a discontinued product line--but thankfully still available on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all the lipcolors in the Moisture Extreme product line, \\&quot;Silver Plum\\&quot; glides on smoothly (because of the moisturizers in the formula) and is sheer enough that you don&#x27;t have to have a high level of skill or a lot of time on your hands to get it artfully applied. You can apply it on the fly--when you&#x27;ve got only a few seconds to spare and your lips will instantly look improved. You can apply just one coat for sheer coverage, if you like, or you can apply several coats, say, to better conceal chapped or uneven skin on your lips.  (This is to say that it&#x27;s not so sheer that you can&#x27;t get coverage from it, if you want coverage. Its consistency is a nice balance between sheer and creamy.  Easy, easy, easy!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course the shimmery quality, also, helps diffract light in all directions, further concealing chapped or flaky areas of skin on your lips. Shimmer comes into and goes out of fashion, but it sure makes a lipstick more flattering to your lips, especially if they are dry and/or deeply lined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Silver Plum\\&quot; color is a browned-down purple.  That is, it&#x27;s not so, \\&quot;HEY! PURPLE!\\&quot; that you look as though you have dragged a purple magic marker across your lips.  Having just a bit of brown in it, it is closer to the natural color of your lips.  But it&#x27;s purple enough that you will look put-together wearing this lipcolor with a purple blouse/dress.  Purple-y lipcolors are tough to find, in my experience!!! This is one of the few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Lots of orange-y or peach-y shades are available from multiple manufacturers, including most of the lipcolors billed as \\&quot;neutrals.\\&quot;  But I get tired of orange all the time. I resent how 99% of the \\&quot;neutrals\\&quot; are orange-y and the fact there are almost no *purple-y* neutrals on the market. Orangey lipcolors don&#x27;t look good with predominantly purpleattire or with gem-tone cool colors such as emerald greens or brilliant sapphire blues. And high intensity reds--also widely available--are so technical to apply; one little slip and you&#x27;ve a major clean-up operation on your hands.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybelline&#x27;s \\&quot;Silver Plum\\&quot; is what I would call a purple-y neutral--a rare find!!!  It will look like your lips, only better--a little more purple-y than your lips would be (for just a hint of magic).  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long live (the existing supplies of) Maybelline Moisture Extreme--and especially \\&quot;Silver Plum.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Wish they didn&#x27;t stop making this</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom she loves it</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lipstick for spring and summer.  When worn with a brown or nude lipliner it looks even better.  Couldn&#x27;t find it in the drugstores anymore thank godness for amazon.</li>
            <li> My favorite Mabelline Moisture Extreme lipstick.  Many of their lipsticks don&#x27;t have the extra moisture feature.  I was very sorry to see that&lt;br /&gt;they are no longer making this lipstick.  I&#x27;ve purchased a few others by Mabelline but the color and moisture factor are not as satisfying to me.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that you&#x27;ve asked $20.00 for one tube of an old lipstick.  I think that&#x27;s asking a lot for a lipstick that&#x27;s been around for a long time.</li>

            <li> Just what I have come to expect from this particular lipstick - a great colour with moisturising qualities.  WHY did they discontinue it???  So pleased I found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> There is nothing plum OR silver about this lipstick. Nor does it come close to matching the color of the lipstick in the photo. Its a straight out pinkberry color. Yuck. So I looked on the bottom of the tube thinking they may have sent me the color one by mistake. Nope, it says Silver Plum. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Lovely color for just about any skin tone.  Very creamy, and rich on the lips.  Just light enough, not to dark.  Can be worn by any age.  My four daughter also love this color.  Please do not discontinue this color!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this from Amazon for a least a year. However, it is a different seller now, and the price is too expensive for Maybelline. I really like this lipstick so I purchased it anyway. However, it is not the same color as before. It&#x27;s lighter without the plum look to it.</li>
            <li> Product was as described and shipped very quickly.  I love Maybelline Moisture extreme and silver plum is a difficult color to find.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite color from Maybelline and it isn&#x27;t available in the stores anymore.  I&#x27;m glad I can still get it through here.</li>
