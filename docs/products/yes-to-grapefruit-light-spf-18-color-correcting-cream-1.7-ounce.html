            <li>and it&#x27;s always great to find a product I can use without irritation.</li>
            <li>Love it on my porcelain skin!!</li>
            <li>But its amazing stuff!</li>
            <li>Who can say a glow doesn&#x27;t look good?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m upset that Burlington is selling expires products and this product would of been good</li>
            <li>I have ivory skin and the fair color cream did not match my skin at all</li>
            <li>I am searching for a good, cruelty-free bb or cc cream.  </li>
            <li>It is very refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love this brand and Amazon has great prices on the products.  </li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it contains a good dose of zinc which is also helpful for psoriasis and adds a nice shimmer to you skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, feels great on your skin, and it has SPF in it.  </li>
            <li>My face looks flawless and with a natural sun-kissed glow.  </li>
            <li>In my quest to use more natural products I chucked my Covergirl BB cream in favor of this CC cream and am so happy I did!</li>
            <li>This and my mineral powder does just fine for me, and the color correcting is a dream!</li>
            <li>This one has a very light grapefruit scent that I like, and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or make my oil-prone skin look greasy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>The smell is also overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really lovely.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>what upsets me the most is I bought it for 5.99 at Burlington coat factory.</li>
            <li>It has okay coverage for tan skin.</li>
            <li>I like this, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>This is nothing more than a tinted moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t blend well and sits on top of your skin.  </li>
            <li>The combination of these two products makes my skin tone much more even.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the smell is overwhelming at all, I find it refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love all of the Yes products and was eager to try this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And of course if it&#x27;s helping fight lines and anti-aging then fantastic!</li>
            <li>This is even better.  </li>
            <li>I love the grapefuit peel extract smell.</li>
            <li>I did find that it made my face more oily throughout the day</li>
            <li>I like it but don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>I usually top this with a finishing powder.  </li>
            <li>I love this, and trust me</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that this has had any impact on fine lines, but I don&#x27;t have many of those (yet) to improve on.  </li>
            <li>This goes on easily, and very cleanly so It doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>and I could not believe that it just left a luminous glow that is so beautiful and healthy look to my face.</li>
            <li>This CC cream has evened out my skin-tone and makes my skin look so nice and fresh.  </li>
            <li>For reference, I have very fair and sensitive skin, and I have combination/oily skin but rarely have pimples.  </li>
            <li>: lightweight, dewy finish, easy to apply</li>
            <li>The consistency was creamy and it was easy to blend -</li>
            <li>Strong grapefruit aroma</li>
            <li>This CC cream helps blend away the red nicely and has good staying power.  </li>
            <li>It might work if you have beautiful teenaged skin, but I&#x27;m in my mid-30s, and there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d wear this in public.  </li>
            <li>, I was told I looked like I had a light tan and had been out in the sun (not a bad thing!).  </li>
            <li>All in all a worthy buy!</li>
            <li>I normally use a medium-beige color foundation, but I use this CC cream in &#x27;light&#x27; and it&#x27;s a near perfect match for my skin, so</li>
            <li>And I can envision myself using it for the rest of my life, bar any huge ingredient or price changes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>It has a great light scent and it&#x27;s moisturizing enough.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and your skin just drinks it up.  </li>
            <li>Light and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I do wish it had more coverage as this is very sheer, but it&#x27;s perfect for day-to-day use when I just want to even out my skin tone a bit for a natural look along with my sun protection, and not have to be concerned with what chemicals I&#x27;m putting on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Should not have been available for sale so close to expiration date.</li>
            <li>It was cheap and</li>
            <li>It was light-medium and Ithought it probably would be too light on my skin but for some reason I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>It is a light coverage</li>
            <li>The coverage on this CC cream is light.  </li>
            <li>All in all - a great product that I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use!  </li>
            <li>Amazingly, it does NOT make me a grease-factory with my otherwise very oily skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin tone looks a lot more even, and actually looks really good now without makeup.</li>
            <li>This has worked great for a natural and fresh look that lasts through my 12+ hour work shifts at the hospital.  </li>
            <li>pump is very easy and functional, not messy, and the scent is light and lovely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d imagine that for anyone with very fair skin it&#x27;ll be a bit too dark.</li>
            <li>it is really refreshing and gives a nice sheer coverage.</li>
            <li>It has a powerful smell, so if you don&#x27;t like strong smells, don&#x27;t purchase.  </li>
            <li>Clean application that goes on smoothly, light coverage that blends into skin and does not clog pores, and fresh scent that is subdued yet uplifting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and softened my skin, and the skin under my eyes looks better.  </li>
            <li>A better scent would be much appreciated.  </li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing a full face of makeup</li>
            <li>A CC cream is not meant to give you full coverage, or hide all imperfections.  </li>
            <li>If you want full or medium coverage, don&#x27;t purchase this.  </li>
            <li>The citrusy smell on this does seem pretty strong when I put the cream on my beauty blending tool, but once I start applying it to my face</li>
            <li>It is very shear which is nice because most days I don’t wear makeup, I&#x27;ve also noticed that its not streaky which is also a major plus.</li>
            <li>So perhaps these kind of items aren&#x27;t checked very closely when it comes to that, but thankfully my order from Amazon was well within its date, not to mention a whole lot cheaper than any that I have seen in stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure some grapefruit essential oils are in the extract creating the lovely smell.</li>
            <li>The product overall is very affordable and smells great.</li>
            <li>This also gives broad spectrum SPF coverage, which is a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li>I really like this CC cream, its nice and light and isn’t causing any major problems for my acne prone/ combination skin.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to replace my traditional foundations, creams, and moisturizers for more natural products, and this one is the latest HIT!  </li>
            <li>For the price, I think it&#x27;s very much worth it.</li>
            <li>While wearing this my skin tone looks smoother and more clear.  </li>
            <li>I prefer a more natural look, and that&#x27;s what I get from this.  </li>
            <li>It felt lightweight and left a nice, dewy finish.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s going up against many, many products (natural, high-end, drug store, you name it!), and so far it&#x27;s the first thing I reach for in my makeup routine.  </li>
            <li>I was not disappointed and will continue to order more in the future.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday because it just goes on so well and smells so good and clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and need some sunscreen when I go makeup free (my usual makeup has an SPF)</li>
            <li>I am very fair-skinned (in makeup terms, I always choose the lightest shade of foundation); the lightly tinted (lightest shade available) is a good shade for me, mixed with an equal part of the (untinted)</li>
            <li>It dispensing too much so it is too easy to apply too much of the product.</li>
            <li>very light and l like the spf for daily use.</li>
            <li>I bought this the first time at a drug store.  </li>
            <li>The results have been nothing short of phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>I wish it had higher SPF</li>
            <li>Pretty coverage, but broke out my face.</li>
            <li>I love using this under my foundation for extra coverage with some spf.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s meant to even out skin tone while looking light and natural.  </li>
            <li>It would be best suited for someone with very little oily skin or even dry skin.</li>
            <li>I tend to breakout from certain products but haven&#x27;t from this.</li>
            <li>It blends in smoothly and has decent sun protection with SPF 18 broad spectrum.</li>
            <li>The light to medium should only be used by very tan skinned people.</li>
            <li>During winter, I sometimes double it up with another light moisturizer when needed.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this, but it doesn&#x27;t make the cut.  </li>
            <li>To Grapefruit Correct and Repair CC Cream SPF 18 (lightly tinted) for several months now.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much and it just glides on.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>it dries into your skin very quickly , feels like a moisturizer until you blend it in, then it&#x27;s just dry feeling.</li>
            <li>I feel the coverage is very similar, I don&#x27;t expect full coverage from a tinted moisturizer nor do I want it.</li>
            <li>My main concerns were that I had never found a product with sunscreen that a) didn&#x27;t burn my eyes by the end of the day,</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is so light and creamy and just sinks into your skin</li>
            <li>only SPF 18, strong scent, &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; is not light enough for the very fair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the bottle, I noticed the scent was strong and lingered for awhile; but my husband said he didn&#x27;t notice it, even up close.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this (along with the cucumber milk wash, cucumber moisturizer, cucumber night cream and blueberry under eye lotion) for a few years and can&#x27;t find anything that I like better for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup, so your results may vary if you try to apply makeup on top of this.  </li>
            <li>It is totally different from makeup - get ready to toss your makeup!  </li>
            <li>I put this on first, all over, then do spot-concealing over problem-areas with my regular concealer.  </li>
            <li>I tried varying amounts, more and less blending, applying when in natural light, and even diluting with plain moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My skin looks dewey, fresh, and natural all day long...</li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;ll add in a light layer of foundation around my eyes/nose/mouth to even things out, then dust a little setting powder over before my blush/bronzer/whatever.  </li>
            <li>- it is clear, so you can see how much product is left.  </li>
            <li>And it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell like a stereotypical sunscreen you&#x27;d buy at the drugstore, which is great for me.  </li>
            <li>i like that it is a natural product.</li>
            <li>This is my go-to CC cream so far.</li>
            <li>I also appreciate the natural ingredients, namely extracts and oils.  </li>
            <li>I plan to use the lightly tinted for everyday use, and the light-medium for summertime.  </li>
            <li>However, this is not a dealbreaker for me, as the scent disappears completely after about 15-20min from application.  </li>
            <li>So far I have not had this problem with the Yes</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice it, and I&#x27;m usually fairly sensitive to scents.  </li>
            <li>I bought the light to medium color, which is entirely too dark and orange.</li>
            <li>I wear separate broad spectrum SPF 50 daily, but for those who don&#x27;t have SPF as part of their daily ritual this could serve as a decent stand in.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, the sheer neutral coverage is what I love about it --- good-for-your-skin benefits along with subtle tint to even things out a bit.  </li>
            <li>Always on the prowl for natural skin care products, I spotted this at my local supermarket and grabbed it.  </li>
            <li>It is quickly absorbed and does not feel heavy, so there is no chance for the product to creep into my eyes throughout the day, and I have had zero problems with any eye irritation.    </li>
            <li>They also have a mattifying effect &#x3D; much less oily face, which lasts almost the whole day!   </li>
            <li>it looks very natural and it&#x27;s not very greasy.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and after showering in the morning, my skin often is pink bordering on red.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pale and typically wear the lightest or second lightest shade of foundation available in a line.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I do wish it had more coverage as this is very sheer, but it&#x27;s perfect for day-to-day use when I just want to even out my skin tone a bit for a natural look along with my sun protection, and not have to be concerned with what chemicals I&#x27;m putting on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Should not have been available for sale so close to expiration date.</li>
            <li> It was cheap and</li>
            <li> It was light-medium and Ithought it probably would be too light on my skin but for some reason I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> It is a light coverage</li>
            <li> The coverage on this CC cream is light.  </li>
            <li> All in all - a great product that I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use!  </li>
            <li> Amazingly, it does NOT make me a grease-factory with my otherwise very oily skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin tone looks a lot more even, and actually looks really good now without makeup.</li>
            <li> This has worked great for a natural and fresh look that lasts through my 12+ hour work shifts at the hospital.  </li>
            <li> pump is very easy and functional, not messy, and the scent is light and lovely.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d imagine that for anyone with very fair skin it&#x27;ll be a bit too dark.</li>
            <li> it is really refreshing and gives a nice sheer coverage.</li>
            <li> It has a powerful smell, so if you don&#x27;t like strong smells, don&#x27;t purchase.  </li>
            <li> Clean application that goes on smoothly, light coverage that blends into skin and does not clog pores, and fresh scent that is subdued yet uplifting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and softened my skin, and the skin under my eyes looks better.  </li>
            <li> A better scent would be much appreciated.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing a full face of makeup</li>
            <li> A CC cream is not meant to give you full coverage, or hide all imperfections.  </li>
            <li> If you want full or medium coverage, don&#x27;t purchase this.  </li>
            <li> The citrusy smell on this does seem pretty strong when I put the cream on my beauty blending tool, but once I start applying it to my face</li>
            <li> It is very shear which is nice because most days I don’t wear makeup, I&#x27;ve also noticed that its not streaky which is also a major plus.</li>
            <li> So perhaps these kind of items aren&#x27;t checked very closely when it comes to that, but thankfully my order from Amazon was well within its date, not to mention a whole lot cheaper than any that I have seen in stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure some grapefruit essential oils are in the extract creating the lovely smell.</li>
            <li> The product overall is very affordable and smells great.</li>
            <li> This also gives broad spectrum SPF coverage, which is a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li> I really like this CC cream, its nice and light and isn’t causing any major problems for my acne prone/ combination skin.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to replace my traditional foundations, creams, and moisturizers for more natural products, and this one is the latest HIT!  </li>
            <li> For the price, I think it&#x27;s very much worth it.</li>
            <li> While wearing this my skin tone looks smoother and more clear.  </li>
            <li> I prefer a more natural look, and that&#x27;s what I get from this.  </li>
            <li> It felt lightweight and left a nice, dewy finish.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s going up against many, many products (natural, high-end, drug store, you name it!), and so far it&#x27;s the first thing I reach for in my makeup routine.  </li>
            <li> I was not disappointed and will continue to order more in the future.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday because it just goes on so well and smells so good and clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned and need some sunscreen when I go makeup free (my usual makeup has an SPF)</li>
            <li> I am very fair-skinned (in makeup terms, I always choose the lightest shade of foundation); the lightly tinted (lightest shade available) is a good shade for me, mixed with an equal part of the (untinted)</li>
            <li> It dispensing too much so it is too easy to apply too much of the product.</li>
            <li> very light and l like the spf for daily use.</li>
            <li> I bought this the first time at a drug store.  </li>
            <li> The results have been nothing short of phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> I wish it had higher SPF</li>
            <li> Pretty coverage, but broke out my face.</li>
            <li> I love using this under my foundation for extra coverage with some spf.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s meant to even out skin tone while looking light and natural.  </li>
            <li> It would be best suited for someone with very little oily skin or even dry skin.</li>
            <li> I tend to breakout from certain products but haven&#x27;t from this.</li>
            <li> It blends in smoothly and has decent sun protection with SPF 18 broad spectrum.</li>
            <li> The light to medium should only be used by very tan skinned people.</li>
            <li> During winter, I sometimes double it up with another light moisturizer when needed.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, but it doesn&#x27;t make the cut.  </li>
            <li> To Grapefruit Correct and Repair CC Cream SPF 18 (lightly tinted) for several months now.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much and it just glides on.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> it dries into your skin very quickly , feels like a moisturizer until you blend it in, then it&#x27;s just dry feeling.</li>
            <li> I feel the coverage is very similar, I don&#x27;t expect full coverage from a tinted moisturizer nor do I want it.</li>
            <li> My main concerns were that I had never found a product with sunscreen that a) didn&#x27;t burn my eyes by the end of the day,</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is so light and creamy and just sinks into your skin</li>
            <li> only SPF 18, strong scent, &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; is not light enough for the very fair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the bottle, I noticed the scent was strong and lingered for awhile; but my husband said he didn&#x27;t notice it, even up close.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this (along with the cucumber milk wash, cucumber moisturizer, cucumber night cream and blueberry under eye lotion) for a few years and can&#x27;t find anything that I like better for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup, so your results may vary if you try to apply makeup on top of this.  </li>
            <li> It is totally different from makeup - get ready to toss your makeup!  </li>
            <li> I put this on first, all over, then do spot-concealing over problem-areas with my regular concealer.  </li>
            <li> I tried varying amounts, more and less blending, applying when in natural light, and even diluting with plain moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin looks dewey, fresh, and natural all day long...</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;ll add in a light layer of foundation around my eyes/nose/mouth to even things out, then dust a little setting powder over before my blush/bronzer/whatever.  </li>
            <li> - it is clear, so you can see how much product is left.  </li>
            <li> And it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell like a stereotypical sunscreen you&#x27;d buy at the drugstore, which is great for me.  </li>
            <li> i like that it is a natural product.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to CC cream so far.</li>
            <li> I also appreciate the natural ingredients, namely extracts and oils.  </li>
            <li> I plan to use the lightly tinted for everyday use, and the light-medium for summertime.  </li>
            <li> However, this is not a dealbreaker for me, as the scent disappears completely after about 15-20min from application.  </li>
            <li> So far I have not had this problem with the Yes</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice it, and I&#x27;m usually fairly sensitive to scents.  </li>
            <li> I bought the light to medium color, which is entirely too dark and orange.</li>
            <li> I wear separate broad spectrum SPF 50 daily, but for those who don&#x27;t have SPF as part of their daily ritual this could serve as a decent stand in.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, the sheer neutral coverage is what I love about it --- good-for-your-skin benefits along with subtle tint to even things out a bit.  </li>
            <li> Always on the prowl for natural skin care products, I spotted this at my local supermarket and grabbed it.  </li>
            <li> It is quickly absorbed and does not feel heavy, so there is no chance for the product to creep into my eyes throughout the day, and I have had zero problems with any eye irritation.    </li>
            <li> They also have a mattifying effect &#x3D; much less oily face, which lasts almost the whole day!   </li>
            <li> it looks very natural and it&#x27;s not very greasy.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and after showering in the morning, my skin often is pink bordering on red.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pale and typically wear the lightest or second lightest shade of foundation available in a line.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several natural brands and the others have always clogged my pores or created other issues.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin this is probably for you, but for me it&#x27;s not comparable to other products.</li>
            <li> A great starting base before concealer application or to wear alone for minimal coverage.</li>
            <li> Additionally, my research on PubMed suggests there may be a role for topical zinc application not only as sunblock, but also as a skin clearing agent in therapeutic dermatology due to its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects, as well as its role in sebum reduction.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is to do with the natural ingredients, or the added fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Same results every time, just a bit too dark.</li>
            <li> I believe the burning sensation in other products I tried until now was due to chemical as opposed to physical sun blockers, as well as any added scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the same shade of pale all year long.</li>
            <li> b) didn&#x27;t make my face look like an oil slick, and c) didn&#x27;t smell like the traditional sunscreen (that smell gives me a massive headache for some unknown reason).  </li>
            <li> I am not really liking the lack of coverage.</li>
            <li> The sale price was $3.99 so not much loss if it did not work.  </li>
            <li> Not a good product for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> When I wash my face off at night, usually 12 hours after initially applying, there&#x27;s evidence that the CC cream was still working.  </li>
            <li> This review is for my fellow redheads (and other super-fair skinned ladies).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had this problem with other, lighter-colored tinted moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> Considering the off coloring and the fact that this is only an SPF 18, I&#x27;m not sure this is a keeper for me.  </li>
            <li> I also tried the light-medium shade - this was a touch dark, but workable.  </li>
            <li> And with you don&#x27;t get a dark makeup on your hands if you touch or rub your skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed some reviewers mentioning this being too dark.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had an issue with this going on too dark.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super moisturizing, but does the job in the summer.</li>
            <li> When I put this on I used about half a pea-size dollop and tried to blend it well.</li>
            <li> and my face was still dewy, but about half a shade darker than my neck.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s little to no coverage though, so this is less a CC/BB cream and closer to a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> but I rely heavily on Amazon reviews when purchasing items at any website online, so</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday just being at home as it has SPF 18.  </li>
            <li> not sure if i would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received or found on the shelves a bottle that was close to or past its expiry date, which I think matters in the effectiveness of sunscreens.</li>
            <li> There is one *minor* change I would suggest: the scent is pretty awful.  </li>
            <li> It was streaky and provided hardly any coverage.</li>
            <li> People could smell it from at least 3 feet away from me when I was wearing.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not great - fair-to-medium tone with some redness around my nose, etc, with a few blemishes here and there.  </li>
            <li> However, the dispenser is not great.</li>
            <li> Usually after a day or 2 of using a BB or CC cream I break out, bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong, I don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li> By caking on the heavier products my skin was unhappy, which made me unhappy because unhappy skin is not attractive skin.  </li>
            <li> The tint is very faint</li>
            <li> Not oompa-loompa horrible, but not great</li>
            <li> I was optimistic about this CC cream, but I turned out to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> But the smell is terrible well..</li>
            <li> So this cream gave me the worst breakout since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> It is terrible.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have terrible skin</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay. i like that it is a natural product.I am not really liking the lack of coverage. not sure if i would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was optimistic about this CC cream, but I turned out to be disappointed. I bought the light to medium color, which is entirely too dark and orange. I have olive skin, and it was even too orange to match that. It was streaky and provided hardly any coverage. The smell is also overwhelming. People could smell it from at least 3 feet away from me when I was wearing. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Always on the prowl for natural skin care products, I spotted this at my local supermarket and grabbed it.  It&#x27;s really lovely.  It goes on smoothly and your skin just drinks it up.  It has a sheer coverage and gives a dewy complexion.  Who can say a glow doesn&#x27;t look good?  It&#x27;s very moisturizing and softened my skin, and the skin under my eyes looks better.  For the price, I think it&#x27;s very much worth it.</li>
            <li> It has a powerful smell, so if you don&#x27;t like strong smells, don&#x27;t purchase.  The problem I had with the product was that is stained my glasses!  I could not get the color off my glasses.  I have always worn tinted moisturizers and that has never happened.  I will be returning.</li>
            <li> Feels all but weightless on and blended in well. There&#x27;s little to no coverage though, so this is less a CC/BB cream and closer to a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Light and moisturizing. It&#x27;s not super moisturizing, but does the job in the summer. During winter, I sometimes double it up with another light moisturizer when needed.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to CC cream so far. I&#x27;ve tried several natural brands and the others have always clogged my pores or created other issues. This one has a very light grapefruit scent that I like, and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or make my oil-prone skin look greasy. It blends in smoothly and has decent sun protection with SPF 18 broad spectrum. I normally use a medium-beige color foundation, but I use this CC cream in &#x27;light&#x27; and it&#x27;s a near perfect match for my skin, so I&#x27;d imagine that for anyone with very fair skin it&#x27;ll be a bit too dark. I do wish it had more coverage as this is very sheer, but it&#x27;s perfect for day-to-day use when I just want to even out my skin tone a bit for a natural look along with my sun protection, and not have to be concerned with what chemicals I&#x27;m putting on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;ve noticed when buying this item online or even in big-box stores-- I&#x27;ve received or found on the shelves a bottle that was close to or past its expiry date, which I think matters in the effectiveness of sunscreens. So perhaps these kind of items aren&#x27;t checked very closely when it comes to that, but thankfully my order from Amazon was well within its date, not to mention a whole lot cheaper than any that I have seen in stores.</li>
            <li> I bought this the first time at a drug store.  I absolutely love it.  I&#x27;m 44 and it&#x27;s all I use as a foundation - it makes my skin look great!  It&#x27;s light, feels great on your skin, and it has SPF in it.  It seems like it was discontinued which is why I bought two bottles from Amazon.  But its amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> Product smells foul and applies blotchy. Expires 2 weeks from receive date. Should not have been available for sale so close to expiration date.</li>
            <li> very light and l like the spf for daily use. It smells like grapefruit and blends well if i need a concealer.</li>
            <li> I like the product. It is very refreshing. However, the dispenser is not great. It dispensing too much so it is too easy to apply too much of the product.</li>
            <li> I have definitely seen a difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to women over 40 years of age.&lt;br /&gt;Please try this product.</li>
            <li> This is a as product made my forehead breakout and what upsets me the most is I bought it for 5.99 at Burlington coat factory. It was cheap and a week later I noticed that it expired on 7/2015 I&#x27;m upset that Burlington is selling expires products and this product would of been good but it was expired while I was using it. It has okay coverage for tan skin. But the smell is terrible well.. Maybe cause it was expired but after all I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product or Burlington lol</li>
            <li> Love it on my porcelain skin!!</li>
            <li> I like this, but I don&#x27;t love it. it is really refreshing and gives a nice sheer coverage. I have ivory skin and the fair color cream did not match my skin at all, it gave me a pancake face. If you have sensitive skin this is probably for you, but for me it&#x27;s not comparable to other products.</li>
            <li> So this cream gave me the worst breakout since I was a teenager. I used it for one evening, and by the time I got home I had white heads all over.  It is terrible.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, but it doesn&#x27;t make the cut.  I am searching for a good, cruelty-free bb or cc cream.  This is nothing more than a tinted moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t blend well and sits on top of your skin.  It might work if you have beautiful teenaged skin, but I&#x27;m in my mid-30s, and there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d wear this in public.  Not to mention the Oompa Loompa tint of the Light/Medium.  Back to my search...</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a deep discount from the official Yes To Carrots website - but I rely heavily on Amazon reviews when purchasing items at any website online, so I figured I&#x27;d give back!  For reference, I have very fair and sensitive skin, and I have combination/oily skin but rarely have pimples.  I was looking for either sunscreen or a moisturizer with SPF that I could wear every day.  I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup, so your results may vary if you try to apply makeup on top of this.  My main concerns were that I had never found a product with sunscreen that a) didn&#x27;t burn my eyes by the end of the day, b) didn&#x27;t make my face look like an oil slick, and c) didn&#x27;t smell like the traditional sunscreen (that smell gives me a massive headache for some unknown reason).  I believe the burning sensation in other products I tried until now was due to chemical as opposed to physical sun blockers, as well as any added scent.  Cue the Yes To Grapefruit Correct and Repair CC Cream SPF 18, with only physical sun blockers (zinc and titanium dioxides) (though it does have added fragrance)!  I have been using the Yes To Grapefruit Correct and Repair CC Cream SPF 18 (lightly tinted) for several months now.  I have only used it mixed in conjunction with an equal part of the Yes To Grapefruit Correct and Repair Even Skin Tone Moisturizer SPF 15 (ASIN: B00AACC02Y).  The moisturizer is white, and the CC cream is colored - I mixed both so that I wouldn&#x27;t get a white cast, or have colored streaks like some foundations or CC creams leave.  The results have been nothing short of phenomenal.  The combination of these two products makes my skin tone much more even.  They also have a mattifying effect &#x3D; much less oily face, which lasts almost the whole day!   It is quickly absorbed and does not feel heavy, so there is no chance for the product to creep into my eyes throughout the day, and I have had zero problems with any eye irritation.    Win, win, and win.  I also appreciate the natural ingredients, namely extracts and oils.  Additionally, my research on PubMed suggests there may be a role for topical zinc application not only as sunblock, but also as a skin clearing agent in therapeutic dermatology due to its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects, as well as its role in sebum reduction.  And the airless pump bottle is an added bonus - it is clear, so you can see how much product is left.  I am very fair-skinned (in makeup terms, I always choose the lightest shade of foundation); the lightly tinted (lightest shade available) is a good shade for me, mixed with an equal part of the (untinted) Even Skin Tone Moisturizer SPF 15 (mentioned above).  I also tried the light-medium shade - this was a touch dark, but workable.  Mixed with an equal part of the untinted Even Skin Tone Moisturizer SPF 15, I was told I looked like I had a light tan and had been out in the sun (not a bad thing!).  I plan to use the lightly tinted for everyday use, and the light-medium for summertime.  There is one *minor* change I would suggest: the scent is pretty awful.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is to do with the natural ingredients, or the added fragrance.  A better scent would be much appreciated.  However, this is not a dealbreaker for me, as the scent disappears completely after about 15-20min from application.  And it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell like a stereotypical sunscreen you&#x27;d buy at the drugstore, which is great for me.  That said, I am 100% sold on the Yes To Grapefruit Correct and Repair SPF line.  And I can envision myself using it for the rest of my life, bar any huge ingredient or price changes.</li>
            <li> Clean application that goes on smoothly, light coverage that blends into skin and does not clog pores, and fresh scent that is subdued yet uplifting. A great starting base before concealer application or to wear alone for minimal coverage. Great product!</li>
            <li> In my quest to use more natural products I chucked my Covergirl BB cream in favor of this CC cream and am so happy I did! I feel the coverage is very similar, I don&#x27;t expect full coverage from a tinted moisturizer nor do I want it. This and my mineral powder does just fine for me, and the color correcting is a dream! I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin. Areas where I couldn&#x27;t resist and picked at are once again blending in with my skin tone. I don&#x27;t think the smell is overwhelming at all, I find it refreshing. I tend to breakout from certain products but haven&#x27;t from this. All in all a worthy buy!</li>
            <li> I love all of the Yes products and was eager to try this. I was not disappointed and will continue to order more in the future. The color matched my skin perfectly. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This goes on easily, and very cleanly so It doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing makeup. It has a great light scent and it&#x27;s moisturizing enough. I like the color it looks very natural and it&#x27;s not very greasy. I wish it had higher SPF but overall it&#x27;s my go-to every day product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course if it&#x27;s helping fight lines and anti-aging then fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this brand and Amazon has great prices on the products.  I&#x27;m fair skinned and need some sunscreen when I go makeup free (my usual makeup has an SPF) so this is a great go-to for weekends when I&#x27;m not wearing makeup.  The tint is very faint so you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing a full face of makeup but it does help to even out the skin tone so you don&#x27;t feel totally naked.  It absorbs well, doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy or coated in sunscreen.  I&#x27;ve been using this (along with the cucumber milk wash, cucumber moisturizer, cucumber night cream and blueberry under eye lotion) for a few years and can&#x27;t find anything that I like better for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have brown skin.  I saw this on sale.  It was light-medium and Ithought it probably would be too light on my skin but for some reason I decided to try it.  The sale price was $3.99 so not much loss if it did not work.  It is so light and creamy and just sinks into your skin and I could not believe that it just left a luminous glow that is so beautiful and healthy look to my face. You don&#x27;t have to use much and it just glides on.  I cannot say how happy I am.  I use it everyday because it just goes on so well and smells so good and clean.  There is no need what so ever to use makeup.  My face looks flawless and with a natural sun-kissed glow.  I have searched for that glow that I used to get from another product that is now discontinued.  This is even better.  It is totally different from makeup - get ready to toss your makeup!  And with you don&#x27;t get a dark makeup on your hands if you touch or rub your skin.  I wear it everyday just being at home as it has SPF 18.  It is just wonderful!</li>
            <li> I have facial psoriasis and this is the only make-up type product that actually does not increase itchiness. I love the grapefuit peel extract smell. I&#x27;m sure some grapefruit essential oils are in the extract creating the lovely smell. I also like the fact that it contains a good dose of zinc which is also helpful for psoriasis and adds a nice shimmer to you skin. I can&#x27;t say that it is healing my psoriasis but it does help to soothe and lighten the redness. It is a light coverage but I put on a second coat. The light to medium should only be used by very tan skinned people. I bought mine at Walgreens but will probably reorder here.</li>
            <li> The product overall is very affordable and smells great. I did find that it made my face more oily throughout the day and I found myself reaching for powder. It would be best suited for someone with very little oily skin or even dry skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely some orange hues in there...</li>
            <li> Pretty coverage, but broke out my face. I would not buy it again.  Not a good product for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this CC cream, its nice and light and isn’t causing any major problems for my acne prone/ combination skin. Usually after a day or 2 of using a BB or CC cream I break out, bad. So far I have not had this problem with the Yes To Grapefruit CC Cream. It is very shear which is nice because most days I don’t wear makeup, I&#x27;ve also noticed that its not streaky which is also a major plus. My skin tone looks a lot more even, and actually looks really good now without makeup. I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Strong grapefruit aroma but I like it, once you put it on it dries into your skin very quickly , feels like a moisturizer until you blend it in, then it&#x27;s just dry feeling. I actually use a foundation over it. I like it but don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it&#x27;s always great to find a product I can use without irritation. I love using this under my foundation for extra coverage with some spf.</li>
            <li> I purchased this wanting to get away from heavier bb creams.  I by no means have perfect skin, and no amount of foundation or bb cream is ever going to change that. By caking on the heavier products my skin was unhappy, which made me unhappy because unhappy skin is not attractive skin.  The coverage on this CC cream is light.  A CC cream is not meant to give you full coverage, or hide all imperfections.  It&#x27;s meant to even out skin tone while looking light and natural.  If you want full or medium coverage, don&#x27;t purchase this.  You won&#x27;t get what you want.  I have very sensitive skin and after showering in the morning, my skin often is pink bordering on red.  This CC cream helps blend away the red nicely and has good staying power.  I usually top this with a finishing powder.  When I wash my face off at night, usually 12 hours after initially applying, there&#x27;s evidence that the CC cream was still working.  While wearing this my skin tone looks smoother and more clear.  This doesn&#x27;t give me an air brushed look, but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m going for.  I prefer a more natural look, and that&#x27;s what I get from this.  I can&#x27;t say that this has had any impact on fine lines, but I don&#x27;t have many of those (yet) to improve on.  This also gives broad spectrum SPF coverage, which is a nice bonus.  I wear separate broad spectrum SPF 50 daily, but for those who don&#x27;t have SPF as part of their daily ritual this could serve as a decent stand in.  The citrusy smell on this does seem pretty strong when I put the cream on my beauty blending tool, but once I start applying it to my face I don&#x27;t notice it, and I&#x27;m usually fairly sensitive to scents.  All in all - a great product that I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use!  UPDATE 3/18/2015:  I&#x27;ve noticed some reviewers mentioning this being too dark.  I&#x27;m pale and typically wear the lightest or second lightest shade of foundation available in a line.  I haven&#x27;t had an issue with this going on too dark.  I use about a nickel size amount for my face and I blend generously.</li>
            <li> This review is for my fellow redheads (and other super-fair skinned ladies).  Those that burn/freckle (never tan) and who normally wear foundation in shades called  &amp;#34;porcelain,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;alabaster&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;00.&amp;#34;  As of this writing Yes to Grapefruit tinted moisturizer comes in two shades, &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;dark.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m here to tell you I feel the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; is still a bit dark - you may want to find this at Tar-jay or another store and test in person first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: lightweight, dewy finish, easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;CONS: only SPF 18, strong scent, &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; is not light enough for the very fair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the bottle, I noticed the scent was strong and lingered for awhile; but my husband said he didn&#x27;t notice it, even up close. When I put this on I used about half a pea-size dollop and tried to blend it well. The consistency was creamy and it was easy to blend - I tried both a makeup sponge and my fingers on different days.  It felt lightweight and left a nice, dewy finish. Unfortunately, I went out into natural light I noticed the coverage was even and my face was still dewy, but about half a shade darker than my neck. Not oompa-loompa horrible, but not great either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong, I don&#x27;t know.  I&#x27;ve not had this problem with other, lighter-colored tinted moisturizers.  I tried varying amounts, more and less blending, applying when in natural light, and even diluting with plain moisturizer. Same results every time, just a bit too dark. I thought about keeping this for a &amp;#34;summer&amp;#34; product, but who am I kidding . . . I&#x27;m the same shade of pale all year long. Considering the off coloring and the fact that this is only an SPF 18, I&#x27;m not sure this is a keeper for me.  Maybe if Yes to comes out with a &amp;#34;very light&amp;#34; version I&#x27;ll give it another try.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to replace my traditional foundations, creams, and moisturizers for more natural products, and this one is the latest HIT!  I love this, and trust me, it&#x27;s going up against many, many products (natural, high-end, drug store, you name it!), and so far it&#x27;s the first thing I reach for in my makeup routine.  I don&#x27;t have terrible skin but it&#x27;s not great - fair-to-medium tone with some redness around my nose, etc, with a few blemishes here and there.  This CC cream has evened out my skin-tone and makes my skin look so nice and fresh.  Amazingly, it does NOT make me a grease-factory with my otherwise very oily skin.  I put this on first, all over, then do spot-concealing over problem-areas with my regular concealer.  Sometimes I&#x27;ll add in a light layer of foundation around my eyes/nose/mouth to even things out, then dust a little setting powder over before my blush/bronzer/whatever.  This has worked great for a natural and fresh look that lasts through my 12+ hour work shifts at the hospital.  My skin looks dewey, fresh, and natural all day long...and it&#x27;s a miracle I&#x27;m saying this because I have struggled with my skin for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump is very easy and functional, not messy, and the scent is light and lovely.  I don&#x27;t mind the citrus smell at all!  The coverage is very sheer so don&#x27;t expect massive coverage - that&#x27;s not the point of the product, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve come across a BB/CC cream yet that was flawless coverage.  In my opinion, the sheer neutral coverage is what I love about it --- good-for-your-skin benefits along with subtle tint to even things out a bit.  Perfect!</li>
