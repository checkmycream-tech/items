            <li>It does a good job softening my har.</li>
            <li>I have nothing good to say about this.</li>
            <li>I used to get samples of this conditioner and loved it.</li>
            <li>Smells good....</li>
            <li>Love it feels and smells great</li>
            <li>I got this conditioner after I purchased the Honey Hibiscus Reconstrucor hoping that it would be better, and it is!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this conditioner works great</li>
            <li>It smells great, and leaves my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to discount this product as it still a nice conditioner.</li>
            <li>This is the kind of conditioner I like to use regularly.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>It smells very strong in the shower but dissipates after drying.  </li>
            <li>By far, this is the best organic conditioner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I love the aroma in the morning and my hair feels amazing.</li>
            <li>My hair smells wonderful and is so manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>It is very fine but also</li>
            <li>A very fine product which I will continue to purchase ongoing.</li>
            <li>After some research I found this on amazon and found that it is better than what I used before, completely natural and my hair feels and smells great!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years.</li>
            <li>I am able to run a comb through it in the shower (I know you&#x27;re never supposed to brush your hair in the shower because it causes breakage but whatever</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have been using John Master&#x27;s products for some time now, but unfortunately, most health food stores have discontinued carrying the products, so I am pleased Amazon can help me with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this &amp; will buy again.</li>
            <li>I would love to buy more of this</li>
            <li>After YEARS of wasting money on organic hair care products Im so glad to have found a conditioner that lives up to its promises.</li>
            <li>Still has some great organic qualities, and may work very well for some hair types.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, smooth texture.  </li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I use them more than ninety percent of the time.</li>
            <li>So I switched to another brand, and immediately noticed the difference (better than when I used this product).</li>
            <li>But I am so happy to find a way to buy it online as it isn&#x27;t in very many local stores.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty unmanageable most of the time so a good conditioner is a must.</li>
            <li>great smell of lavender and avocado and the texture of my hair is soft but not oily!</li>
            <li>In the winter my fine, curly hair gets even more witchy than in the Summer</li>
            <li>It works great on my thin, fine hair and it smells wonderful</li>
            <li>It is very light and clean smelling.  </li>
            <li>My hair tends to tangle easily during washing.</li>
            <li>My hair has a tendency to mat after shampooing because it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>It takes the tiniest amount to detangle and soften my fine hair.</li>
            <li>and I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>toxin free, organic, smells heavenly and works well on my fine, color and heat damaged, middle-aged hair.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner did not make my hair smooth at all, nor did I see improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li>This product does a great job of detangling and hydrating without leaving my hair greasy or flat.</li>
            <li>I feel like my hair isn&#x27;t that clean after using it</li>
            <li>If you like the more natural, aromatherapy sorts of scents (like going to an Aveda salon) - you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>Rinses cleanly and no residue.  </li>
            <li>Pure Mint + Echinacea, which I like even more than the John Masters.</li>
            <li>It feels good knowing that the conditioner I&#x27;m using isn&#x27;t laden with chemicals, especially since I use it almost every</li>
            <li>This conditioner didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me, so it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>I discovered an EO conditioner that provides more moisture for a MUCH lower price, so I&#x27;m switching to that.</li>
            <li>I love the gentle smell of lavender.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because when the conditioner arrived in it&#x27;s package; it had already been leaking out of the top of the bottle, and when I went to use it in the shower a large amount squirted out the top and all over.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, expensive, but good.</li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>This conditioner seems to do a good job without weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li>Love them both - great ingredients, fresh not overpowering scents, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>Before I ordered this I had been using the rainforest hair butter from the Body Shop brand, which also works well, but it wasn&#x27;t fully effective for my bone dry ends.</li>
            <li>Made me wonder if it was going to be well conditioned, but when I get out of the shower, it is so easy to run a comb through my hair, and it is soft as can be.</li>
            <li>After the very first time I used it, my hair felt like silk and continues to feel very silky and manageable.  </li>
            <li>This is very unusual for Amazon.  </li>
            <li>product leaves my fine, wavy hair naturally soft, frizz-free, and shiny.</li>
            <li>Does not weigh down fine hair and delivers on healthy shine.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this and the rosemary and mint detangler on my asian hair for many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never lost so much hair in my life!  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased it in a bottle</li>
            <li>However, I am always glad to go back to John Masters.</li>
            <li>So I used more the next time.</li>
            <li>Now I just need to find a good deep conditioner that follows the same strick quality control rules as this line.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this conditioner long ago.  </li>
            <li>Having grown up in my mothers hair salon, Im very particular about the products I use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m replacing all my personal care products with products that have less toxic ingredients, so on my search for a conditioner I tried Intelligent Nutrients (tried the shampoo too).</li>
            <li>Anyways back to the conditioner, it&#x27;s really good for dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves it soft and mostly tangle free, and doesn&#x27;t feel as weighed down with chemicals.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this conditioner and that it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my long and very fine hair.</li>
            <li>Everything I&#x27;ve tried in this brand has been very high quality.</li>
            <li>John Masters is a very high quality line of products.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like this product as much as I do.</li>
            <li>Fast ship.</li>
            <li>and this conditioner really helps to keep it from tangling.  </li>
            <li>organic, does not make your hair feel fake and plasticly after conditioning and it offers the perfect moisture balance without greasing up my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Organic blend to top it off, worth the purchase to tame split ends.</li>
            <li>I have long silky baby-fine hair which can tangle easily</li>
            <li>This conditioner has done wonders for my naturally fine, dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li>i tried it for the first time today and my hair has gotten so soft.</li>
            <li>This conditioner works well and smells fantastic - no fake fragrances - only pure essential oils which are high quality.  </li>
            <li>It really is a very hydrating conditioner that leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as normal shampoos</li>
            <li>The extra cash is worth it.</li>
            <li>I have been on the hunt for a great conditioner for a long time, and this one has worked well enough, but I&#x27;m looking for something a little thicker and luxurious.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s color-treated &amp; I use a hot iron straightener on it almost daily.</li>
            <li>I have used Redken Smooth Down series for years as my hair gets quite frizzy, but decided to change to organic products.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product, but it&#x27;s much too expensive on this web site.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural conditioner</li>
            <li>But if I do want a leave-in(dry winter weather, humid, windy), I will use Dessert Essence Coconut Soft Curls Hair Cream or Dessert Essence Coconut Hair Defrizzer &amp; Heat Protector Spray.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly blond hair.  </li>
            <li>I can leave this in my hair --not rinse it completely out</li>
            <li>I am an active buyer and thought I had found the right brand but guess not.</li>
            <li>Major hair damage after using for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Yes, they make your hair feel soft and look shiny, but that&#x27;s only because you put a liquid plastic on your hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li>I have really dry hair, and after using this conditioner, it is VERY soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels clean after 2 shampoos but for such a small bottle it hardly seems worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t wanting to waste that much of it, especially considering it wasn&#x27;t the least bit cheap.</li>

            <li> Anyways back to the conditioner, it&#x27;s really good for dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves it soft and mostly tangle free, and doesn&#x27;t feel as weighed down with chemicals.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this conditioner and that it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my long and very fine hair.</li>
            <li> Everything I&#x27;ve tried in this brand has been very high quality.</li>
            <li> John Masters is a very high quality line of products.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like this product as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Fast ship.</li>
            <li> and this conditioner really helps to keep it from tangling.  </li>
            <li> organic, does not make your hair feel fake and plasticly after conditioning and it offers the perfect moisture balance without greasing up my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Organic blend to top it off, worth the purchase to tame split ends.</li>
            <li> I have long silky baby-fine hair which can tangle easily</li>
            <li> This conditioner has done wonders for my naturally fine, dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li> i tried it for the first time today and my hair has gotten so soft.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works well and smells fantastic - no fake fragrances - only pure essential oils which are high quality.  </li>
            <li> It really is a very hydrating conditioner that leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as normal shampoos</li>
            <li> The extra cash is worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for a great conditioner for a long time, and this one has worked well enough, but I&#x27;m looking for something a little thicker and luxurious.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s color-treated &amp; I use a hot iron straightener on it almost daily.</li>
            <li> I have used Redken Smooth Down series for years as my hair gets quite frizzy, but decided to change to organic products.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product, but it&#x27;s much too expensive on this web site.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural conditioner</li>
            <li> But if I do want a leave-in(dry winter weather, humid, windy), I will use Dessert Essence Coconut Soft Curls Hair Cream or Dessert Essence Coconut Hair Defrizzer &amp; Heat Protector Spray.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly blond hair.  </li>
            <li> I can leave this in my hair --not rinse it completely out</li>
            <li> I am an active buyer and thought I had found the right brand but guess not.</li>
            <li> Major hair damage after using for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Yes, they make your hair feel soft and look shiny, but that&#x27;s only because you put a liquid plastic on your hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have really dry hair, and after using this conditioner, it is VERY soft.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels clean after 2 shampoos but for such a small bottle it hardly seems worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t wanting to waste that much of it, especially considering it wasn&#x27;t the least bit cheap.</li>
            <li> This vendor (B glowing) found a way to water down the product and reseal the tube, selling it as new condition.</li>
            <li> Not sure where they came up with this price, but it&#x27;s much cheaper on the Pharmica and the John Masters web sites.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;--cones&amp;#34; actually coat your hair and prevent moisture from getting into your hair, so long term results are dry, dry hair.</li>
            <li> It might go a long way on a shorter-haired person, but my hair is long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same thickness as a normal conditioner, so no complaints there, but it&#x27;s not the thick &amp;#34;conditioning treatment&amp;#34; consistency I remember from the sample packets.</li>
            <li> I have colored my hair with bad chemicals in the past and it is still growing out but oevr all I have healthy normal middle of the road thickness.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> - I don&#x27;t have to use any finishing products, just blow dry my hair and go.  </li>
            <li> My hair was dry and damaged from coloring before using this.  </li>
            <li> dry ad</li>
            <li> Once dry, my hair has body and shine.</li>
            <li> I have curly dry hair, so I will keep looking.</li>
            <li> I have oily scalp with dry hair</li>
            <li> and she has dry scalp and very dry hair.</li>
            <li> I use it as my daily conditioner and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> I have really thick curly hair that is very dry and tangles almost every time after I wash, so when I got out of the shower I was surprised to see that my brush slid right through almost effortlessly, with no hairs were being pulled out or broken from my ends.</li>
            <li> (only apply it to lower half of my hair, not on scalp), doesn&#x27;t leave it oily but does help with detangling and softness.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft but not at all weighed down or dried out.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair and scalp</li>
            <li> After using them, my hair felt dry, coarse, and heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so very hard to give this whole line a chance.  </li>
            <li> but I felt it left my hair a little oily looking at the scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I will purchase again just because of the price, but for now, I have no regrets.</li>
            <li> I suffer from some damage due to medication that I take.</li>
            <li> I have used this product from other sellers in the past, and I could tell as soon as I opened it that this tube was not the same.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try other John Masters products</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I do believe the color stays a bit longer (half a week?)</li>
            <li> &amp; I was surprised at how thin it is.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh down my hair and gives my hair body.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh it down</li>
            <li> only sad bit is that it IS pricey for only 7 fl oz.</li>
            <li> My wallet wept a little when I bought both the shampoo (Lavender &amp; Rosemary) and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I thought perhaps I used too little of either shampoo or conditioner.</li>
            <li> , it saves me time and trouble when I get out).</li>
            <li> It conditions and detangles without heavy build up.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner is one of the few that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy in one day - and yet, does the job it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> It was thin and runny and did not give me the same results.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t continue using even though throwing it away offends me as a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with JMO Lavender Rosemary shampoo which seems slightly above average for how expensive it is.</li>
            <li> It dried out my hair terribly, and using nothing is better than this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use any finishing cream or leave-in treatments to keep my hair tame.</li>
            <li> I was used to spending no more than $5.00.</li>
            <li> have very middle of the road hair, not dry (but can get that way with bad products) and not greasy (but can get that way with bad products).</li>
            <li> Seriously!  </li>
            <li> Did I mention no harshness, drying or chemicals to be wary of?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s been difficult to find products in this category that work but JM Organics Lavender and Avocado treats my hair well.  </li>
            <li> Then you become a slave to using them because they give you that artificial quick-fix shine and softness.</li>
            <li> but this is absurd!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing considering it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> No sulfates and bad chemicals...</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Smell was awful &amp; made my hair feel terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years. I use it as my daily conditioner and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair. Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and it&#x27;s pretty unmanageable most of the time so a good conditioner is a must. I&#x27;m replacing all my personal care products with products that have less toxic ingredients, so on my search for a conditioner I tried Intelligent Nutrients (tried the shampoo too). It was good but I felt it left my hair a little oily looking at the scalp. John Masters Intensive Conditioner was my second try and I have to say I like it. I am able to run a comb through it in the shower (I know you&#x27;re never supposed to brush your hair in the shower because it causes breakage but whatever, it saves me time and trouble when I get out). I&#x27;m using the shampoo too (rosemary something) and it&#x27;s ok. It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as normal shampoos so it takes some getting used to I guess. I feel like my hair isn&#x27;t that clean after using it but I don&#x27;t come out with greasy scalp so it must be working. It&#x27;s a brown gel like substance which also takes some getting used to. Anyways back to the conditioner, it&#x27;s really good for dry, curly hair. Gave it 4 starts because the price. I was used to spending no more than $5.00.</li>
            <li> I have used Redken Smooth Down series for years as my hair gets quite frizzy, but decided to change to organic products. After some research I found this on amazon and found that it is better than what I used before, completely natural and my hair feels and smells great!</li>
            <li> this stuff is AMAZING! i tried it for the first time today and my hair has gotten so soft. I have really thick curly hair that is very dry and tangles almost every time after I wash, so when I got out of the shower I was surprised to see that my brush slid right through almost effortlessly, with no hairs were being pulled out or broken from my ends. Before I ordered this I had been using the rainforest hair butter from the Body Shop brand, which also works well, but it wasn&#x27;t fully effective for my bone dry ends. I think I just found my replacement!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural conditioner and I am really happy with the Lavender and Avocado Intensive Conditioner. It smells great, and leaves my hair smooth and shiny. It feels good knowing that the conditioner I&#x27;m using isn&#x27;t laden with chemicals, especially since I use it almost every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only sad bit is that it IS pricey for only 7 fl oz. My wallet wept a little when I bought both the shampoo (Lavender &amp; Rosemary) and conditioner. I think next time I am going to stick with just the conditioner and use Dr. Bronner for my shampoo...and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  I have fine hair and this conditioner works great - I don&#x27;t have to use any finishing products, just blow dry my hair and go.  It smells great with the lavender.  I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> great smell of lavender and avocado and the texture of my hair is soft but not oily! No sulfates and bad chemicals...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for hair care products that do NOT have Dimethicone, Methicone... any of the hair Silicones. Yes, they make your hair feel soft and look shiny, but that&#x27;s only because you put a liquid plastic on your hair. The &amp;#34;--cones&amp;#34; actually coat your hair and prevent moisture from getting into your hair, so long term results are dry, dry hair. Then you become a slave to using them because they give you that artificial quick-fix shine and softness. John Masters Intensive Conditioner does not have this and my hair loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product leaves my fine, wavy hair naturally soft, frizz-free, and shiny. When I use it (twice a week), people are always asking to touch my hair.  I usually don&#x27;t use any finishing cream or leave-in treatments to keep my hair tame. But if I do want a leave-in(dry winter weather, humid, windy), I will use Dessert Essence Coconut Soft Curls Hair Cream or Dessert Essence Coconut Hair Defrizzer &amp; Heat Protector Spray.</li>
            <li> I have been using John Master&#x27;s products for some time now, but unfortunately, most health food stores have discontinued carrying the products, so I am pleased Amazon can help me with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the hair products meet my needs.  Thank you</li>
            <li> This conditioner did not make my hair smooth at all, nor did I see improvement in my hair. The smell of that product was not all that great either. I am an active buyer and thought I had found the right brand but guess not.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  My hair was dry and damaged from coloring before using this.  After the very first time I used it, my hair felt like silk and continues to feel very silky and manageable.  I will use this forever.</li>
            <li> I have really dry hair, and after using this conditioner, it is VERY soft.  I like that it is organic as I do not like using products with chemicals.  It also smells great.  I highly recommend if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like this product as much as I do. It really is a very hydrating conditioner that leaves my hair soft and manageable. My hair tends to tangle easily during washing. It is very fine but also dry ad I suffer from some damage due to medication that I take. This product does a great job of detangling and hydrating without leaving my hair greasy or flat. Once dry, my hair has body and shine. It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it and a little goes a long way. Love this &amp; will buy again.</li>
            <li> It conditions and detangles without heavy build up.  It works great on my thin, fine hair and it smells wonderful</li>
            <li> It smells great, not too overpowering. It does a good job softening my har. I would love to buy more of this but I can&#x27;t afford it all the time. I only use it when I travel or go to the gym because the tube is travel-sized.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this conditioner long ago.  But I am so happy to find a way to buy it online as it isn&#x27;t in very many local stores. This conditioner is one of the few that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy in one day - and yet, does the job it is supposed to do. And it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> This vendor (B glowing) found a way to water down the product and reseal the tube, selling it as new condition. I have used this product from other sellers in the past, and I could tell as soon as I opened it that this tube was not the same. It was thin and runny and did not give me the same results. Do not buy from this vendor! BTY the product itself is great.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, expensive, but good.</li>
            <li> Having grown up in my mothers hair salon, Im very particular about the products I use. After YEARS of wasting money on organic hair care products Im so glad to have found a conditioner that lives up to its promises. My hair is soft but not at all weighed down or dried out. By far, this is the best organic conditioner I&#x27;ve used. I ordered this with JMO Lavender Rosemary shampoo which seems slightly above average for how expensive it is. My hair feels clean after 2 shampoos but for such a small bottle it hardly seems worth it. I plan to reorder the conditioner, and try a different JMO shampoo.</li>
            <li> OH my, if you like Lavender, this is the product for you.  It smells very strong in the shower but dissipates after drying.  Seems to moisturize well.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly blond hair.  Always looking for a great conditioner.  This was not it.  It dried out my hair terribly, and using nothing is better than this stuff.  I will go back to Redkin, and Salon only sold L&#x27;Oreal.  (not the store stuff)... but if you need moisture.  This is not the product.</li>
            <li> Major hair damage after using for 2 weeks. Can&#x27;t continue using even though throwing it away offends me as a waste of money. But my hair can&#x27;t take it</li>
            <li> Finally found a conditioner that works for me.  I have very dry hair and scalp this is wonderful! Love it feels and smells great</li>
            <li> In the winter my fine, curly hair gets even more witchy than in the Summer and this worked great for smoothing it out and smells wonderful. If you like the more natural, aromatherapy sorts of scents (like going to an Aveda salon) - you&#x27;ll love it. It is a bit pricey for the amount you get. It might go a long way on a shorter-haired person, but my hair is long.</li>
            <li> This conditioner feels different in the shower than some conditioners, not as slippery. Made me wonder if it was going to be well conditioned, but when I get out of the shower, it is so easy to run a comb through my hair, and it is soft as can be. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this conditioner and that it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my long and very fine hair. I&#x27;m not sure I will purchase again just because of the price, but for now, I have no regrets.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to discount this product as it still a nice conditioner. I have been on the hunt for a great conditioner for a long time, and this one has worked well enough, but I&#x27;m looking for something a little thicker and luxurious. I have curly dry hair, so I will keep looking. Still has some great organic qualities, and may work very well for some hair types.</li>
            <li> Great product, my hair smells awesome. Fast ship. Can&#x27;t wait to try other John Masters products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this and the rosemary and mint detangler on my asian hair for many years. Love them both - great ingredients, fresh not overpowering scents, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> good stuff!!  Been using 8 years.  I suppose I should rotate but I like that I can leave this in my hair --not rinse it completely out and it protects it&lt;br /&gt;during drying.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works well and smells fantastic - no fake fragrances - only pure essential oils which are high quality.  My hair has a tendency to mat after shampooing because it&#x27;s fine and this conditioner really helps to keep it from tangling.  A very fine product which I will continue to purchase ongoing.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.  Nice scent, smooth texture.  Rinses cleanly and no residue.  Did I mention no harshness, drying or chemicals to be wary of?  They did a great job with this product.  Thank my wife who turned me on to John Masters products.</li>
            <li> The extra cash is worth it. I love the aroma in the morning and my hair feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Perfect pairing for the John Masters Organics Lavender Shampoo. Together these two products worked well and I will continue to use for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> Did not like it at all. Smell was awful &amp; made my hair feel terrible!</li>
            <li> I like John Masters products (Linden Blossom face wash is my holy grail face wash and I do like the Zinc and Sage shampoo). Everything I&#x27;ve tried in this brand has been very high quality. This conditioner didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me, so it&#x27;s just ok. For the price, I won&#x27;t purchase again. I discovered an EO conditioner that provides more moisture for a MUCH lower price, so I&#x27;m switching to that.</li>
            <li> It takes the tiniest amount to detangle and soften my fine hair. I love the gentle smell of lavender. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Great brand but it does still contain preservatives.</li>
            <li> My hair smells wonderful and is so manageable and soft. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a nice product, but it&#x27;s much too expensive on this web site.  Not sure where they came up with this price, but it&#x27;s much cheaper on the Pharmica and the John Masters web sites.  This is very unusual for Amazon.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so very hard to give this whole line a chance.  I&#x27;ve used it exclusively for 5 months.  I&#x27;ve never lost so much hair in my life!  Seriously!  I have long silky baby-fine hair which can tangle easily but this is absurd!  I DREAD washing my hair because of the difficulty combing it out after using Masters products.  On the other hand, I do believe the color stays a bit longer (half a week?) and it can look shinier than with non-organic products.</li>
            <li> I have nothing good to say about this. This has not helped mine or my daughter&#x27;s hair. I have oily scalp with dry hair and she has dry scalp and very dry hair. This does nothing for any one of us. Very disappointing considering it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> I used to get samples of this conditioner and loved it. This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased it in a bottle &amp; I was surprised at how thin it is. It&#x27;s the same thickness as a normal conditioner, so no complaints there, but it&#x27;s not the thick &amp;#34;conditioning treatment&amp;#34; consistency I remember from the sample packets. That said, it does a great job of conditioning my hair. I have wavy/curly hair that&#x27;s frizzy. It&#x27;s color-treated &amp; I use a hot iron straightener on it almost daily. This conditioner seems to do a good job without weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  It is very light and clean smelling.  It does not weigh down my hair and gives my hair body.</li>
            <li> Great product great brand. my hair feels and smells great.</li>
            <li> This was not moisturizing enough for me at all and I have fine hair. I returned it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has done wonders for my naturally fine, dry, curly hair. It leaves it soft and mostly tangle free, and doesn&#x27;t feel as weighed down with chemicals. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because when the conditioner arrived in it&#x27;s package; it had already been leaking out of the top of the bottle, and when I went to use it in the shower a large amount squirted out the top and all over. I really wasn&#x27;t wanting to waste that much of it, especially considering it wasn&#x27;t the least bit cheap.</li>
            <li> Works great, smells good and working great. Organic blend to top it off, worth the purchase to tame split ends.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great, and after every use my hair looks sleek and shiny!  I use it with the restructuring shampoo, and I am really happy with the results.</li>
            <li> John Masters is a very high quality line of products. I use them more than ninety percent of the time. Every now and then I have to use something else because I have to change shampoos once in a while to avoid build up. However, I am always glad to go back to John Masters.</li>
            <li> Smells good....but that&#x27;s about it. I bought this and the shampoo. After using them, my hair felt dry, coarse, and heavy.  I thought perhaps I used too little of either shampoo or conditioner. So I used more the next time. And the next. I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement. So I switched to another brand, and immediately noticed the difference (better than when I used this product). Too bad. I was hoping for a different outcome. But I will not get this again, nor can I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner, I prefer it over any organic or non organic. Does not weigh down fine hair and delivers on healthy shine.</li>
            <li> excellent!! that&#x27;s it!!</li>
            <li> toxin free, organic, smells heavenly and works well on my fine, color and heat damaged, middle-aged hair.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh it down (only apply it to lower half of my hair, not on scalp), doesn&#x27;t leave it oily but does help with detangling and softness.  :o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s been difficult to find products in this category that work but JM Organics Lavender and Avocado treats my hair well.  I switch between using it and Acure Conditioner Pure Mint + Echinacea, which I like even more than the John Masters.</li>
            <li> I got this conditioner after I purchased the Honey Hibiscus Reconstrucor hoping that it would be better, and it is! This is the kind of conditioner I like to use regularly.&lt;br /&gt;Its organic, does not make your hair feel fake and plasticly after conditioning and it offers the perfect moisture balance without greasing up my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have very middle of the road hair, not dry (but can get that way with bad products) and not greasy (but can get that way with bad products). I have colored my hair with bad chemicals in the past and it is still growing out but oevr all I have healthy normal middle of the road thickness.&lt;br /&gt;This is a solid conditoner. I recomend it if you want to start trating you body and the environment right. Now I just need to find a good deep conditioner that follows the same strick quality control rules as this line.</li>
