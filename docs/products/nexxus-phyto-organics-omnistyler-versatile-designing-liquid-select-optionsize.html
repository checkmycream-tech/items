            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Size is great as it does not require frequent reordering.  </li>

            <li>The boss, er, better half was delighted, which of course makes me delighted.</li>
            <li>I have never found another product that works on my fine hair and cowlicks as well as this one</li>
            <li>and I manage my fine curly hair with it.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and it does not weight it down.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Huge bottle lasts forever</li>
            <li>Its light on my hair but gives it a lot of body</li>
            <li>My hair fit neither of these categories.</li>
            <li>Great for managing curly hair either leaving to air dry or blow out.</li>
            <li>I use it right after the shower, just a little bit on the roots, and it keeps my hair styled perfectly all day.  </li>
            <li>The product has a pleasant smell and even though it is not a thick and sticky formulation, it creates order and a reasonable, presentable look.  </li>
            <li>so was happy to find such a large size on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have super curly hair (3b)</li>
            <li>Like others mentioned, I was a loyal Versastyler user for about 20 yrs.</li>
            <li>The formula is very watery and it&#x27;s very easy to pour out too much without some sort of spout.</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s a soft hold, rather than having crunchy curls.</li>
            <li>The price is right, and the shipment was timely.</li>
            <li>Love this product great styling product put on wet hair blow dry to style desired.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice because it contains no alcohol to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I actually like it better.</li>
            <li>I can never keep my hair more than one day, but this allows me second day hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li>This was my first dealing with Amazon, and I have since ordered something else, and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li>so I had to pour it out into a different container to be able to use it.</li>
            <li>I have very fine and thin hair and find the Omnistyler allows me to curl my hair and have it hold quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>This is a solution for my fine as feathers hair that likes to fly around and plaster itself oddly in several different directions on my head, which is a bit surprising, considering how little hair I actually have--about 2 inches at its longest anywhere.  </li>
            <li>It tames static electricity and gives my hair the look of body that lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>So, tried the never fail Amazon, and of course there it was at a much lower price than I was told.</li>
            <li>I have used it for several years and is great on thin fine hair.</li>
            <li>It Doesn&#x27;t Take Much For Each Use.</li>
            <li>This product performs very well.</li>
            <li>(2) both of our hairs being very frizzy.</li>
            <li>As a styling product this works very well for me.</li>
            <li>Plus it makes it very shiny.</li>
            <li>really like it.</li>
            <li>It is similar, but has a less pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>It is a very light  liquid and does not weigh down hair.</li>
            <li>It is alcohol free so it doesnt dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>After Versastyler was discontinued, I tried numerous products that would either turn out super crunchy or too relaxed.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>With extremely straight, fine hair, this is the only hair setting lotion that actually works for me.  </li>
            <li>Product did everything I expected of it, and the free shipping was a surprise bonus.</li>
            <li>Well Worth The Price and Lasts A long Time</li>
            <li>Generally, perms can give it much of the body it needs.</li>
            <li>This setting product works so well with my fine, limp hair.</li>
            <li>This is a large bottle, bigger than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>Most curly haired products are made for people with extremely thick and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>No alcohol, keeps the curls soft, smooth and tame!</li>
            <li>Does not dry out my hair</li>
            <li>I recommend this for people with short hair who prefer to contain hair drama to a manageable status without spending too much time and cost on salon visits, and avoid that getting-out-of-the-house difficulty due to funny-looking hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair because of an illness in childhood, so I have fought it all my life.</li>

            <li> I have fine, thin hair because of an illness in childhood, so I have fought it all my life.</li>
            <li> The other product I like for fine, thin hair is Matrix Essentials AMPLIFY, a texturizing liquid that sprays on.</li>
            <li> when I received it, the lid was loose and some of the product was leaking .</li>
            <li> I have straight, thin hair.</li>
            <li> In the meantime, I&#x27;ve tried several other products and wasted my time and money because they do not work.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that my bottle came with a pump that did not work</li>
            <li> My hair is baby-fine and Omnistyler seems to &amp;#34;coat&amp;#34; and thicken without weighing the hair down.  </li>
            <li> Reminds me of the Nexxus VersaStyler Artistic Designing Lotion, I was very sad when they discontinued it.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and all I have to do to revive it is spritz a little water and re-fluff.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a number of years and then was unable to purchase it locally.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this on my hair and I usually buy it from her</li>
            <li> and then the store I usually buy it from discontinued it.  </li>
            <li> Was not able to find it anywhere since I moved.</li>
            <li> but it is hard to find in stores and beauty shops</li>
            <li> I have used this product for at least 5 years.</li>
            <li> No more helmet head for me!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product have been using it for years but it is hard to find in stores and beauty shops so was happy to find such a large size on Amazon.  I will surely order more.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a number of years and then was unable to purchase it locally.  I ordered it and the supplier responded in record time---only a couple of days before I received the item.  I have very fine and thin hair and find the Omnistyler allows me to curl my hair and have it hold quite nicely.  It&#x27;s nice because it contains no alcohol to dry my hair.  KB</li>
            <li> I had read that this was just like the discontinued Versastyle lotion that was discontinued.  It is similar, but has a less pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this on my hair and I usually buy it from her but she didn&#x27;t have any so I got it from Amazon.  Its light on my hair but gives it a lot of body</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations as a styling product. It is light but effective. No more helmet head for me!</li>
            <li> Great for managing curly hair either leaving to air dry or blow out.</li>
            <li> when I received it, the lid was loose and some of the product was leaking .</li>
            <li> Well Worth The Price and Lasts A long Time Cause It Doesn&#x27;t Take Much For Each Use.</li>
            <li> I just love this product. Tried others, always come back to it. So glad I found it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 10 years. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for at least 5 years. I have straight, thin hair. It tames static electricity and gives my hair the look of body that lasts all day long. Would not use anything else!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they discontinued Versastyler but I tried this product and I actually like it better. I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Preferred Versastyler but it was discontinued. Similar but does not have the hold that Versastyler had.</li>
            <li> This is a large bottle, bigger than I thought it would be.  I use it right after the shower, just a little bit on the roots, and it keeps my hair styled perfectly all day.  Nice smell.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to the pricier Versastyler.  Size is great as it does not require frequent reordering.  Dispenser works well.  This product performs very well.</li>
            <li> This has great hold for my natural curly hair. Scrunchable when air drying and with a blow dryer, it is more touchable of a hold.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  I have never found another product that works on my fine hair and cowlicks as well as this one</li>
            <li> Fave product for permed hair. Great price and got it fast!</li>
            <li> This alcohol-free lotion provides light control and superior curl retention when used for roller sets or with curling irons and hot rollers. Adds texture and hold when sculpting, scrunching, or finger drying.</li>
            <li> This Nexxus product is perfect for curly hair!! No alcohol, keeps the curls soft, smooth and tame!</li>
            <li> Was looking to replace the Versistyler Lotion they had. This isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Been using for years. I love this product!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t Versatyler but it works.</li>
            <li> This is a solution for my fine as feathers hair that likes to fly around and plaster itself oddly in several different directions on my head, which is a bit surprising, considering how little hair I actually have--about 2 inches at its longest anywhere.  The product has a pleasant smell and even though it is not a thick and sticky formulation, it creates order and a reasonable, presentable look.

            <li> Brilliant Product and Quick Delivery from USA to UK</li>
            <li> Good for a lighter control.</li>
            <li> This setting product works so well with my fine, limp hair. Holds well in humidity.</li>
            <li> Great deal on a great product.</li>
            <li> The price is right, and the shipment was timely. The boss, er, better half was delighted, which of course makes me delighted. Honest injun!</li>
            <li> For anyone that has curly hair, this product prevents friz and sets the curls to have form.  I have been using this product for over a decade and I manage my fine curly hair with it.  You dont need to use a lot of it and it can be re-activated with water.  It comes in a liquid form.  It is alcohol free so it doesnt dry my hair.  I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair (3b) and my mom has wavy hair (2) both of our hairs being very frizzy. This works miracles! My mom&#x27;s hair gets these beachy waves that have no frizz for a couple of days and my hair curls beautifully and frizz free. I can never keep my hair more than one day, but this allows me second day hair. I love this product. Huge bottle lasts forever and I use it almost every day! Definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> With extremely straight, fine hair, this is the only hair setting lotion that actually works for me.  Used it for years, but seller source discontinued carrying product.  In the meantime, I&#x27;ve tried several other products and wasted my time and money because they do not work.  It is a very light  liquid and does not weigh down hair.</li>
            <li> was told of this product by a friend, but we couldn&#x27;t find it. So, tried the never fail Amazon, and of course there it was at a much lower price than I was told. Product did everything I expected of it, and the free shipping was a surprise bonus. I will order this again. This was my first dealing with Amazon, and I have since ordered something else, and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> VERY SATISFIED. MAKES MY HAIR MORE MANAGEABLE.</li>
            <li> I still miss the Nexxus Versastyler, but this is close second. I love the smell of this styling liquid!!!! I hope this is not discontinued.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Does not dry out my hair and it gives it a nice shine and strong hold. Perfect for controlling my frzzy wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product great styling product put on wet hair blow dry to style desired.  It holds.</li>
            <li> the only product I have found since nexus versastyler. I am so glad I bought it. it is a great replacement for versastyler. thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for awhile and then the store I usually buy it from discontinued it.  So I was happy to find it here.</li>
            <li> I am beyond thrilled to find this product. Like others mentioned, I was a loyal Versastyler user for about 20 yrs. I have fine, curly hair. Most curly haired products are made for people with extremely thick and frizzy hair. My hair fit neither of these categories. After Versastyler was discontinued, I tried numerous products that would either turn out super crunchy or too relaxed. This is a great alternative for loose beautiful, bouncy curls!</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I have used it for several years and is great on thin fine hair.</li>
            <li> The product itself it amazing. I switched to this for my curly hair and have been using for several months now in place of mousse. My hair feels great and I love that it&#x27;s a soft hold, rather than having crunchy curls. My only complaint is that my bottle came with a pump that did not work so I had to pour it out into a different container to be able to use it. The formula is very watery and it&#x27;s very easy to pour out too much without some sort of spout.</li>
            <li> I love this! It works great on my curls. Reminds me of the Nexxus VersaStyler Artistic Designing Lotion, I was very sad when they discontinued it. This work just as good.</li>
            <li> Hairdos come and go -- but I keep using this product because, over the last 15 years or so, I have found nothing like it.  My hair is baby-fine and Omnistyler seems to &amp;#34;coat&amp;#34; and thicken without weighing the hair down.  Can&#x27;t think of another product I&#x27;ve liked as well in any category.</li>
            <li> As a styling product this works very well for me. Was not able to find it anywhere since I moved. Found it at Amazon, like the product since it is alcohol free which is good for the hair. Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> The best for curly hair</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair because of an illness in childhood, so I have fought it all my life. Generally, perms can give it much of the body it needs. But the hair gets fragile with perms and so must go without one for months. This is one product I use to help put body in it. Plus it makes it very shiny. The other product I like for fine, thin hair is Matrix Essentials AMPLIFY, a texturizing liquid that sprays on. It actually makes the individual hairs look thicker.</li>
            <li> I have tried many hair styling products.  They sit on the shelf and age as I continue to go back to Nexxus Omnistyler.  It works for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Glad I was able to find it on-line!</li>
            <li> My daughter was a hair dresser and she recommended it to me.  My hair is fine and it does not weight it down.&lt;br /&gt;I really like it.</li>
