            <li>this attaches to a table or stool very easily and holds my styrofoam head with a wig on it nicely.</li>

            <li>I think very cheap price.</li>
            <li>Does not match with most hair manikins.</li>
            <li>will update this review when I have more status of resolution.</li>
            <li>To be able to use it, i ask my husband to go macgyver on it.</li>
            <li>I would like to be able to set it and forget it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.  </li>
            <li>Received and satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li>You can loosen the top part to turn or tilt the head, which we needed.  </li>
            <li>I would invest in a better clamp for mannequins if in school.</li>
            <li>over all we will buy more for the price</li>
            <li>i wish it expanded more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to loosen up more movement or tighten up to stay in place.</li>
            <li>Easy to assemble, sturdy, able to mount and move it easily.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit every head, but fits most</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product the seller was also very quick on delivery.</li>
            <li>Sturdy and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I quickly realized I had to get one of these!  </li>
            <li>Cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li>Nothing in my house seems to fit.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit the mannequin heads we purchased.</li>
            <li>And the vendor was exceptionally kind when the first one didn&#x27;t arrive - they quickly sent out another to replace, so it was here before Christmas.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and just right for beginners.</li>
            <li>The top section (where the mannequin is supposed to go) does not hold steady.</li>
            <li>The very first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>not very sturdy but good for the price I guess</li>
            <li>Received in good time and was what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I already have it on my table bolted down nice and secure and haven&#x27;t even damaged my table.</li>
            <li>so I ordered a second for safe keeping.</li>
            <li>This item broke on first day.</li>
            <li>I used it for the FIRST time on March 30, 2015 and it broke.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;wheel\\&quot; in the mid section can be adjusted to move the support rod around like a joy stick, but there&#x27;s no real way to adjust the support rod to keep the styrofoam head from moving.  </li>
            <li>Good standard clamp holds well, allows you to tilt manikin head in different directions as needed.</li>
            <li>they are really convenient.</li>
            <li>This product works very well for me.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t tighten too much cut</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>As a puppeteer using life size figures they make working on the wigs so much easier.</li>
            <li>this stand for mannequin heads seemto be very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Holds the head steady well.</li>
            <li>This standard keep slipping, and it was a pain to find somewhere, where it would fit right!</li>
            <li>My expectations were too high.</li>
            <li>I will be buying a few more.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the product works fine.</li>
            <li>But other than buying a standing tri-pod because I&#x27;m cheap, it works</li>
            <li>this is new one.</li>
            <li>She loved it, but could hardly do anything with it without the head falling over and the long hair tangling up.  </li>
            <li>The clamp is wide and strong enough for virtually any table or counter edge.</li>
            <li>they hold wig heads very well and hold up well to constant abuse as I wove them from one place to another.</li>
            <li>We bought two of these as gifts for young girls to use to hold their Cosmetically Mannequin heads to the table.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I have not been able to use this swivel as I am still searching for the right &amp;#34;long neck&amp;#34; wig head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure one could wrap a few rubber bands around the support rod in order to prevent slipping,</li>
            <li>I get it nice and tight, but when cutting hair or rolling a perm, it loosens quickly.</li>
            <li>Only thing that stopped me from giving it 5 stars was it is really hard to secure it to the table or stand</li>
            <li>The tighening wheel spins easily and locks down tight allowing you to change the angle in a blink of an eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I spent several hours chasing the styrofoam head around the pole, trying to part hair evenly, only to discover that the head had swiveled on the stick and misaligned everything.  </li>
            <li> It came quickly and is not cheap or shoddy.</li>
            <li> These are high quality, made of hard plastic with a metal bearing for the ball and socket assembly.</li>
            <li> Not worth the postage.  </li>
            <li> but this tool can be clamped down and will stay still.</li>
            <li> Althought my application may not be typical</li>
            <li> When my daughter opened the package for Christmas, we discovered that parts are missing.</li>
            <li> Now trying to get missing part.</li>
            <li> It worked but broke in a few days</li>
            <li> Works well, very firm.</li>
            <li> Those foam heads are hard to keep still</li>
            <li> it loses it&#x27;s grip.&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li> Very hard to use the manikin with this stand.</li>
            <li> But shiping was very slow this time....</li>
            <li> Arrived with a part broken.  </li>
            <li> these work well, not great.</li>
            <li> Theres nothing wrong i can say about this product.</li>
            <li> Lots of duct tape :(((</li>
            <li> Terrible product.  </li>
            <li> IT IS TERRIBLE QUALITY!!!!!!!!!</li>

            <li> It does what it says. Any one looking to try makeing their own wigs should give this a try and its at a fair price.</li>
            <li> Cheap for a reason. Does not match with most hair manikins. Very hard to use the manikin with this stand.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have bought the big ground stand.  This standard keep slipping, and it was a pain to find somewhere, where it would fit right! I no longer use it!  It was a waist of money!</li>
            <li> When my daughter opened the package for Christmas, we discovered that parts are missing. Now trying to get missing part. will update this review when I have more status of resolution.</li>
            <li> Sturdy mannequin holder, great price and very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Clamps  quite well onto a table.</li>
            <li> It worked but broke in a few days</li>
            <li> Works great with the mannequin head I bought with it</li>
            <li> they are really convenient. I ordered one and I liked the way it holds up so I ordered a second for safe keeping.</li>
            <li> Good Product.  Holds Manequin head in p lace without a problem.</li>
            <li> Not sturdy broke upon tightening the 1st use!</li>
            <li> not very sturdy but good for the price I guess</li>
            <li> The top section (where the mannequin is supposed to go) does not hold steady. There is no locking mechanism to keep it from not moving in all directions when in use. To be able to use it, i ask my husband to go macgyver on it. Lots of duct tape :(((</li>
            <li> Good standard clamp holds well, allows you to tilt manikin head in different directions as needed. Would buy another like it.</li>
            <li> This is a great clamp if you&#x27;re in cosmetology school and need to practice on a mannequin head.  Holds the head steady well.</li>
            <li> this attaches to a table or stool very easily and holds my styrofoam head with a wig on it nicely.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit every head, but fits most and I love it! Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t leave marks, head removes and turns with ease! Great product!</li>
            <li> Good for use for making your own UPart Wigs. Those foam heads are hard to keep still but this tool can be clamped down and will stay still.</li>
            <li> The ball and post has to be adjusted quite often.  I would like to be able to set it and forget it. Other than that, the product works fine.</li>
            <li> But its a pain in the butt to find something to screw it on to. Nothing in my house seems to fit. But other than buying a standing tri-pod because I&#x27;m cheap, it works and oh well.</li>
            <li> This item serves the purpose for which it was made for. I&#x27;m pleased.  The price was very good.  No complaints here.</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble, sturdy, able to mount and move it easily. I would recommend this product the seller was also very quick on delivery.</li>
            <li> Received and satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought my four-year-old daughter a somewhat inexpensive styling practice head as part of her birthday gift, because she loves playing beauty shop.  She loved it, but could hardly do anything with it without the head falling over and the long hair tangling up.  I quickly realized I had to get one of these!  In my daughter&#x27;s words:  &amp;#34;This clamp works great, mom!  It doesn&#x27;t move at all!&amp;#34;  You can loosen the top part to turn or tilt the head, which we needed.  Having no experience with this type of thing, I&#x27;m glad I picked a good one!</li>
            <li> The stand doesn&#x27;t grip well to my square cornered table. I get it nice and tight, but when cutting hair or rolling a perm, it loosens quickly. I have to stop repeatedly to tighten it. I am going to spend the $36 on the stand with adjustable height like we use in the classroom. I know it was only $6. My expectations were too high.</li>
            <li> Been using this for quite a while now and find myself very happy with them- they hold wig heads very well and hold up well to constant abuse as I wove them from one place to another.</li>
            <li> This stand works great. Easy to use and just right for beginners. The item arrived as promised on time. I will order oter items in the future.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for me. It&#x27;s easy to loosen up more movement or tighten up to stay in place.</li>
            <li> Works well. Just don&#x27;t tighten too much cut it loses it&#x27;s grip.&lt;br /&gt;Came at time estimated</li>
            <li> Works well, very firm. Was a good buy.</li>
            <li> Received in good time and was what I expected.  Thanks</li>
            <li> this is new one. this is very good and not problem. I think very cheap price. But shiping was very slow this time....</li>
            <li> I needed to mount a styrofoam head to my table in order to style a wig.  The mount works great, but it has no means of securing the styrofoam head to the mount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;wheel\\&quot; in the mid section can be adjusted to move the support rod around like a joy stick, but there&#x27;s no real way to adjust the support rod to keep the styrofoam head from moving.  I spent several hours chasing the styrofoam head around the pole, trying to part hair evenly, only to discover that the head had swiveled on the stick and misaligned everything.  :\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure one could wrap a few rubber bands around the support rod in order to prevent slipping, but I was hoping the device wouldn&#x27;t need to be tinkered with it function desirably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the $8 I paid for it, though!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase. It came quickly and is not cheap or shoddy. I will be buying a few more.</li>
            <li> This item broke on first day. Would not recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit the mannequin heads we purchased.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.  I used it for the FIRST time on March 30, 2015 and it broke.  The very first time I used it.  I can&#x27;t return or replace it because of the return policy.  DO NOT BUY THIS!  IT IS TERRIBLE QUALITY!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> We bought two of these as gifts for young girls to use to hold their Cosmetically Mannequin heads to the table. It worked find, no issues.</li>
            <li> Arrived with a part broken.  Didn&#x27;t want to pay to send back.  Not worth the postage.  It was still usable.</li>
            <li> I ordered the &amp;#34;Jasmine Budget Cosmetology Ethnic Human Hair Manikin&amp;#34; (mannequin) and ordered this stand too so it worked out wonderful. I already have it on my table bolted down nice and secure and haven&#x27;t even damaged my table. Will order another for under $6 when I order another &amp;#34;mannequin. Amazon is truly the place for a &amp;#34;budget shopaholic&amp;#34; like myself. Glad I did go ahead and order when I did , nice piece,price and purchase!</li>
            <li> A bit flimsy but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I would invest in a better clamp for mannequins if in school.</li>
            <li> these work well, not great. if you over tighten them it will strip them. over all we will buy more for the price</li>
            <li> These head form clamps are exceptional. As a puppeteer using life size figures they make working on the wigs so much easier. These are high quality, made of hard plastic with a metal bearing for the ball and socket assembly. They arrive in their Retail box and are shipped with care in a shipping box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price can&#x27;t be beat - you can pay 2-3 times the amount at a beauty supply stroe but why bother? Althought my application may not be typical I can see these working perfectly for any cosmetology student to Pro hair stylist. The clamp is wide and strong enough for virtually any table or counter edge. The tighening wheel spins easily and locks down tight allowing you to change the angle in a blink of an eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply a great product that does exactly what it&#x27;s designed to do and at a great price to boot!</li>
            <li> great, cheap and does the job</li>
            <li> i wish it expanded more</li>
            <li> Sturdy and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Broke almost instantly</li>
            <li> Purchased this item for my daughters mannequin so that they can practice braiding hair. It fits perfectly and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This broke very easily!</li>
            <li> Works great all smiles. Theres nothing wrong i can say about this product. I would def reccomend to any cosmetologist.</li>
            <li> Works well for what we&#x27;re using it for - a mannequin head for my daughter to play with. And the vendor was exceptionally kind when the first one didn&#x27;t arrive - they quickly sent out another to replace, so it was here before Christmas. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> work well with my mannequin</li>
            <li> Works great! Bought for play!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have not been able to use this swivel as I am still searching for the right &amp;#34;long neck&amp;#34; wig head.</li>
            <li> this stand for mannequin heads seemto be very sturdy.  the price was great -- the best I was able to find.</li>
            <li> Only thing that stopped me from giving it 5 stars was it is really hard to secure it to the table or stand</li>
            <li> good quality for the price</li>
            <li> It came on time and doing what its supposed to do.</li>
