    <ol>
            <li>The CE Ferulic was recommended to me by an excellent dermatologist who said they use it for their $40 microderm facials.  </li>
            <li>Great product!!!  </li>
            <li>I decided to try the sample of Skinceuticals Retinol and am very impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for about 1 week, and already see the difference in the tone, texture and pore size of my skin  with the use of this remarkable prodcut!  </li>
            <li>The price is very good.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>Thank you for this great find.</li>
            <li>I have a way to go to perfect skin, but it&#x27;s better than it has ever been in my life.</li>
            <li>The 0.5% is really good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certainly glad I did!</li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing.  </li>
            <li>I told them .05 retinol cream, a nice moisturizing night cream, and lots of sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best deal on these products.  </li>
            <li>I saw better results in terms of increasing clarity and reducing fine lines but the trade-off was a nice case of cystic acne.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>but it got better over time.</li>
            <li>Even my husband remarked for the first time in our marriage that my skin looked \\&quot;particularly good . . .</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think because it&#x27;s working great at the rate you are using it that you can use it more frequently.</li>
            <li>Works great, makes my skin soft, and more even.  </li>
            <li>Retinol, obviously, is magic for fine eye lines.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for people who loved using Retin-A or if you are in need of a brighter, more even skin tone.</li>
            <li>Sweet!</li>
            <li>This stuff is really strong in comparison</li>
            <li>I was going to start with the skinceuticals 1% retinol, but decided after reading the reviews, that it may be too strong.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks smooth.</li>
            <li>All three of Skin Ceuticals -- Retinol, CE Ferulic, B Gel -- are fantastic for anyone over 40.  </li>
            <li>Skinceuticals is a fantastic product line and this product works for me as well as</li>
            <li>The following week, my face looked absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>For me, this extraordinary product delivers and it does so, Quickly!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh, yet effective.  </li>
            <li>I could see some rather quick results from this product, which isn&#x27;t always the case with skin care products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many of such products and this really gets results.  </li>
            <li>The only thing you need other than these three is an  exfoliating cleanser (the best for me is Zhen Papaya Face Scrub).</li>
            <li>I remembered purchasing a product with pure retinol in it (not this one) along with a pure plant-based toner and pure vitamin C serum many moons ago (about 17 years) and noticed how well my skin looked; pore reduction, firmness, collagen support, even skin-tone.</li>
            <li>I have the buffet of skin woes - aging, fine lines, plus chronic adult acne.  </li>
            <li>so I suspect the grade of retinol is higher.  </li>
            <li>Now using it three times and my face is clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>Fresh,  brand new, came really fast!!  </li>
            <li>In fact, at a party with my coworkers the other day one of them commented on how nice my skin is.</li>
            <li>The first couple weeks I used my skinceuticals, my face broke out even more noticeably, and the skin in my t-zone become dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It was very drying at first</li>
            <li>When I first used this combination, I was very concerned, because my face began to break out and flake.</li>
            <li>Also, I will probably purchase pure vit. C serum.</li>
            <li>I tended to get around my mouth, especially near my period.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how or why it works</li>
            <li>I paid WAY too much money for the amount of product that I received.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Works very well for the OTC retinol cream.</li>
            <li>This .5% doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>I am a 55 yr old woman with hyper-pigmentation problems and this works wonders at keeping skin bright and even toned, however you must use SUNSCREEN with any product that removes old, dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>I will probably get the 1.0 % next as I love the way it keeps the skin looking renewed daily.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure it worked before purchasing the more expensive package.  </li>
            <li>and I persisted in using a pea sized dab of the cream before bed, under my normal Oil of Olay night cream.</li>
            <li>Although I typically have sensitive skin, I was able to tolerate this for nighttime use without any noticeable irritation.</li>
            <li>I purchased this after reading the reviews on another site and expected it to clear my congested skin while it reduced fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use the little tubes it til they&#x27;re gone, since there&#x27;s noting &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; with it really, but I was hoping for some skin rejunivation (a little peeling is good).</li>
            <li>I have never seen my skin so clear, ever!</li>
            <li>Secondly, the package says right on it, &amp;#34;Samples only- not for resale&amp;#34;, so please tell my how you are legally reselling them?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31, slightly sensitive skin (very pale), doing what I can to fight fine lines and keep deep wrinkles at bay (preventitive care, basically), and I&#x27;m not one to use retinols (although I tried ROC deep wrinkle treatment - a full tube of it and had decent results).</li>
            <li>my Dr. suggested I use this to clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and for the longest time any product I put on my face will cause it to break out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 60 years old and still have skin breakouts, blackheads etc.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve just used one tube so far.</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly in a small travel pouch and were very practical to open and use.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>This product seems to have a high enough percentage of Retinol that will make a difference.  </li>
            <li>In addition, the packaging is really cheap and small for the price.  </li>
            <li>(Don&#x27;t start using it just before a major event).</li>
            <li>First off, the package was much smaller than what I expected to receive.</li>
            <li>I am no stranger to OTC retinols and have used both Green Cream and Diacneal with success.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, there is barely any product in each tube.</li>
            <li>Granted, I was in my early 30&#x27;s and had minor skin problems (not associated with diet nor nutrition).</li>
            <li>If you really want to clear up your skin, try this product and stick with it for at least a month.</li>

            <li> This was a complete waste of money, first off the bottles were SOOOOO small.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe it took me so long to try Retinol, but I have gotten verbal compliments on my complexion after one week.  </li>
            <li> Tried to return the other totally unused tubes but was refused by seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it nightly for the last few weeks - around my eyes, mouth, and between my brows.</li>
            <li> Be careful when using.</li>
            <li> Only slightly helped with dark spots though.</li>
            <li> Right out of the gate though, not impressed.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that my face is beginning to flake, so I guess this is a sign that it is regenerating/renewing skin-cells.</li>
            <li> My skin peeled quite a bit but then settled down.  </li>
            <li> Loaned some to a friend who had a skin abrasion resulting in a dark spot and she saw lightening results in five days using about half a tube.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a pimple or spot in 4 and a half months</li>
            <li> It does, however have a slight medicinal-like?</li>
            <li> I started once a week for two months then twice a week for one and a half.  </li>
            <li> I started using these little sample tubes 5 months ago to remedy acne flare ups</li>
            <li> the product comes with 5 little tubes, and they are labeled as samples.  </li>
            <li> A little tube lasts for a while.  </li>
            <li> I took these little jewels with me on vacation.</li>
            <li> I will stick with Green Cream 9.</li>
            <li> on smoothly, no greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> Let me say I saw nothing, I would not recommend this to anyone especially for those of you with tough skin or hard to lighten area&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I was scared to try it because of my past experiences with skin care products that I waited to see the effect on her before I tried it</li>
            <li> scent which may annoy some, but the scent does go away, within a few seconds and bugs don&#x27;t bother me!</li>
            <li> The moisturizing gel is one of the very few that doesn&#x27;t make my face breakout.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for my body and tough to lighten area&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I opened the tube few minutes ago and, for my surprise, the tube was used!!!</li>
            <li> It was false advertising.</li>
            <li> EVERY SINGLE TIME I USE ANYTHING WITH A SCENT/FRAGRANCE BUGS BITE ME, I HATE</li>
            <li> The unfortunate thing is that I could no longer find the line of products (discontinued) and never tried anything else again.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Although I&#x27;ve used skin Ceutical Retinal products before w/o any problem this stuff turned my skin red, itchy and pealing. Tried to return the other totally unused tubes but was refused by seller.</li>
            <li> I started using these little sample tubes 5 months ago to remedy acne flare ups I tended to get around my mouth, especially near my period. The first couple weeks I used my skinceuticals, my face broke out even more noticeably, and the skin in my t-zone become dry and flaky. I had, however, read that this would happen and I persisted in using a pea sized dab of the cream before bed, under my normal Oil of Olay night cream. I&#x27;m certainly glad I did! I haven&#x27;t had a pimple or spot in 4 and a half months and, here&#x27;s the kicker, I no longer have any acne scars!! After the second or third month, they disappeared. My skin feels and looks smooth. In fact, at a party with my coworkers the other day one of them commented on how nice my skin is. Everyone agreed and asked how I keep it that way. I told them .05 retinol cream, a nice moisturizing night cream, and lots of sunscreen. If you really want to clear up your skin, try this product and stick with it for at least a month. (Don&#x27;t start using it just before a major event). I don&#x27;t really know how or why it works and I probably don&#x27;t want to, but it does what it says plus some.</li>
            <li> I have the buffet of skin woes - aging, fine lines, plus chronic adult acne.  I purchased this after reading the reviews on another site and expected it to clear my congested skin while it reduced fine lines.  I am no stranger to OTC retinols and have used both Green Cream and Diacneal with success.  This stuff is really strong in comparison so I suspect the grade of retinol is higher.  My skin peeled quite a bit but then settled down.  I saw better results in terms of increasing clarity and reducing fine lines but the trade-off was a nice case of cystic acne.  In addition, the packaging is really cheap and small for the price.  I will stick with Green Cream 9.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best deal on these products.  All three of Skin Ceuticals -- Retinol, CE Ferulic, B Gel -- are fantastic for anyone over 40.  I&#x27;ve tried many, many of such products and this really gets results.  Even my husband remarked for the first time in our marriage that my skin looked \\&quot;particularly good . . . brighter.\\&quot;  The CE Ferulic was recommended to me by an excellent dermatologist who said they use it for their $40 microderm facials.  The moisturizing gel is one of the very few that doesn&#x27;t make my face breakout.  Retinol, obviously, is magic for fine eye lines.  Can&#x27;t beat this grouping.  The only thing you need other than these three is an  exfoliating cleanser (the best for me is Zhen Papaya Face Scrub).</li>
            <li> I received this item today and, although I have yet to try it out, I noticed several things about the packaging: First off, the package was much smaller than what I expected to receive. Secondly, the package says right on it, &amp;#34;Samples only- not for resale&amp;#34;, so please tell my how you are legally reselling them? It&#x27;s obvious Skinceuticals has no idea about this. I purchased these tubes under the impression that they were &amp;#34;Travel size&amp;#34; as indicated in the description of the product. Lastly, there is barely any product in each tube. I paid WAY too much money for the amount of product that I received. I will try this product and update my review once I determine it&#x27;s performance. Right out of the gate though, not impressed.</li>
            <li> Great product!!!  Fresh,  brand new, came really fast!!  The 0.5% is really good but I think my skin needs the 1% product.  Will definetly order again.</li>
            <li> It was marketed as equaling 1oz but in one tube there was hardly enough lotion for one application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it stated on all tubes &amp;#34;SAMPLE NOT FOR RESALE&amp;#34; ANSI paid close to $30 for this product. It was marketed as &amp;#34;Travel&amp;#34; tubes but should have been labeled as &amp;#34;Samples&amp;#34;. It was false advertising.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I cannot believe it took me so long to try Retinol, but I have gotten verbal compliments on my complexion after one week.  This product seems to have a high enough percentage of Retinol that will make a difference.  Although I typically have sensitive skin, I was able to tolerate this for nighttime use without any noticeable irritation. Loaned some to a friend who had a skin abrasion resulting in a dark spot and she saw lightening results in five days using about half a tube.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and for the longest time any product I put on my face will cause it to break out. One day my cousin went to the dermatologist and she was given a sample of this. She asked me to try it. I was scared to try it because of my past experiences with skin care products that I waited to see the effect on her before I tried it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&lt;br /&gt;-This thing solved my pimple problems forever. I have never seen my skin so clear, ever! I&#x27;ve tried the generic retinol (trenitoin) cause it was cheaper but I switched back because it didn&#x27;t work as well as skin ceuticals.&lt;br /&gt;-Dries pimples practically overnight.&lt;br /&gt;-Goes on smoothly, no greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;-It was very drying at first but it got better over time. I started using a moisturizer 30mins after this and that helped a lot. Now I can use it by itself without the drying issue anymore.</li>
            <li> I could see some rather quick results from this product, which isn&#x27;t always the case with skin care products.  I&#x27;d buy this again.  It&#x27;s not harsh, yet effective.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> I remembered purchasing a product with pure retinol in it (not this one) along with a pure plant-based toner and pure vitamin C serum many moons ago (about 17 years) and noticed how well my skin looked; pore reduction, firmness, collagen support, even skin-tone. Granted, I was in my early 30&#x27;s and had minor skin problems (not associated with diet nor nutrition). When I first used this combination, I was very concerned, because my face began to break out and flake. I began to reduce the use of the retinol (used it along with toner and vit C serum 3 times, daily) to about twice-a-week. The following week, my face looked absolutely amazing! The unfortunate thing is that I could no longer find the line of products (discontinued) and never tried anything else again. I decided to try the sample of Skinceuticals Retinol and am very impressed with the results. I have been using the product for about 1 week, and already see the difference in the tone, texture and pore size of my skin  with the use of this remarkable prodcut!  I also like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have perfume or a fragrance which attract bugs! EVERY SINGLE TIME I USE ANYTHING WITH A SCENT/FRAGRANCE BUGS BITE ME, I HATE IT!...lol. It does, however have a slight medicinal-like? scent which may annoy some, but the scent does go away, within a few seconds and bugs don&#x27;t bother me! The only negative is that my face is beginning to flake, so I guess this is a sign that it is regenerating/renewing skin-cells. I will reduce the applications to two/three times, weekly to see if this helps with the flakiness. Also, I will probably purchase pure vit. C serum. I thought about aloe, but my skin doesn&#x27;t seem to like aloe. For me, this extraordinary product delivers and it does so, Quickly!</li>
            <li> Works very well for the OTC retinol cream. Would recomend to my friends and family. Thank you for this great find.</li>
            <li> the product comes with 5 little tubes, and they are labeled as samples.  A little tube lasts for a while.  I use on my face every 2-3 days, and experience no adverse effect.  My face looks fresher than before.  The price is very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31, slightly sensitive skin (very pale), doing what I can to fight fine lines and keep deep wrinkles at bay (preventitive care, basically), and I&#x27;m not one to use retinols (although I tried ROC deep wrinkle treatment - a full tube of it and had decent results). I was going to start with the skinceuticals 1% retinol, but decided after reading the reviews, that it may be too strong. This .5% doesn&#x27;t do much for me. I&#x27;ve been using it nightly for the last few weeks - around my eyes, mouth, and between my brows. No peeling, not really any improvement so far. I&#x27;ll continue to use the little tubes it til they&#x27;re gone, since there&#x27;s noting &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; with it really, but I was hoping for some skin rejunivation (a little peeling is good). Next, I&#x27;ll go for the 1%!</li>
            <li> my Dr. suggested I use this to clear up my skin. I&#x27;m almost 60 years old and still have skin breakouts, blackheads etc. I noticed an improvement after 3 days. I have a way to go to perfect skin, but it&#x27;s better than it has ever been in my life. And I&#x27;ve just used one tube so far. Sweet!</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money, first off the bottles were SOOOOO small. Second I didn&#x27;t see any peeling!!!!! I bought it for my body and tough to lighten area&#x27;s. Let me say I saw nothing, I would not recommend this to anyone especially for those of you with tough skin or hard to lighten area&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin clear. Be careful when using. Wean yourself on this. Your face WILL break out if not. I started once a week for two months then twice a week for one and a half.  Now using it three times and my face is clear and smooth. Don&#x27;t think because it&#x27;s working great at the rate you are using it that you can use it more frequently. Let your face get use to it. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I took these little jewels with me on vacation. They fit perfectly in a small travel pouch and were very practical to open and use.&lt;br /&gt;You wake up with fresher looking skin than when you went to bed with. Terrific product.</li>
            <li> Skinceuticals is a fantastic product line and this product works for me as well as Retin-A did and I don&#x27;t need a prescription. I will probably get the 1.0 % next as I love the way it keeps the skin looking renewed daily. I am a 55 yr old woman with hyper-pigmentation problems and this works wonders at keeping skin bright and even toned, however you must use SUNSCREEN with any product that removes old, dead skin cells. I would highly recommend this product for people who loved using Retin-A or if you are in need of a brighter, more even skin tone.</li>
            <li> I purchased the samples of the Skinceuticals Retinol.  I wanted to make sure it worked before purchasing the more expensive package.  My skin looks amazing.  I combined it with the Skinceuticals CF, CE, and B5 and the redness on my face disappeared.  I no longer need foundation.</li>
            <li> Works great, makes my skin soft, and more even.  Only slightly helped with dark spots though. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I opened the tube few minutes ago and, for my surprise, the tube was used!!!</li>
