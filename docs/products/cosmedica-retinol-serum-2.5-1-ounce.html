            <li>Great company, seems like a good product.  </li>
            <li>Always a good idea, no?</li>
            <li>It came safety sealed with good packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also have Vitamin E and collagen that makes it a good serum.</li>
            <li>Received timely appears to be a good product.  </li>
            <li>So when I started using this product, my skin was already in good shape.</li>
            <li>This serum feels great on the skin, absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky or tacky.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>any good results I should say.</li>
            <li>This is a very light scented product that soothes my skin and helps keep my pores looking great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the results .</li>
            <li>This formula is very light, not at all greasy, works great for my combination skin and absorbs into my skin very easily.  </li>
            <li>A Keeper for sure!</li>
            <li>I hope that as I continue to use it my skin tones ever MORE!</li>
            <li>This advanced retinol serum is a maximum strength retinol serum that combines with hyaluronic acid to promote youth- retaining collagen and balanced hydration!!</li>
            <li>I use it because it also helps the fine lines, and I know it feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li>I received a sample to try in order to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own, and not influenced in any way.</li>
            <li>Have noticed a nice difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>but I liked how it made my skin feel after a week.</li>
            <li>Have used this kind of product before.  </li>
            <li>She is super happy and love this product!</li>
            <li>This serum also contains vitamin E, which refines skin tone and texture with its powerful effective boost of amazing antioxidants that make for a healthy beautiful complexion.</li>
            <li>It feels good, and smooth.</li>
            <li>I really love products that include witch hazel since it works amazingly for my skin, but I do know it doesn&#x27;t agree with everyone, so if you are the type to avoid it this product may not be for you.</li>
            <li>I can already see my skin is not as smooth and bright as it was when I was using this serum.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my sister and so far shes been happy!</li>
            <li>More importantly, it makes my skin feel good and adds a nice glow.</li>
            <li>did get this on a promotion for my unbiased opinion, and super happy I did, I only stand by the best products and this is one of them!  </li>
            <li>And best yet, I feel like it&#x27;s barely made a dent in the amount of product in the bottle.</li>
            <li>It smells very lightly of witch hazel, which is what I use for an astringent and toner anyways before I use this product so that scent doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The results - healthy looking and feeling skin that continues to improve with repeated use.</li>
            <li>I feel more confident,</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly, and it&#x27;s amazing to me.</li>
            <li>love it ...</li>
            <li>Love Love it...</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t done that, but it does look and feel a lot better than it did.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I was given this product to try</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m a lifer :-)</li>
            <li>I love it ...</li>
            <li>her and her skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li>I just love it... &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I was able to stop taking my prescription by incorporating retinol serum at night and vitamin C serum in the mornings into my routine.</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding oil.</li>
            <li>I love how it smells and feels.</li>
            <li>Love the pump bottle as opposed to the dropper.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels after using this serum.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes in an amber glass bottle.</li>
            <li>This advanced retinol serum makes your skin look and feel amazing after using it.</li>
            <li>really love this product.</li>
            <li>My face feels better and looks better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s but still have acne prone skin, this stuff has been awesome for that.</li>
            <li>My complexion has never looked better.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and it leaves it looking healthy, feeling smoote, and it evens out my skin tone very nicely.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it&#x27;s mostly organic, but the formula was a bit too strong for me.</li>
            <li>Best product I&#x27;ve ever bought for my skin, and I have tried many other products.</li>
            <li>, it made my skin so smooth, I&#x27;m so pleased</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m more excited about this product than anyone here</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this Cosmedica Skincare Advanced Retinol serum in the mail!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a retinol serum and  must say I am in love!</li>
            <li>This is a little magical bottle of wonderful!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really easy to dispense and apply.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of the composition of the product and the easy routine for application.</li>
            <li>It applies easily because it is</li>
            <li>so it was too strong for me.</li>
            <li>It was too strong for me.</li>
            <li>(thought Cosmedica doesn&#x27;t advertise that) - but apply to the dorsum of the hands twice a day and watch the paperlike appearance, fine lines and brown spots dramatically reduce.</li>
            <li>I notice a reduction in the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li>Retinol which is Vitamin A is touted to improve fine lines, wrinkles, skin texture, and skin tone.  </li>
            <li>My fine lines and wrinkles that aren&#x27;t too severe</li>
            <li>True, some users with severely damaged skin won&#x27;t get the results most will see, but it is amazing how fast this formula does the job it claims to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It even works good on my sensitive skin, which I always worry about when buying skincare products!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pump type bottle, and I use the H.A., then after I feel it tighten, which is awesome, I use the Retinol Serum, which by the way contains other benefits, and I swear it&#x27;s accelerating everything!!</li>
            <li>I end up with smooth, glowing skin, and fewer lines.</li>
            <li>this made my skin feel so smooth.....</li>
            <li>it is 14% and will easily last 4-6 months plus of great pruduct.  </li>
            <li>but, the truth will set you free.   </li>
            <li>Hope you see the light</li>
            <li>I received a sample for review purposes and overall I have found it to be a great product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>No GMO&#x27;s, Cruelty Free and Never Tested On Animals.&lt;br</li>
            <li>received this product for free for the purpose of reviewing.</li>
            <li>This serum is  fragrance free which is important to me.</li>
            <li>I was provided a sample for free  to test and review.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel smooth and refreshed</li>
            <li>product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>if you are sensitive to heavy-scented products I think this is a good fit.</li>
            <li>These product is great it leaves my skin soft and fresh and its not grese at all</li>
            <li>Seems to be working good as far as what my friend has told me</li>
            <li>I feel it keeps my skin clear and gives it a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li>look younger( my actual age) and feel so much more happy with my over all appearance!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a clean retinol serum to help with pimples and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Retinol is great for fading dark spots, preventing wrinkles and softening fine lines.</li>
            <li>I used the entire bottle to give it a fair shot and all I saw was the quality of my skin decline.</li>
            <li>It should last a good while.</li>
            <li>Cosmedica serum is a nice product that leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>The team at Cosmedica Skincare certainly have done their research and worked with the right formulators because once again they have a very fine product whose results are practically guaranteed.</li>
            <li>I will genuinely say, this is the right product for my skin.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t have the great effect of other retinal serums or creams.</li>
            <li>It works well for men, I use this on razor burn and it does a great job around my neck and other tender</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels tighter...like a fresh clean look.</li>
            <li>I think the witch hazel scent dissipates quickly so</li>
            <li>Not very greasy which is what I liked!</li>
            <li>My answer is ABSOLUTELY YES!!  </li>
            <li>Its light , clear gel and odorless and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>So far I think I&#x27;m going to love this serum for my face.</li>
            <li>Complimentary sample provided for review.</li>
            <li>I have been using it and noticed a difference on my laugh lines they are not as noticeable anymore.  </li>
            <li>works well when applied to freshly washed skin before applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This serum will not only help with the above but also includes many amazing ingredients that can unclog your pores, reduces blackheads, boost collagen, smooth and brighten up the appearance of your skin etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just resently got this product, but so far I love it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li>me, loving anything that can help stop the fine lines from coming, or getting rid of the little ones I have now, I have discovered the Retinol Serum.</li>
            <li>It is effective at reducing minor wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Being fair and a natural red head  </li>
            <li>My skin is very soft and smooth after a week of use.</li>
            <li>I have very large pores on my cheeks and chin and many products seem to like to soak into them and make them appear even larger, but this formula doesn&#x27;t do that to my skin, even if I apply it before my foundation.</li>
            <li>Her fine lines is slowly diminishing and her skin is more smooth now.</li>
            <li>love the pump that this comes with, many similar products on the market come with that eye dropper style bottle that I find inconvenient, love the pump so much more!</li>
            <li>This serum offers your skin the ultimate protection you need from many skin problems all us women face from discoloration to fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Ok.... back again.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a light , clear gel.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with all the products, but the Retinol really put the icing on the cake!  </li>
            <li>Serums penatrate better but, 2.5% slightly above a face clothe.  </li>
            <li>You BETTER HAVE SUNSCREEN ON THE NEXT DAY</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I am changing my review from 4 stars to 5 stars after completing my first bottle of this serum.</li>
            <li>you never know if you&#x27;re getting a genuine product, so I&#x27;m glad that this is sold directly by the manufacturer and not a third party distributor.</li>
            <li>It made my skin tingly on first application  </li>
            <li>It feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>With this serum it is just is naturally fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>Affordable and saw the difference within the first week.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Personally, this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all - the product needs to stay safe on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different retinol and anti wrinkle creams over the years and never had any results...</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li>Crows feet disappearing, eyes look younger, whole face more defined</li>
            <li>I ordered this new advance retinol serum and was surprised to get it so quickly !</li>
            <li>/&gt; - Helps my skin to be super soft</li>
            <li>I wanted to use it for a few weeks first, and now that I have, I can honestly say I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>No, I do not look 20 again but it has certainly helped.</li>
            <li>/&gt; - Is starting to decrease my fine lines and wrinkles&lt;</li>
            <li>so really couldn&#x27;t say if it was helping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really used anything like these things before, and I&#x27;m so glad that I have been introduced to products that say what they do, and work.  </li>
            <li>Tretnoin has zero buffers, it is the real Vitamin A and COSTCO LOWEST Prescription prices.  </li>
            <li>This serum works really well.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>this serum doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin which is a much for me when purchasing skincare products.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this Cosmedica Skincare advanced retinol serum to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li>I love this new Advanced Retinol Serum by Cosmedica Skincare!&lt;br /&gt;After just a few days of using this product my blackheads were reducing &amp; some going away completely!  </li>
            <li>Will def be buying more of this product and plan to try the other products in their skincare line.</li>
            <li>There are cheaper Alpa Hydroxy Acid in semi active form at Wal-Mart that works much better.  </li>
            <li>I really like it and highly recommend it if your looking to have tone skin.</li>
            <li>Dark spots are fading, and I don&#x27;t break out at all any more.</li>
            <li>bottle is small with a nice pump.</li>
            <li>Great Retinol serum one that actually works and doesn&#x27;t burn your face off in the mean time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>We call those areas the high zones.  </li>
            <li>One thing I also really like about this retinol serum is that being someone with somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It must be noted that the serum does contain preservatives and emulsifiers, all at low level and all are the same used in food generally accepted as safe according to the FDA.</li>
            <li>Is there a way I can receive new one as said 100% satisfaction ?</li>
            <li>This was something new to try and I am running out of options, so I figured, what could it hurt?  </li>
            <li>I always exfoliate first, I just think it helps overall.</li>
            <li>Do not use UVA/UVB TANNING BEDS UNLESS you want to look 50 years old at 30!  </li>
            <li>i tried other brands, but this one definitely better even though the strength is the same 2.5%.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Speaking for men, this Advanced Retinol serum 2.5% actually does resurface the skin of the face and neck (and the tops of hands) that is noticeable on the first few days of usage.</li>
            <li>I recently ran out of the previous retinol serum I had been using, so I was glad to have this one on hand.</li>
            <li>It unclogs pores, supports collagen activity that results in the erasure of fine lines, and in addition to these resurfacing aspects of Retinol the formula also contains the reparative green tea, hyaluronic acid and vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased to say this hasn&#x27;t produced any negative side effects (I have sensitive skin!), and my skin continues to improve over time.</li>
            <li>I bought it hoping it would help clear up acne on my chin.</li>
            <li>it contains tea tree oil which is a natural</li>
            <li>Sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Until about three months ago, I was taking an oral prescription for adult acne from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>it seems my skin is yoo sensitive for it</li>
            <li>I have no particular opinion about this product - I use a lot of things off and on and, not running any strict controls, don&#x27;t know if any or all of them do me some good or no good at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had problems on my nose with blackheads due to my large pores...ummm not anymore!</li>
            <li>, it leaves my skin feeling fresh and firm without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>right wasted probably 60% on mirror every where even as I would try and cup</li>
            <li>Why, 2.5 is so the general public person will not sue.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;ve noticed that my pores appear a little smaller and a bit more tight after using this!</li>
            <li>The consistency isn&#x27;t too thin and the pump lets you easily control the amount that comes out.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great company, seems like a good product.  </li>
            <li> Always a good idea, no?</li>
            <li> It came safety sealed with good packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also have Vitamin E and collagen that makes it a good serum.</li>
            <li> Received timely appears to be a good product.  </li>
            <li> So when I started using this product, my skin was already in good shape.</li>
            <li> This serum feels great on the skin, absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky or tacky.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> any good results I should say.</li>
            <li> This is a very light scented product that soothes my skin and helps keep my pores looking great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the results .</li>
            <li> This formula is very light, not at all greasy, works great for my combination skin and absorbs into my skin very easily.  </li>
            <li> A Keeper for sure!</li>
            <li> I hope that as I continue to use it my skin tones ever MORE!</li>
            <li> This advanced retinol serum is a maximum strength retinol serum that combines with hyaluronic acid to promote youth- retaining collagen and balanced hydration!!</li>
            <li> I use it because it also helps the fine lines, and I know it feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> I received a sample to try in order to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own, and not influenced in any way.</li>
            <li> Have noticed a nice difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> but I liked how it made my skin feel after a week.</li>
            <li> Have used this kind of product before.  </li>
            <li> She is super happy and love this product!</li>
            <li> This serum also contains vitamin E, which refines skin tone and texture with its powerful effective boost of amazing antioxidants that make for a healthy beautiful complexion.</li>
            <li> It feels good, and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really love products that include witch hazel since it works amazingly for my skin, but I do know it doesn&#x27;t agree with everyone, so if you are the type to avoid it this product may not be for you.</li>
            <li> I can already see my skin is not as smooth and bright as it was when I was using this serum.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my sister and so far shes been happy!</li>
            <li> More importantly, it makes my skin feel good and adds a nice glow.</li>
            <li> did get this on a promotion for my unbiased opinion, and super happy I did, I only stand by the best products and this is one of them!  </li>
            <li> And best yet, I feel like it&#x27;s barely made a dent in the amount of product in the bottle.</li>
            <li> It smells very lightly of witch hazel, which is what I use for an astringent and toner anyways before I use this product so that scent doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The results - healthy looking and feeling skin that continues to improve with repeated use.</li>
            <li> I feel more confident,</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly, and it&#x27;s amazing to me.</li>
            <li> love it ...</li>
            <li> Love Love it...</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t done that, but it does look and feel a lot better than it did.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I was given this product to try</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m a lifer :-)</li>
            <li> I love it ...</li>
            <li> her and her skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li> I just love it... &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I was able to stop taking my prescription by incorporating retinol serum at night and vitamin C serum in the mornings into my routine.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding oil.</li>
            <li> I love how it smells and feels.</li>
            <li> Love the pump bottle as opposed to the dropper.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after using this serum.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes in an amber glass bottle.</li>
            <li> This advanced retinol serum makes your skin look and feel amazing after using it.</li>
            <li> really love this product.</li>
            <li> My face feels better and looks better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s but still have acne prone skin, this stuff has been awesome for that.</li>
            <li> My complexion has never looked better.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and it leaves it looking healthy, feeling smoote, and it evens out my skin tone very nicely.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s mostly organic, but the formula was a bit too strong for me.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever bought for my skin, and I have tried many other products.</li>
            <li> , it made my skin so smooth, I&#x27;m so pleased</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m more excited about this product than anyone here</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this Cosmedica Skincare Advanced Retinol serum in the mail!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a retinol serum and  must say I am in love!</li>
            <li> This is a little magical bottle of wonderful!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really easy to dispense and apply.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of the composition of the product and the easy routine for application.</li>
            <li> It applies easily because it is</li>
            <li> so it was too strong for me.</li>
            <li> It was too strong for me.</li>
            <li> (thought Cosmedica doesn&#x27;t advertise that) - but apply to the dorsum of the hands twice a day and watch the paperlike appearance, fine lines and brown spots dramatically reduce.</li>
            <li> I notice a reduction in the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li> Retinol which is Vitamin A is touted to improve fine lines, wrinkles, skin texture, and skin tone.  </li>
            <li> My fine lines and wrinkles that aren&#x27;t too severe</li>
            <li> True, some users with severely damaged skin won&#x27;t get the results most will see, but it is amazing how fast this formula does the job it claims to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It even works good on my sensitive skin, which I always worry about when buying skincare products!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pump type bottle, and I use the H.A., then after I feel it tighten, which is awesome, I use the Retinol Serum, which by the way contains other benefits, and I swear it&#x27;s accelerating everything!!</li>
            <li> I end up with smooth, glowing skin, and fewer lines.</li>
            <li> this made my skin feel so smooth.....</li>
            <li> it is 14% and will easily last 4-6 months plus of great pruduct.  </li>
            <li> but, the truth will set you free.   </li>
            <li> Hope you see the light</li>
            <li> I received a sample for review purposes and overall I have found it to be a great product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> No GMO&#x27;s, Cruelty Free and Never Tested On Animals.&lt;br</li>
            <li> received this product for free for the purpose of reviewing.</li>
            <li> This serum is  fragrance free which is important to me.</li>
            <li> I was provided a sample for free  to test and review.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel smooth and refreshed</li>
            <li> product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> if you are sensitive to heavy-scented products I think this is a good fit.</li>
            <li> These product is great it leaves my skin soft and fresh and its not grese at all</li>
            <li> Seems to be working good as far as what my friend has told me</li>
            <li> I feel it keeps my skin clear and gives it a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li> look younger( my actual age) and feel so much more happy with my over all appearance!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a clean retinol serum to help with pimples and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Retinol is great for fading dark spots, preventing wrinkles and softening fine lines.</li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle to give it a fair shot and all I saw was the quality of my skin decline.</li>
            <li> It should last a good while.</li>
            <li> Cosmedica serum is a nice product that leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> The team at Cosmedica Skincare certainly have done their research and worked with the right formulators because once again they have a very fine product whose results are practically guaranteed.</li>
            <li> I will genuinely say, this is the right product for my skin.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t have the great effect of other retinal serums or creams.</li>
            <li> It works well for men, I use this on razor burn and it does a great job around my neck and other tender</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels tighter...like a fresh clean look.</li>
            <li> I think the witch hazel scent dissipates quickly so</li>
            <li> Not very greasy which is what I liked!</li>
            <li> My answer is ABSOLUTELY YES!!  </li>
            <li> Its light , clear gel and odorless and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> So far I think I&#x27;m going to love this serum for my face.</li>
            <li> Complimentary sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> I have been using it and noticed a difference on my laugh lines they are not as noticeable anymore.  </li>
            <li> works well when applied to freshly washed skin before applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This serum will not only help with the above but also includes many amazing ingredients that can unclog your pores, reduces blackheads, boost collagen, smooth and brighten up the appearance of your skin etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just resently got this product, but so far I love it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li> me, loving anything that can help stop the fine lines from coming, or getting rid of the little ones I have now, I have discovered the Retinol Serum.</li>
            <li> It is effective at reducing minor wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Being fair and a natural red head  </li>
            <li> My skin is very soft and smooth after a week of use.</li>
            <li> I have very large pores on my cheeks and chin and many products seem to like to soak into them and make them appear even larger, but this formula doesn&#x27;t do that to my skin, even if I apply it before my foundation.</li>
            <li> Her fine lines is slowly diminishing and her skin is more smooth now.</li>
            <li> love the pump that this comes with, many similar products on the market come with that eye dropper style bottle that I find inconvenient, love the pump so much more!</li>
            <li> This serum offers your skin the ultimate protection you need from many skin problems all us women face from discoloration to fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Ok.... back again.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a light , clear gel.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with all the products, but the Retinol really put the icing on the cake!  </li>
            <li> Serums penatrate better but, 2.5% slightly above a face clothe.  </li>
            <li> You BETTER HAVE SUNSCREEN ON THE NEXT DAY</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I am changing my review from 4 stars to 5 stars after completing my first bottle of this serum.</li>
            <li> you never know if you&#x27;re getting a genuine product, so I&#x27;m glad that this is sold directly by the manufacturer and not a third party distributor.</li>
            <li> It made my skin tingly on first application  </li>
            <li> It feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> With this serum it is just is naturally fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> Affordable and saw the difference within the first week.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Personally, this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all - the product needs to stay safe on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different retinol and anti wrinkle creams over the years and never had any results...</li>
            <li> Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> Crows feet disappearing, eyes look younger, whole face more defined</li>
            <li> I ordered this new advance retinol serum and was surprised to get it so quickly !</li>
            <li> /&gt; - Helps my skin to be super soft</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it for a few weeks first, and now that I have, I can honestly say I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> No, I do not look 20 again but it has certainly helped.</li>
            <li> /&gt; - Is starting to decrease my fine lines and wrinkles&lt;</li>
            <li> so really couldn&#x27;t say if it was helping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really used anything like these things before, and I&#x27;m so glad that I have been introduced to products that say what they do, and work.  </li>
            <li> Tretnoin has zero buffers, it is the real Vitamin A and COSTCO LOWEST Prescription prices.  </li>
            <li> This serum works really well.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> this serum doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin which is a much for me when purchasing skincare products.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this Cosmedica Skincare advanced retinol serum to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> I love this new Advanced Retinol Serum by Cosmedica Skincare!&lt;br /&gt;After just a few days of using this product my blackheads were reducing &amp; some going away completely!  </li>
            <li> Will def be buying more of this product and plan to try the other products in their skincare line.</li>
            <li> There are cheaper Alpa Hydroxy Acid in semi active form at Wal-Mart that works much better.  </li>
            <li> I really like it and highly recommend it if your looking to have tone skin.</li>
            <li> Dark spots are fading, and I don&#x27;t break out at all any more.</li>
            <li> bottle is small with a nice pump.</li>
            <li> Great Retinol serum one that actually works and doesn&#x27;t burn your face off in the mean time.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> We call those areas the high zones.  </li>
            <li> One thing I also really like about this retinol serum is that being someone with somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It must be noted that the serum does contain preservatives and emulsifiers, all at low level and all are the same used in food generally accepted as safe according to the FDA.</li>
            <li> Is there a way I can receive new one as said 100% satisfaction ?</li>
            <li> This was something new to try and I am running out of options, so I figured, what could it hurt?  </li>
            <li> I always exfoliate first, I just think it helps overall.</li>
            <li> Do not use UVA/UVB TANNING BEDS UNLESS you want to look 50 years old at 30!  </li>
            <li> i tried other brands, but this one definitely better even though the strength is the same 2.5%.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Speaking for men, this Advanced Retinol serum 2.5% actually does resurface the skin of the face and neck (and the tops of hands) that is noticeable on the first few days of usage.</li>
            <li> I recently ran out of the previous retinol serum I had been using, so I was glad to have this one on hand.</li>
            <li> It unclogs pores, supports collagen activity that results in the erasure of fine lines, and in addition to these resurfacing aspects of Retinol the formula also contains the reparative green tea, hyaluronic acid and vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased to say this hasn&#x27;t produced any negative side effects (I have sensitive skin!), and my skin continues to improve over time.</li>
            <li> I bought it hoping it would help clear up acne on my chin.</li>
            <li> it contains tea tree oil which is a natural</li>
            <li> Sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Until about three months ago, I was taking an oral prescription for adult acne from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> it seems my skin is yoo sensitive for it</li>
            <li> I have no particular opinion about this product - I use a lot of things off and on and, not running any strict controls, don&#x27;t know if any or all of them do me some good or no good at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems on my nose with blackheads due to my large pores...ummm not anymore!</li>
            <li> , it leaves my skin feeling fresh and firm without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> right wasted probably 60% on mirror every where even as I would try and cup</li>
            <li> Why, 2.5 is so the general public person will not sue.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;ve noticed that my pores appear a little smaller and a bit more tight after using this!</li>
            <li> The consistency isn&#x27;t too thin and the pump lets you easily control the amount that comes out.  </li>
            <li> There is a very faint scent - nothing that even the most sensitive nose would be bothered by.</li>
            <li> only beef with this order is the incredibly long time it took for delivery.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know but hope springs eternal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it now for not even 2 full weeks and have seen dramatic results in my skin and overall complexion!</li>
            <li> Very little product in the tiny bottle, for the high price.</li>
            <li> She had tried to get me to use retin a creams, but they always made my skin dry, red, and irritated.</li>
            <li> Then once it dries, which isn&#x27;t long, I use the eye cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The benefits of retinol are widely known, especially in this concentration.</li>
            <li> a long way!&lt;br /&gt; - Has helped with my acne&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin you should start with 2xs per week and increase as needed.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft, firm, and glowing!</li>
            <li> Additionally, the pump on the bottle was poorly made, at first product would shoot all over the place, now the pump has ceased working at all</li>
            <li> It is so inexpensive what have you got to loose?</li>
            <li> Just received this item and have been using it for only a few days.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected...</li>
            <li> This serum is on the thin side and absorbs really well.  </li>
            <li> The consistency of this product is not as &amp;#34;liquidy&amp;#34; as some other products I&#x27;ve tried, but not quite a gel either - it&#x27;s somewhere in between.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well,  Not as drying as other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some changes with this serum, i had some dark spots on my arms, and this made them fade a bit, now they&#x27;re not as noticeable ,I will continue to purchase this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already noticed some lightening of dark spots from sun damage.</li>
            <li> I mean, I feel like I look years younger!</li>
            <li> About 7-8 months ago I started using a cosmetic retinol serum, which combined botanicals and other ingredients to help counteract the harsh effects of retin a.</li>
            <li> It is odd to see this along with all the organic ingredients listed.</li>
            <li> Next,the Vitamin C Serums you get from Dermotology is like heavy oil/natural odor, not the water down versions here.  </li>
            <li> - A little goes</li>
            <li> Give it a few weeks before seeing any improvements.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;Organic herbal infusion , Organic aloe barbadensis leaf, Cassia angustifolis seed polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), Hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel), pentylene glycol, phospholipids, retinol, polysorbate 20, potassium phosphate, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carrageenan gum, organi simmondsia, chinensis (jojoba oil), triticum vulgare (wheat germ oil), tocopheroyl acetate (vitamin E)m, organic camellia sinensis (green tea), Wilcrafted resina propoli, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, ethyl hexyl glycerin</li>
            <li> oil)&lt;br /&gt;tocopheroyl acetate (vitamin E)&lt;br /&gt;organic camellia sinensis (green tea)&lt;br /&gt;Wilcrafted resina propoli</li>
            <li> The change isn&#x27;t dramatic, but every little bit helps when you&#x27;ve got big pores.  </li>
            <li> The aloe in this formula is soothing to my skin which is a plus since I am pale and tend to sunburn a lot in spring even with suncare products.  </li>
            <li> So I have been applying it for the past week</li>
            <li> However, of the several I do use, this is the worst dispenser of them all, and really of any I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> It is that so weak.</li>
            <li> We know I&#x27;m addicted to the H.A, ( Hyaluronic Acid) and now the Restorative eye cream, But</li>
            <li> a thin gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is paraben-free.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> Buying skin care products from unfamiliar brands (or even known brands) on Amazon may seem scary-</li>

            <li> I ordered this new advance retinol serum and was surprised to get it so quickly ! I have been using it for a couple of weeks and I already see the difference in my skin. It&#x27;s a great product and can be used morning or night under my moisturizer. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results .</li>
            <li> The team at Cosmedica Skincare certainly have done their research and worked with the right formulators because once again they have a very fine product whose results are practically guaranteed. True, some users with severely damaged skin won&#x27;t get the results most will see, but it is amazing how fast this formula does the job it claims to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking for men, this Advanced Retinol serum 2.5% actually does resurface the skin of the face and neck (and the tops of hands) that is noticeable on the first few days of usage. It unclogs pores, supports collagen activity that results in the erasure of fine lines, and in addition to these resurfacing aspects of Retinol the formula also contains the reparative green tea, hyaluronic acid and vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results - healthy looking and feeling skin that continues to improve with repeated use. It is especially excellent for &#x60;aging hands&#x27; (thought Cosmedica doesn&#x27;t advertise that) - but apply to the dorsum of the hands twice a day and watch the paperlike appearance, fine lines and brown spots dramatically reduce. This company knows the skincare business. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, December 14</li>
            <li> Disappointed I like having serums in pump but mine never came out right wasted probably 60% on mirror every where even as I would try and cup my had over it to prevent so really couldn&#x27;t say if it was helping.Is there a way I can receive new one as said 100% satisfaction ?</li>
            <li> The most incredible Serum THERE IS!  I sampled about 10 products and this one came through!  I am only 25, but look about 40!  I have tried everything.  This was something new to try and I am running out of options, so I figured, what could it hurt?  I will never turn back now!  I feel more confident, look younger( my actual age) and feel so much more happy with my over all appearance!</li>
            <li> Ok.... back again. We know I&#x27;m addicted to the H.A, ( Hyaluronic Acid) and now the Restorative eye cream, But me, loving anything that can help stop the fine lines from coming, or getting rid of the little ones I have now, I have discovered the Retinol Serum. It&#x27;s so great!!   I always exfoliate first, I just think it helps overall. I used my H.A. ( wonderful), then the Restorative Eye Cream ( so wonderful too). I changed things up with the addition of the Retinol. I use it because it also helps the fine lines, and I know it feels great on my skin. It&#x27;s a pump type bottle, and I use the H.A., then after I feel it tighten, which is awesome, I use the Retinol Serum, which by the way contains other benefits, and I swear it&#x27;s accelerating everything!! I pump some in my hand, it&#x27;s a light , clear gel. And odorless, and I \\&quot;pat\\&quot; it on my face, all over, and my neck too. I don&#x27;t want to forget that area. It goes on so smoothly, and it&#x27;s amazing to me. With adding the Retinol, and it does accelerate the process of vanishing lines. It feels good, and smooth. But again..... DOES IT WORK? My answer is ABSOLUTELY YES!!  Then once it dries, which isn&#x27;t long, I use the eye cream. I end up with smooth, glowing skin, and fewer lines. I&#x27;ve never really used anything like these things before, and I&#x27;m so glad that I have been introduced to products that say what they do, and work.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with all the products, but the Retinol really put the icing on the cake!  I won&#x27;t give this one up either.  I&#x27;m amazed with the results. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s, and I will be an addict to these products because they work! Plus, they don&#x27;t cost a fortune. Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!! I love these!! And like I said the Retinol is the icing on the cake because it has the collagen, and the Vitamin E, and it accelerates the process!!  A Keeper for sure!</li>
            <li> Came with excellent reviews. I have been using for a week and as soon as you put this on you  can feel your skin tightening. So far I think I&#x27;m going to love this serum for my face.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It makes my skin so soft, firm, and glowing! It even works good on my sensitive skin, which I always worry about when buying skincare products! *I received a sample to try in order to give my honest and unbiased opinion. The views in this review are completely my own!*</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome. After two weeks twice daily usage there is a noticeable difference. Crows feet disappearing, eyes look younger, whole face more defined</li>
            <li> love it ... this made my skin feel so smooth..... Love Love it... I think I&#x27;m more excited about this product than anyone here, it made my skin so smooth, I&#x27;m so pleased , I&#x27;m so impressed and 3 of my friends have already ordered, I&#x27;ve recommended it to my Aesthetic lady. Y&#x27;all continue to make this because I won&#x27;t stop buying</li>
            <li> Just received this item and have been using it for only a few days. My skin already looks healthier. I bought it hoping it would help clear up acne on my chin. It hasn&#x27;t done that, but it does look and feel a lot better than it did. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> This serum absorbs well and isn&#x27;t sticky or oily.  The consistency isn&#x27;t too thin and the pump lets you easily control the amount that comes out.  Don&#x27;t expect overnight results.  Give it a few weeks before seeing any improvements.  Complimentary sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> There are cheaper Alpa Hydroxy Acid in semi active form at Wal-Mart that works much better.  Have gotten the Retin A prescription for years and yes miss my Retin A with a passion. The generic Trention is the cats meow!  This AHA Shampoo it is 14% and will easily last 4-6 months plus of great pruduct.  Go to ABC 2000 Alpha Hydroxy Acid Merz Pharmacy if you do not believe me.  Been in Dermotology Reserve 20 plus years. Serums penatrate better but, 2.5% slightly above a face clothe.  In A Dermotology office have them write for Tretnoin and it is 206% stronger.  Why, 2.5 is so the general public person will not sue. It is that so weak. Tretnoin has zero buffers, it is the real Vitamin A and COSTCO LOWEST Prescription prices.  Not trying to diminish any sales goals  but, the truth will set you free.   Sunlight actually deactivates  the Tretnoin which is why, only at bed time.  You BETTER HAVE SUNSCREEN ON THE NEXT DAY OR YOU WILL BURN ON THE CHEEKS, NOSE AND FORHEAD!  We call those areas the high zones.  Sunscreen, is the fountain of youth  Know that is sobering ,the truth is, Rein A/Tretnoin, Alpa Hydroxy Acid,Chemical Peels are not the fountain of youth.   Next,the Vitamin C Serums you get from Dermotology is like heavy oil/natural odor, not the water down versions here.  Ever wonder how every Vitamin C is, &amp;#34;Highest Concentration&amp;#34; How is that possible?   We sell MD FORTE and Obagi named after Mohs Cancer MD.Those 2 we sell and they work.  Just Remember these:  1,SUNSCREEN   2,Sunscreen   3, Do not use UVA/UVB TANNING BEDS UNLESS you want to look 50 years old at 30!  No UVA/UVB HAS EVER BEEN CERTIFIED BY THE ACADEMY OF DERMOTOLOGY!   ANOTHER SOBERING MOMENT   YOUR, amicable research  specialist   Bill  Hope you see the light</li>
            <li> been using this for a week and I already see awesome results! I mean, I feel like I look years younger! I am so glad I was given this product to try so I could let everybody know if it works or not. It does! And best yet, I feel like it&#x27;s barely made a dent in the amount of product in the bottle. I think I&#x27;m a lifer :-)</li>
            <li> This is a very light scented product that soothes my skin and helps keep my pores looking great.  It smells very lightly of witch hazel, which is what I use for an astringent and toner anyways before I use this product so that scent doesn&#x27;t bother me. I really love products that include witch hazel since it works amazingly for my skin, but I do know it doesn&#x27;t agree with everyone, so if you are the type to avoid it this product may not be for you. I think the witch hazel scent dissipates quickly so if you are sensitive to heavy-scented products I think this is a good fit. I have very large pores on my cheeks and chin and many products seem to like to soak into them and make them appear even larger, but this formula doesn&#x27;t do that to my skin, even if I apply it before my foundation. In fact, I&#x27;ve noticed that my pores appear a little smaller and a bit more tight after using this! The change isn&#x27;t dramatic, but every little bit helps when you&#x27;ve got big pores.  The aloe in this formula is soothing to my skin which is a plus since I am pale and tend to sunburn a lot in spring even with suncare products.  This formula is very light, not at all greasy, works great for my combination skin and absorbs into my skin very easily.  I received a sample for review purposes and overall I have found it to be a great product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t review this do to my code did my work</li>
            <li> Everything I expected...</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotional item.  Since I have been using something else during the day I began to use this during the evening before going to bed.  I think that this is the time that our bodies heal from our daily events.  So I have been applying it for the past week and I have always suffered from the wrinkles on my forehead and the crows feet.  I feel that during my use it has smoothen those areas. I hope that as I continue to use it my skin tones ever MORE! I really like it and highly recommend it if your looking to have tone skin.</li>
            <li> Great Retinol serum one that actually works and doesn&#x27;t burn your face off in the mean time. No drying out either!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it - aging has it consequences and wrinkles are a part of that. That being said, there are ways to help minimize the wrinkles. For me, this is one such product. Even my niece, without my even asking, noticed an improvement in my skin. No, I do not look 20 again but it has certainly helped. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> Not very greasy which is what I liked!</li>
            <li> This serum works really well. I have been using it and noticed a difference on my laugh lines they are not as noticeable anymore.  The serum comes with a pump so it&#x27;s really easy to dispense and apply. It does not have a scent. I received it to reveiew.</li>
            <li> I have no particular opinion about this product - I use a lot of things off and on and, not running any strict controls, don&#x27;t know if any or all of them do me some good or no good at all. However, of the several I do use, this is the worst dispenser of them all, and really of any I&#x27;ve used in the past. It has a pump top which squirts the stuff out in a random way. A catch as catch can way. Maybe they should send this back to design, packaging or what ever group decides this sort of thing and have them TRY using it before they sell it. Always a good idea, no?</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin. This is the best retinol product! I have no irritation whatsoever and it is working miracles for me.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the serum.  Still work on the spot and will let you  know the result of it!</li>
            <li> I know skin care products work differently for everyone, this serum did nothing for me. I have noticed no difference whatsoever in the appearance of my skin since I began using it in June. Additionally, the pump on the bottle was poorly made, at first product would shoot all over the place, now the pump has ceased working at all and I have to unscrew the bottle to get serum. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product. It did arrive within a couple days and package was simple and all together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed and will defiantly will consider this product again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a clean retinol serum to help with pimples and wrinkles. This works well, it leaves my skin feeling fresh and firm without feeling greasy. I have oily skin so I use this daily. If you have dry skin you should start with 2xs per week and increase as needed.</li>
            <li> These product is great it leaves my skin soft and fresh and its not grese at all I love it ...</li>
            <li> The consistency of this product is not as &amp;#34;liquidy&amp;#34; as some other products I&#x27;ve tried, but not quite a gel either - it&#x27;s somewhere in between. There is a very faint scent - nothing that even the most sensitive nose would be bothered by. It came safety sealed with good packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefits of retinol are widely known, especially in this concentration. I like that it contains tea tree oil which is a natural soother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only beef with this order is the incredibly long time it took for delivery. I am a Prime customer and it took 9 days to receive it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cosmedica Skincare provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I am changing my review from 4 stars to 5 stars after completing my first bottle of this serum. I finished the bottle about 2 weeks ago and started using another retinol serum. I can already see my skin is not as smooth and bright as it was when I was using this serum. For that reason I wanted to update this review to say YES YES YES buy this product. I am making another purchase of it.</li>
            <li> excellent product. works well when applied to freshly washed skin before applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my sister and so far shes been happy! This serum works well with her and her skin looks so much better. This is part of her beauty regimen now. Its light , clear gel and odorless and easy to apply. It also have Vitamin E and collagen that makes it a good serum. Her fine lines is slowly diminishing and her skin is more smooth now. She is super happy and love this product!</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt; - A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt; - Has helped with my acne&lt;br /&gt; - Has also helped reduce my acne scarring&lt;br /&gt; - Is starting to decrease my fine lines and wrinkles&lt;br /&gt; - Helps my skin to be super soft&lt;br /&gt; - Contains No Alcohol, No Parabens, Plant Based, No GMO&#x27;s, Cruelty Free and Never Tested On Animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt; - None so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;Organic herbal infusion , Organic aloe barbadensis leaf, Cassia angustifolis seed polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), Hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel), pentylene glycol, phospholipids, retinol, polysorbate 20, potassium phosphate, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carrageenan gum, organi simmondsia, chinensis (jojoba oil), triticum vulgare (wheat germ oil), tocopheroyl acetate (vitamin E)m, organic camellia sinensis (green tea), Wilcrafted resina propoli, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, ethyl hexyl glycerin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free for the purpose of reviewing. All opinions are my own, and not influenced in any way.</li>
            <li> It works wonders on me I just love it... &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Have noticed a nice difference in my skin.  Will Continue to use and purchase.</li>
            <li> Sensitive skin so it was too strong for me. Being fair and a natural red head  It was too strong for me. It probably works well for others.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> Received timely appears to be a good product.  Time will tell</li>
            <li> My skin is very soft and smooth after a week of use. I notice a reduction in the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li> I recently ran out of the previous retinol serum I had been using, so I was glad to have this one on hand. I received a discount on this product in exchange for trying it out and sharing my opinions. I wanted to use it for a few weeks first, and now that I have, I can honestly say I have no complaints. Until about three months ago, I was taking an oral prescription for adult acne from my dermatologist. She had tried to get me to use retin a creams, but they always made my skin dry, red, and irritated. About 7-8 months ago I started using a cosmetic retinol serum, which combined botanicals and other ingredients to help counteract the harsh effects of retin a. I was able to stop taking my prescription by incorporating retinol serum at night and vitamin C serum in the mornings into my routine. So when I started using this product, my skin was already in good shape. I&#x27;m pleased to say this hasn&#x27;t produced any negative side effects (I have sensitive skin!), and my skin continues to improve over time. Dark spots are fading, and I don&#x27;t break out at all any more. Buying skin care products from unfamiliar brands (or even known brands) on Amazon may seem scary- you never know if you&#x27;re getting a genuine product, so I&#x27;m glad that this is sold directly by the manufacturer and not a third party distributor.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t have the great effect of other retinal serums or creams. I used the entire bottle to give it a fair shot and all I saw was the quality of my skin decline.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding oil. I use it every morning and its perfect. I love how it smells and feels. Great purchase. Thanks.</li>
            <li> It made my skin tingly on first application  but I liked how it made my skin feel after a week. Thank you for letting me review product.</li>
            <li> I revived this for my review. I am a fan of the composition of the product and the easy routine for application.</li>
            <li> Have used this kind of product before.  Seems to work well,  Not as drying as other products I have used.</li>
            <li> Combined with the hydrolinic serum works great</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever bought for my skin, and I have tried many other products. I will genuinely say, this is the right product for my skin. My skin is very sensitive and it leaves it looking healthy, feeling smoote, and it evens out my skin tone very nicely. I will continue buying this product!</li>
            <li> Love the pump bottle as opposed to the dropper.</li>
            <li> Great company, seems like a good product.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know but hope springs eternal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks and I like it.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a great deal of difference, but I do like the way it makes my face feel.  It feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Awesome retinol serum. Retinol is great for fading dark spots, preventing wrinkles and softening fine lines. This serum feels great on the skin, absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky or tacky.&lt;br /&gt;I love the pump that this comes with, many similar products on the market come with that eye dropper style bottle that I find inconvenient, love the pump so much more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some changes with this serum, i had some dark spots on my arms, and this made them fade a bit, now they&#x27;re not as noticeable ,I will continue to purchase this product</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after using this serum. Retinol which is Vitamin A is touted to improve fine lines, wrinkles, skin texture, and skin tone.  This serum is  fragrance free which is important to me. I suffer from migraines that are sometimes triggered by different fragrances. With this serum it is just is naturally fragrance free.  This serum is on the thin side and absorbs really well.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy or sticky. I love that it comes in an amber glass bottle. It should last a good while. I was provided a sample for free  to test and review.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t do anything at all. it was not expensive but still what a waste of my time!</li>
            <li> Seems to be working good as far as what my friend has told me</li>
            <li> As someone that’s always looking for beauty products to help improve the appearance of my skin I was excited to receive this Cosmedica Skincare Advanced Retinol serum in the mail! After testing this retinol serum out for myself I have to say it works wonders!! This advanced retinol serum makes your skin look and feel amazing after using it. This serum offers your skin the ultimate protection you need from many skin problems all us women face from discoloration to fine lines and wrinkles. This advanced retinol serum is a maximum strength retinol serum that combines with hyaluronic acid to promote youth- retaining collagen and balanced hydration!! This serum also contains vitamin E, which refines skin tone and texture with its powerful effective boost of amazing antioxidants that make for a healthy beautiful complexion. This retinol serum is bond to be your go to serum for all your skin care needs.

I definitely recommend this Cosmedica Skincare advanced retinol serum to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> really love this product. i tried other brands, but this one definitely better even though the strength is the same 2.5%.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel smooth and refreshed</li>
            <li> Affordable and saw the difference within the first week.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Cosmedica serum is a nice product that leaves my skin feeling soft. It is effective at reducing minor wrinkles. More importantly, it makes my skin feel good and adds a nice glow. It works well for men, I use this on razor burn and it does a great job around my neck and other tender areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is small with a nice pump. The serum is essentially odorless. It applies easily because it is a thin gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is paraben-free. It is made in the United States. It must be noted that the serum does contain preservatives and emulsifiers, all at low level and all are the same used in food generally accepted as safe according to the FDA. It is odd to see this along with all the organic ingredients listed. Personally, this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all - the product needs to stay safe on the shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Organic herbal infusion&lt;br /&gt;Organic aloe barbadensis leaf&lt;br /&gt;Cassia angustifolis seed polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid)&lt;br /&gt;Hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel)&lt;br /&gt;pentylene glycol&lt;br /&gt;phospholipids&lt;br /&gt;retinol&lt;br /&gt;polysorbate 20&lt;br /&gt;potassium phosphate&lt;br /&gt;hydroxyethyl cellulose&lt;br /&gt;carrageenan gum&lt;br /&gt;organi simmondsia chinensis (jojoba oil)&lt;br /&gt;triticum vulgare (wheat germ oil)&lt;br /&gt;tocopheroyl acetate (vitamin E)&lt;br /&gt;organic camellia sinensis (green tea)&lt;br /&gt;Wilcrafted resina propoli&lt;br /&gt;sodium benzoate&lt;br /&gt;potassium sorbate&lt;br /&gt;ethyl hexyl glycerin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s mostly organic, but the formula was a bit too strong for me. It dried my skin out something terrible. It may work for someone else though. It&#x27;s definitely worth the shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> I must say, I have tried everything. I can not believe this product. IT DOES WORK. I do not even remember how I discovered it. Try for your self. It is so inexpensive what have you got to loose?</li>
            <li> I still use this every day. . Retinol is supposed to be very good for the skin and I do feel that it has made a difference but don&#x27;t expect drastic changes.</li>
            <li> I love this new Advanced Retinol Serum by Cosmedica Skincare!&lt;br /&gt;After just a few days of using this product my blackheads were reducing &amp; some going away completely!  I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and still get acne and it&#x27;s all almost gone now just from using this serum!  My fine lines and wrinkles that aren&#x27;t too severe it has worked wonders on!&lt;br /&gt;It also goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue behind.  My face feels refreshed after using the Retinol Serum.  My face feels better and looks better.  It also doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.  And they have 100% money back guarantee so you&#x27;ve got nothing to lose!&lt;br /&gt;I did get this on a promotion for my unbiased opinion, and super happy I did, I only stand by the best products and this is one of them!  Will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I just resently got this product, but so far I love it. It leaves my skin feeling fresh and moisturized. I am eager to see how it does on my wrinkles over time. I will update my review and let you know.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a retinol serum and  must say I am in love! I use it day and night and I haven&#x27;t had one breakout since I started using it. I feel it keeps my skin clear and gives it a nice healthy glow. Great product will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> This is a little magical bottle of wonderful! I&#x27;ve used many different retinol and anti wrinkle creams over the years and never had any results...any good results I should say. This stuff is awesome! I&#x27;ve been using it now for not even 2 full weeks and have seen dramatic results in my skin and overall complexion! My skin looks and feels tighter...like a fresh clean look. I&#x27;ve already noticed some lightening of dark spots from sun damage. I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s but still have acne prone skin, this stuff has been awesome for that. My complexion has never looked better. I&#x27;ve always had problems on my nose with blackheads due to my large pores...ummm not anymore! Pores gone! I can&#x27;t say enough about this product! It says to use one pump and pat it into your skin. I actually use 2 pumps, one for face and one for neck &amp; chest area. Will def be buying more of this product and plan to try the other products in their skincare line. Happy shopping!</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  Will order again.  Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> Did not see any noticeable help to my skin. Very little product in the tiny bottle, for the high price.</li>
            <li> it seems my skin is yoo sensitive for it</li>
            <li> .This product is fantastic. I told no one I was using this, even my husband and all I hear is &amp;#34;something is different about you&amp;#34; did you change your makeup or something? You are looking a lot younger than the last time I saw you. I am not going to say anything since it&#x27;s only been two weeks. I also added once a week the vitamin c and hyauronic acid to my regiment.</li>
