            <li> I have found though that the IBD colors don&#x27;t last as long as other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used, Sally Hansen and Sensationail, but for half the price you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>

            <li> Beautiful color! Perfect shade for my Christmas nails.

            <li> In an effort to save I little money, I went online looking for nail polish to add to my supply. I found this brand (IBD) and decided to give it a go. It got here in a timely manner and was shipped in a bubble envelope. The first coat I put on made me cringe a little bit. I looked like a dark pink with red sparkles. But after a second coat it&#x27;s true color emerged. It&#x27;s a BEAUTIFUL rich red!! The sparkles give it so much depth and I have got NUMEROUS compliments on the color! I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase and will continue to by the IBD brand!</li>
            <li> I have only used gel polishes a couple times for manicures, but this shade beats any red lacquer I have ever seen!  Spectacular shade, and the glitter is just the right amount.  Would recommend for anyone!  Love this color!</li>
            <li> This color is a true red with tons of red glitter. It covers perfectly in two coats and holds up really well. Definitely a go-to color for the holidays, for my clients.</li>
            <li> Love this Cosmic Red glittery color! Applies just as well as Gelish, which is all I have ever used. Cures with my LED and worked along with the other Gelish products like the phbond, foundation, and top coat. Will be buying more colors! Great price! 1/2 that of Gelish brand :)</li>
            <li> Great over other colors to give a holographic affect, will be great holiday color by itself too</li>
            <li> It takes 2 coats to get the red I want, but I love the sparkle.  The price and bottle size are great compared to other brands.  It&#x27;s one of my current favorites!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite polish! Such a true red with a hint of glittery sparkle.... Perfect color and a great bargain. I have tried several brands of the gel polish and this one seems to stay on longer. I usually do three thinner coats to get a better coverage.</li>
            <li> I love nail polish and have a nice collection of polish but this is my favorite I get lots of compliments and wear it all the time</li>
            <li> Super sparkly polish. I mainly use it for my toes! I have gotten lots of compliments on this color! (:</li>
            <li> So pretty! Bright red vibrant color with sparkles. I usually put on two coats to make sure it covers evenly. Perfect for Christmas and Valentines Day!</li>
            <li> Awesome holiday color!</li>
            <li> I ordered this color, but received a different but also pretty red called bing cherries. I wanted this red because I used it in nail school and I loved the glitter in it. The bing cherries color is also gorgeous and I am not disappointed in it so I didn&#x27;t bother to return it. I will probably buy this color again sometime but hopefully I will get it and not a different red again.</li>
