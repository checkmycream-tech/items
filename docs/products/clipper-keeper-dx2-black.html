            <li>He&#x27;s in love.  </li>
            <li>my husband was so satisfied with this case</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so much better for him to have at the shop with his clippers in</li>
            <li>it hold 6 clippers but 8 or 10 would be better.</li>
            <li>Love this case.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Bought this about a year ago and honestly its still good as new!</li>
            <li>It keeps my clippers safe , its easy to set up a passcode .one</li>
            <li>i have about 5 clippers in it and has alot more space to fit more.</li>
            <li>He spoke of needing a way to keep his clippers safe and secure when he traveled to his clients locations..</li>
            <li>Nice case worth spending for..</li>
            <li>It does NOT feel cheap at all.</li>
            <li>However, I use it to secure all of my clippers, guards, and blades when I am taking a break and/or moving around.  </li>
            <li>The design is great but the quality is very low.</li>
            <li>Really cool</li>
            <li>This is a great product for anybody out there that cuts hair on the go &amp; has a few clippers/trimmers on hand.</li>
            <li>The mirror has come in handy several</li>
            <li>Well worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Pure awesomeness!</li>
            <li>However, I still love it and get several complements on it wherever I carry it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>For the price it could be a little bigger, feels ok once everything is in place but taken apart the two halves of the case feels light and cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be gentle with her</li>
            <li>Can fit about 3 clippers, all your guards, product, and has enough room for me to fold my cape in there.  </li>
            <li>; in the back as they allow me to secure my equipment without having to unplug and put everything away.  </li>
            <li>The two side slots, aren&#x27;t adjustable and it will not fit the wahl attachment set with their own housing</li>
            <li>I wanted him to not only arrive with a stylish appearance but a professional one as well..</li>
            <li>being said I just nitpicked because he final cost with shipping to Canada is a bit high and although this awesome case looks expensive</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>he meets new clientele</li>
            <li>The case is really nice, but the locks are cheaply made, and I am very unhappy with their customer service.</li>
            <li>Not to heavy but just the right weight.</li>
            <li>Now I have to pretty much destroy the case to get my clippers and blades out.</li>

            <li> Really cool i have about 5 clippers in it and has alot more space to fit more. Jas a really great quality.</li>
            <li> Great customer service and my husband loves it!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this case for my son for Christmas. One of the locks jammed, and I couldn&#x27;t get a response from&lt;br /&gt;Future Horizon. The case is really nice, but the locks are cheaply made, and I am very unhappy with their customer service.</li>
            <li> BEST CASE EVER WHAT MORE CAN I SAY! ALL BARBERS SHOULD HAVE ONE PROS &amp; STUDENTS. IT WILL PROTECT YOUR TOOLS NICELY.</li>
            <li> I have been waiting and keeping up to date of this case. Finally it is back on Amazon and purchased it to use. I just got it in and delivered early than expected. I am satisfied with purchase, at the moment can not say any thing bad bout this. Liked what I saw on YouTube and had to get it. If you want to learn how to set combination do not follow the instructions that is given. Go onto YouTube and and type in Clipper Keeper combination, it gives a better detail how to set it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must have buy if your looking. . . just get it. . .</li>
            <li> Great way to keep track of your tools! LOVE!!!!</li>
            <li> It keeps my clippers safe , its easy to set up a passcode .one of the best investments I&#x27;ve made to my barber career</li>
            <li> For the price it could be a little bigger, feels ok once everything is in place but taken apart the two halves of the case feels light and cheap. Mind the holes at the bottom some small stuff could fall out. The two side slots, aren&#x27;t adjustable and it will not fit the wahl attachment set with their own housing when closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said I just nitpicked because he final cost with shipping to Canada is a bit high and although this awesome case looks expensive you know this thing isn&#x27;t meant for wear and tear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be gentle with her</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a barber on the go, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this.  It does NOT feel cheap at all. Looks really good. Can fit about 3 clippers, all your guards, product, and has enough room for me to fold my cape in there.  It also comes with some egg foam to product your investment when walking with it.  5 STARS.</li>
            <li> Over all love it. Only bad thing I have to say. And it not to bad when u take cover off sometimes it&#x27;s little hard to put it back on...</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband he love it quality! !!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this clipper keeper for the Barber in my life...He spoke of needing a way to keep his clippers safe and secure when he traveled to his clients locations..Being a mobile barber I wanted him to not only arrive with a stylish appearance but a professional one as well..The clipper keeper helped pull off both looks..&lt;br /&gt;When he meets new clientele they know that he is about his business and professional to say the least..Best investment made for a Barber whether its in a shop or on the go...</li>
            <li> My husband is a barber/barbershop owner and died and went to Heaven when I ordered this for him! He&#x27;s in love.  Pure awesomeness! Great quality,  very sturdy,  arrived ahead of schedule! All barbers need one!</li>
            <li> Nice case worth spending for..</li>
            <li> one of the locks from the case got stuck and couldn&#x27;t open it! So had to open it with a screwdriver</li>
            <li> Great product hoping it was a lil better bit exactly as I expected and described</li>
            <li> my husband was so satisfied with this case it&#x27;s so much better for him to have at the shop with his clippers in</li>
            <li> wish it was a little bit bigger. it hold 6 clippers but 8 or 10 would be better. I like the fact I can carry my clippers with me.</li>
            <li> Love this case. It is sturdy and holds all clippers in place. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I use this case along with a travel case.  It fits in the travel case quite nicely.  However, I use it to secure all of my clippers, guards, and blades when I am taking a break and/or moving around.  It does the trick for that and keeps everything in place as I travel from location to location.  I especially like the cord &amp;#34;holes&amp;#34; in the back as they allow me to secure my equipment without having to unplug and put everything away.  The mirror has come in handy several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that this can not be my only means of transporting everything I need.  It has enough room for about 4-5 sets of clippers and some misc items on the sides.  However, I still love it and get several complements on it wherever I carry it.  Well worth the buy.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anybody out there that cuts hair on the go &amp; has a few clippers/trimmers on hand. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this about a year ago and honestly its still good as new! Best investment I&#x27;ve made to keep all my clippers and stuff inside</li>
            <li> This Is a good product to have. Keeps everything organized. Not to heavy but just the right weight. So I recommend this product if ur a barber. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves it. Thanks!</li>
            <li> The design is great but the quality is very low. Most of the case including the terrible locks are plastic. Not worth the money. Now I have to pretty much destroy the case to get my clippers and blades out. Sending this piece of s@#t Back!!!!! I was expecting a quality made case for over $100 but I was ripped off.</li>
