            <li>Works wonderfully</li>
            <li>Happy customer!!</li>
            <li>Very good stuff!!!</li>
            <li>great stuff, use it every day!  </li>
            <li>best out there, I have tried probably 20-25 scrubs.</li>
            <li>So good I had to repurchase it!</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I couldnt believe how much better my skin is looking!</li>
            <li>i am in love with this!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line - I love the scent, I liked that it was a smoothing product that seemed to cleanse well.</li>
            <li>The beads scrub your face good to make it feel like a clean face.</li>
            <li>The cleanser lathers up nicely and easily and doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes if it does get</li>
            <li>Very gentle on my skin and cleared my face up within a week!!!</li>
            <li>However, I bought this stuff about a week ago and most of my acne has cleared up.</li>
            <li>This is a simply ok face wash/scrub.  </li>
            <li>This scrub was okay, but I was expecting more.</li>
            <li>As for the product itself, my acne did not worsen, but it did not get much better either.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser</li>
            <li>, if you do decide to buy this, make sure to pair it with the toner.</li>
            <li>, it has a great scent which leaves you feeling very refreshed.</li>
            <li>I use this every morning to wash my face and love the feeling.  </li>
            <li>Better luck to anyone else who decides to use it</li>
            <li>I had great results using it in combination with Neutrogena Clear Pore Oil-Eliminating Astringent.</li>
            <li>and you want to be able to remove them quickly or even better, over night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The absolute best scrub, lathers up richly, you feel the tiny scrub granules, refreshing orange citrus</li>
            <li>Sure it cleared up my acne, but it looked like I had sunburn all over my face after the first 3 days of use!</li>
            <li>Great for in the shower for my  pre teen daughter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena for most of my teenage years when my acne was most prominent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years and found in the times my face decides to break out, it leaves my face feeling clean but</li>
            <li>Bought this for my teenage daughter when she requested a good face cleaner that helps with blackheads.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great facial cleanser for someone with the traits I just described, I would highly recommend Clarisonic&#x27;s acne clarifying cleanser!</li>
            <li>(Disclaimer - I am also pregnant, so hormones may also be playing a role in making this product intolerable to my skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very gentle!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your face very much.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating beads to a great job of removing dead skin without irritating it which is great.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin clear and totally smooth.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I finally found this.</li>
            <li>- everyone&#x27;s skin is different and you may have luck with this product :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for people with mild acne.</li>
            <li>you have mild acne like me (3-5 spots on avg), then I highly recommend using Neutrogena Naturals Scrub.</li>
            <li>Love this face wash, especially when combined with the moisturizer, keeps my blemishes down &amp; my face smooth!!</li>
            <li>It really disappoints me.</li>
            <li>combination of the two have really saved my skin.</li>
            <li>Nice scrub for a everyday wash.</li>
            <li>This particular wash never had any particular effect on my skin (compared to Neutrogena Naturals, Blackhead Eliminating Scrub, and Acne Stress Control Cleanser).</li>
            <li>I have the occasional mild blemish and this seems to help keep this under control.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been suffering with acne for most of my life, starting at my teen years.  </li>
            <li>I still had black heads and little bumps that i wasnt happy with</li>
            <li>I think the product may be too new and could use some improvements.</li>
            <li>so I think I was a pretty basic user of this product.</li>
            <li>use along with the Rapid Clear Toner, Acne Gel &amp; Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Then I started using the rapid clear pads and my face cleared up like you wouldnt believe.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product if you have stressed skin or adult acne like myself.</li>
            <li>I read about this product in a magazine article where it was recommended along with this product La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo Dual Action Acne Treatment http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004L8J15C/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, due to the fact that my face is now fire-engine red (and super itchy, to boot!), I won&#x27;t be using this any longer.</li>
            <li>I bought this while my main face wash was on back order to hope it worked just as well.  </li>
            <li>The main problem I had was actually with the bottle it comes in.</li>
            <li>I though perhaps this would be a nice, middle of the road product that would maybe do something without making my face dry, itchy and red, being that it was salicylic acid which I normally tolerate to the point where it works a little, but not much.</li>
            <li>Although it didn&#x27;t start any new breakouts, it simply didn&#x27;t prevent future ones that eventually kept popping up, and didn&#x27;t clear other ones (which is the whole point of this scrub).  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin or anything negative, but it didn&#x27;t make anything better</li>
            <li>I would say that I have regular old teenage oily skin.  </li>

            <li> I was skeptical at first because I haven&#x27;t had much luck with products from Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used either product in 3 days and my skin is still dry, red and burning.</li>
            <li> It is not sensitive or combination</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and a few acnes from time to time.</li>
            <li> i dont know why i waited so long to try this out!</li>
            <li> You will need re-rinse even after padding your face on your towel because your face will feel dry after 5 mins.</li>
            <li> And after that my face became unbearably dry to the point where it was affecting my sleep.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry me out, but keeps the acne at bay.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the only cleanser that can properly cleanse my skin and keep away any unwanted dark dark marks because of the salylic acid in all the products I mentioned (including the cleanser).</li>
            <li> I was having some serious problems with adult acne/spot breakouts.</li>
            <li> The mouth area appears to have quite a few peeling around.</li>
            <li> not all dried</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all way too harsh on my skin and doesn&#x27;t do anything for acne.</li>
            <li> The scrub rocks are too big and it is so difficult to get it out of the tube.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had luck with Neutrogena in the past - their acne wash didn&#x27;t do anything for me, their acne kit burned my skin like a mofo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what went wrong, but after 2 days of consecutive use, plus using the 8 Hour Lotion from the same line, but my face is still on fire.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very subtle orange but not overpowering</li>
            <li> but recently they have gotten VERY bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s an alright product.</li>
            <li> recommend this to anyone who has skin like, as in those annoying buggers that always pop up onto your face every once in a while</li>

            <li> Excellent product. Fulfill their function.</li>
            <li> Nice scrub for a everyday wash.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and a few acnes from time to time. It sooths the acnes without drying or hurting my skin. Love it!</li>

            <li> I was having some serious problems with adult acne/spot breakouts. I read about this product in a magazine article where it was recommended along with this product La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo Dual Action Acne Treatment http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004L8J15C/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the combination of the two have really saved my skin.</li>

            <li> Great for in the shower for my  pre teen daughter. Seems to be clearing up her skin. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> i dont know why i waited so long to try this out! i have had break outs all my life but recently they have gotten VERY bad. i tried basically everything in the drugstore. Nothing i was doing was kicking these red bumps taking over my face. I basically was going to give up and hide in the house for ever. Then I started using the rapid clear pads and my face cleared up like you wouldnt believe. I still had black heads and little bumps that i wasnt happy with so i decided if the pads worked so well than i should try this. Ive been using this for 4 days now and i am amazed. I basically just stared at my face this morning in awe. I couldnt believe how much better my skin is looking! i am in love with this!</li>
            <li> Love this face wash, especially when combined with the moisturizer, keeps my blemishes down &amp; my face smooth!! Happy customer!!</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day yet still break out. In fact it causes me to break out. Not for me.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on my skin and cleared my face up within a week!!! Very good stuff!!!</li>
            <li> great stuff, use it every day!  Doesn&#x27;t dry me out, but keeps the acne at bay.</li>
            <li> The absolute best scrub, lathers up richly, you feel the tiny scrub granules, refreshing orange citrus scent.&lt;br /&gt;The best out there, I have tried probably 20-25 scrubs.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teenage daughter when she requested a good face cleaner that helps with blackheads.  I&#x27;ve used this for years and found in the times my face decides to break out, it leaves my face feeling clean but not all dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it has a great scent which leaves you feeling very refreshed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It keeps my skin clear and totally smooth. I ran out once and immediately had issues with breakouts. I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> So good I had to repurchase it!</li>
            <li> Does what it says and keeps acne at bay.  I like the smell, it&#x27;s very subtle orange but not overpowering</li>
            <li> I use this every morning to wash my face and love the feeling.  I have the occasional mild blemish and this seems to help keep this under control.</li>
            <li> The only thing I have foung besides proactiv that works on my skin for my acne. I use it when I run out of my proactiv and am waiting for a shipment or just want to swith things up a bit. NOTHING ELSE I could find worked. It&#x27;s all way too harsh on my skin and doesn&#x27;t do anything for acne. I am so glad I finally found this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering with acne for most of my life, starting at my teen years.  I&#x27;m now 34, and still looking for a product that works to keep breakouts at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had luck with Neutrogena in the past - their acne wash didn&#x27;t do anything for me, their acne kit burned my skin like a mofo. I though perhaps this would be a nice, middle of the road product that would maybe do something without making my face dry, itchy and red, being that it was salicylic acid which I normally tolerate to the point where it works a little, but not much. Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what went wrong, but after 2 days of consecutive use, plus using the 8 Hour Lotion from the same line, but my face is still on fire. Haven&#x27;t used either product in 3 days and my skin is still dry, red and burning. (Disclaimer - I am also pregnant, so hormones may also be playing a role in making this product intolerable to my skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - I love the scent, I liked that it was a smoothing product that seemed to cleanse well. However, due to the fact that my face is now fire-engine red (and super itchy, to boot!), I won&#x27;t be using this any longer. Suddenly, pimples seem quite favorable compared to the skin I&#x27;m left with. Better luck to anyone else who decides to use it - everyone&#x27;s skin is different and you may have luck with this product :)</li>
