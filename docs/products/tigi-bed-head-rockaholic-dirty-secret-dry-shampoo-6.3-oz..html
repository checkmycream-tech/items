            <li>/&gt;So, thank you Amazon, and no thanks to TIGI BED HEAD, and raspberries to all the reviewers who touted this product as the best thing since tampons!</li>
            <li>It smells good and gives your hair real body and bounce.</li>
            <li>This spray is powerful and has a nice, fruity smell.  </li>
            <li>Strong odor, don&#x27;t use in an enclosed space.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be great to try to refreshen at the end of the day, or maybe even buy me a shampooing-free day once in a blue moon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and has a citrus smell.</li>
            <li>ordered this dry shampoo with great excitement because I have very fine, straight, shoulder length hair that I wash every day, so</li>
            <li>and my hair would feel clean.</li>
            <li>I tend to save Rockaholic for special occasions.</li>
            <li>It smells nice,  not heavy</li>
            <li>by far the best dry shampoo I have used...does not make your hair look powdery or lose shine  or become greasy.</li>
            <li>By far the best dry shampoo I have ever used and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>It gives it more volume and it actually makes my hair look better than when it is clean.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wash my hair everyday but with Rockaholic I can freshen it up and be good to go!</li>
            <li>first off, gag me with the smell- i sprayed it lightly on my roots</li>
            <li>The good news is the residue disappears easily with a little rubbing into your hair.  </li>
            <li>what it says it will and has a fresh scent.</li>
            <li>You spray it on after shaking very well at the root of the hair, massage in and brush, your hair looks clean and fuller.</li>
            <li>Hands down this is the best dry shampoo out there.</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo for 20$ the first time.  </li>
            <li>It does the trick and smells good, however, it feels heavy.</li>
            <li>I like PSSSST dry shampoo better</li>
            <li>My favorite brand of dry shampoo is  </li>
            <li>more than a few quick sprays-</li>
            <li>but i do love the rockaholic dry conditioner!</li>
            <li>It feels like this is drinking my hair&#x27;s oils almost as much as my uncle  was drinking on Thanksgiving.</li>
            <li>The product was well wrapped and in a box, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I was using another brand and really didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>I have tried a wide variety of dry shampoos, and this one definitely is the best, so far.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite dry shampoos by far.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;it.</li>
            <li>Often hard to find in drugstores so its nice to buy on prime.</li>
            <li>straight think hair that I can only wash  every  2-3 days.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s expensive so most of the time I use my second favorite which is Dove brand because it&#x27;s a third of the cost.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling dry or fried like other cheap dry shampoos.</li>
            <li>Arrived exactly when I expected it.</li>
            <li>I returned it to the company and it was replaced, only to have the EXACT same problem with the next bottle.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave hair with a nasty and unworkable texture like the Big Sexy Hair dry shampoo and it has a nice, fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to give up on it, since I spent so much money on it, but I got no results no matter how I manuevered it.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look good but it still feels dirty.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> If I wanted gray hair again, I&#x27;d simply stop using the dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon graciously refunded my $$ even thought the product is non-returnable due to some rule about beauty products not being returnable.&lt;br</li>

            <li> When I use this it, it just makes my hair feel very dry and look frizzy, and makes my scalp sort of itchy.</li>

            <li> Not really understanding the hype on this.</li>
            <li> it was completely empty and the nozzle didn&#x27;t function.  </li>
            <li> It smells like pink grapefruit, but doesn&#x27;t linger all day.  </li>
            <li> Certainly not a scent my hubby, spouse, lover or whoever would want to stick his nose into…</li>
            <li> Rockaholic dry shampoo never sprayed anything but the activator when I would press down, which would just get my hair wet</li>

            <li> I have not had this problem with other dry shampoos, as it seems like they at least leave a bit of moisture in your hair.</li>

            <li> I just didn&#x27;t like the way it made my hair feel afterwards, so dry and thick.</li>

            <li> I love this stuff. it&#x27;s the best one i&#x27;ve ever found. I have dark hair and it doesn&#x27;t leave a powder or residue.</li>
            <li> I have tried a wide variety of dry shampoos, and this one definitely is the best, so far.  It doesn&#x27;t leave hair with a nasty and unworkable texture like the Big Sexy Hair dry shampoo and it has a nice, fresh smell.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff.  I have kind of oily hair and this allows me not to have to wash it every single day!</li>
            <li> This stuff made me feel like I just sprayed a can of Aqua Net through my hair. I had to rake a brush through my hair afterwards to calm it down and make it look less ratted at the roots. Yucky yucky! I didn&#x27;t have the issue of only getting a few uses out of it though as some others have commented. I just didn&#x27;t like the way it made my hair feel afterwards, so dry and thick.</li>
            <li> Not really understanding the hype on this. When I use this it, it just makes my hair feel very dry and look frizzy, and makes my scalp sort of itchy.

            <li> rockaholic dry shampoo- ummm, seriously, get this garbage off the market and into the dumpster where it belongs~! this is one of the worst dry shampoos i have everr purchased! first off, gag me with the smell- i sprayed it lightly on my roots and it brought me back to a part of the 80s i&#x27;d like to forget....it actually felt like i had a ton of aqua net in my hair. it made my hair feel heavy/sticky/gross- i couldn&#x27;t even get a brush through it. i had to wash it out immediately. i would never buy this crap again...but i do love the rockaholic dry conditioner!</li>
            <li> I exercise regularly and this helps me between shampoos. Works great!</li>
            <li> I hate to have to 1 star something.  but it must be done.  I bought this shampoo for 20$ the first time.  I didn&#x27;t use it for a month or so, when I went to use it (and NEEDED it) it was completely empty and the nozzle didn&#x27;t function.  I returned it to the company and it was replaced, only to have the EXACT same problem with the next bottle.  I was so disappointed and was waiting to write a review as to not review it in anger.  I really hope they rethink their packaging for an expensive product that lets you down when you need it.  Look elsewhere for a dry shampoo.  Sorry rockaholic, you are no rockstar to me.</li>
            <li> The product was well wrapped and in a box, fast delivery. I love the smell and the price cause this is sold 18$ else where. You spray it on after shaking very well at the root of the hair, massage in and brush, your hair looks clean and fuller.I have long hair and don&#x27;t feel like washing every 2 days. So I get an extra day or two.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!! I simply love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been faithfully using this product for over  3 years.  I have  straight think hair that I can only wash  every  2-3 days.  In  between wakes this product is amazing.  I have  brown hair and  have had problems in the past with white residue left in my hair after using similar products.  As long as  you  shake  product week and follow directions I&#x27;ve never had any issues with that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for a year now- usually I buy it at Ulta but took a gamble on purchasing online dispute all of the horrid reviews. Maybe I haven&#x27;t gotten a funky bottle yet, or I&#x27;m more conservative with it, but I don&#x27;t understand the 2-3 uses some people report. At any rate, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite dry shampoos by far.</li>
            <li> Great way to keep hair manageable during no wash days.  It also helps gives texture to unruly hair such as mine, that is thick and frizzy.  I&#x27;m rating this a 4 due to the white powdery residue it sometimes leaves after spraying.  The good news is the residue disappears easily with a little rubbing into your hair.  I use this several times a week and would recommend it, especially to those trying to lengthen the time between wet shampooing.</li>
            <li> This is convenient when I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to wash and set my hair. It extends time between shampoos for me, and it has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> Arrived exactly when I expected it. wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;Does what it says it will and has a fresh scent. A must&lt;br /&gt;purchase item!!</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo around!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 years now... It&#x27;s great in a pinch when you have to run out and don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair... It gives it more volume and it actually makes my hair look better than when it is clean.  The absolute best thing about the product is the fragrance.  I am allergic to most fragrances and this is awesome.  It smells like pink grapefruit, but doesn&#x27;t linger all day.  It&#x27;s also great just after a workout at the health club...&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!!  :)</li>
            <li> I have tried several dry shampoos... I travel quite a bit and need this occasionally... by far the best dry shampoo I have used...does not make your hair look powdery or lose shine  or become greasy.</li>
            <li> Some love it some don&#x27;t. My wife says it&#x27;s awesome and it saves her a day or two for washing hair. It was a bargain too, saved at least 50%</li>
            <li> I only used this product once. When I tried using it a second time, the nozzle didn&#x27;t work. When the bottle was shaken, it sounded like there were a few drops of liquid in it. I will go back to the Klorane.</li>
            <li> It does the trick and smells good, however, it feels heavy. It makes my hair look good but it still feels dirty.</li>
            <li> Love this product at such an awesome price!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It smells good and gives your hair real body and bounce. By far the best dry shampoo I have ever used and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling dry or fried like other cheap dry shampoos. Often hard to find in drugstores so its nice to buy on prime. I also recommend the dry conditioner</li>
            <li> I rely on Amazon reviews before purchasing a product I&#x27;m unfamiliar with but this one takes the cake &amp; makes me wonder just who is writing all the glowing reviews for such a horrible product.ones as well)  I guess the truth lies somewhere in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this dry shampoo with great excitement because I have very fine, straight, shoulder length hair that I wash every day, so I thought this would be great to try to refreshen at the end of the day, or maybe even buy me a shampooing-free day once in a blue moon. However the moon will have to turn purple before I buy this junk again!&lt;br /&gt;My experience:&lt;br /&gt;1.The scent begins a bit like lime/citrus but morphs into something offensive that I lack words for. Certainly not a scent my hubby, spouse, lover or whoever would want to stick his nose into…Even a dog would run from it (animal or human)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Made my hair limper. It looked like a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; photo AFTER I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. My hair felt heavy &amp; stuck to my. I could have achieved this feeling by pouring a container of baby powder in my hair and wrapping it in saran wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. White residue. Once I stopped choking on the fumes &amp; powdery residue fogging up the bathroom, my pecan-dyed hair looked like I had gray roots!  If I wanted gray hair again, I&#x27;d simply stop using the dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon graciously refunded my $$ even thought the product is non-returnable due to some rule about beauty products not being returnable.&lt;br /&gt;So, thank you Amazon, and no thanks to TIGI BED HEAD, and raspberries to all the reviewers who touted this product as the best thing since tampons!</li>
            <li> This is my secret for long hair in Texas summer!  I can&#x27;t wash my hair everyday but with Rockaholic I can freshen it up and be good to go!</li>
            <li> This spray is powerful and has a nice, fruity smell.  It has all day staying power and is not too &amp;#34;powdery.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was using another brand and really didn&#x27;t like it. I decided to give this a try before giving up and I love it!  It smells nice,  not heavy, it doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of white in my hair.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Greatest spray ever.  Please don&#x27;t ever change it.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair great texture and helps with day after hair. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell and it leaves a little bit of a white residue on my hair.</li>
            <li> made my hair feel like starch</li>
            <li> I feel as though I have tried every dry shampoo out there. This is my very favorite. I love the texture in my hair. It&#x27;s light and has a citrus smell. It&#x27;s expensive so most of the time I use my second favorite which is Dove brand because it&#x27;s a third of the cost. These are the only two dry shampoos that I like. I tend to save Rockaholic for special occasions. I have to hide it because both of my daughter come in and use up. Hands down this is the best dry shampoo out there.</li>
            <li> It kinda works, not magic,though. For emergency use only. Strong odor, don&#x27;t use in an enclosed space.</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy hair that I have to wash every day. I bought this product for $25 and tried it a few times, but it never worked. I didn&#x27;t want to give up on it, since I spent so much money on it, but I got no results no matter how I manuevered it. With other dry shampoos, I would have some issues with the white-powder residue, but I could at least brush that out and my hair would feel clean. Rockaholic dry shampoo never sprayed anything but the activator when I would press down, which would just get my hair wet and then make it hard, like hairspray. I would not recommend this. My favorite brand of dry shampoo is  [[ASIN:B004FQGLQC Got2b Rockin&#x27; It Dry Shampoo, 4.3-Ounce]].</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for awhile &amp; it&lt;br /&gt;is awesome! Even after a few days, it totally&lt;br /&gt;makes your hair look good. You don&#x27;t really&lt;br /&gt;need more than a few quick sprays- i hold&lt;br /&gt;my hair up in the back &amp; spray a little there.&lt;br /&gt;One of the coolest &amp; best hair products i&lt;br /&gt;have ever tried &amp; love! Highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;it.</li>
