            <li>and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Its the best powder ever</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Works great!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had exceptional results from the Clinique line</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>It fits in the brush holder section (under the cake) and provides better coverage.</li>
            <li>For my skin (face psoriasis and acne for more than 20 years) I couldn&#x27;t find better solution.</li>
            <li>While your skin won&#x27;t look perfect, it can make a HUGE difference...especially for those important social events.</li>
            <li>If your skin is hyper sensitive then this product might not work effectively in terms of coverage as it is very light.</li>
            <li>I also brush lightly over my foundation to mattify and set is</li>
            <li>It is light feeling on my skin and does not cause blemish breakouts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not complete coverage (like the Clinique redness foundation), but works great as a quick once over to lessen the look of redness.  </li>
            <li>made the bright red go away and looked like the rest of my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a yellow powder that is perfect for covering minor imperfections.</li>
            <li>It is light and covers really well.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t cover flaws or blemishes - but changes my bright red skin to normal color.</li>
            <li>Clinique stopped production of a product that worked beautifully and put a pressed powder in a clumsy case.  </li>
            <li>I agree with previous comments about yellow color, but I found solution and make easy and quick mix with light brown loose powder, so it looks on skin perfect.</li>
            <li>This stuff does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li>To its credit I&#x27;ve used many different anti-redness concealers, primers and moisturizers to no avail.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product and does what it says, buy like all makeup it has to be reapplied after a few hours.</li>
            <li>I bought this products some months ago and since I start to using it instead of other compact make up (fluid), my skin starts to looks great.</li>
            <li>This powder works great to minimize my reddish nose and other red tones on my face.  </li>
            <li>It can pretty much cover over anything.</li>
            <li>Blends easily into skin and does not leave a white caste.</li>
            <li>This powder is very helpful in trying to cover reddness.  </li>
            <li>I wish Clinique would make their former option available, but this works in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For those mornings when I don&#x27;t want to put a full face on, I brush those over my very red cheeks and forehead and it helps cover the redness and leaves my skin looking as it should.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different types of covering powder and this works well under or over your regular pressed powder.</li>
            <li>I keep an extra in my car for quick touchups.</li>
            <li>covers the redness and looks very natural</li>
            <li>It helps to dry and camouflage them very well.</li>
            <li>I have red cheeks and nose from sun burning to easily - a soft swipe of the powder</li>
            <li>No greasy feeling later in the day, lasts all day, and does not clog my sensitive pores.</li>
            <li>I have a few small rosacea spots where I use my finger to dab more.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have a few small rosacea spots where I use my finger to dab more.  </li>
            <li> and I use this over my other makeup in those places that are especially red.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover as well as the loose powder did.  </li>
            <li> Would rather have the loose powder, but I will use this since I don&#x27;t have the option anymore.</li>
            <li> Definitely tones down the redness in your face.</li>
            <li> It tones down the redness - it works instantly for me.  </li>
            <li> This product was definitely not worth the price--would not recommend it to anyone----did not live up to description</li>
            <li> I have due to lupus.  </li>
            <li> A poor, very poor replacement for the original loose powder.  </li>
            <li> So if I ever find something that works as well and costs less</li>
            <li> for application: throw the brush away and get a round, flat-ish make up sponge to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude with really bad rosacea and while this is embarrassing to admit to purchasing makeup, this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I usually reapply at night if I am going out.</li>
            <li> the coverage was not very good.  </li>
            <li> so I was a little disappointed that this product didn&#x27;t work for my reactive redness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just expensive.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and does what it says, buy like all makeup it has to be reapplied after a few hours. It also has a tendecy to turn greasy later in the day. I use it to cosmetically cover up my rosacea. I just wish someone woud discover cure.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover as well as the loose powder did.  I like the case and the storage for the brush.  Would rather have the loose powder, but I will use this since I don&#x27;t have the option anymore.</li>
