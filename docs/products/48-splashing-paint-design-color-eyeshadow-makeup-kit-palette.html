            <li>Using the two products together creates ling lasting beautiful color!</li>
            <li>I was pleased with this set</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to any adventurous makeup wearing persons.</li>
            <li>maybe it is more shinny when u see the color.</li>
            <li>I really love this product would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>You have to have this in your makeup this is the coolest palette that I have for my daughter, love the colors and the way the company match them up.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>

            <li>Nonetheless, I love this</li>
            <li>glad I did colors</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re ok.</li>
            <li>Pigment is ok but you&#x27;ll have to layer.</li>
            <li>I love eyeshadow</li>
            <li>I am so happy to get this, I don&#x27;t remember how much it was</li>
            <li>I think it would prove to be better as a matte palette.</li>
            <li>I love all 24 colors though.  </li>
            <li>So many options and varieties.</li>
            <li>In conclusion if you are thinking about purchasing this, It&#x27;s the right price for a good quality product.</li>
            <li>The colors are all very nice and seem to go on very well.</li>
            <li>The eye shodow its self is actually pretty good love the way it goes one and stays on</li>
            <li>I like these pretty good</li>
            <li>lol I wasn&#x27;t really thinking they&#x27;d apply and blend so smoothly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the eye shadows, they are bright with some shimmer, just what I expected.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I was impressed. :)</li>
            <li>I love it when the light hits the colors,</li>
            <li>may be a bit clear for a darker skin but really great to learn makup.</li>
            <li>on easy and shimmery, I also use a primer</li>
            <li>However I highly recommend also investing in a good eye shadow primer.</li>
            <li>A lot of other makeup that is cheap don&#x27;t work, but this was a very wise choice!</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and blend exceptionally well, and while they do carry a smell, I had to hold them to my nose to smell it.  </li>
            <li>They are so pigmented and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll tend to look less bright or bright</li>
            <li>I was a little worried because some of the reviews said they came damaged, but mine came wrapped in bubble wrap and they were in perfect shape.</li>
            <li>Overall, really great deal.</li>
            <li>Perfect if you like, me have trouble choosing which colors you want to wear that day.</li>
            <li>they were such a great price.</li>
            <li>I love how shiny they are and Ipretty much have a color to match everything in my wardrobe:)</li>
            <li>it is really pretty colors!!  </li>
            <li>Pretty in the case but not on the application of it; colors very light and don&#x27;t go smoothly.</li>
            <li>I love love my new eyeshadows;)And</li>
            <li>The colors are every bit as vibrant as they look in the pictures and the variety of bold shimmery colors is fabulous!!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure to buy at first but decided to try after reading reviews</li>
            <li>I love that its not difficult to remove the eyeshadow</li>
            <li>but you pay big bucks for it and this is as good to me and get more of it then the higher price one.</li>
            <li>very easily, very pigmented, very smooth, stays on forever</li>
            <li>The palette is VERY PIGMENTED and came wrapped very securely without any problems.</li>
            <li>hard love amazon and the prices a customer for Life.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>True staying power all day.  </li>
            <li>Overall though, good product.</li>
            <li>There are so many colors,but not that much of it</li>
            <li>Nice palette for a modest budget or a makeup beginner .</li>
            <li>only things is that it does not feel really good when applied /touches the waterline... not itchy but feels like having some powder for an hour or so..</li>
            <li>I love them thank you so much for your professional &amp; friendly customer service and prompt delivery of my orders!!</li>
            <li>When you use this set with a eyeshadow primer it makes the color very bold and, pretty.</li>
            <li>I ordered this item and NO pieces were broken like others have stated, the colors are bright and show up very easily, which is a HUGE plus for the price!</li>
            <li>After purchasing it and trying a few colors for the first time I was highly impressed by how dark and even the color was when applied as well as the great variation in colors.</li>
            <li>Other than that really happy with my order.</li>
            <li>This product is one of the best products I bought from Amazon and especially for this low cost.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite makeup eyeshadow now :) i haven&#x27;t used anything else since, i get compliments constantly!</li>
            <li>I remember recieving this quickly.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this set and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>After searching for make up that has variety of color and dark pigments this color pallet I&#x27;d say is a great product.</li>
            <li>Pretty good eyeshadow looks just like the picture and the pallets are big.</li>
            <li>what you see in the picture is what you get, all color are exactly as it show!</li>
            <li>and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>I USE A PRIMER BEFORE APPLYING THE EYE SHADOW, AND LOVE JUST HOW VIVID THE COLOR LOOKS.</li>
            <li>Excellent pigmentation and will last for a very long time.</li>
            <li>They are such amazing colors in the palettes.</li>
            <li>Its worth it just for them</li>
            <li>am having fun with this item..</li>
            <li>And the price is also right</li>
            <li>They stay bright and vibrant all day long</li>
            <li>I would definately recommend it, The colours are rich and vibrant, just what i needed.</li>
            <li>In the morning when getting ready for school it makes it so easy to match your colors and be on your way never late to school and always looking so pretty.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I only wish that this set had come with more than two applicators.</li>
            <li>oh so pretty.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my teen because of the many colors.</li>
            <li>My sisters love them as it was a christmas present to them.</li>
            <li>Great colors, long lasting.</li>
            <li>she doesnt know which colors to use first.</li>
            <li>They arrived earlier then the estimate date like 2 days before, and i love the eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>I was totally surprised since the price was so cheap.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it :)</li>
            <li>My reason for giving 4 stars is that these colors don&#x27;t look exactly like they do on the palette.</li>
            <li>I really like this palette!</li>
            <li>The only issue I had was the seller did send the right product the first time, but they very quickly got the correct item out to me.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product for anyone who loves to experiment with different colors and styles and who likes a bright pigment.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>All of the colors are bright, and last long.</li>
            <li>palette does contain shades shown however the photo is of two palettes (you do get both) pushed together instead of one large palette.</li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t need any other shadows because of so many colors &amp; they are pretty.</li>
            <li>The colors I picked are bright and hard to find.  </li>
            <li>And they really have staying power.</li>
            <li>Very spongy and doesn&#x27;t hold the color when you&#x27;re trying to apply.  </li>
            <li>Colors are very pertty ！</li>
            <li>You get so much to play with .</li>
            <li>I was very sketchy on buying this item</li>
            <li>Great price, just not great quality</li>
            <li>i really wished i wouldn&#x27;t have</li>
            <li>The price was great and none of my shadows were broken.</li>
            <li>and it blends very well.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>very well a product</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>My Ancient Chinese secret sure Boo!!!  </li>
            <li>so, it will last you a nice long while before you have to buy another one.</li>
            <li>and still I did a decent job.</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s a quirk I&#x27;ve had since Jr high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I love eye make up, but I could never get any look I created to last long, even with primer.  </li>
            <li>the colors look pretty on the palate, but don&#x27;t go on the same.</li>
            <li>I am 15 teen and have a real makeup collect as my mother calls it</li>
            <li>and I completely recommend.</li>
            <li>For example, the first one I&#x27;ve tried out was the blueish-purple that&#x27;s next to the yellow</li>
            <li>The main reason for my low star review is the fallout.</li>
            <li>but when this arrived BEFORE expected date i was very pleased it applied easily and stays on forever nothing broken, missing, or smudged.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how vivid the colors were, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>there is a slight odor at first</li>
            <li>I docked one star because without the use of primer the shadow doesn&#x27;t last very long and the colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll last too long as one is already wearing down after a week, but worth the price.  </li>

            <li> I love eyeshadow</li>
            <li> I am so happy to get this, I don&#x27;t remember how much it was</li>
            <li> I think it would prove to be better as a matte palette.</li>
            <li> I love all 24 colors though.  </li>
            <li> So many options and varieties.</li>
            <li> In conclusion if you are thinking about purchasing this, It&#x27;s the right price for a good quality product.</li>
            <li> The colors are all very nice and seem to go on very well.</li>
            <li> The eye shodow its self is actually pretty good love the way it goes one and stays on</li>
            <li> I like these pretty good</li>
            <li> lol I wasn&#x27;t really thinking they&#x27;d apply and blend so smoothly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the eye shadows, they are bright with some shimmer, just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I was impressed. :)</li>
            <li> I love it when the light hits the colors,</li>
            <li> may be a bit clear for a darker skin but really great to learn makup.</li>
            <li> on easy and shimmery, I also use a primer</li>
            <li> However I highly recommend also investing in a good eye shadow primer.</li>
            <li> A lot of other makeup that is cheap don&#x27;t work, but this was a very wise choice!</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and blend exceptionally well, and while they do carry a smell, I had to hold them to my nose to smell it.  </li>
            <li> They are so pigmented and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll tend to look less bright or bright</li>
            <li> I was a little worried because some of the reviews said they came damaged, but mine came wrapped in bubble wrap and they were in perfect shape.</li>
            <li> Overall, really great deal.</li>
            <li> Perfect if you like, me have trouble choosing which colors you want to wear that day.</li>
            <li> they were such a great price.</li>
            <li> I love how shiny they are and Ipretty much have a color to match everything in my wardrobe:)</li>
            <li> it is really pretty colors!!  </li>
            <li> Pretty in the case but not on the application of it; colors very light and don&#x27;t go smoothly.</li>
            <li> I love love my new eyeshadows;)And</li>
            <li> The colors are every bit as vibrant as they look in the pictures and the variety of bold shimmery colors is fabulous!!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure to buy at first but decided to try after reading reviews</li>
            <li> I love that its not difficult to remove the eyeshadow</li>
            <li> but you pay big bucks for it and this is as good to me and get more of it then the higher price one.</li>
            <li> very easily, very pigmented, very smooth, stays on forever</li>
            <li> The palette is VERY PIGMENTED and came wrapped very securely without any problems.</li>
            <li> hard love amazon and the prices a customer for Life.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> True staying power all day.  </li>
            <li> Overall though, good product.</li>
            <li> There are so many colors,but not that much of it</li>
            <li> Nice palette for a modest budget or a makeup beginner .</li>
            <li> only things is that it does not feel really good when applied /touches the waterline... not itchy but feels like having some powder for an hour or so..</li>
            <li> I love them thank you so much for your professional &amp; friendly customer service and prompt delivery of my orders!!</li>
            <li> When you use this set with a eyeshadow primer it makes the color very bold and, pretty.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item and NO pieces were broken like others have stated, the colors are bright and show up very easily, which is a HUGE plus for the price!</li>
            <li> After purchasing it and trying a few colors for the first time I was highly impressed by how dark and even the color was when applied as well as the great variation in colors.</li>
            <li> Other than that really happy with my order.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best products I bought from Amazon and especially for this low cost.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite makeup eyeshadow now :) i haven&#x27;t used anything else since, i get compliments constantly!</li>
            <li> I remember recieving this quickly.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this set and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> After searching for make up that has variety of color and dark pigments this color pallet I&#x27;d say is a great product.</li>
            <li> Pretty good eyeshadow looks just like the picture and the pallets are big.</li>
            <li> what you see in the picture is what you get, all color are exactly as it show!</li>
            <li> and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> I USE A PRIMER BEFORE APPLYING THE EYE SHADOW, AND LOVE JUST HOW VIVID THE COLOR LOOKS.</li>
            <li> Excellent pigmentation and will last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> They are such amazing colors in the palettes.</li>
            <li> Its worth it just for them</li>
            <li> am having fun with this item..</li>
            <li> And the price is also right</li>
            <li> They stay bright and vibrant all day long</li>
            <li> I would definately recommend it, The colours are rich and vibrant, just what i needed.</li>
            <li> In the morning when getting ready for school it makes it so easy to match your colors and be on your way never late to school and always looking so pretty.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> I only wish that this set had come with more than two applicators.</li>
            <li> oh so pretty.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my teen because of the many colors.</li>
            <li> My sisters love them as it was a christmas present to them.</li>
            <li> Great colors, long lasting.</li>
            <li> she doesnt know which colors to use first.</li>
            <li> They arrived earlier then the estimate date like 2 days before, and i love the eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> I was totally surprised since the price was so cheap.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it :)</li>
            <li> My reason for giving 4 stars is that these colors don&#x27;t look exactly like they do on the palette.</li>
            <li> I really like this palette!</li>
            <li> The only issue I had was the seller did send the right product the first time, but they very quickly got the correct item out to me.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product for anyone who loves to experiment with different colors and styles and who likes a bright pigment.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> All of the colors are bright, and last long.</li>
            <li> palette does contain shades shown however the photo is of two palettes (you do get both) pushed together instead of one large palette.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t need any other shadows because of so many colors &amp; they are pretty.</li>
            <li> The colors I picked are bright and hard to find.  </li>
            <li> And they really have staying power.</li>
            <li> Very spongy and doesn&#x27;t hold the color when you&#x27;re trying to apply.  </li>
            <li> Colors are very pertty ！</li>
            <li> You get so much to play with .</li>
            <li> I was very sketchy on buying this item</li>
            <li> Great price, just not great quality</li>
            <li> i really wished i wouldn&#x27;t have</li>
            <li> The price was great and none of my shadows were broken.</li>
            <li> and it blends very well.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> very well a product</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> My Ancient Chinese secret sure Boo!!!  </li>
            <li> so, it will last you a nice long while before you have to buy another one.</li>
            <li> and still I did a decent job.</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s a quirk I&#x27;ve had since Jr high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love eye make up, but I could never get any look I created to last long, even with primer.  </li>
            <li> the colors look pretty on the palate, but don&#x27;t go on the same.</li>
            <li> I am 15 teen and have a real makeup collect as my mother calls it</li>
            <li> and I completely recommend.</li>
            <li> For example, the first one I&#x27;ve tried out was the blueish-purple that&#x27;s next to the yellow</li>
            <li> The main reason for my low star review is the fallout.</li>
            <li> but when this arrived BEFORE expected date i was very pleased it applied easily and stays on forever nothing broken, missing, or smudged.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how vivid the colors were, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> there is a slight odor at first</li>
            <li> I docked one star because without the use of primer the shadow doesn&#x27;t last very long and the colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll last too long as one is already wearing down after a week, but worth the price.  </li>
            <li> to be honest, I was a little disappointed when I opened it up for the first time</li>
            <li> When it got here thought that it would not last long.</li>
            <li> I see this lasting for a veeeery long time</li>
            <li> Everyday is something new.</li>
            <li> I really like this palette, the pigments are sharp and I was a little surprise at that</li>
            <li> These colors are long wearing.</li>
            <li> I have not tested the shadow for long term wear yet, but will update when I do.</li>
            <li> Oh ya they stay on all day as long as you wear a primer.</li>
            <li> I work long days and the colors don&#x27;t fade or clump.</li>
            <li> so you can see for yourself in this video how the dark blue and purple color come out on my complexion.</li>
            <li> Such a mess.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> But a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a total waste of money!</li>
            <li> All shadows have at least a little fallout but these will completely cover every part of your face in shadow.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth 5$, but if i were you i would get two, (four pallets total) because the shipping is kind-of expensive, but it should be when you buy this, you definitely don&#x27;t want it broken!</li>
            <li> dark skinned</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that one of the eyeshadows was cracked when I received it.</li>
            <li> Downside can be a little fallout.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very skilled at make-up</li>
            <li> However, the applicator is a waste.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday, and.</li>
            <li> There is a VERY SLIGHT odor</li>
            <li> Not a very good quality kit.</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this product after reading all the complaints about a &amp;#34;horrible odor&amp;#34;, thinking if it smells that bad it probably shouldn&#x27;t be near your eyes, or even on your face for that matter!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cheap you almost expect the worst.  </li>
            <li> However, the shipping was a day late.</li>
            <li> There was no smell, it wasn&#x27;t broken and it came 3 days before the day</li>
            <li> and i hope this saves at least one person from wasting their money!!</li>
            <li> was packaged perfectly no damaged product.</li>
            <li> and i hate my money going to waste.</li>
            <li> but you literally have to stick your face down into the compact, and then it wasn&#x27;t a horribly offensive odor -</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got these really fast and as a makeup artist i am impressed with the pigmentation for how cheap they were</li>
            <li> I love all the colors in this shadow kit. I shouldn&#x27;t need any other shadows because of so many colors &amp; they are pretty.</li>
            <li> My mom its a dancer still used</li>
            <li> These colors are long wearing. They stay bright and vibrant all day long</li>
            <li> ..which fades if you leave them open for a bit.;)  I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect with this palette to be honest.  It&#x27;s so cheap you almost expect the worst.  So I was kind of amazed when I tried them out.  The colors are so bright and pigmented.  And they really have staying power. Even without primer.  Also I&#x27;m not one to like sparkle and glitter etc in my makeup but these are perfect with just the right amount of shimmer.    Delivered within days of ordering.  Would definitely buy from seller agian.:    Overall, really great deal.</li>
            <li> for the price and the amount of colors you get, I thought this was a really good deal. to be honest, I was a little disappointed when I opened it up for the first time (some of the colors are really similar..) but there is still a lot, and different shades of each for any occasion, and the colors don&#x27;t rub off ALL DAY!! every girl should get this</li>
            <li> Great colors in the palette.  True staying power all day.  Don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll last too long as one is already wearing down after a week, but worth the price.  However, the applicator is a waste.  Very spongy and doesn&#x27;t hold the color when you&#x27;re trying to apply.  Go with your own applicator or a brush.  Works better.  Overall though, good product.</li>
            <li> They are such amazing colors in the palettes. Best eyeshadow I have ever bought!There are enough colors for every outfit!</li>
            <li> This product had great color and shimmer. It stays all day even when walking all around town. Perfect if you like, me have trouble choosing which colors you want to wear that day. The only issue I had was the seller did send the right product the first time, but they very quickly got the correct item out to me.</li>
            <li> The colors I picked are bright and hard to find.  I used it a lot on vacation and love that it gives me a variety of shades to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on easy and shimmery, I also use a primer so it helps any eyeshadow stay on longer.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this eye shadow because of the variety of colors and for the price.  I love eye make up, but I could never get any look I created to last long, even with primer.  After reading the reviews here, I purchased this set and have been very impressed.  The colors are vibrant and blend exceptionally well, and while they do carry a smell, I had to hold them to my nose to smell it.  I only wish that this set had come with more than two applicators.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful! They are so pigmented and arrived quickly! A little goes a long way. 10/10 would recommend</li>
            <li> I love these. Eyeshadow. The only things that I don&#x27;t like it&#x27;s because come just 3 white shadows.I would like if come more....But it&#x27;s beautiful great quality.</li>
            <li> delivered before that estimated date. items in good conditions. what you see in the picture is what you get, all color are exactly as it show! I give this items five stars!</li>
            <li> palette does contain shades shown however the photo is of two palettes (you do get both) pushed together instead of one large palette. the colors are brilliant &amp; all are shimmer shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;shipped in a timely fashion!</li>
            <li> I love all the color. lasts all day with our creasing in lid. so many beautiful colors to choose from. shipment came on time. was packaged perfectly no damaged product. love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the colors, and the formula. The only thing i dont like is that its WAY smaller than the picture. There are so many colors,but not that much of it</li>
            <li> very bright and pigmented colors, love this palet!</li>
            <li> Colors are very pertty ！</li>
            <li> Color and pigments are great . Nice palette for a modest budget or a makeup beginner . I would buy this again</li>
            <li> I like the eyeshadows, it goes on very easily, very pigmented, very smooth, stays on forever, however they smell horrific.other than that i believe it is a very good product.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of colors .. You get so much to play with . I would recommend all to add to collection ..</li>
            <li> I was surprised how vivid the colors were, especially for the price. I added swatches of both palettes to the image gallery so people can see how they look on skin. I have not tested the shadow for long term wear yet, but will update when I do.</li>
            <li> I was very sketchy on buying this item cuz i know of scams and i hate my money going to waste. but when this arrived BEFORE expected date i was very pleased it applied easily and stays on forever nothing broken, missing, or smudged. it was in perfect condition. there is a slight odor at first but it goes away after a day or two. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love the color choices and great pigment!</li>
            <li> Love it love it , the colors are so beautiful. Shinny, matalic like colors. I love it when the light hits the colors, oh so pretty.</li>
            <li> Not a very good quality kit. I purchased this for my teen because of the many colors. Great price, just not great quality</li>
            <li> The color selection, price, and pigment results are exceptional! The only thing that prevented me from going 5 stars is that there is nothing on this product about animal testing, and that it is not made with organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> the colors are bright and it came perfectly... I love all the colors and they are sparkly ;)) and great for beginners.</li>
            <li> They were good. My sisters love them as it was a christmas present to them. However, the shipping was a day late. Other than that, I was impressed. :)</li>
            <li> Perfeft kit and the colors are awesome. The eye shodow its self is actually pretty good love the way it goes one and stays on</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this product after reading all the complaints about a &amp;#34;horrible odor&amp;#34;, thinking if it smells that bad it probably shouldn&#x27;t be near your eyes, or even on your face for that matter!  I decided to go ahead and try it for myself.  I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s dance competitions thinking I&#x27;d probably be tossing it into the trash, but it&#x27;s a great product and wears very well.  There is a VERY SLIGHT odor but you literally have to stick your face down into the compact, and then it wasn&#x27;t a horribly offensive odor - it just smells like make up to me.  The colors are every bit as vibrant as they look in the pictures and the variety of bold shimmery colors is fabulous!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s glittery, but not too glittery. The eyeshadows didn&#x27;t smell for me so I don&#x27;t know what everyone else is talking about and they came in perfect condition! :)</li>
            <li> Shipped promptly and I received the package in perfect condition. Every bit of powder was in tact. I ordered this along with ELF eye shadow primer. Using the two products together creates ling lasting beautiful color! I am known for matching my eye shadow to my outfit, It&#x27;s a quirk I&#x27;ve had since Jr high. I was pleased with this set and I would recommend it to any adventurous makeup wearing persons. I docked one star because without the use of primer the shadow doesn&#x27;t last very long and the colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant. In conclusion if you are thinking about purchasing this, It&#x27;s the right price for a good quality product. However I highly recommend also investing in a good eye shadow primer.</li>
            <li> Pretty good eyeshadow looks just like the picture and the pallets are big. They are shimmery powder. I recommend using a primer with this and the color will last.</li>
            <li> it is same as picture shown. maybe it is more shinny when u see the color. it is really pretty colors!!  and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow is awesome. .. the colors are amazing; bright and shimmery. . I really love this product would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I use this set on a daily basis. When you use this set with a eyeshadow primer it makes the color very bold and, pretty. You get a lot of makeup in this Make Up Palette so, it will last you a nice long while before you have to buy another one.</li>
            <li> You have to have this in your makeup this is the coolest palette that I have for my daughter, love the colors and the way the company match them up. In the morning when getting ready for school it makes it so easy to match your colors and be on your way never late to school and always looking so pretty. You can Mac I have it but you pay big bucks for it and this is as good to me and get more of it then the higher price one.I am 15 teen and have a real makeup collect as my mother calls it I am working on it hard love amazon and the prices a customer for Life.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great colors, long lasting.</li>
            <li> i got these for my niece and she is loving them. she doesnt know which colors to use first. awesome</li>
            <li> You have to buy this! Excellent pigmentation and will last for a very long time. Good quality for a cheap price</li>
            <li> Pretty in the case but not on the application of it; colors very light and don&#x27;t go smoothly. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love them thank you so much for your professional &amp; friendly customer service and prompt delivery of my orders!! I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer and will order more products.</li>
            <li> I like these pretty good</li>
            <li> My daughter loves to do her make-up. With all the colors she has she always does a different look. When it got here thought that it would not last long. But a little goes a long way. I have even used some of the colors from time to time. I am going to be getting it again when she runs out.</li>
            <li> I would definately recommend it, The colours are rich and vibrant, just what i needed. And the price is also right</li>
            <li> Just love the colors and it bright my eyes and I love it</li>
            <li> I love this makeup set! For the low price, you definitely get the quality of a more expensive eye shadow set. I am very pleased with this set and would definitely buy it again. I recommend this set to anyone that likes a variety of beautiful eye-shadows.</li>
            <li> They arrived earlier then the estimate date like 2 days before, and i love the eyeshadows. The colors stands out &amp; stays onnn! Id recommened this to anybody.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow kit!!! All of the colors are bright, and last long. I was totally surprised since the price was so cheap.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best products I bought from Amazon and especially for this low cost. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I WAS SCEPTICAL IN PURCHASING THIS, ESPECIALLY BY THE PRICE. I WAS GLAD I DID. I USE A PRIMER BEFORE APPLYING THE EYE SHADOW, AND LOVE JUST HOW VIVID THE COLOR LOOKS. IT STAYS ON ALL DAY, AND NEVER SMEARS, NOR DOES IT WEAR OFF. I TOTALLY LOVE IT, AND WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE.</li>
            <li> There was no smell, it wasn&#x27;t broken and it came 3 days before the day it was suppose to arrive so i was really happy about that!! :D I love the colors!! I definitely recommend it :)</li>
            <li> they are so very good. I like all the different colors of choice. I will get more when I run out of  these colors.</li>
            <li> excelente producto buena presentación y servicio de primera me encanta deseo hacer en el futuro mas compras con ustedes gracias</li>
            <li> a total waste of money! this would be good for a pre-teen girl just learning how to do makeup. it goes on very light.. it doesn&#x27;t go on very smoothly, either. the colors look pretty on the palate, but don&#x27;t go on the same. by reading all of the reviews i figured i would give it a chance. i really wished i wouldn&#x27;t have and i hope this saves at least one person from wasting their money!!:((</li>
            <li> Nice beginner palette to get you started in applying eyeshadow. Lots of shimmery shades and good pigment. Downside can be a little fallout.</li>
            <li> these colors are so vivid i love the purples!!!! Its worth it just for them lol I wasn&#x27;t really thinking they&#x27;d apply and blend so smoothly. I see this lasting for a veeeery long time</li>
            <li> These colors are pigmented have staying power, and you get 2 palettes for was it $5?  Do NOT sleep on this product. I use it everyday, and. Do my make up at the stop lights, and have people asking me if this issshhhh is MAC.  My Ancient Chinese secret sure Boo!!!  Get this and you will not regret -- Trust my frugality Barbz!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item and NO pieces were broken like others have stated, the colors are bright and show up very easily, which is a HUGE plus for the price! A lot of other makeup that is cheap don&#x27;t work, but this was a very wise choice! Would recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> I really like this palette, the pigments are sharp and I was a little surprise at that, I will definitely order this palette again.  If you like a palette that is not expensive and you are looking for great colors, I recommend that you purchase this palette.</li>
            <li> I love the colors, they come on nicely and they&#x27;re very bright. My reason for giving 4 stars is that these colors don&#x27;t look exactly like they do on the palette. For example, the first one I&#x27;ve tried out was the blueish-purple that&#x27;s next to the yellow (by the way, these are two separate palettes). The blueish purple looks sort&#x27;ve magenta-ish, in comparison to my eyeliner that is the same color. Nonetheless, I love this and I completely recommend.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure to buy at first but decided to try after reading reviews glad I did colors blend beautifully great pigment I recommend this product get compliments when I wear it</li>
            <li> Great eye shadow and choice of colors, the pigmentation is really good on these.  The price was great and none of my shadows were broken.</li>
            <li> Meh. They&#x27;re ok. Pigment is ok but you&#x27;ll have to layer. Primer helps. The main reason for my low star review is the fallout. All shadows have at least a little fallout but these will completely cover every part of your face in shadow. Such a mess. But you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> the colors don&#x27;t fade, they are just what i was looking for, this is and item i think you should buy a lot of, it comes in a pack of two, the difference in the palette is that the colors are similar but they aren&#x27;t the same. this is my favorite makeup eyeshadow now :) i haven&#x27;t used anything else since, i get compliments constantly! Definitely worth 5$, but if i were you i would get two, (four pallets total) because the shipping is kind-of expensive, but it should be when you buy this, you definitely don&#x27;t want it broken! also, i didnt notice a smell.</li>
            <li> I got a good price for these at $4.95. The colors are all very nice and seem to go on very well. I love eyeshadow so I thought this was a good buy and I would definately order this again.I remember recieving this quickly. I got it in about a week.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these palettes! I was a little worried because some of the reviews said they came damaged, but mine came wrapped in bubble wrap and they were in perfect shape. The colors are great and I love the variety. When I use it I need to apply a couple layers to get the shade that I want (I am bi-racial) but you definitely cannot beat this makeup especially for the price! This eye shadow actually stays longer then my Marykay and Revlon eye shadows. I just love it! Ok, I am done ranting now lol</li>
            <li> may be a bit clear for a darker skin but really great to learn makup. am having fun with this item.. colors are visible and durable.&lt;br /&gt;the only things is that it does not feel really good when applied /touches the waterline... not itchy but feels like having some powder for an hour or so..</li>
            <li> I am so happy to get this, I don&#x27;t remember how much it was but it was cheap for all the beautiful colors you get. Everyday is something new. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Nice and easy to hold just love it. I think I is even nicer than what it looks in the picture</li>
            <li> Love the eyeshadow and it was a great price! The colors are great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the eye shadows, they are bright with some shimmer, just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have every color eyeshadow I could possibly want! You are definetly getting more than what you&#x27;re paying for here!</li>
            <li> After searching for make up that has variety of color and dark pigments this color pallet I&#x27;d say is a great product. After purchasing it and trying a few colors for the first time I was highly impressed by how dark and even the color was when applied as well as the great variation in colors. I definitely recommend this product for anyone who loves to experiment with different colors and styles and who likes a bright pigment.</li>
            <li> I really like this palette! However I wish I had know it was shimmery I think it would prove to be better as a matte palette. Another problem I had was some of the colors don&#x27;t show up to well on my skin tone. They&#x27;ll tend to look less bright or bright than I thought, However there&#x27;s no way the company can make it perfect for everybody. I love that its not difficult to remove the eyeshadow and it blends very well.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s an example of me using the Palette: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;HQWh8D09vq4&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m dark skinned so you can see for yourself in this video how the dark blue and purple color come out on my complexion. Just to show you an example of how sometimes the eyeshadow colors don&#x27;t turn out as planned but still look great. I&#x27;m not very skilled at make-up and still I did a decent job.</li>
            <li> The palette is VERY PIGMENTED and came wrapped very securely without any problems. I highly recommend this product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be 48 different colors not 24 colors duplicated in another packaging.  I now have eyeshadow for years to come, that is unless I decide to share them with somebody.  I love all 24 colors though.  With what I have doubt if I need to order again anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I love love my new eyeshadows;)And they were such a great price.I love how shiny they are and Ipretty much have a color to match everything in my wardrobe:) My only complaint is that one of the eyeshadows was cracked when I received it.Other than that really happy with my order.Oh ya they stay on all day as long as you wear a primer.</li>
            <li> very well a product&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> The colors are great. So many options and varieties. Very inspiring. I work long days and the colors don&#x27;t fade or clump.</li>
            <li> I love all the colors!!!! This pallette is Awesome!!!! Would differently by this for a gift without a doubt. Thanks</li>
