            <li>Great price and great moisturizer!!  </li>
            <li>I can use this before putting on my makeup without getting incredibly oily.</li>
            <li>I have officially converted to this stuff for good!</li>
            <li>This is good stuff!</li>
            <li>My skin is beautiful.</li>
            <li>However, it seems to be working and feels great on my skin.  </li>
            <li>1- is great.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;you look great</li>
            <li>Great shipping A++++</li>
            <li>Olay has always offered great products.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and the results are great.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t too happy about that.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer and comes in a fragrance-free version.  </li>
            <li>Great, bonus,</li>
            <li>I bought identical one with SPF before, and worked great on my skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great moisturizer with no smell.</li>
            <li>so this works great for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective and a high-quality reliable product.</li>
            <li>Very nice on my neck too.</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>I liked it because the price was good , and the quality was perfect .</li>
            <li>I used aveeno for the longest time because that was the best I found, but wouldn&#x27;t keep my face moisturized for more than 12 hours.</li>
            <li>Good product, wife loves it, this is all she used.</li>
            <li>but it does feel good going on and soothes irritation from shaving the sun etc.</li>
            <li>Another good product from Olay.</li>
            <li>so I thought it had to be good.  </li>
            <li>There is a good reason why they have been around forever.</li>
            <li>They are that good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good moisturizer for me</li>
            <li>but if you just want a good moisturizer then go for this.</li>
            <li>This stuff is SO GOOD.</li>
            <li>It is also noncomedogenic (won&#x27;t clog pores), so it&#x27;s good for acne-prone skin like mine.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product, not to greasy, but I have not noticed any diminishing lines or wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Great product, goes on nice and not greasy.</li>
            <li>how good it is.  </li>
            <li>LOVED IT and recommended it to family and friends!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>Does not have the SPF in it, but that is good for me too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good moisturizer with a good price.</li>
            <li>and I am good to go.</li>
            <li>good face cream.</li>
            <li>Best part its full of ingredients that protect and heal your skin.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I did research and found that this moisturizer contains lots of great anti-aging ingredients and the price was even more affordable through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a wonderful hand cream;-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it!</li>
            <li>Have used for years and still love it!  </li>
            <li>But I was primarily interested in a good moisturizer!!</li>
            <li>to better skin!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Olay products are the very best and the most economical!  </li>
            <li>My wife has used this Olay moisturizer for 20 years and her face &amp;#34;glows&amp;#34; -- she is so beautiful (at age 72) -- and attributes her fresh good looks to this Olay product.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m acne prone this fragrance free lotion works great and leaves my skin looking dewy and youthful despite the loads of acne meds</li>
            <li>This moisturizer smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>Great product - it goes on smoothly with no after-effect or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great -- it handles eczema and dryness really well and for people without those conditions it is probably  great too.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s really nice is my oily skin was balanced.  </li>
            <li>It works well on its own and with my prescription tretinoin.  </li>
            <li>This is the best all-around anti-aging moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used, truly targeting 7 skin aging problems.</li>
            <li>nice nice</li>
            <li>gives a nice feeling over all.</li>
            <li>Well, this one is perfect and good for sensitive skin besides.</li>
            <li>This fragrance free version is pleasant and lightweight and I believe has kept my wrinkles from increasing in appearance for 2 years since I started using it.</li>
            <li>The best cream so far.</li>
            <li>yes but goes far and an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>The soft, non-greasy feeling was WONDERFUL on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Loved that it was fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>This product gives your skin a vibrant smooth look, it is great!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, very fair skin</li>
            <li>Things have changed - and NOT for the better.  </li>
            <li>I love Olay skin care</li>
            <li>/&gt;Could be more product for the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so I grabbed some Olay Daily Wash too - perfect.</li>
            <li>Wish it did more for fading age spots.</li>
            <li>I love the Olay products, and this was no disapointment.</li>
            <li>Too many blemishes pop up on my face and when applying the cream becomes flaky.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer makes me look better day after day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d order it again for sure.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I have not found a better moisturizer at any price.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lotion.</li>
            <li>&quot; it to me and said it has great anti-aging properties even for young skin (mid-twenties in my case - she said early prevention is best).  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff -</li>
            <li>I love how it feels going on - I put it on after washing my face at the end of the day and wear it while sleeping.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for sometime now through Amazon subscribe and save program and find that the price is better than grocery stores</li>
            <li>Have used Olay for many years.</li>
            <li>I love it based on the evidence of the result.  </li>
            <li>just love it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this moisturizer because I have always been satisfied with Olay products.  </li>
            <li>The price is getting more and that I dont like it  </li>
            <li>nithing more to say.</li>
            <li>Nice texture and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>and sometimes I am even able to use an Amazon coupon to make it even lower.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many, and I&#x27;m a guy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve  been using it for more than a year</li>
            <li>Love this product, has been using it for quite some time now.  </li>
            <li>Love that it has no scent.</li>
            <li>but then return to better products.</li>
            <li>l just love the feel of this moisturizer and</li>
            <li>I would probably buy again unless I found something better.</li>
            <li>I love Olay products</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brands and because of a terrific review by a fellow Sr, Citizen on Amazon&#x27;s site, I tried it and think it&#x27;s probably the best.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>Olay is the best facial product I have found--I even mix this with my foundation to make it apply more evenly and in a more moist fashion.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for 15 years or more.</li>
            <li>makes my skin look better.</li>
            <li>Love this..</li>
            <li>How could a product purchased in the supermarket do a better job?  </li>
            <li>Very happy with the olay total effects.  </li>
            <li>my skin is much better now...</li>
            <li>I have tried another lines of Olay brand skin products and now sure that Total effect works the best for my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>My husband love it too...</li>
            <li>Girls in my household love this and will be repeat purchasers.</li>
            <li>Nice texture, goes on smooth and not one iota of sticky.</li>
            <li>I may get some more for her</li>
            <li>i have used this moisturizer before too.one of the best ones.my skin feels so soft and fresh after using it.</li>
            <li>It is the greatest moisturizer i&#x27;ve ever used, and I haven&#x27;t had dry skin on my face since.</li>
            <li>super nice A++++.</li>
            <li>It feels rich yet lightweight at the same time - the perfect combination for combination skin!</li>
            <li>Great product and great price here compared to retail stores; can&#x27;t beat it; always arrives quickly and good for sensitive skin, especially the no fragrance part.  </li>
            <li>I find my cheap Suave hand lotion moisturizes my skin better, and at about 1/50th the cost ounce for ounce.</li>
            <li>OR most importantly there wasn&#x27;t the plug in the nozzle (where the lotion is dispensed).</li>
            <li>wish there were more fragrance free products that worked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many compliments since using this product saying my skin looks fabulous and with a glow.  </li>
            <li>Many frangrance free creams give me a rash.</li>
            <li>This is especially true considering the fact that there does not seem to be a whole lot of moisturizers in it.</li>
            <li>This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used, other than for Creme De La Mer.</li>
            <li>A stopper is no longer affixed to the pump, which seems like a safety issue, since the product could be easily tampered with.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>after hours of reading on pores and make up for oily skin, I order this product and I cannot be more happy; if you have large pores this moisturizer is for you, because it has zinc and Titanium, two minerals recommended for large pores.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first \\&quot;bottle\\&quot; with an amazing coupon as a splurge.  </li>
            <li>at first I really liked this product.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a reduction in fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes after 3 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>but the fine lines under my eyes are still there</li>
            <li>its glowing and the fine lines have reduced .</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and soaks right in without a greasy \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always need to buy the fragrance free, though.  </li>
            <li>I rarely use drugstore products, as most of my skin care is physician/prescription strength.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my face moist and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>been using this oil free day cream for day and night.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Olay has been making great skin care products for years and this total effects product is proof of that!</li>
            <li>I use the fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Illuminating face moisturizer that is fabulous for the price.</li>
            <li>Product is truly fragrance free.</li>
            <li>This is just one great daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I like fragrance free because I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li>When I put it on my skin it felt so smooth and even.</li>
            <li>but I would probably purchase the lightly scented one once this one is finished.</li>
            <li>I keep her stocked up with the great S&amp;S price and big clip-free coupons that come out from time to time.</li>
            <li>I am in my mid-twenties and use the 7-in-1 fragrance free one.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s smooth.</li>
            <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz]] and [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>far so good.</li>
            <li>Good for people sensitive to fragrance and some preservatives.  </li>
            <li>I only used these two products for the week and my skin looked amazing!  </li>
            <li>Very pleased so far.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel great all day long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s deceiving because it&#x27;s very rich feeling when it first goes on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the one with SPF-15 works better, but any of the couple different types of this 7in 1 moisturizer is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best facial cream I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>With age, my skin has gone through some changes, including becoming very sensitive,and this product is not only a great all-day moisturizer, but has reduced the size of my pores and reduced break-outs.</li>
            <li>The texture is rich and creamy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy and price was right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Fragrance Free Moisturizer for years and been very satisfied - until now.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, if you really care about wrinkles then invest in something better</li>
            <li>The cool thing about this product is that it is NOT greasy and has no perfumes.</li>
            <li>As good as any moisturizer you could buy at your local drug store.</li>
            <li>I do wish it didn&#x27;t cost as much as I would stock up on more of this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made this a Subscribe and Save item I love it so much.</li>
            <li>So far i have liked this cream.</li>
            <li>I always buy professional products and this is the first time I tried a drug store brand in many, many years.  </li>
            <li>It is so smooth and creamy and really makes makeup go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>but it absorbs quickly and never feels greasy.</li>
            <li>but your skin will adapt quickly.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I used to use the regular kind but switched to the fragrance-free because that is what Amazon.com has available for Subscribe &amp; Save.  </li>
            <li>I wake up and get going quickly in the mornings and this applicator works well for me.  </li>
            <li>My face looks brighter :) i highly recommend this..</li>
            <li>I normally have combination to oily skin, and this made my skin more oily.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li>love this alot ,I use this in the morning and micro sculpting at night my skin stays soft all through the winter and no drying!</li>
            <li>recently changed to coconut oil, which seems to work even better on my fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Very creamy and smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>This is a great everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer that isn&#x27;t overly greasy or heavy feeling on the face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the lowest priced moisturizer but for what it does, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Perhaps, my case is just really, really rare.</li>
            <li>If using daytime, I find if I apply it about an hour before doing make-up, the cream is completely absorbed by then.</li>
            <li>This lotion gives your face a fresh drink of moisture.  </li>
            <li>The Amazon price is far better than any store (even with a coupon)</li>
            <li>It seems like it would be really nice and luxurious for someone with regular skin, that&#x27;s why the two stars.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, and actually have oily skin, but I&#x27;ve always liked how it made my skin feel, and I&#x27;m quite picky about moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how soft it makes my skin.  </li>
            <li>im 33 and keeps my face fresh looking</li>
            <li>I like it better than regenerist, age defying and olay complete products I have tried</li>
            <li>and I put it in the morning and feel fresh all day.</li>
            <li>I found that is the right amount</li>
            <li>A half pump in the morning and at night is perfect and the bottle will last you 1.5 months.</li>
            <li>I love this on my sensitive skin, feels so soft and smooth after using, I apply this after taking a bath.</li>
            <li>My skin appearance (pores, fine lines, freckles) improved within a few weeks and it was truly AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>With the more expensive lotions, my skin was great</li>
            <li>its smooth and makes skin very soft..</li>
            <li>I use other Olay products and have been very pleased with them.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin, mostly oily, but gets SUPER DRY in the winter</li>
            <li>Before I purchased this, I had the exact same one with the light, clean scent.</li>
            <li>Compared to other products that easily cost twice as much or more, this product really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I have sensitive skin and need fragrance free products.  </li>
            <li>This was my first beauty treatment from Olay.</li>
            <li>Pretty affordable too (compared to the moisturizer).</li>
            <li>I use this between using another cheaper and more simple moisturizer and the balance works for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every cent I pay for Olay as very seldom do the residents guess even close to 65</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 plus and when I run out I realize just how much better my skin feels using Total Effects.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that Oil of Olay had a fragrance free product; I know a lot of people who swear by it, but I&#x27;m allergic to perfume, so I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>I also love the Total Effects Tone</li>
            <li>but I have no signs of aging and at this point many of my friends are starting.</li>
            <li>This fragrance free variety without SPF has not given me any problem so far.</li>
            <li>Not greasy at all, even in the hot, humid weather.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products and this one is the only one that doesn&#x27;t cause me breakouts and has improved my complexion.  </li>
            <li>I used up the entire container and even broke off the top</li>
            <li>I placed my order on 4/8 and received it on 4/11, that was fast!</li>
            <li>This is not oily but leaves skin feeling like it has nothing on it, just soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I have to say that I liked the one with the scent better because I felt that it was a better moisturizer and left you smelling clean but not overally perfumed.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any major changes in the appearance of my fine lines,</li>
            <li>If you have average to sensitive skin with no major issues to contend with, Olay products are a perfect, SIMPLE solution to maintain healthy skin.</li>
            <li>Fragrance-free, easily absorbed, no more a miracle worker than any other face product, but it truly is an excellent moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love being able to have it on regular order and shipped every other month.</li>
            <li>This product, I feel, lacks the amount of moisture I need, that was in the scented one, as my face still feels dry many times.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have large pores untill</li>
            <li>I have large pores around my nose, chin and forhead, This didn&#x27;t help tighten those.</li>
            <li>IT keeps me looking young and vibrant with a special glow.</li>
            <li>did not notice a real change</li>
            <li>I put one whole pump morning and night because I use a medication that severely dries out my skin and</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much about its effects on lines or age spots yet</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: This lotion isn&#x27;t really living up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much so</li>
            <li>I just wiped it on w/o paying much attention to how I did it.    </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not using this for intense anti-aging effects</li>
            <li>It might provide too much moisture to use both day and night for people with oilier skin.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference straight away.  </li>
            <li>I really could not tell the difference based on my skin&#x27;s reaction.</li>
            <li>The product is excelent, is really moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I just got Olay Total Effects Fragrance Free this week.</li>
            <li>, if you want to try Olay Total Effects, get the one that is fragrance free and does not have the SPF.</li>
            <li>and I really can tell the difference.</li>
            <li>As for \\&quot;reducing the 7 signs of aging,\\&quot; I started using it in my 20&#x27;s, so I can&#x27;t really speak to that.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work really well.</li>
            <li>If you apply too much you get the oily effect and it doesn&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li>this product works very well for me...</li>
            <li>B0000CC64W Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Fragrance Free, 1.7-Fluid</li>
            <li>This product is very moisturizing-</li>
            <li>It really has NO fragrance, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>Does the hydrating job, but doesn&#x27;t really seem to fix anything when it comes to signs of aging</li>
            <li>I have really senstive skin also.</li>
            <li>so I need something that is really going to help me with that</li>
            <li>but she needs to get thru 3 bottles or what ever it is ,thanks.</li>
            <li>Received product really fast</li>
            <li>I was using Meaningful Beauty, and I constantly received compliments on my skin, and how young I looked.</li>
            <li>It felt heavy on my face and after a couple of hours, it kind of pealed of my face.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and was well wrapped and when I had a little problem it was fixed cheerfully and quickly.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve transitioned most of my personal care and beauty products to be free of parabens and other ingredients recognized as harmful by the EWG- Environmental Working Group.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely a good daily moisturizer, not too heavy or greasy, but it did not live up to the marketing and for the price we should get more.</li>
            <li>I like it very much for keeping my ski n soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>However, this moisturizer works very well and has a high percentage of niacinamide, which is known to even skin tone.  </li>
            <li>The one thing I don&#x27;t like is if you use too much and don&#x27;t rub it in really well right away it will flake off like peeling skin later in the day.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin fresh and not dry!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks and see noticable improvements to my face, particularly around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it really has improved the complexion of my skin, and it&#x27;s not too heavy for my oily skin.  </li>
            <li>It is more expensive than most face lotions, but its that price for a reason.</li>
            <li>Experiment with the amount your particular skin texture needs.  </li>
            <li>This for overall skin care, then I use cover up for under my eyes and a quick zip of blush</li>
            <li>I always woke up super greasy with a face full of little whiteheads.</li>
            <li>Since using this product on my hands, my husband has commented on how soft my hands have been, and again, I can see and feel a positive difference.  </li>
            <li>I served in the military and suffered in very dry climates in texas and in Iraq, trying many many different kinds of lotions.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to every and any woman who wants clear, toned, well maintained skin for years to come!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for everyone.</li>
            <li>As a moisturizer I highly recommend this but for anti aging...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I bought this moisturizer with very high hopes of slowing down the number of fine lines under my eyes and the sagging skin on both ends of my mouth.</li>
            <li>Rub it in completely, especially to wrinkles, crow&#x27;s feet and laugh lines.</li>
            <li>I have always had normal to combination skin.</li>
            <li>Started using it twice a week along side other lotions for my face and have been fine.</li>
            <li>Let me say that this stuff works better than the other two major products for hypoallergenics.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I feel like it&#x27;s just as effective as my mom&#x27;s super expensive stuff...</li>
            <li>I would often get many breakouts but needed a moisturizer for my face daily as I would get dry skin as well.  </li>
            <li>I washed it off right away using water and my long-time stand-by facial soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;am starting to really like Olay better than some of my more expensive products .Something about their formula</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a new fragrance-free moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are in the market for a new moisturizer, I would give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new face moisturizer and figured I might as well get something to treat</li>
            <li>Since it lets you keep it simple, it remains affordable enough and definitely available anywhere.</li>
            <li>Later tried Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging on the backs of my hands; no skin reaction and it made my hands feel good--moisturized and smooth, but I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li>The dry skin from the Retin A is always quickly corrected and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily.</li>
            <li>My skin is very clear and sof.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is very soft and supple.</li>
            <li>i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>my skin in very sensitive may be it didnt suit me.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Soon she will look too young to get seniors discounts without showing proof of age!</li>
            <li>the regular, original product is still the same as when I used it in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crossing fingers....</li>
            <li>I use Peter Thomas Roth cleanser and than I put this moisturizer , wow!</li>
            <li>Although I must admit I was skeptical after lathering on much more expensive products with excellent reviews from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have used Oil of Olay 7 in 1 anti-aging daily moisturizer for the last 10 years and I am so glad that I have because I am 50 years old, but the skin on my face makes me look much younger.  </li>
            <li>B001IM5VT4 Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer SPF 15 - 4 oz.]]</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, although not any more so than similar products.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s psychological, but I feel like it makes my skin a little more greasy and clogged.</li>
            <li>Despite the bad reaction, it SEEMS even folks with sensitive skin (like me) SHOULD be able to use this more than once a day.</li>
            <li>I am 79 years old.</li>
            <li>Nearly all that saggy neck skin tightened.</li>
            <li>Could not use the night cream - - far too oily for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>I am 65 years old &amp; work at a teaching hospital  </li>
            <li>Wake up in the AM without that oily feeling but skin is soft.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Olay products since I was a teenager (now 38) and am completely in awe of this product.</li>
            <li>After one week I was looking at myself in the mirror in the early morning and thinking, &amp;#34;Oh</li>
            <li>wow...</li>
            <li>It really does help those facial lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>This works well with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>&amp; I am 19 years old</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive.....</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin, so it could be the chemicals in the moisturizer not getting along well with my skin.</li>
            <li>I am still young</li>
            <li>However, I let my mom pick one out and now this has replaced her Anew completely.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer blends in well and leaves my skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m highly sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>B0012J135O Olay Complete Night</li>
            <li>I have acne prone, oily and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks now and my skin feels soft.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin prone to itchiness, rashes...</li>
            <li>My face can definitely tell when I forget to moisturize, my skin feels hard and dry, and my foundation doesn&#x27;t apply as nicely!</li>
            <li>After only one week of use the discoloration on my cheekbones and above my upper lip (which looked very much like a fake mustache) has been greatly dimished.  </li>
            <li>First of all let me say that I have dry skin</li>
            <li>This cream never irritates my skin and it completely removed  a few new fine lines I recently noticed around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have used Olay for over 30 years, Total Effects has become my main moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It could be a little bit better than regular moisturizers if you have a normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>Every year when the new residents arrive our favorite game</li>
            <li>Makeup application is smooth, and seems to stay put longer than usual when I use this.</li>
            <li>Very good!I am so surprised that I can buy it in such a low price!</li>
            <li>But of late i developed some fine lines..</li>
            <li>and I only live in FL.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also works very well on the occasional age related spots of scale on arms, hands and legs.</li>
            <li>A major creamy clogger for the pores.</li>
            <li>Of course I put it on every day, but the daily chore is worth not being paranoid about dry, red, flaky skin on my face.</li>
            <li>no more losen skin specially on neck and close to eyes.</li>
            <li>As an added unexpected advantage, it got rid of some red, itchy patches on my chin and side of my nose that nothing else helped!</li>
            <li>I have adult acne prone skin and feel like I&#x27;ve tried every moderately priced moisturizer under the sun.</li>
            <li>Being a lotion and rather thin in consistency, you will have to use a lot more.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for someone that has been searching for a cure for their dry skin on their face.</li>
            <li>You may notice a slight redness or tingling the first time you use it</li>
            <li>But as an Anti-Ager and all the other stuff it&#x27;s supposed to do not so much.</li>
            <li>No dry skin, redness gone, and no breakouts at all.</li>
            <li>My first several purchases of this product, both through Amazon and a local warehouse store were for the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; 7-in-1 anti-aging moisturizer with a slight fragrance.  </li>
            <li>have been less than gentle with them.  </li>
            <li>is guess the Social worker&#x27;s age correctly &amp; get extra credit.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer really does keep my face soft, even in the harsh northern winter, and I tend to have very dry skin.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have officially converted to this stuff for good!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff!</li>
            <li> My skin is beautiful.</li>
            <li> However, it seems to be working and feels great on my skin.  </li>
            <li> 1- is great.  </li>

            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and the results are great.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t too happy about that.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer and comes in a fragrance-free version.  </li>
            <li> Great, bonus,</li>
            <li> I bought identical one with SPF before, and worked great on my skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great moisturizer with no smell.</li>
            <li> so this works great for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very effective and a high-quality reliable product.</li>
            <li> Very nice on my neck too.</li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> I liked it because the price was good , and the quality was perfect .</li>
            <li> I used aveeno for the longest time because that was the best I found, but wouldn&#x27;t keep my face moisturized for more than 12 hours.</li>
            <li> Good product, wife loves it, this is all she used.</li>
            <li> but it does feel good going on and soothes irritation from shaving the sun etc.</li>
            <li> Another good product from Olay.</li>
            <li> so I thought it had to be good.  </li>
            <li> There is a good reason why they have been around forever.</li>
            <li> They are that good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good moisturizer for me</li>
            <li> but if you just want a good moisturizer then go for this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is SO GOOD.</li>
            <li> It is also noncomedogenic (won&#x27;t clog pores), so it&#x27;s good for acne-prone skin like mine.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product, not to greasy, but I have not noticed any diminishing lines or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Great product, goes on nice and not greasy.</li>
            <li> how good it is.  </li>
            <li> LOVED IT and recommended it to family and friends!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> Does not have the SPF in it, but that is good for me too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizer with a good price.</li>
            <li> and I am good to go.</li>
            <li> good face cream.</li>
            <li> Best part its full of ingredients that protect and heal your skin.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I did research and found that this moisturizer contains lots of great anti-aging ingredients and the price was even more affordable through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a wonderful hand cream;-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it!</li>
            <li> Have used for years and still love it!  </li>
            <li> But I was primarily interested in a good moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> to better skin!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Olay products are the very best and the most economical!  </li>
            <li> My wife has used this Olay moisturizer for 20 years and her face &amp;#34;glows&amp;#34; -- she is so beautiful (at age 72) -- and attributes her fresh good looks to this Olay product.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m acne prone this fragrance free lotion works great and leaves my skin looking dewy and youthful despite the loads of acne meds</li>
            <li> This moisturizer smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> Great product - it goes on smoothly with no after-effect or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great -- it handles eczema and dryness really well and for people without those conditions it is probably  great too.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s really nice is my oily skin was balanced.  </li>
            <li> It works well on its own and with my prescription tretinoin.  </li>
            <li> This is the best all-around anti-aging moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used, truly targeting 7 skin aging problems.</li>
            <li> nice nice</li>
            <li> gives a nice feeling over all.</li>
            <li> Well, this one is perfect and good for sensitive skin besides.</li>
            <li> This fragrance free version is pleasant and lightweight and I believe has kept my wrinkles from increasing in appearance for 2 years since I started using it.</li>
            <li> The best cream so far.</li>
            <li> yes but goes far and an excellent product.  </li>
            <li> The soft, non-greasy feeling was WONDERFUL on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Loved that it was fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> This product gives your skin a vibrant smooth look, it is great!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, very fair skin</li>
            <li> Things have changed - and NOT for the better.  </li>
            <li> I love Olay skin care</li>
            <li> /&gt;Could be more product for the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> so I grabbed some Olay Daily Wash too - perfect.</li>
            <li> Wish it did more for fading age spots.</li>
            <li> I love the Olay products, and this was no disapointment.</li>
            <li> Too many blemishes pop up on my face and when applying the cream becomes flaky.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer makes me look better day after day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d order it again for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I have not found a better moisturizer at any price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion.</li>
            <li> &quot; it to me and said it has great anti-aging properties even for young skin (mid-twenties in my case - she said early prevention is best).  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff -</li>
            <li> I love how it feels going on - I put it on after washing my face at the end of the day and wear it while sleeping.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for sometime now through Amazon subscribe and save program and find that the price is better than grocery stores</li>
            <li> Have used Olay for many years.</li>
            <li> I love it based on the evidence of the result.  </li>
            <li> just love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this moisturizer because I have always been satisfied with Olay products.  </li>
            <li> The price is getting more and that I dont like it  </li>
            <li> nithing more to say.</li>
            <li> Nice texture and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> and sometimes I am even able to use an Amazon coupon to make it even lower.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many, and I&#x27;m a guy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  been using it for more than a year</li>
            <li> Love this product, has been using it for quite some time now.  </li>
            <li> Love that it has no scent.</li>
            <li> but then return to better products.</li>
            <li> l just love the feel of this moisturizer and</li>
            <li> I would probably buy again unless I found something better.</li>
            <li> I love Olay products</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brands and because of a terrific review by a fellow Sr, Citizen on Amazon&#x27;s site, I tried it and think it&#x27;s probably the best.</li>
            <li> and I love the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> Olay is the best facial product I have found--I even mix this with my foundation to make it apply more evenly and in a more moist fashion.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for 15 years or more.</li>
            <li> makes my skin look better.</li>
            <li> Love this..</li>
            <li> How could a product purchased in the supermarket do a better job?  </li>
            <li> Very happy with the olay total effects.  </li>
            <li> my skin is much better now...</li>
            <li> I have tried another lines of Olay brand skin products and now sure that Total effect works the best for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> My husband love it too...</li>
            <li> Girls in my household love this and will be repeat purchasers.</li>
            <li> Nice texture, goes on smooth and not one iota of sticky.</li>
            <li> I may get some more for her</li>
            <li> i have used this moisturizer before too.one of the best ones.my skin feels so soft and fresh after using it.</li>
            <li> It is the greatest moisturizer i&#x27;ve ever used, and I haven&#x27;t had dry skin on my face since.</li>
            <li> super nice A++++.</li>
            <li> It feels rich yet lightweight at the same time - the perfect combination for combination skin!</li>
            <li> Great product and great price here compared to retail stores; can&#x27;t beat it; always arrives quickly and good for sensitive skin, especially the no fragrance part.  </li>
            <li> I find my cheap Suave hand lotion moisturizes my skin better, and at about 1/50th the cost ounce for ounce.</li>
            <li> OR most importantly there wasn&#x27;t the plug in the nozzle (where the lotion is dispensed).</li>
            <li> wish there were more fragrance free products that worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many compliments since using this product saying my skin looks fabulous and with a glow.  </li>
            <li> Many frangrance free creams give me a rash.</li>
            <li> This is especially true considering the fact that there does not seem to be a whole lot of moisturizers in it.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used, other than for Creme De La Mer.</li>
            <li> A stopper is no longer affixed to the pump, which seems like a safety issue, since the product could be easily tampered with.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> after hours of reading on pores and make up for oily skin, I order this product and I cannot be more happy; if you have large pores this moisturizer is for you, because it has zinc and Titanium, two minerals recommended for large pores.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first \\&quot;bottle\\&quot; with an amazing coupon as a splurge.  </li>
            <li> at first I really liked this product.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a reduction in fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes after 3 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> but the fine lines under my eyes are still there</li>
            <li> its glowing and the fine lines have reduced .</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly and soaks right in without a greasy \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always need to buy the fragrance free, though.  </li>
            <li> I rarely use drugstore products, as most of my skin care is physician/prescription strength.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my face moist and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> been using this oil free day cream for day and night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Olay has been making great skin care products for years and this total effects product is proof of that!</li>
            <li> I use the fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Illuminating face moisturizer that is fabulous for the price.</li>
            <li> Product is truly fragrance free.</li>
            <li> This is just one great daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I like fragrance free because I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> When I put it on my skin it felt so smooth and even.</li>
            <li> but I would probably purchase the lightly scented one once this one is finished.</li>
            <li> I keep her stocked up with the great S&amp;S price and big clip-free coupons that come out from time to time.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-twenties and use the 7-in-1 fragrance free one.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s smooth.</li>
            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz]] and [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> far so good.</li>
            <li> Good for people sensitive to fragrance and some preservatives.  </li>
            <li> I only used these two products for the week and my skin looked amazing!  </li>
            <li> Very pleased so far.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel great all day long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deceiving because it&#x27;s very rich feeling when it first goes on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the one with SPF-15 works better, but any of the couple different types of this 7in 1 moisturizer is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best facial cream I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> With age, my skin has gone through some changes, including becoming very sensitive,and this product is not only a great all-day moisturizer, but has reduced the size of my pores and reduced break-outs.</li>
            <li> The texture is rich and creamy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy and price was right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Fragrance Free Moisturizer for years and been very satisfied - until now.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, if you really care about wrinkles then invest in something better</li>
            <li> The cool thing about this product is that it is NOT greasy and has no perfumes.</li>
            <li> As good as any moisturizer you could buy at your local drug store.</li>
            <li> I do wish it didn&#x27;t cost as much as I would stock up on more of this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made this a Subscribe and Save item I love it so much.</li>
            <li> So far i have liked this cream.</li>
            <li> I always buy professional products and this is the first time I tried a drug store brand in many, many years.  </li>
            <li> It is so smooth and creamy and really makes makeup go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> but it absorbs quickly and never feels greasy.</li>
            <li> but your skin will adapt quickly.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> I used to use the regular kind but switched to the fragrance-free because that is what Amazon.com has available for Subscribe &amp; Save.  </li>
            <li> I wake up and get going quickly in the mornings and this applicator works well for me.  </li>
            <li> My face looks brighter :) i highly recommend this..</li>
            <li> I normally have combination to oily skin, and this made my skin more oily.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> love this alot ,I use this in the morning and micro sculpting at night my skin stays soft all through the winter and no drying!</li>
            <li> recently changed to coconut oil, which seems to work even better on my fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Very creamy and smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> This is a great everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer that isn&#x27;t overly greasy or heavy feeling on the face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the lowest priced moisturizer but for what it does, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Perhaps, my case is just really, really rare.</li>
            <li> If using daytime, I find if I apply it about an hour before doing make-up, the cream is completely absorbed by then.</li>
            <li> This lotion gives your face a fresh drink of moisture.  </li>
            <li> The Amazon price is far better than any store (even with a coupon)</li>
            <li> It seems like it would be really nice and luxurious for someone with regular skin, that&#x27;s why the two stars.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, and actually have oily skin, but I&#x27;ve always liked how it made my skin feel, and I&#x27;m quite picky about moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how soft it makes my skin.  </li>
            <li> im 33 and keeps my face fresh looking</li>
            <li> I like it better than regenerist, age defying and olay complete products I have tried</li>
            <li> and I put it in the morning and feel fresh all day.</li>
            <li> I found that is the right amount</li>
            <li> A half pump in the morning and at night is perfect and the bottle will last you 1.5 months.</li>
            <li> I love this on my sensitive skin, feels so soft and smooth after using, I apply this after taking a bath.</li>
            <li> My skin appearance (pores, fine lines, freckles) improved within a few weeks and it was truly AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> With the more expensive lotions, my skin was great</li>
            <li> its smooth and makes skin very soft..</li>
            <li> I use other Olay products and have been very pleased with them.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin, mostly oily, but gets SUPER DRY in the winter</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this, I had the exact same one with the light, clean scent.</li>
            <li> Compared to other products that easily cost twice as much or more, this product really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have sensitive skin and need fragrance free products.  </li>
            <li> This was my first beauty treatment from Olay.</li>
            <li> Pretty affordable too (compared to the moisturizer).</li>
            <li> I use this between using another cheaper and more simple moisturizer and the balance works for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every cent I pay for Olay as very seldom do the residents guess even close to 65</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 plus and when I run out I realize just how much better my skin feels using Total Effects.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that Oil of Olay had a fragrance free product; I know a lot of people who swear by it, but I&#x27;m allergic to perfume, so I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> I also love the Total Effects Tone</li>
            <li> but I have no signs of aging and at this point many of my friends are starting.</li>
            <li> This fragrance free variety without SPF has not given me any problem so far.</li>
            <li> Not greasy at all, even in the hot, humid weather.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products and this one is the only one that doesn&#x27;t cause me breakouts and has improved my complexion.  </li>
            <li> I used up the entire container and even broke off the top</li>
            <li> I placed my order on 4/8 and received it on 4/11, that was fast!</li>
            <li> This is not oily but leaves skin feeling like it has nothing on it, just soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have to say that I liked the one with the scent better because I felt that it was a better moisturizer and left you smelling clean but not overally perfumed.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any major changes in the appearance of my fine lines,</li>
            <li> If you have average to sensitive skin with no major issues to contend with, Olay products are a perfect, SIMPLE solution to maintain healthy skin.</li>
            <li> Fragrance-free, easily absorbed, no more a miracle worker than any other face product, but it truly is an excellent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love being able to have it on regular order and shipped every other month.</li>
            <li> This product, I feel, lacks the amount of moisture I need, that was in the scented one, as my face still feels dry many times.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have large pores untill</li>
            <li> I have large pores around my nose, chin and forhead, This didn&#x27;t help tighten those.</li>
            <li> IT keeps me looking young and vibrant with a special glow.</li>
            <li> did not notice a real change</li>
            <li> I put one whole pump morning and night because I use a medication that severely dries out my skin and</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much about its effects on lines or age spots yet</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: This lotion isn&#x27;t really living up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much so</li>
            <li> I just wiped it on w/o paying much attention to how I did it.    </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not using this for intense anti-aging effects</li>
            <li> It might provide too much moisture to use both day and night for people with oilier skin.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference straight away.  </li>
            <li> I really could not tell the difference based on my skin&#x27;s reaction.</li>
            <li> The product is excelent, is really moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I just got Olay Total Effects Fragrance Free this week.</li>
            <li> , if you want to try Olay Total Effects, get the one that is fragrance free and does not have the SPF.</li>
            <li> and I really can tell the difference.</li>
            <li> As for \\&quot;reducing the 7 signs of aging,\\&quot; I started using it in my 20&#x27;s, so I can&#x27;t really speak to that.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work really well.</li>
            <li> If you apply too much you get the oily effect and it doesn&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li> this product works very well for me...</li>
            <li> B0000CC64W Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Fragrance Free, 1.7-Fluid</li>
            <li> This product is very moisturizing-</li>
            <li> It really has NO fragrance, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> Does the hydrating job, but doesn&#x27;t really seem to fix anything when it comes to signs of aging</li>
            <li> I have really senstive skin also.</li>
            <li> so I need something that is really going to help me with that</li>
            <li> but she needs to get thru 3 bottles or what ever it is ,thanks.</li>
            <li> Received product really fast</li>
            <li> I was using Meaningful Beauty, and I constantly received compliments on my skin, and how young I looked.</li>
            <li> It felt heavy on my face and after a couple of hours, it kind of pealed of my face.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and was well wrapped and when I had a little problem it was fixed cheerfully and quickly.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve transitioned most of my personal care and beauty products to be free of parabens and other ingredients recognized as harmful by the EWG- Environmental Working Group.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely a good daily moisturizer, not too heavy or greasy, but it did not live up to the marketing and for the price we should get more.</li>
            <li> I like it very much for keeping my ski n soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> However, this moisturizer works very well and has a high percentage of niacinamide, which is known to even skin tone.  </li>
            <li> The one thing I don&#x27;t like is if you use too much and don&#x27;t rub it in really well right away it will flake off like peeling skin later in the day.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin fresh and not dry!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks and see noticable improvements to my face, particularly around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it really has improved the complexion of my skin, and it&#x27;s not too heavy for my oily skin.  </li>
            <li> It is more expensive than most face lotions, but its that price for a reason.</li>
            <li> Experiment with the amount your particular skin texture needs.  </li>
            <li> This for overall skin care, then I use cover up for under my eyes and a quick zip of blush</li>
            <li> I always woke up super greasy with a face full of little whiteheads.</li>
            <li> Since using this product on my hands, my husband has commented on how soft my hands have been, and again, I can see and feel a positive difference.  </li>
            <li> I served in the military and suffered in very dry climates in texas and in Iraq, trying many many different kinds of lotions.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to every and any woman who wants clear, toned, well maintained skin for years to come!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for everyone.</li>
            <li> As a moisturizer I highly recommend this but for anti aging...</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this moisturizer with very high hopes of slowing down the number of fine lines under my eyes and the sagging skin on both ends of my mouth.</li>
            <li> Rub it in completely, especially to wrinkles, crow&#x27;s feet and laugh lines.</li>
            <li> I have always had normal to combination skin.</li>
            <li> Started using it twice a week along side other lotions for my face and have been fine.</li>
            <li> Let me say that this stuff works better than the other two major products for hypoallergenics.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I feel like it&#x27;s just as effective as my mom&#x27;s super expensive stuff...</li>
            <li> I would often get many breakouts but needed a moisturizer for my face daily as I would get dry skin as well.  </li>
            <li> I washed it off right away using water and my long-time stand-by facial soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;am starting to really like Olay better than some of my more expensive products .Something about their formula</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a new fragrance-free moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are in the market for a new moisturizer, I would give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> I needed a new face moisturizer and figured I might as well get something to treat</li>
            <li> Since it lets you keep it simple, it remains affordable enough and definitely available anywhere.</li>
            <li> Later tried Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging on the backs of my hands; no skin reaction and it made my hands feel good--moisturized and smooth, but I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> The dry skin from the Retin A is always quickly corrected and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily.</li>
            <li> My skin is very clear and sof.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is very soft and supple.</li>
            <li> i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> my skin in very sensitive may be it didnt suit me.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Soon she will look too young to get seniors discounts without showing proof of age!</li>
            <li> the regular, original product is still the same as when I used it in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crossing fingers....</li>
            <li> I use Peter Thomas Roth cleanser and than I put this moisturizer , wow!</li>
            <li> Although I must admit I was skeptical after lathering on much more expensive products with excellent reviews from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have used Oil of Olay 7 in 1 anti-aging daily moisturizer for the last 10 years and I am so glad that I have because I am 50 years old, but the skin on my face makes me look much younger.  </li>
            <li> B001IM5VT4 Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer SPF 15 - 4 oz.]]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, although not any more so than similar products.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s psychological, but I feel like it makes my skin a little more greasy and clogged.</li>
            <li> Despite the bad reaction, it SEEMS even folks with sensitive skin (like me) SHOULD be able to use this more than once a day.</li>
            <li> I am 79 years old.</li>
            <li> Nearly all that saggy neck skin tightened.</li>
            <li> Could not use the night cream - - far too oily for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> I am 65 years old &amp; work at a teaching hospital  </li>
            <li> Wake up in the AM without that oily feeling but skin is soft.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Olay products since I was a teenager (now 38) and am completely in awe of this product.</li>
            <li> After one week I was looking at myself in the mirror in the early morning and thinking, &amp;#34;Oh</li>
            <li> wow...</li>
            <li> It really does help those facial lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> This works well with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> &amp; I am 19 years old</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive.....</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin, so it could be the chemicals in the moisturizer not getting along well with my skin.</li>
            <li> I am still young</li>
            <li> However, I let my mom pick one out and now this has replaced her Anew completely.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer blends in well and leaves my skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> B0012J135O Olay Complete Night</li>
            <li> I have acne prone, oily and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks now and my skin feels soft.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin prone to itchiness, rashes...</li>
            <li> My face can definitely tell when I forget to moisturize, my skin feels hard and dry, and my foundation doesn&#x27;t apply as nicely!</li>
            <li> After only one week of use the discoloration on my cheekbones and above my upper lip (which looked very much like a fake mustache) has been greatly dimished.  </li>
            <li> First of all let me say that I have dry skin</li>
            <li> This cream never irritates my skin and it completely removed  a few new fine lines I recently noticed around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have used Olay for over 30 years, Total Effects has become my main moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It could be a little bit better than regular moisturizers if you have a normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Every year when the new residents arrive our favorite game</li>
            <li> Makeup application is smooth, and seems to stay put longer than usual when I use this.</li>
            <li> Very good!I am so surprised that I can buy it in such a low price!</li>
            <li> But of late i developed some fine lines..</li>
            <li> and I only live in FL.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also works very well on the occasional age related spots of scale on arms, hands and legs.</li>
            <li> A major creamy clogger for the pores.</li>
            <li> Of course I put it on every day, but the daily chore is worth not being paranoid about dry, red, flaky skin on my face.</li>
            <li> no more losen skin specially on neck and close to eyes.</li>
            <li> As an added unexpected advantage, it got rid of some red, itchy patches on my chin and side of my nose that nothing else helped!</li>
            <li> I have adult acne prone skin and feel like I&#x27;ve tried every moderately priced moisturizer under the sun.</li>
            <li> Being a lotion and rather thin in consistency, you will have to use a lot more.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for someone that has been searching for a cure for their dry skin on their face.</li>
            <li> You may notice a slight redness or tingling the first time you use it</li>
            <li> But as an Anti-Ager and all the other stuff it&#x27;s supposed to do not so much.</li>
            <li> No dry skin, redness gone, and no breakouts at all.</li>
            <li> My first several purchases of this product, both through Amazon and a local warehouse store were for the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; 7-in-1 anti-aging moisturizer with a slight fragrance.  </li>
            <li> have been less than gentle with them.  </li>
            <li> is guess the Social worker&#x27;s age correctly &amp; get extra credit.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer really does keep my face soft, even in the harsh northern winter, and I tend to have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> The description said it was new, but if it was new it would have had at least the plug in the nozzle..........</li>
            <li> I might be sensitive to  other products as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve called Olay to register my complaint and the customer service people aren&#x27;t even aware of the packaging change-</li>
            <li> Also, the red, flaky dry patches beside my nose and at the corners of my mouth as well as one between my eyes are, yes, gone.  </li>
            <li> I am a male and have always had problems with dry skin on my face.</li>
            <li> I really do recommend this for winter when the wind here in the mountains just dries out my face terribly AND yet gives good SPF protection.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other expensive products..</li>
            <li> I keep trying other products hoping they will work as well as Total Effects, but I keep coming back to this one because it is so reliable.</li>
            <li> It leaves a residue  and is absorbed very slowly.</li>
            <li> you blend too hard or much</li>
            <li> This product is actually a lotion, not a creme which I expected.</li>
            <li> - it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and keeps my skin soft but firm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even harder to find these things in a product that actually makes a difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> Within a few days, my 45-year old skin had....</li>
            <li> Olay helped me decide to stick with it for a while..a long long while</li>
            <li> It could leave a greasy feeling all day long.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft without being heavy and the pump usually gives me just the right amount so that none is wasted.</li>
            <li> But this product is a disappoinment,&lt;br /&gt;the lotion couldn&#x27;t be absorbed, like a thin mask on your face, when it&#x27;s dry you can rubbed it off from your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a redhead with pale, sensitive, and dry skin.</li>
            <li> but probably only due to genetics</li>
            <li> Olay has other lines like their Regenerist line for anti aging and that&#x27;s totally focused on anti aging.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different facial cleansers and lotions over the past year.  </li>
            <li> i always have been a clinique dramatcially different gel user due to my skin allergies.</li>
            <li> the dry flakes are now gone.</li>
            <li> This product returned; I use this in the colder months and my face feels nourished and the dry scaly areas disappear.</li>
            <li> But I have combination oily and dry skin, and acne.</li>
            <li> but my skin still looked dry and lifeless.</li>
            <li> I have dry cheeks and oily in T-Zone and it didn&#x27;t help with the dryness AT ALL.</li>
            <li> After applying it, my skin appeared to have thin white film like I had put too much baby powder.</li>
            <li> While I still find it sticky- the other benefits far outweigh a little stickyness.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am just hopeful, but I think it has helped keep the age lines limited.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely pricey and not much comes in the bottle, but if you don&#x27;t overuse and use a pea size amount everyday it should last a bit</li>
            <li> My neck was an over abundance of loose saggy skin.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced it actually changes anything about your skin, it just slightly masks flaws.</li>
            <li> Once I did that, I was never able to transition back to my former moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> My skin was actually softer and looked less lizard like.  </li>
            <li> 11/25: I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and a half and had to come back and edit my review.</li>
            <li> I have very, very dry skin, but am allergic to everything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this for years but was afraid to spend the money when I know my skin is super sensitive, and it could just turn out to be a waste.</li>
            <li> After using it religiously for about 3 weeks, I started to notice little bumps almost like a rash start to appear on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Lately I found that soap dried my skin too much</li>
            <li> I use it nightly  and find that one bottle generally lasts about a month using a small amount each night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I received a sample packet in the mail a few years back</li>
            <li> I finally tried this one a few weeks ago and while it is not causing rashes or drying my skin out, it is causing me to break out along my hairline.  </li>
            <li> You might end up a lifelong user, like me.</li>
            <li> Only negative is such a small container doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> I use  Clinique all my life, but last few months my skin, which is oily with large pores, got so bad that I decided to try something new; Dior, Laura, Lancôme,  name it</li>
            <li> It is NOT GOOD FOR SENSITIVE SKIN!</li>
            <li> They interact well with each other, too.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to blot my face several times a day.  </li>
            <li> and this doesn&#x27;t burn, break me out, or bother my skin in any other way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Total Effects for the past three nights</li>
            <li> Have tried other brands a couple times but can always tell a difference.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t notice any other claimed benefits.</li>
            <li> I have combo skin with breakouts due to dryness.  </li>
            <li> A merry go round of skin products later still no significant improvement.  </li>
            <li> Not too heavy but can handle the dry spells</li>
            <li> Every single time I used this as a night cream (sometime days in a row, sometimes I&#x27;d wait a few days and they try again)</li>
            <li> It can be hard to find a moisturizer without fragrance, and especially without sunblock (if I&#x27;m not going in the sun, I don&#x27;t want sunblock) !</li>
            <li> and i can see the dark spots disappearing ...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want my usual long, drawn out skin regimen.  </li>
            <li> I started using it in my mid twenties and continue (currently late twenties).  </li>
            <li> So far it hasn&#x27;t broken me out or irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a  good product but the Seller is TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a very light product.</li>
            <li> This led me down the Olay path of skin care</li>
            <li> More expensive but not as expensive as other stuff like products you&#x27;d find in Sephora.</li>
            <li> much less any change in the product</li>
            <li> typical face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use this on my ankles to help the appearance of little black dots (hair follicles).</li>
            <li> and I can already see my skin has a smoother texture and the little lines around my eyes are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned before buying and applying it.</li>
            <li> , my skin felt now a little lifted,</li>
            <li> Otherwise, my skin can get a little irritated.</li>
            <li> The reason I am giving four stars instead of five is that I wish it lasted a little bit longer based on the price.</li>
            <li> It is one of the few moisturizers that doesn&#x27;t make me breakout, rubs in cleanly, no greasy feeling and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s just &#x27;sitting&#x27; on my skin.</li>
            <li> Olay had changed the formula to a much thicker one, and it was difficult to spread without pulling at delicate skin.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding this in the stores but leave it to Amazon to come to the rescue.  </li>
            <li> I often applied it a few times a day.</li>
            <li> I went onto the Olay site about a year ago and it asked for your skin problems and after I answered a few questions it recommended this product.</li>
            <li> but geez, what a coincidence that I just happen to brake out just a few days after using it...</li>
            <li> Well I tried it, and it was a waste.</li>
            <li> and I could never get rid of the greasy, heavy feeling until I washed my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also felt like it dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is not only a poor moisturizer, it does nothing for aging skin .</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> Then a few weeks ago I added a variety of Olay products to do battle.  </li>
            <li> Comparing with other similar treatments, it looks a little expensive, but I subscribed from Amazon to get 15% off.</li>
            <li> Could have been a combination of many things; but since using this product my skin broke out worst than any other time in my life...</li>
            <li> Not greasy,doesn&#x27;t cause acne, I also buy the one that has a touch of foundation in it when my skin is so pale in the winter months.</li>
            <li> The product is worth a try, but if you do have a reaction, it&#x27;s also a waste of money.  : (</li>
            <li> One was light and almost rejuvenating, and the other was a TERRIBLE waste of</li>
            <li> There is actually very little product in this packaging.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this moisturizer, but after 3 days of using it, I got bad breakouts all over my face.  </li>
            <li> It unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> No more flackiness and itching.  </li>
            <li> Not magic but does help.</li>
            <li> the people who say it feels greasy, use small amounts, don&#x27;t \\&quot;slather\\&quot;</li>
            <li> There is also excessive packaging for a small quantity of the product.</li>
            <li> Was not sure how this would be because I used to see the ones with the tint</li>
            <li> I would get flaky dry skin around my nose, and would get so bad it would turn red, and I was so embarassed by my face.</li>
            <li> after a few weeks of use you will notice the subtle changes--for the price--you can&#x27;t beat this</li>
            <li> I have been on long term steroid therapy combined with winter&#x27;s harsh wind and cold made my face drier than the Sahara Desert.</li>
            <li> I used this product, it makes my skin look hard and greasy.</li>
            <li> I had a coupon for a freebie from P&amp;G after being very disappointed with another face cream of their, and went back to my &#x27;old&#x27; one (RoC).</li>
            <li> Have used the product at least 3 years and started as a response to a dermatologist discussing the benefits of vitamins for the skin.  </li>
            <li> Big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for at least 5 years now, and I find it always does the trick.</li>
            <li> At least it didn&#x27;t cause acne.</li>
            <li> I tried this for a few months, and my skin became worse.</li>
            <li> This is a thick lotion that isn&#x27;t greasy</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this based on the reviews, but the smell is terrible.</li>
            <li> I was worried because some reviewers said that they had bad reactions, and that it&#x27;s not good if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I can tell the difference when I try less expensive products.  </li>
            <li> This is hard to find!</li>
            <li> It felt like I was putting on a very thick, greasy suntan lotion mask.  </li>
            <li> It does make your skin oily.. &amp;&amp; after putting it on,, In a few hours pimples started appearing on my cheeks and face!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried expensive creams, but I have a hard time spending $40+ on a bottle of moisturizer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried newer Olay products and they made my skin start sagging worse, and the patches came back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tube was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> I am not happy that the product contains parabens though, so I won&#x27;t buy it again for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> yes, even worst than in high school.</li>
            <li> I hate it when my moisturizer slithers of my face like an oil slick, or is so thick you almost have to add water to spread it onto your face.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when Olay discontinued their definity line and took a chance on the Total Effects line.</li>
            <li> i was skeptical if i would end up with skin allergies with this product as well.</li>
            <li> I am always desperate for products I can use, and this fills the bill.</li>
            <li> So, that&#x27;s the bad news.  </li>
            <li> However, halfway through the bottle, my skin created a bad reaction &amp; my face broke out in a rash.  </li>
            <li> There is no savings when a product is so bad you THROW IT AWAY.</li>
            <li> and I have not had any bad reaction to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The people who had bad reactions bought the one with SPF.</li>
            <li> My face is still ugly</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

            <li> Good product, wife loves it, this is all she used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Fragrance Free Moisturizer for years and been very satisfied - until now.  Things have changed - and NOT for the better.  A stopper is no longer affixed to the pump, which seems like a safety issue, since the product could be easily tampered with.  Also the moisturizer itself seems very different - thicker,  feels sticky on my face, and appears to clog my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve called Olay to register my complaint and the customer service people aren&#x27;t even aware of the packaging change- much less any change in the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the last purchase for me.  I&#x27;m looking for a new fragrance-free moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I started looking at the 5-star reviews and they all appear to be prior to 2012/2013.  I would have3 given it a 5 star review last year before the change.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected.  I purchased via Amazon because of the price</li>
            <li> I love Olay skin care but I have sensitive skin and need fragrance free products.  I was having trouble finding this in the stores but leave it to Amazon to come to the rescue.  Great price and great moisturizer!!  Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Quick and easy and price was right</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, although not any more so than similar products.  However, it seems to be working and feels great on my skin.  I definitely notice the difference when I don&#x27;t use it!!</li>
            <li> My mom started me on Oil of Olay products when I was in my 20&#x27;s.  This is probably one of the best products Olay has produced.  I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks and see noticable improvements to my face, particularly around the eyes.  I work with my hands have been less than gentle with them.  Since using this product on my hands, my husband has commented on how soft my hands have been, and again, I can see and feel a positive difference.  I bought a bottle for every woman in my family.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it has made me look any younger with it&#x27;s use but it does feel good going on and soothes irritation from shaving the sun etc. I like it.</li>
            <li> This was my first beauty treatment from Olay. I was a little concerned before buying and applying it. I applied it and result came about after for two weeks, my skin felt now a little lifted, no more losen skin specially on neck and close to eyes. I apply it daily before sleep, once a day.    Comparing with other similar treatments, it looks a little expensive, but I subscribed from Amazon to get 15% off.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Non greasy&lt;br /&gt;The pump gives a perfect amount&lt;br /&gt;Nice packaging&lt;br /&gt;Hydrates&lt;br /&gt;Lightly scented&lt;br /&gt;Non irritating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I did not notice a real change&lt;br /&gt;Its lotion marketed to be a fix all&lt;br /&gt;Could be more product for the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a good daily moisturizer, not too heavy or greasy, but it did not live up to the marketing and for the price we should get more.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a week now and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is very soft and supple. I put one whole pump morning and night because I use a medication that severely dries out my skin and the dry flakes are now gone. Only time will tell if it has anti aging properties, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try.</li>
            <li> recently changed to coconut oil, which seems to work even better on my fine lines and wrinkles.  Until I found it, this was the best stuff I&#x27;ve used.  I always need to buy the fragrance free, though.  Otherwise, my skin can get a little irritated.</li>
            <li> I received a sample packet in the mail a few years back and I knew I had to have this product because of the way it made my skin look and feel.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this cream for about a week now but so far so good. It is so smooth and creamy and really makes makeup go on smoothly. The one thing I don&#x27;t like is if you use too much and don&#x27;t rub it in really well right away it will flake off like peeling skin later in the day. I can&#x27;t say much about its effects on lines or age spots yet but hopefully it helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: This lotion isn&#x27;t really living up to my expectations. I&#x27;m not convinced it actually changes anything about your skin, it just slightly masks flaws. Once I run out I&#x27;m going back to my Aveeno [[ASIN:B001IM5VT4 Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer SPF 15 - 4 oz.]]</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this moisturizer, but after 3 days of using it, I got bad breakouts all over my face.  I normally have combination to oily skin, and this made my skin more oily.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Olay Total Effects 7-1- is great.  I have been using it for 30 years!  It is a great skin care product and recommend olay to all!!!</li>
            <li> This is hard to find! I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s discontinued? Olay had changed the formula to a much thicker one, and it was difficult to spread without pulling at delicate skin. This product returned; I use this in the colder months and my face feels nourished and the dry scaly areas disappear. Also an &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; spot is lighter as well. No stinky stuff and has spf for protection. Love it.</li>
            <li> Around 30, I started getting frown lines while still having pimples (yay!). I started using Olay Total Effects nightly for my combination skin (stork bites around nose, too). What a difference! It absorbs perfectly and leaves no film, and there&#x27;s no adjustment period where your skin breaks out. Helps fine lines APPEAR LESS (not sure it can get rid of them) and balances skin. You don&#x27;t need much so that helps the $ a bit. I don&#x27;t use it under makeup because I use mineral powder only and it gets in its way if i don&#x27;t wait 15 minutes (time I don&#x27;t have in the morning, but you might!).    Lately I found that soap dried my skin too much so I grabbed some Olay Daily Wash too - perfect. No dry skin, redness gone, and no breakouts at all. Pretty affordable too (compared to the moisturizer). Tone is overall evened out. Skin&#x27;s just a bit brighter.    If you have average to sensitive skin with no major issues to contend with, Olay products are a perfect, SIMPLE solution to maintain healthy skin. It has never required an adjustment period for me, spreads well, and never leaves a film. They interact well with each other, too.  No overnight miracles but overnight RELIEF with long-term improvement. Strongly recommend. Since it lets you keep it simple, it remains affordable enough and definitely available anywhere.</li>
            <li> I have used Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging  cream for several years.  I like it very much for keeping my ski n soft and hydrated.  There is one  thing it has not helped, a brown age spot on my face.  Wish it did more for fading age spots. I am 79 years old.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this based on the reviews, but the smell is terrible. It smells like the tanning lotion people wear to go in a tanning bed but after you have been tanning. Like a burnt tanning lotion smell. I&#x27;m very disappointed. I had to wash it off my face immediately.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great -- it handles eczema and dryness really well and for people without those conditions it is probably  great too.  The package and bottle likely account for 1/2 the price, but it is the only thing I have found that works this well.</li>
            <li> Just a week and i can see the dark spots disappearing ... its smooth and makes skin very soft.. My face looks brighter :) i highly recommend this..</li>
            <li> I used this morning cream along with their night cream.    problem:  I&#x27;m a 65 yo male that has always had a ruddy complexion. I wore a cervical neck collar for about 6 years, plus losing about 100 pounds about 2 years ago. My neck was an over abundance of loose saggy skin.    I used both the day and night creams. I just wiped it on w/o paying much attention to how I did it.    RESULT after 1 month:  Nearly all that saggy neck skin tightened. It unbelievable.  plus-  I&#x27;ve received comments from three different people who commented, \\&quot;you look great - what have you done to your face and neck!\\&quot; THAT SAYS IT ALL&gt;    I&#x27;ll definitely reorder these two products.</li>
            <li> After only one week of use the discoloration on my cheekbones and above my upper lip (which looked very much like a fake mustache) has been greatly dimished.  Also, the red, flaky dry patches beside my nose and at the corners of my mouth as well as one between my eyes are, yes, gone.  No more flackiness and itching.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the improvement with my  continued use of this product.  After reading the review about the improvement of the saggy neck I&#x27;m going to start applying it to my neck area.</li>
            <li> I was using Meaningful Beauty, and I constantly received compliments on my skin, and how young I looked. To save money, I tried switching to Olay products. I&#x27;m a redhead with pale, sensitive, and dry skin. I tried this for a few months, and my skin became worse. Definitely didn&#x27;t do anything regarding wrinkles! I also had to use quite a bit to keep my skin moisturized. I often applied it a few times a day. Needless to say, I&#x27;m back to using Meaningful Beauty.</li>
            <li> This product is actually a lotion, not a creme which I expected. Being a lotion and rather thin in consistency, you will have to use a lot more. This is especially true considering the fact that there does not seem to be a whole lot of moisturizers in it. I find my cheap Suave hand lotion moisturizes my skin better, and at about 1/50th the cost ounce for ounce.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it really has improved the complexion of my skin, and it&#x27;s not too heavy for my oily skin.  I have officially converted to this stuff for good!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and people always comment on how young-looking my skin is. It&#x27;s deceiving because it&#x27;s very rich feeling when it first goes on but it absorbs quickly and never feels greasy. An excellent product.</li>
            <li> Another good product from Olay. Not magic but does help. Regular use of this product is the key to getting the results advertised.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Thank you. Great shipping A++++</li>
            <li> after a few weeks of use you will notice the subtle changes--for the price--you can&#x27;t beat this</li>
            <li> i have very sensitive skin and i&#x27;m acne prone this fragrance free lotion works great and leaves my skin looking dewy and youthful despite the loads of acne meds i put on it!</li>
            <li> I was hospitalized for an entire week and couldn&#x27;t take a lot of my skin care with me.  I only packed Glytone exfoliating wash for Oily Skin and Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging moisturizer. I didn&#x27;t want my usual long, drawn out skin regimen.  I only used these two products for the week and my skin looked amazing!  My pores diminished and my skin tone was even.  What&#x27;s really nice is my oily skin was balanced.  I didn&#x27;t have any oily skin problems while using this and that says a lot.  I usually have to blot my face several times a day.  So far it hasn&#x27;t broken me out or irritated my skin.  I rarely use drugstore products, as most of my skin care is physician/prescription strength.  However, this moisturizer works very well and has a high percentage of niacinamide, which is known to even skin tone.  It works well on its own and with my prescription tretinoin.  I highly recommend this for everyone.</li>
            <li> I love the Olay products, and this was no disapointment. Very creamy and smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> I am a male and have always had problems with dry skin on my face. I would get flaky dry skin around my nose, and would get so bad it would turn red, and I was so embarassed by my face. I served in the military and suffered in very dry climates in texas and in Iraq, trying many many different kinds of lotions. I used aveeno for the longest time because that was the best I found, but wouldn&#x27;t keep my face moisturized for more than 12 hours. I went onto the Olay site about a year ago and it asked for your skin problems and after I answered a few questions it recommended this product. It is the greatest moisturizer i&#x27;ve ever used, and I haven&#x27;t had dry skin on my face since. Of course I put it on every day, but the daily chore is worth not being paranoid about dry, red, flaky skin on my face. I&#x27;ve found that the one with SPF-15 works better, but any of the couple different types of this 7in 1 moisturizer is amazing. I highly recommend it for someone that has been searching for a cure for their dry skin on their face. It is more expensive than most face lotions, but its that price for a reason. It&#x27;s very effective and a high-quality reliable product.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used, other than for Creme De La Mer. I use this between using another cheaper and more simple moisturizer and the balance works for me. After a night, there is a visual change in the quality of my skin. There is actually very little product in this packaging. I opened the container once and it was laughable the way they designed the bottle to make it look like it would contain a lot more product. It&#x27;s not the lowest priced moisturizer but for what it does, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years.  It keeps my face moist and comfortable.  I love being able to have it on regular order and shipped every other month.</li>
            <li> there weren&#x27;t stickers sealing the box OR most importantly there wasn&#x27;t the plug in the nozzle (where the lotion is dispensed). The description said it was new, but if it was new it would have had at least the plug in the nozzle..........</li>
            <li> Too many blemishes pop up on my face and when applying the cream becomes flaky.  Looks like foundation applied incorrectly</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews so I thought it had to be good.  I will never buy this product again, it left a residue on my face that made my makeup roll off. I didn&#x27;t have large pores untill I used this product, it makes my skin look hard and greasy. The best thing I&#x27;ve used is Olay regenerating serum, and I will stick to that from now on.</li>
            <li> Could not use the night cream - - far too oily for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Have been using this oil free day cream for day and night.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;ve used Olay for years. It&#x27;s not greasy &amp; works wonders.  I am 65 years old &amp; work at a teaching hospital  Every year when the new residents arrive our favorite game is guess the Social worker&#x27;s age correctly &amp; get extra credit.  It&#x27;s worth every cent I pay for Olay as very seldom do the residents guess even close to 65</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a couple of years and Amazon has the best price. I&#x27;m 50 plus and when I run out I realize just how much better my skin feels using Total Effects. Olay has always offered great products. There is a good reason why they have been around forever. They are that good.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer makes me look better day after day. Wish I&#x27;d found it in my 20&#x27;s but we can&#x27;t turn back the clocks of time. Use it every day...yep even as a male I&#x27;m using this stuff...Olay has been making great skin care products for years and this total effects product is proof of that!</li>
            <li> I hate it when my moisturizer slithers of my face like an oil slick, or is so thick you almost have to add water to spread it onto your face. Just one pump of this covers my face, neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;. Makeup application is smooth, and seems to stay put longer than usual when I use this. I haven&#x27;t noticed any major changes in the appearance of my fine lines, etc&lt;br /&gt;But I do like he way my skin feels when I use this.  I&#x27;d order it again for sure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good moisturizer for me but I&#x27;m 18 so I&#x27;m not using this for intense anti-aging effects lol. I just wanted an anti aging moisturizer but I know this is nothing compared to my mom&#x27;s $50+ skincare products. It&#x27;s moisturizing but not greasy which is great! I can use this before putting on my makeup without getting incredibly oily. I have combination skin, mostly oily, but gets SUPER DRY in the winter and I only live in FL.&lt;br /&gt;My aunt who&#x27;s in her 50s uses this and I feel like it&#x27;s just as effective as my mom&#x27;s super expensive stuff... but probably only due to genetics (we&#x27;re Asian). As a moisturizer I highly recommend this but for anti aging... I don&#x27;t know, if you really care about wrinkles then invest in something better but if you just want a good moisturizer then go for this. Olay has other lines like their Regenerist line for anti aging and that&#x27;s totally focused on anti aging. More expensive but not as expensive as other stuff like products you&#x27;d find in Sephora.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of the buzz words...anti-aging, 7 benefits for aging skin for younger looking skin blah blah. This is a thick lotion that isn&#x27;t greasy but I prefer a serum (Olay Regeneristl) Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, etc and three kinds of PARABENS! Uh, I have already had breast cancer and am not putting known carcinogens on my skin, The Regenerist Serum I mentioned has no parabens.</li>
            <li> Have used the product at least 3 years and started as a response to a dermatologist discussing the benefits of vitamins for the skin.  Have used it faithfully and will continue to do so.  Wake up in the AM without that oily feeling but skin is soft.  Maybe I am just hopeful, but I think it has helped keep the age lines limited.  You may notice a slight redness or tingling the first time you use it but your skin will adapt quickly.</li>
            <li> My friend recommend this to me, she said it is a very wonderful moisture,so  I ordered it.Now I have used this moisturizer in the morning for several days.The texture is rich and creamy and absorbs quickly. It leaves my face well moisturized and actually glowing.I love this moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say how it works on existing lines and wrinkles,but I feel it may help prevent them.</li>
            <li> Could have been a combination of many things; but since using this product my skin broke out worst than any other time in my life...yes, even worst than in high school. Again, I&#x27;m not prepared to put the blame solely on this product...but geez, what a coincidence that I just happen to brake out just a few days after using it...So, that&#x27;s the bad news.  The cool thing about this product is that it is NOT greasy and has no perfumes. Despite the bad reaction, it SEEMS even folks with sensitive skin (like me) SHOULD be able to use this more than once a day. Perhaps, my case is just really, really rare. It is for this reason that I didn&#x27;t rate it \\&quot;1\\&quot; star.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay products since I was a teenager (now 38) and am completely in awe of this product. Compared to other products that easily cost twice as much or more, this product really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply it in the morning before make-up or even apply it in the evening after make-up. It goes on very smoothly and soaks right in without a greasy \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this product a try. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> As good as any moisturizer you could buy at your local drug store.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t purchase this again it causes my skin to have irritation and breakouts. But it&#x27;s a wonderful hand cream;-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I have not found a better moisturizer at any price. I use the fragrance free.</li>
            <li> This is the best all-around anti-aging moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used, truly targeting 7 skin aging problems. You can get it with or without sunscreen. This fragrance free version is pleasant and lightweight and I believe has kept my wrinkles from increasing in appearance for 2 years since I started using it. Although it hasn&#x27;t necessarily made the wrinkles that were already there \\&quot;disappear,\\&quot; it makes my foundation go on smoother and not settle into creases, and it seems agreeable to any brand of foundation I&#x27;ve used. As an added unexpected advantage, it got rid of some red, itchy patches on my chin and side of my nose that nothing else helped! I&#x27;ve tried newer Olay products and they made my skin start sagging worse, and the patches came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the people who say it feels greasy, use small amounts, don&#x27;t \\&quot;slather\\&quot; it on - it goes a long way. Rub it in completely, especially to wrinkles, crow&#x27;s feet and laugh lines. If using daytime, I find if I apply it about an hour before doing make-up, the cream is completely absorbed by then. It might provide too much moisture to use both day and night for people with oilier skin.</li>
            <li> The best cream so far. Have been using it for years,  no complaints.  Tried others, always go back to this one</li>
            <li> This is a great everyday moisturizer. Not too heavy but can handle the dry spells my skin goes through. I purchased this to get a head start on fighting wrinkles. I have noticed a reduction in fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes after 3 weeks of use. I am a believer in this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am so bummed &#x27;cause at first I really liked this product.  However, halfway through the bottle, my skin created a bad reaction &amp; my face broke out in a rash.  The product is worth a try, but if you do have a reaction, it&#x27;s also a waste of money.  : (</li>
            <li> I was surprised that Oil of Olay had a fragrance free product; I know a lot of people who swear by it, but I&#x27;m allergic to perfume, so I couldn&#x27;t use it. It works really well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion. I have tried many other expensive products.. Can&#x27;t beat the price or the results. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Illuminating face moisturizer that is fabulous for the price.</li>
            <li> This stuff is SO GOOD. After one week I was looking at myself in the mirror in the early morning and thinking, &amp;#34;Oh my gosh, I don&#x27;t need makeup!&amp;#34; Seriously. I&#x27;ve all but quit using foundation since I started using Olay Total Effects 7 regularly. I have sensitive, very fair skin and this doesn&#x27;t burn, break me out, or bother my skin in any other way. I&#x27;ve already repurchased this and I don&#x27;t intend to stop using it any time soon.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer that isn&#x27;t overly greasy or heavy feeling on the face.  My dermatologist \\&quot;prescribed\\&quot; it to me and said it has great anti-aging properties even for young skin (mid-twenties in my case - she said early prevention is best).  It is also noncomedogenic (won&#x27;t clog pores), so it&#x27;s good for acne-prone skin like mine.  It feels rich yet lightweight at the same time - the perfect combination for combination skin!</li>
            <li> Bought this for Mom. She uses and enjoys! Soon she will look too young to get seniors discounts without showing proof of age! But it and try it for yourself!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything..</li>
            <li> i got a red rash on my cheek after using this. stopped using after 2days of buying this. I bought it to through in my trash can. my skin in very sensitive may be it didnt suit me.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - I noticed a difference straight away.  I love how it feels going on - I put it on after washing my face at the end of the day and wear it while sleeping.  If it had sunscreen in it, I&#x27;d likely reapply in the morning, but I switch products to get sun protection.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for sometime now through Amazon subscribe and save program and find that the price is better than grocery stores etc. I use it nightly  and find that one bottle generally lasts about a month using a small amount each night. It absorbs quickly.  The reason I am giving four stars instead of five is that I wish it lasted a little bit longer based on the price.</li>
            <li> Product is truly fragrance free. It is hydrating, but not overly greasy - doesn&#x27;t leave a residue at all! My face can definitely tell when I forget to moisturize, my skin feels hard and dry, and my foundation doesn&#x27;t apply as nicely! This product doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and keeps my skin soft but firm. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it!</li>
            <li> This is a good product, not to greasy, but I have not noticed any diminishing lines or wrinkles. Then again, it does say anti-aging, so who knows it might be doing its job- not letting me age from here on out. I&#x27;ll let you know in a couple of years.</li>
            <li> for a couple years i have been purchasing this oil of olay moisturizer for around 25 dollars at cvs and am amazed to find it at amazon for around 10 dollars...wow...now i can use it on my chest and hands in addition to my face and neck...</li>
            <li> I use this on my ankles to help the appearance of little black dots (hair follicles).</li>
            <li> Have used Olay for many years. Not greasy,doesn&#x27;t cause acne, I also buy the one that has a touch of foundation in it when my skin is so pale in the winter months.</li>
            <li> I use this product every night on my face after washing it and I have seen some wonderful results and will order it again soon.</li>
            <li> It can be hard to find a moisturizer without fragrance, and especially without sunblock (if I&#x27;m not going in the sun, I don&#x27;t want sunblock) ! It&#x27;s even harder to find these things in a product that actually makes a difference in your skin. This is good stuff!</li>
            <li> I love it based on the evidence of the result.  It helps me to forget my number of age... just love it.</li>
            <li> I liked it because the price was good , and the quality was perfect . IT keeps me looking young and vibrant with a special glow.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price here compared to retail stores; can&#x27;t beat it; always arrives quickly and good for sensitive skin, especially the no fragrance part.  Only negative is such a small container doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> This is just one great daily moisturizer. I use it every day and the results are great. If you have this&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer you don&#x27;t need anything eles.</li>
            <li> Big disappointment.  This products actually &amp;#34;clumps&amp;#34; on my face and cannot be evenly distributed.  I purchased this moisturizer because I have always been satisfied with Olay products.  Not this one.  Will return to my moisturizer of choice, Elemis Pro Collagen  Marine Cream. Pricey, yes but goes far and an excellent product.  There is no savings when a product is so bad you THROW IT AWAY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and I really like it! It helps hydrate my skin and I never have had any break out because of it. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great product, goes on nice and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Used it twice a day for 4 weeks.  I saw no benefit.</li>
            <li> Tube was broken when I received it. Wasn&#x27;t too happy about that.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for at least 5 years now, and I find it always does the trick.</li>
            <li> i have used this moisturizer before too.one of the best ones.my skin feels so soft and fresh after using it.</li>
            <li> The price is getting more and that I dont like it  nithing more to say. there should be a constant price</li>
            <li> Have used for years and still love it!  Nice texture and goes on smoothly.  I like fragrance free because I don&#x27;t like a lot of perfume smells.  Hope they don&#x27;t change it.</li>
            <li> This lotion gives your face a fresh drink of moisture.  It really does help those facial lines and wrinkles.  You can&#x27;t beat the price of this product with the subscribe &amp; save deal.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually HEALS. I have used it on rashes, burns, just about everything and it is excellent. Get the one with sunscreen, I think that one is Olay 7x.</li>
            <li> Good for people sensitive to fragrance and some preservatives.  I am always desperate for products I can use, and this fills the bill.</li>
            <li> I have used Olay for over 30 years, Total Effects has become my main moisturizer. Once in the morning and once in the evening.... I will not go without it!</li>
            <li> My wife has used this Olay moisturizer for 20 years and her face &amp;#34;glows&amp;#34; -- she is so beautiful (at age 72) -- and attributes her fresh good looks to this Olay product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  The Amazon price is far better than any store (even with a coupon) and sometimes I am even able to use an Amazon coupon to make it even lower.  It keeps my skin soft without being heavy and the pump usually gives me just the right amount so that none is wasted.</li>
            <li> No problems, no hassles...</li>
            <li> It helps to improve my skin.</li>
            <li> This works well with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> With age, my skin has gone through some changes, including becoming very sensitive,and this product is not only a great all-day moisturizer, but has reduced the size of my pores and reduced break-outs. Great product!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t have any scent in any derma product, and I can&#x27;t have any sunblock on my daily facial cream.  This is by far the best facial cream I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve tried many, and I&#x27;m a guy.  I&#x27;ve used this for about a decade now, if not longer.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product so I can&#x27;t say long-term how good it is.  I use other Olay products and have been very pleased with them.  I&#x27;ve used Total Effects for the past three nights and I like the pump container as well as the feel of the cream.  I have allergies and appreciate the fact that there is no fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this for years but was afraid to spend the money when I know my skin is super sensitive, and it could just turn out to be a waste. Well I tried it, and it was a waste. It seems like it would be really nice and luxurious for someone with regular skin, that&#x27;s why the two stars. But I have combination oily and dry skin, and acne. Every single time I used this as a night cream (sometime days in a row, sometimes I&#x27;d wait a few days and they try again) I always woke up super greasy with a face full of little whiteheads. A major creamy clogger for the pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using a pricy Clarins cream, when I decided to try this one.  I really could not tell the difference based on my skin&#x27;s reaction. I&#x27;ve  been using it for more than a year and it is now a part of my daily care.</li>
            <li> This is a  good product but the Seller is TERRIBLE! Never received the order! Tried sending emails with no response.  Ordered a month ago and still to this day, NO PRODUCT! BEWARE OF THIS SELLER!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer and comes in a fragrance-free version.  I also love the Total Effects Tone Correcting Moisturizer:  I use the tone correcter with SPF every day and this daily moisturizer (the one with no SPF) a couple of times a week at night.</li>
            <li> Love this product, has been using it for quite some time now.  My skin is beautiful. I owe it all to Olay.</li>
            <li> I have used Oil of Olay 7 in 1 anti-aging daily moisturizer for the last 10 years and I am so glad that I have because I am 50 years old, but the skin on my face makes me look much younger.  This product gives your skin a vibrant smooth look, it is great!</li>
            <li> To begin, I have Combination oily/dry skin &amp; I am 19 years old I do Not have acne but I will get the occasion pimple or two. My skin is sensitive.....This moisturizer smells amazing. When I put it on my skin it felt so smooth and even. It does make your skin oily.. &amp;&amp; after putting it on,, In a few hours pimples started appearing on my cheeks and face!!!  i NEVER had pimples on cheeks before!!) I discontinued use of product. It is NOT GOOD FOR SENSITIVE SKIN! i am RETURNING THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> If this was the version with SPF, I would have given this a 5 star.  However, Amazon doesn&#x27;t sell the version with sun protection.</li>
            <li> Love that it has no scent. After using it religiously for about 3 weeks, I started to notice little bumps almost like a rash start to appear on my cheeks. I have somewhat sensitive skin, so it could be the chemicals in the moisturizer not getting along well with my skin. Started using it twice a week along side other lotions for my face and have been fine.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I have been using this product for 10 years. I am still young but I have no signs of aging and at this point many of my friends are starting. Also helped me through my acne phase. It is definitely a thicker moisturizer. A half pump in the morning and at night is perfect and the bottle will last you 1.5 months.</li>
            <li> My first several purchases of this product, both through Amazon and a local warehouse store were for the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; 7-in-1 anti-aging moisturizer with a slight fragrance.  The soft, non-greasy feeling was WONDERFUL on my skin.  My skin appearance (pores, fine lines, freckles) improved within a few weeks and it was truly AMAZING.  LOVED IT and recommended it to family and friends!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next time I was at the warehouse store I picked up two since there was a $ off coupon for the moisturizer (the one they sell is 2x the size) but when I got it home, I realized they no longer carried the regular one and now offered the SPF15 version.  Great, bonus, I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I used it.  UGH....ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.  It felt like I was putting on a very thick, greasy suntan lotion mask.  Within a few days, my 45-year old skin had....UGH....PIMPLES and I could never get rid of the greasy, heavy feeling until I washed my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference between the two very similar products was like night an day.  One was light and almost rejuvenating, and the other was a TERRIBLE waste of almost $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to return the unopened SPF product for a refund and purchase the smaller, regular product through Amazon.  I only hope that somehow they haven&#x27;t changed the formula and the regular, original product is still the same as when I used it in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crossing fingers....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple years--even in the summer.  Very nice on my neck too.</li>
            <li> super nice A++++. The product is excelent, is really moisturizer.  I use everday and my skin lokks hidrated. nice nice</li>
            <li> I have tried several different facial cleansers and lotions over the past year.  I finally tried this one a few weeks ago and while it is not causing rashes or drying my skin out, it is causing me to break out along my hairline.  With the more expensive lotions, my skin was great but I cut back because of cost.  I will continue to use this till its gone but then return to better products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on and off from age 18-28. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, and actually have oily skin, but I&#x27;ve always liked how it made my skin feel, and I&#x27;m quite picky about moisturizers. However, I&#x27;ve transitioned most of my personal care and beauty products to be free of parabens and other ingredients recognized as harmful by the EWG- Environmental Working Group. I wish they would update their formula to not use parabens!</li>
            <li> I just got Olay Total Effects Fragrance Free this week. I was worried because some reviewers said that they had bad reactions, and that it&#x27;s not good if you have sensitive skin. I have very sensitive skin and I have not had any bad reaction to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the key is not to get the one with SPF. The people who had bad reactions bought the one with SPF. This fragrance free variety without SPF has not given me any problem so far. I am not happy that the product contains parabens though, so I won&#x27;t buy it again for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want to try Olay Total Effects, get the one that is fragrance free and does not have the SPF.</li>
            <li> I bought identical one with SPF before, and worked great on my skin. But this product is a disappoinment,&lt;br /&gt;the lotion couldn&#x27;t be absorbed, like a thin mask on your face, when it&#x27;s dry you can rubbed it off from your face. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month now and I really can tell the difference. Have put it on my monthly list.</li>
            <li> l just love the feel of this moisturizer and the best part is that I do not smell after applying, wish there were more fragrance free products that worked.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for about three weeks now and I can already see my skin has a smoother texture and the little lines around my eyes are less noticeable. Very pleased so far.</li>
            <li> It did keep my skin moist but didn&#x27;t notice anything drastic.  I would probably buy again unless I found something better.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this, I had the exact same one with the light, clean scent. Unfortunately, I have to say that I liked the one with the scent better because I felt that it was a better moisturizer and left you smelling clean but not overally perfumed. This product, I feel, lacks the amount of moisture I need, that was in the scented one, as my face still feels dry many times. I love Olay products but I would probably purchase the lightly scented one once this one is finished.</li>
            <li> I use  Clinique all my life, but last few months my skin, which is oily with large pores, got so bad that I decided to try something new; Dior, Laura, Lancôme,  name it I tried it... None worked. after hours of reading on pores and make up for oily skin, I order this product and I cannot be more happy; if you have large pores this moisturizer is for you, because it has zinc and Titanium, two minerals recommended for large pores. I use Peter Thomas Roth cleanser and than I put this moisturizer , wow!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even remember what year Olay Total Effects was introduced -- 1999ish? I purchased my first \\&quot;bottle\\&quot; with an amazing coupon as a splurge.  Once I did that, I was never able to transition back to my former moisturizer.  I absolutely love how soft it makes my skin.  As for \\&quot;reducing the 7 signs of aging,\\&quot; I started using it in my 20&#x27;s, so I can&#x27;t really speak to that.  I do know that I still pass for a mid-twentysomething. Genetics or Olay? I may never know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the version with sunscreen because that is what it feels and smells like.  I used to use the regular kind but switched to the fragrance-free because that is what Amazon.com has available for Subscribe &amp; Save.  It is IMMENSELY cheaper through Amazon.com than if you buy it at the store, including the discount chains.  If you are in the market for a new moisturizer, I would give it a shot.  You might end up a lifelong user, like me.</li>
            <li> I love this on my sensitive skin, feels so soft and smooth after using, I apply this after taking a bath.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to every and any woman who wants clear, toned, well maintained skin for years to come! I love it</li>
            <li> Seems to work really well. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brands and because of a terrific review by a fellow Sr, Citizen on Amazon&#x27;s site, I tried it and think it&#x27;s probably the best. I signed up for automatic delivery, so don&#x27;t have to remember when I run low - it&#x27;s already on it&#x27;s way!</li>
            <li> I have bought this moisturizer before and I love the way it makes my skin feel.  It leaves my skin fresh and not dry!</li>
            <li> I had a coupon for a freebie from P&amp;G after being very disappointed with another face cream of their, and went back to my &#x27;old&#x27; one (RoC). However, I let my mom pick one out and now this has replaced her Anew completely. I keep her stocked up with the great S&amp;S price and big clip-free coupons that come out from time to time.</li>
            <li> Good value. I like this product. It has no smell. I have been using for over 10 years. Does not have the SPF in it, but that is good for me too.</li>
            <li> Olay is the best facial product I have found--I even mix this with my foundation to make it apply more evenly and in a more moist fashion. I wear this all alone, too--light and does the job!</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t care for this product.  It felt heavy on my face and after a couple of hours, it kind of pealed of my face. It also felt like it dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for 15 years or more. Have tried other brands a couple times but can always tell a difference.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer blends in well and leaves my skin soft and supple.  Not greasy at all, even in the hot, humid weather.</li>
            <li> I have always had normal to combination skin. I would often get many breakouts but needed a moisturizer for my face daily as I would get dry skin as well.  I also get eczema on my skin in the winter.  I have found when using this product you only need a pea size drop and just dot it in different areas on your face and blend lightly(if you blend too hard or much you will irritate your skin).  If you apply too much you get the oily effect and it doesn&#x27;t work as well.  I found that is the right amount and if you use daily you don&#x27;t need anymore than that.  I&#x27;ve had many compliments since using this product saying my skin looks fabulous and with a glow.  It has helped my face dramatically. I have tried many products and this one is the only one that doesn&#x27;t cause me breakouts and has improved my complexion.  It&#x27;s definitely pricey and not much comes in the bottle, but if you don&#x27;t overuse and use a pea size amount everyday it should last a bit. I do wish it didn&#x27;t cost as much as I would stock up on more of this moisturizer. I am in my mid-twenties and use the 7-in-1 fragrance free one. It doesn&#x27;t have any smell or does not leave skin oily.</li>
            <li> I use this product for night time moisturizer since it doesn&#x27;t have SPF. I like it. It&#x27;s a good moisturizer with a good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;am starting to really like Olay better than some of my more expensive products .Something about their formula makes my skin look better.</li>
            <li> I have very, very dry skin, but am allergic to everything. Let me say that this stuff works better than the other two major products for hypoallergenics.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for years and plan to for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time. It keeps my face from drying out and keeps me hydrated.</li>
            <li> Recommend it highly.&lt;br /&gt;You start to see the results soon after using it.</li>
            <li> I tried this product once on my cheeks and instantly I had two flaming-red cheeks. I washed it off right away using water and my long-time stand-by facial soap. Later tried Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging on the backs of my hands; no skin reaction and it made my hands feel good--moisturized and smooth, but I won&#x27;t buy this again. A one-star review pointed out chemicals in this that I avoid. Since I bought online, I didn&#x27;t know but I should have checked before buying.</li>
            <li> My face is still ugly but it&#x27;s smooth.</li>
            <li> I had to retrieve the container from my bathroom trash bin and re-examine label to ensure I was reviewing the correct product. My experiences are totally different from all the reviews. I bought this moisturizer with very high hopes of slowing down the number of fine lines under my eyes and the sagging skin on both ends of my mouth. But I was primarily interested in a good moisturizer!! This product did not moisturize at all. After applying it, my skin appeared to have thin white film like I had put too much baby powder. I would put layers and layers of it hoping that the dryness would stop but my skin still looked dry and lifeless. There is also excessive packaging for a small quantity of the product. I used up the entire container and even broke off the top so I could scrape out the last drop but the fine lines under my eyes are still there and my sagging skin has not changed. This product is not only a poor moisturizer, it does nothing for aging skin . Waste of money</li>
            <li> this product works very well for me...im 33 and keeps my face fresh looking...love all olay products. Ive tried a lots of brands before...Olay helped me decide to stick with it for a while..a long long while</li>
            <li> love this alot ,I use this in the morning and micro sculpting at night my skin stays soft all through the winter and no drying!</li>
            <li> Love this..it&#x27;s a great moisturizer with no smell. I&#x27;m highly sensitive to smells so this works great for me. I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer really does keep my face soft, even in the harsh northern winter, and I tend to have very dry skin. Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel great all day long. Best part its full of ingredients that protect and heal your skin.</li>
            <li> UGH skin!  I have been on long term steroid therapy combined with winter&#x27;s harsh wind and cold made my face drier than the Sahara Desert. A merry go round of skin products later still no significant improvement.  Then a few weeks ago I added a variety of Olay products to do battle.  Although I must admit I was skeptical after lathering on much more expensive products with excellent reviews from Amazon.  How could a product purchased in the supermarket do a better job?  Got news for you Olay trumps them.  My skin was actually softer and looked less lizard like.  Loved that it was fragrance free.  Sometimes I overdid the amount I needed so just scooped it up and used it elsewhere.  Experiment with the amount your particular skin texture needs.  It isn&#x27;t Crisco.  This led me down the Olay path of skin care and I haven&#x27;t looked back.&lt;br /&gt;I added the following to my arsenal[[ASIN:B0000CC64W Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Fragrance Free, 1.7-Fluid Ounces]],[[ASIN:B0012J135O Olay Complete Night Fortifying Moisture Cream 2 Oz]], [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz]] and [[ASIN:B002UUT38I Olay Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser 6 Fl Oz]]&lt;br /&gt;Yay to better skin!</li>
            <li> I needed a new face moisturizer and figured I might as well get something to treat/prevent wrinkles as I&#x27;m not getting any younger. This product is very moisturizing- I notice with just about a weeks&#x27; use that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel as parched or look as flaky. I use it at night after I shower. I could never apply in the morning just before doing my makeup. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s greasy- \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; is the best word I can come up with. I don&#x27;t recommend it if you have oily/combination skin. It really has NO fragrance, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 11/25: I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and a half and had to come back and edit my review. While I still find it sticky- the other benefits far outweigh a little stickyness. I&#x27;ve made this a Subscribe and Save item I love it so much. I added a star to my review! I look forward to using it each day. My skin is smoother in texture and I notice fewer lines on my forehead. I tell my friends about this and would recommend it to anyone with normal-dry skin.</li>
            <li> I always buy professional products and this is the first time I tried a drug store brand in many, many years.  I did research and found that this moisturizer contains lots of great anti-aging ingredients and the price was even more affordable through Amazon.  It doesn&#x27;t have SPF (which is perfect) because I use this as my night moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years as a daily facial moisturizer.  It is not greasey or sticky and it provides SP15 protection.&lt;br /&gt;It also works very well on the occasional age related spots of scale on arms, hands and legs.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the olay total effects.  Also very happy with the price.</li>
            <li> Made my face break out can&#x27;t tell if it did anything</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when Olay discontinued their definity line and took a chance on the Total Effects line. Great product - it goes on smoothly with no after-effect or greasy feeling. The pump is so convenient to get just what I need without contaminating the entire jar.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.  I wake up and get going quickly in the mornings and this applicator works well for me.  This for overall skin care, then I use cover up for under my eyes and a quick zip of blush and I am good to go.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone, oily and sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of months. It&#x27;s not a very light product. It leaves a residue  and is absorbed very slowly. It could leave a greasy feeling all day long. Over time, I noticed my skin got softer but I didn&#x27;t notice any other claimed benefits.At least it didn&#x27;t cause acne. It could be a little bit better than regular moisturizers if you have a normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks now and my skin feels soft.  My wrinkles are not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin prone to itchiness, rashes...i was skeptical if i would end up with skin allergies with this product as well. I have not used olay on my face,..i always have been a clinique dramatcially different gel user due to my skin allergies. But of late i developed some fine lines..so thought of trying this product ...This product is just wonderful, it was not making my skin oily and my skin is much better now...its glowing and the fine lines have reduced .</li>
            <li> One of the best Olay products on the market! I have tried another lines of Olay brand skin products and now sure that Total effect works the best for my skin.</li>
            <li> Very good!I am so surprised that I can buy it in such a low price! All in all, very good !</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My skin is very clear and sof. My husband love it too... when I used it.</li>
            <li> typical face moisturizer. Does the hydrating job, but doesn&#x27;t really seem to fix anything when it comes to signs of aging</li>
            <li> Girls in my household love this and will be repeat purchasers.</li>
            <li> Fragrance-free, easily absorbed, no more a miracle worker than any other face product, but it truly is an excellent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I really do recommend this for winter when the wind here in the mountains just dries out my face terribly AND yet gives good SPF protection. It came quickly and was well wrapped and when I had a little problem it was fixed cheerfully and quickly. I do recommend this seller AND the product!</li>
            <li> I use this with Retin A. It&#x27;s perfect. The dry skin from the Retin A is always quickly corrected and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily. I have really senstive skin also. Many frangrance free creams give me a rash. This cream never irritates my skin and it completely removed  a few new fine lines I recently noticed around my eyes. I also feel my skin has a glow and is tighter. I love this stuff! I like it better than regenerist, age defying and olay complete products I have tried and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> So far i have liked this cream. its oilfree and I put it in the morning and feel fresh all day. gives a nice feeling over all. good face cream.</li>
            <li> Was not sure how this would be because I used to see the ones with the tint and I did not want any. Well, this one is perfect and good for sensitive skin besides. Nice texture, goes on smooth and not one iota of sticky. Very nice.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne prone skin and feel like I&#x27;ve tried every moderately priced moisturizer under the sun. I&#x27;ve tried expensive creams, but I have a hard time spending $40+ on a bottle of moisturizer I will go through in a month.  I keep trying other products hoping they will work as well as Total Effects, but I keep coming back to this one because it is so reliable. It is one of the few moisturizers that doesn&#x27;t make me breakout, rubs in cleanly, no greasy feeling and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s just &#x27;sitting&#x27; on my skin. My combination acne-prone skin feels supple and hydrated when I used this moisturizer.  It is my go-to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin tends to get breakouts when I used the SPF formulation of this moisturizer, so for my acne-prone skin I prefer the non-SPF version.  Maybe it&#x27;s psychological, but I feel like it makes my skin a little more greasy and clogged.</li>
            <li> Did not use  oil of Olay  total effects. I used Olay  Regenerist  deep hydration  moisturizer cream and broke out in a severe rash on face, neck and arms. I am now Leary of purchasing anything of the like that Olay has to offer.  I might be sensitive to  other products as well.</li>
            <li> First of all let me say that I have dry skin so I need something that is really going to help me with that and this just didn&#x27;t do that for me. It didn&#x27;t break me out or cause irritation but it didn&#x27;t help with my problem areas either! I have large pores around my nose, chin and forhead, This didn&#x27;t help tighten those. I have dry cheeks and oily in T-Zone and it didn&#x27;t help with the dryness AT ALL. If you have perfect skin and you just need a face cream then this is for you. But as an Anti-Ager and all the other stuff it&#x27;s supposed to do not so much. It didn&#x27;t brighten my complexion or help even out my skin. So I went back to my Boots No 7 Regimen (See My Review) and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Been using Olay 7 signs for years now... It&#x27;s a big part of the reason I look so much younger than my actual age. I wish I could do an Olay commercial!</li>
            <li> This product is for my sister-in-law and she likes it and  i guess this that&#x27;s what matters.I buy things she needs and it&#x27;s not a big deal for me to do this for her.I may get some more for her but she needs to get thru 3 bottles or what ever it is ,thanks.</li>
            <li> I placed my order on 4/8 and received it on 4/11, that was fast! I love this product! It&#x27;s perfect for those of us with fragrance sensitivity.</li>
            <li> feels luxurious and doesn&#x27;t make me itch</li>
            <li> Product was used for years and will continue to be used as the quality of this product is excellent.  Recommend its use for others.</li>
            <li> THE best day time lotion.  I started using it in my mid twenties and continue (currently late twenties).  If only i had found this sooner i think my skin may have balanced itself earlier than it had.  I have combo skin with breakouts due to dryness.  This is not oily but leaves skin feeling like it has nothing on it, just soft and smooth.  A cliche, I know, but I found my forever cream!</li>
            <li> I can tell the difference when I try less expensive products.  You see the results with Olay. Received product really fast</li>
            <li> I use ONLY Olay products, from moisturizer to soaps (liquide and bar) to lotions.  Olay products are the very best and the most economical!  I am 73, but do not look it.  I have used Olay products for years and years.  They have gone up in price through the years, but I have to have them.</li>
