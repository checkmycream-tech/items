    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Not anywhere as effective as Latisse!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It could be that this serum is best at restoring your lashes to where they are meant to be after you have lost them?</li>
            <li>Again thank you MyChelle for a awesome product!!</li>
            <li>I am very good at applying this every night no matter what.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li>I was going for longer - and I&#x27;m really happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product on my eyebrows for 6 weeks and haven&#x27;t experienced any increase in volume.</li>
            <li>I am SO thrilled!</li>
            <li>Since I loved the makeup, I picked up this serum that had great reviews at my time of purchase.</li>
            <li>and now after about 4 months they look thicker, darker and somewhat longer with a pleasant curl.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I purchased this product, because of the good reviews.</li>
            <li>This one works good and does not burn my eyes at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the length and thickness of my lashes.</li>
            <li>it kind of migrates around my eyelids</li>
            <li>It may be an effective serum for thinning lashes/brows</li>
            <li>However if you are willing to invest your time and be patient  - you will get a beautiful, full, healthy eyelashes and will be happy with the results.</li>
            <li>and so far I am quite impressed.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it on my eyelashes as well and have seen new growth there which is so amazing!!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any difference in the length of my lashes, but it does seem to condition your lashes so that when I do put on mascara, I can tell they better than when I wasn&#x27;t using the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s filling in my lashes and brows, love it.</li>
            <li>I have been pleased before with Mychelle products ( like polypeptide cream which I&#x27;ve been using for a while)</li>
            <li>After using this serum for a couple months ( mostly once a day at bedtime, but sometimes in the morning as well)</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pleased that it isn&#x27;t bothering me.  </li>
            <li>This product makes my lashes more visible when I&#x27;m not wearing mascara.</li>
            <li>also tried this product on my brows, but it seems to work better on my eyelashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot believe it, but in two weeks my lashes have dramatically filled in, and they weren&#x27;t all that sparse to begin with!</li>
            <li>I love this product and would recommend it to anyone looking for longer lashes.</li>
            <li>As for this lash serum: I started with healthy lashes that I just wanted to see become a bit longer.</li>
            <li>I am beyond thrill with the results of this product (and many of the others in their beauty line)...</li>
            <li>But so far so good</li>
            <li>but this product has brought them back to life and almost completely filled out again!!!  </li>
            <li>so I do feel I have spent my money wisely!  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li>If it weren&#x27;t for the cost of this particular product I would be using it on my hair at the temples where I have unfortunately experienced some hair loss (most likely from change of hormones after kids)...MyChelle should come out with a product for that!!!  </li>
            <li>my new eyelashes started to look more like what my normal and healthy eyelashes looked like ( relief already!)</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell if it is working yet but seems nice so far.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try if you are looking to enhance the look of your eyelashes, although don&#x27;t expect it to work overnight.ely seeing a difference.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try if you are looking to enhance the look of your eyelashes, although don&#x27;t expect it to work overnight.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is a more natural formula.</li>
            <li>Since it looks good so soon, I&#x27;ve already slacked to 1 every other day usage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had lost  a strip of eyelashes on my right eye, it had been a problem for about 5 months.  </li>
            <li>and they started to burn right away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am blonde, so my eyelashes are naturally very light colored.</li>
            <li>Product is very easy to apply because the brush is small and easy to control, the amount of product delivered from the tube is just right.  </li>
            <li>so this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried an eyelash-enhancing product; thus, I can&#x27;t compare it to competing products.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;this wasnt the first time in ordering cosmetic</li>
            <li>It took about 3 to 4 weeks before my lashes filled in completely, so don&#x27;t give up.</li>
            <li>First, I was under the assumption that this was applied like mascara, sort of like a conditioner for your lashes.</li>
            <li>It may be that they are more nourished rather than actually growing.  </li>
            <li>I was using Rapid lash serum for a couple years, it absolutely worked on me.</li>
            <li>Amazon offered it via subscribe and save which I find very convenient.</li>
            <li>Although I bought this from Vitacost, I really like this product and want to share my thoughts.  </li>
            <li>I am very diligent about applying it at night.</li>
            <li>Also, if you get MyChelle in your eye, it really stings and burns.</li>
            <li>I use mostly natural and organic products as I believe it is much better for my body and health overall.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I plan on using this product for at least 2-3 months to see what kind of results I get.</li>
            <li>Seems Fine, I have not used it long enough to see how it really going to work.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a non natural product before that worked a little better but burned my eyes.</li>
            <li>if i am paying money to have a new product i like to receive it in a new condition.</li>
            <li>but on my skin is new and</li>
            <li>I saw noticeable new eyelash and brow growth after two weeks.  </li>
            <li>I have brows for the first time since I was a teen.</li>
            <li>No irritation was an added bonus because I have sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>Here is the complete ingredients list copied from the manufacturer&#x27;s website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I was pleasantly surprised at the effects.  </li>
            <li>, I was pleasantly surprised at the effects.  </li>
            <li>Much to my dismay, they never grew back.</li>
            <li>I like that this is and all natural lash and brow serum.</li>
            <li>I am 62 years old and purchased the product to help with thinning.  </li>
            <li>and I like the natural ingredient list,</li>
            <li>Since I didn&#x27;t really expect it to work (I&#x27;m skeptical of products that claim to promote any kind of hair growth)</li>
            <li>Since I didn&#x27;t really expect it to work (I&#x27;m skeptical of products that claim to promote any kind of hair growth)</li>
            <li>I have very short lashes and naturally blonde eyebrows, which I am very self-conscious of (it looks as if I have no eyebrows!).</li>
            <li>i have many mychelle products when i order the product did come fast, cool, but whats very disturbing the box was over damage and ripped then the produced look like it was open and the writing on it was scratch out .</li>
            <li>Now, my lashes are long and my eyebrows are much darker.</li>
            <li>However, I can live with those two things because it actually seems to be working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I definitely see longer lashes as well as incoming new growth.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product that I have found which is truly natural and trust near my eyes.  </li>
            <li>After many years of wearing false lashes, I barely had any left.</li>
            <li>I stand behind their foundation, and only recently switched to bare minerals liquid when I decided I wanted more coverage.</li>

            <li> I stand behind their foundation, and only recently switched to bare minerals liquid when I decided I wanted more coverage.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are back  and on my left eye, the eyelashes are much longer than usual.  </li>
            <li> The product is meant to last 3-4 months so broken down, it&#x27;s pretty reasonable.</li>
            <li> I bought this on impulse, not completely expecting it to work.</li>
            <li> I usually have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> I have used strengthening products but it helped minimally and didn&#x27;t look as long as they do now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like liquid liner, with a tiny brush that you use to apply to your lash base only.</li>
            <li> (maybe I don&#x27;t let it dry for long enough) and can make my lashes a little oily.  </li>
            <li> The next few days my brows rashed up</li>
            <li> I will say it has lasted longer than I expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small to get enough of the product on the brows!  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not willing to stick with it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a lot of new growth, but I do feel like I&#x27;m losing fewer eyelashes, so perhaps this is working by extending the growing cycle for the lashes that already exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not find this irritating.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for an immediate results - this is not a right product.</li>
            <li> although sometimes I forget, so I&#x27;d say I average about six times a week.  </li>
            <li> I also can tell my lashes are longer and slightly</li>
            <li> I lost a half of my eyelashes after the extensions and the new ones were growing very thin, week and colorless.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was less expensive than other similar products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it for a few days and then gave up.  </li>
            <li> No change to lashes at all - so this purchase was basically a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> my eyebrows were starting to thin</li>
            <li> I have very thin/sparse hair on my brows and, got sick of drawing my brows everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my lashes have grown, but when I put on my mascara</li>
            <li> I was on an auto-ship with Smart Lash and was disappointed after about 6 months&#x27; use, so decided to try this product.</li>
            <li> Frankly I am not sure if there is any out there without negative side effects.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s five times the price, but at least it works.</li>
            <li> Lashes are thick and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give it a try after  my eyelashes were seriously damaged by eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li> BUT the applicator is no good</li>
            <li> gave two stars because I truly like the MyChelle brand and felt bad giving them a single star review.</li>
            <li> No, they don&#x27;t look like lash extensions or even false eyelashes, but they are deifnitely thicker and longer, and seem to have a longer life span.</li>
            <li> The experience was horrible and, I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anybody at all!!!!They didn&#x27;t even offer to give me my money back since, I had already opened it.</li>
            <li> i dont know if each seller is storing them wrong.</li>
            <li> The instructions say NOT to use it on your lower lashes, but, ever the rebel, I have used it without any ill effects.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it truly did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I used it as directed, and was sad to see no results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also suggest MyChelle consider the cost of this product as it is a bit expensive...</li>
            <li> I was desperate for fuller brows.</li>
            <li> This has worked so well, that people think that I am still wearing my false lashes!!</li>
            <li> This product was so expensive and with awful results!!!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the brush applicator for this product.  </li>
            <li> and, it itched so badly!!!</li>

            <li> I had lost  a strip of eyelashes on my right eye, it had been a problem for about 5 months.  I bought the serum to see if it would help them to grow back, which it did.  My eyelashes are back  and on my left eye, the eyelashes are much longer than usual.  No irritation was an added bonus because I have sensitive eyes.  Very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a month now. I don&#x27;t see any difference in the length of my lashes, but it does seem to condition your lashes so that when I do put on mascara, I can tell they better than when I wasn&#x27;t using the product. I am going to give it another month and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product, because of the good reviews. I have very thin/sparse hair on my brows and, got sick of drawing my brows everyday. I was desperate for fuller brows.I washed my brows with dove soap and water and apply the serum. The following day, I looked into the mirror and saw red bumps and, it itched so badly!!! The next few days my brows rashed up and my skin was peeling from my brows,to the point where I had to purchase a maximum strength anti-itch cream for relief. The experience was horrible and, I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anybody at all!!!!They didn&#x27;t even offer to give me my money back since, I had already opened it. This product was so expensive and with awful results!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s filling in my lashes and brows, love it.</li>
            <li> I used this in combination with another Cruelty-free serum -&lt;br /&gt;RapidLash Eyelash and Eyebrow Serum, 0.1 oz ...&lt;br /&gt;and in 3 wks., I have longer and thicker lashes.  I was going for longer - and I&#x27;m really happy with the results.  Since it looks good so soon, I&#x27;ve already slacked to 1 every other day usage.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I decided to give it a try after  my eyelashes were seriously damaged by eyelash extensions. I use mostly natural and organic products as I believe it is much better for my body and health overall. I have been pleased before with Mychelle products ( like polypeptide cream which I&#x27;ve been using for a while) so I decided to go with a trustful brand.&lt;br /&gt;After using this serum  for several months I can tell it does makes the difference. I lost a half of my eyelashes after the extensions and the new ones were growing very thin, week and colorless. After using this serum for a couple months ( mostly once a day at bedtime, but sometimes in the morning as well) my new eyelashes started to look more like what my normal and healthy eyelashes looked like ( relief already!) and now after about 4 months they look thicker, darker and somewhat longer with a pleasant curl.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an immediate results - this is not a right product. Frankly I am not sure if there is any out there without negative side effects. However if you are willing to invest your time and be patient  - you will get a beautiful, full, healthy eyelashes and will be happy with the results. I would definitely give it a try.</li>
            <li> Have not noticed any difference a month into applying Ultimate Lash. I&#x27;m still going to use it until it&#x27;s gone...hope to see some growth soon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now.  I try to use it every night although sometimes I forget, so I&#x27;d say I average about six times a week.  I just use it on my eyelashes (upper only).  And I already notice a difference.  My lashes appear longer!  I don&#x27;t see a lot of new growth, but I do feel like I&#x27;m losing fewer eyelashes, so perhaps this is working by extending the growing cycle for the lashes that already exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not find this irritating.  (I do use it at night after I&#x27;ve removed my contact lenses, though.)  I usually have sensitive eyes so I&#x27;m pleased that it isn&#x27;t bothering me.  I&#x27;d advise you to use it sparingly if you decide to try it, though -- it kind of migrates around my eyelids (maybe I don&#x27;t let it dry for long enough) and can make my lashes a little oily.  However, I can live with those two things because it actually seems to be working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: the ingredients list on the product listing page appears to have been cut off partway through.  Here is the complete ingredients list copied from the manufacturer&#x27;s website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Glycerin, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate,Gluconolactone, Cactus Flower Extract, Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17, Copper Tripeptide-1, Centella Asiatica Leaf Extract, Brassica Campestris Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Lupine Protein, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract, Pterocarpus Marsupium Bark Extract, Apple Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Plumeria Alba Flower Extract, Grape Seed Extract, Levisticum Officinale Oil, Morinda Citrifolia Fruit Powder, Biotin (D), Cysteine (L), Mannitol, Niacin, Calcium Pantothenate (D), Panthenol (D), Lecithin, Glutamic Acid (L), Glutathione (L), Disodium Succinate, Witch Hazel Water, Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Phytic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this in a Yuzen box so this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried an eyelash-enhancing product; thus, I can&#x27;t compare it to competing products.  However, I am definitely seeing a difference.  Since I didn&#x27;t really expect it to work (I&#x27;m skeptical of products that claim to promote any kind of hair growth), I was pleasantly surprised at the effects.  Definitely worth a try if you are looking to enhance the look of your eyelashes, although don&#x27;t expect it to work overnight.ely seeing a difference.

            <li> I was using Rapid lash serum for a couple years, it absolutely worked on me. Great product.  I decided to try MyChelle lash and brow serum. Amazon offered it via subscribe and save which I find very convenient. I gotta say, I was unimpressed by this product. I even wondered if my lashes were losing ground using this inferior product? I canceled my subscription and went RUNNING back to Rapid lash. I will use up this rest of this on my brows.</li>
            <li> After many years of wearing false lashes, I barely had any left. This has worked so well, that people think that I am still wearing my false lashes!! I am SO thrilled! Also, as a teen, I shaved off my eye brows as they were so big and unruly. Much to my dismay, they never grew back. Now with this MyChelle Lash and Brow Serum I have brows for the first time since I was a teen. I am so happy. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was less expensive than other similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it nightly for about a month now and am seeing results! My lashes seem longer, thicker and darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am blonde, so my eyelashes are naturally very light colored. This product makes my lashes more visible when I&#x27;m not wearing mascara. I also can tell my lashes are longer and slightly fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried this product on my brows, but it seems to work better on my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are not miraculous, but I am definitely seeing a gradual difference! I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe it, but in two weeks my lashes have dramatically filled in, and they weren&#x27;t all that sparse to begin with!</li>
            <li> My lashes are longer and fuller. I love this product and would recommend it to anyone looking for longer lashes.</li>
            <li> I like that this is and all natural lash and brow serum. Can&#x27;t tell if it is working yet but seems nice so far.</li>
            <li> Although I bought this from Vitacost, I really like this product and want to share my thoughts.  It is about 6-8 weeks since I began using it and I definitely see longer lashes as well as incoming new growth.  I am very diligent about applying it at night. I dip once for each eye and swipe the excess on my outer brow, which is showing a bit of growth as well. I also didn&#x27;t realize until recently how eyelashes can break and look shorter.  I have used strengthening products but it helped minimally and didn&#x27;t look as long as they do now. This is the only product that I have found which is truly natural and trust near my eyes.  The product is meant to last 3-4 months so broken down, it&#x27;s pretty reasonable.</li>
            <li> After using this product for 3 months, I have seen no increased growth or thickness. I am going back to Latisse which works for me. It&#x27;s five times the price, but at least it works. Also, if you get MyChelle in your eye, it really stings and burns.</li>
            <li> Not anywhere as effective as Latisse!!!</li>
            <li> i have many mychelle products when i order the product did come fast, cool, but whats very disturbing the box was over damage and ripped then the produced look like it was open and the writing on it was scratch out . if i am paying money to have a new product i like to receive it in a new condition. this is so unsatisfying and unclean.&lt;br /&gt;this wasnt the first time in ordering cosmetic i dont know if each seller is storing them wrong. i like to know what i but on my skin is new and untouch.&lt;br /&gt; unwrapping and damage products is a no no</li>
            <li> I was on an auto-ship with Smart Lash and was disappointed after about 6 months&#x27; use, so decided to try this product. I like the fact that it is a more natural formula. I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the length and thickness of my lashes. No, they don&#x27;t look like lash extensions or even false eyelashes, but they are deifnitely thicker and longer, and seem to have a longer life span. They&#x27;re also not appreciably darker that I can tell, but that&#x27;s why God made mascara. The instructions say NOT to use it on your lower lashes, but, ever the rebel, I have used it without any ill effects. However, don&#x27;t get this stuff in your eyes - no permanent damage, but it smarts. It took about 3 to 4 weeks before my lashes filled in completely, so don&#x27;t give up. I used it morning and evening. I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
            <li> I am 62 years old and purchased the product to help with thinning.  I saw noticeable new eyelash and brow growth after two weeks.  Lashes are thick and bouncy.  Product is very easy to apply because the brush is small and easy to control, the amount of product delivered from the tube is just right.  This product is in my permanent arsenal.</li>
            <li> First, I was under the assumption that this was applied like mascara, sort of like a conditioner for your lashes. But it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s more like liquid liner, with a tiny brush that you use to apply to your lash base only. The bottle is extremely tiny too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it made my eyes so itchy and they started to burn right away. I had to remove asap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I cannot use this product.</li>
            <li> My lashes seemed a bit thicker but not longer which was my goal.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t use this Mychell product again</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the brush applicator for this product.  It&#x27;s too small to get enough of the product on the brows!  I tried it for a few days and then gave up.  Overpriced at around $35.  It may be an effective serum for thinning lashes/brows and I like the natural ingredient list, BUT the applicator is no good so I&#x27;m not willing to stick with it.</li>
            <li> I have very short lashes and naturally blonde eyebrows, which I am very self-conscious of (it looks as if I have no eyebrows!). I bought this on impulse, not completely expecting it to work. Now, my lashes are long and my eyebrows are much darker. I am very good at applying this every night no matter what. I put one dip in for each eye and I use what is left from that dip on my eyebrows. Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> No change to lashes at all - so this purchase was basically a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my eyebrows for 6 weeks and haven&#x27;t experienced any increase in volume. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I like MyChelle a lot. I stand behind their foundation, and only recently switched to bare minerals liquid when I decided I wanted more coverage. As for this lash serum: I started with healthy lashes that I just wanted to see become a bit longer. I dreamt of never using mascara again! Since I loved the makeup, I picked up this serum that had great reviews at my time of purchase. Unfortunately, it truly did nothing for me. I used it as directed, and was sad to see no results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could be that this serum is best at restoring your lashes to where they are meant to be after you have lost them? Maybe my lashes are the longest they can ever be? Either way it did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave two stars because I truly like the MyChelle brand and felt bad giving them a single star review.</li>
            <li> I am beyond thrill with the results of this product (and many of the others in their beauty line)...my eyebrows were starting to thin but this product has brought them back to life and almost completely filled out again!!!  I have been using it on my eyelashes as well and have seen new growth there which is so amazing!!  If it weren&#x27;t for the cost of this particular product I would be using it on my hair at the temples where I have unfortunately experienced some hair loss (most likely from change of hormones after kids)...MyChelle should come out with a product for that!!!  I also suggest MyChelle consider the cost of this product as it is a bit expensive...though after splurging I would totally buy this again and again.  I will say it has lasted longer than I expected and I still have quiet a bit left so I do feel I have spent my money wisely!  Again thank you MyChelle for a awesome product!!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about a month and so far I am quite impressed.  I&#x27;m not sure if my lashes have grown, but when I put on my mascara my lashes do look longer.  It may be that they are more nourished rather than actually growing.  I plan on using this product for at least 2-3 months to see what kind of results I get.</li>
            <li> Seems Fine, I have not used it long enough to see how it really going to work.  But so far so good</li>
            <li> I have tried a non natural product before that worked a little better but burned my eyes. This one works good and does not burn my eyes at all.</li>
