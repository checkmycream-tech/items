            <li>That is amazing success in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice,</li>

            <li>Great for my white hair</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found American Crew Gray in stores in many years, so I order it here in bulk for a good price</li>
            <li>men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company changed its formula from a lighter purple to this deep one about 2010(?), which is more effective for maintaining a blonde, non-reddish tone to colored hair.</li>
            <li>I have only used it for a short time, but am happy with it.</li>
            <li>It really is excellent for those who want natural-looking gray hair without color overtones, particularly that yellow haze that other shampoos either leave in or impart.</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>In addition, hair is left manageable and healthy.</li>
            <li>I use another shampoo first, then this one.</li>
            <li>My daughter, a hair dresser who gave me my first bottle, said I should continue to use it, but not exclusively.  </li>
            <li>It is a purple shampoo (surprisingly deep color purple), cleans fine hair well</li>
            <li>The bluish tint began so slowly, I really didn&#x27;t notice, much to my chagrin and self admonishment.  </li>
            <li>then rinse if out very well</li>
            <li>Does not remove brassiness much</li>
            <li>Works great taking brassy tint out of grey hair and rinses out with no blue tint left over.</li>
            <li>I have used the Crew Classic Gray Shampoo for years.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve decided I want no question about what color my hair is, silver or gray, taking the brassisness out with crew classic</li>
            <li>Salt &amp; pepper hair has a natural contrast in which the \\&quot;salt\\&quot; is white and the \\&quot;pepper\\&quot; is not changed from the original color.</li>
            <li>After reviewing many shampoos for grey or white hair</li>
            <li>8.5oz is not very much, but the picture looked like a full sized bottle.</li>
            <li>The shampoo was fine for cleaning hair, but I&#x27;m not sure how much darkening took place.</li>
            <li>White hair is a natural, clean white.</li>
            <li>I purchased the shampoo at the stylist&#x27;s suggestion as it would help maintain the natural shine.  </li>
            <li>and, when left on for a couple minutes, takes the gold out of blonde highlights and keeps them a pretty color and keeps my hair shiny.</li>
            <li>:B000FZXGB0 American Crew Classic Gray Shampoo, 8.45 oz]]</li>
            <li>It only takes the second shampooing to do the coloring, so you could use another one for a first shampooing regularly anyway.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using American Crew Classic Gray shampoo off and on for several years.  </li>
            <li>I, of course, don&#x27;t know for sure, but the color of the shampoo and the fact it was first noticed by the person who has been cutting my hair for years, leads me to this conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>IF you&#x27;re getting older and can&#x27;t get those wiry gray hairs to lay down, this is the answer.  </li>

            <li> Not the same stuff ... It smells differently than my older purchases, the ingredient list is different, and it tended to stain my cuticles black.  I threw it away.</li>
            <li> IF you&#x27;re getting older and can&#x27;t get those wiry gray hairs to lay down, this is the answer.  I&#x27;d order a case of this just to be sure I don&#x27;t run out.  My biggest fear is they quit making it.  Works great.  Paired with their conditioner, my hair has never been better.  If you are tired of gray hairs sticking out everywhere, then switch to this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  My Husbands hair looks so much better with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo, wish they still made the conditioner.</li>
            <li> My husband uses and loves this shampoo, which cuts out any yellowing of gray hair.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with the product.</li>
            <li> American Crew makes great products, and this speciality shampoo for gray hair is excellent.  It eliminates yellow highlights, brightens gray hair, and smells great.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shampoo for his hair</li>
            <li> Dark purple when it comes out of the bottle! Shocked the hell out of me, but it works!</li>
            <li> Good quality product for men with gray or salt and pepper hair looking to use something better.</li>
            <li> worthless...ive gotten even more gray since using this product....not saying its the product thats causing me to go more gray but this does nothing to cover it at all</li>
            <li> A fantastic product for keeping your hair in place an looking great. The scent is also pleasant . I would recommend this to folks that are greying and being bothered by flyaway hair or for people who have dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have used the Crew Classic Gray Shampoo for years.  The shampoo in my last bottles is a very deep purple.  Over time (about 4 months I would guess)my hair has taken on a bluish tint.  The person cutting my hair noticed first (I get my hair cut about once a month).  Then my wife noticed.  The bluish tint began so slowly, I really didn&#x27;t notice, much to my chagrin and self admonishment.  But, when called to my attention, my hair clearly had the faint bluish tint. I have now changed shampoos after years of Crew use.  I suspect it is something in the formula that was changed over the last year or so.  I, of course, don&#x27;t know for sure, but the color of the shampoo and the fact it was first noticed by the person who has been cutting my hair for years, leads me to this conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David T.</li>
            <li> Andreson Cooper uses this shampoo - nuff said!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Hair looks great without the yellowish color. Amazon does it part by delivering it on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J.&lt;br /&gt;Brasilia, Brazil</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo twice and it did nothing for my hair. I threw the rest of the bottle in the trash.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, makes gray hair so soft and managable.</li>
            <li> I am not one to color my hair.  I have earned every gray hair.  The shampoo was fine for cleaning hair, but I&#x27;m not sure how much darkening took place.</li>
            <li> Absolutly great shampoo. It is hard to find locally at $ 15.00.</li>
            <li> If you like your hare to have a tint of blue then this is the product. I don&#x27;t like my man with blue hair. I dumped it down the drain.</li>
            <li> Good product and on time</li>
            <li> bought it for the wife, she likes it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this product for several years. It really is excellent for those who want natural-looking gray hair without color overtones, particularly that yellow haze that other shampoos either leave in or impart. White hair is a natural, clean white. Salt &amp; pepper hair has a natural contrast in which the \\&quot;salt\\&quot; is white and the \\&quot;pepper\\&quot; is not changed from the original color. In addition, hair is left manageable and healthy. If you&#x27;ve decided to stop dying your hair, this is definitely the product to go with.</li>
            <li> After reviewing many shampoos for grey or white hair I decided that this might be just what I needed.I have been using&lt;br /&gt;Redkin for years and they have nothing for me now that I have grey/white hair.  Anyway, my daughter today said that&lt;br /&gt;my hair looked really nice and the color was good.  She did not know that I had changed shampoos.  One thing you only need&lt;br /&gt;a small amount of shampoo to do the job and it does not lather at all.  Weird experience.  I also let it saturate while I shower&lt;br /&gt;and then rinse if out very well and then use a Redkin conditioner.  I am still not sure if I should use it every day or alternate&lt;br /&gt;it with Redkin.  Time will tell but right now I am a happy camper.</li>
            <li> Was a different product than purchased at my hair cutter. I was expecting a purple product. It was blue and had a bad odor also.</li>
            <li> Does not remove brassiness much</li>
            <li> Works great taking brassy tint out of grey hair and rinses out with no blue tint left over. I&#x27;m grey but still have hair, having hair at my age is something to show off. So I&#x27;ve decided I want no question about what color my hair is, silver or gray, taking the brassisness out with crew classic, it&#x27;s silver hands down no question.</li>
            <li> Takes the sham out, leaves the poo in.....</li>
            <li> Shampoo works as describes. Was a little surprised by the small size of the bottle once I received it. 8.5oz is not very much, but the picture looked like a full sized bottle. This was my only complaint. I have only used it for a short time, but am happy with it. I am usining a smaller amount of the shampoo and it seems to be working fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of these Gray hair shampoo&#x27;s will have an unpleasant odor to them, this one has a pleasent aroma compared to the others.</li>
            <li> I purchased the shampoo at the stylist&#x27;s suggestion as it would help maintain the natural shine.  Use it 1-2x week and it works.</li>
            <li> Good stuff ... probably paid more than it is really worth --- however, it is good shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo for fine hair that has been highlighted! It is a purple shampoo (surprisingly deep color purple), cleans fine hair well and, when left on for a couple minutes, takes the gold out of blonde highlights and keeps them a pretty color and keeps my hair shiny. I shampoo and rinse twice every other day, so about once a month I use another shampoo first, then this one. It only takes the second shampooing to do the coloring, so you could use another one for a first shampooing regularly anyway. Also, about once a month, I use a conditioner. This routine has been completely successful for my fine hair for more than a decade. That is amazing success in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice, gentle fragrance, so it&#x27;s good for women. The company should market this to women, not just men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company changed its formula from a lighter purple to this deep one about 2010(?), which is more effective for maintaining a blonde, non-reddish tone to colored hair. Haven&#x27;t found American Crew Gray in stores in many years, so I order it here in bulk for a good price and so I don&#x27;t run out of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using American Crew Classic Gray shampoo off and on for several years.  My current bottle seems to have changed the color of my hair from its usual semi-silver to an almost blue-gray.  I had noticed that my hair seemed to be darkening some but the other day my wife said that it appeared to have taken on a blue hue.  It&#x27;s more noticeable in the sunlight.  The shampoo itself is normally a deep, dark purple but I never considered the possibility that it would turn my hair blue.  My daughter, a hair dresser who gave me my first bottle, said I should continue to use it, but not exclusively.  She suggests every third or fourth washing.  I&#x27;ll finish off this bottle and alternate with another shampoo and see how it works out.</li>
            <li> Used it for a long time and it is getting hard to find in our salons.  My husband loves it and I like that it takes the yellowing out of his gray hair and keeps the nice silver color.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo based on good reviews however, I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair has gone very dry and wirey but extremely dull.  Although not the most expensive on the market but still dear enough and in my opinion, it cetainly has not met with my expectations for what&#x27;s supposed to be, a quality shampoo.  Sorry but won&#x27;t be using it again what a waste.[[ASIN:B000FZXGB0 American Crew Classic Gray Shampoo, 8.45 oz]]</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for gray hair. It makes my hair feel really great. This is a good product for any gray haired man.</li>
