            <li>Unless of course you believe in the magic of The Interwebs, in which case you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>The peppermint smells really invigorating, which is perfect for a morning wake-me-up shower.</li>
            <li>And once again, keeps my going out clothes nice and</li>
            <li>But honestly, just wait 5 minutes after your shower</li>
            <li>But honestly, just wait 5 minutes after your shower</li>
            <li>so I decided to make my own cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I squeeze a dab onto a shower pouf, put some warm water on and lather, then wash with it.</li>
            <li>Also, it has no lathering agents, so you have to do that on your own.</li>
            <li>Cost effective much?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>and they both are nice too.</li>
            <li>Honestly I didn&#x27;t think the peppermint scent would carry over into it&#x27;s cleaning capacity.</li>
            <li>There is much more good things to say about this product</li>
            <li>Plus it smells nice and refreshing after cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Handy size of my favorite soap.</li>
            <li>Nothig makes this more evident than feeling a brilliant tingling sensation after a shower.</li>
            <li>It is better for the environment when camping, and the scent is nice and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Great for gifts or for refilling from a large bottle.</li>
            <li>It makes for a hilarious read if you&#x27;re not the type to drink</li>
            <li>If I have any more feedback</li>
            <li>If I have any more feedback</li>

            <li>I love the smell and the tingle.</li>

            <li>I thought peppermint might be appealing but after trying it out I have reconsidered.</li>

            <li>The ingredients are safe and beneficial to skin health.</li>

            <li>Love the smell..</li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>

            <li>So refreshing.</li>
            <li>:B00120VWJ0 Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap, 18-in-1 Hemp Peppermint, 8 oz bottle</li>

            <li>My sister-in-law that uses the foam pump also uses this scent of soap &amp; I do love it so ordered it &amp; am using it now.  </li>
            <li>Bronner&#x27;s is notorious for being applicable in many situations, and as this particular one smells great, I recommend using it for anything you&#x27;d use some minty cleaner on.</li>

            <li>I love all of the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps I&#x27;ve tried and they are great if you&#x27;re looking to multitask or switch over to more natural products.&lt;br</li>

            <li>it has so many uses and is pure and good for the environment</li>
            <li>Works great, doesn&#x27;t leave as much soap residue as my other body wash and is the best shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The peppermint is great for a pick me up during an early morning shower!</li>
            <li>Mix this stuff with water in a clean spray bottle...voila!  </li>
            <li>What I love most about the product is that it leaves your skin feeling squeaky clean and renewed.</li>
            <li>You feel like you fell in a vat of candy cane , you have a very cool sensation when leaving the shower...</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review.ary to get clean.  </li>
            <li>This is so nice and gentle on my skin - and the SCENT is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>Lightly towel off after a shower, and follow up with Peppermint oil and enjoy the magic of peppermint oil.  </li>
            <li>Very mild.</li>
            <li>Lathers nicely, has a mild scent and leaves your hands clean, without drying them out.</li>
            <li>But this one... STRONG.</li>
            <li>First off, I ordered Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint scented soap and I have to say that the smell is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>As a guy, I have to say this is hands down the best body soap I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This is a Huge Bottle.</li>
            <li>I do, however, need to enjoy how I smell when exiting the shower/bath.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really that effective, and it isn&#x27;t abrasive on household materials or clothes (should you use it as detergent).&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Although the bottle is smaller than I normally purchase it makes perfect for traveling</li>
            <li>If you are car camping works great with the Triton instant hot water heater for warm or hot showers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soooo refreshing in the hot, humid weather.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave you with that &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27; feeling.</li>
            <li>The peppermint smell makes me feel clean.</li>
            <li>, I strictly use it as a body wash and to clean the shower.</li>
            <li>Love it even more for being all natural.</li>
            <li>Powerful fragrance,I thought it might be too strong for my coworkers</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best and most useful thing  for person hygene after a few days in the bush.</li>
            <li>I understand this is because modern soaps have a bunch of garbage additives, many of which strip your body/hair/skin of all oils.  </li>
            <li>I have used it full strength and also diluted and have not found it tingling or nondrying..</li>
            <li>True to the statements, my hair has stopped falling out in clumps.</li>
            <li>Similarly, unlike many traditional body washes, it does not leave you feeling like you have a lotion-like substance on your skin after rinsing or leaving you smelling incredibly fragrant.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and great product for dry hands with no harsh chemicals, fragrance, alcohol, etc!!</li>
            <li>It smells great, lathers great, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>My beard is Epic, and I&#x27;d like it to stay that way, but the chemicals in modern products suck the moisture and oils out and really cause more harm than good</li>
            <li>And a great soap overall very pepper-minty.</li>
            <li>This was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>It has a clean scent, and it awakens your senses a little (in a great way).</li>
            <li>I love all the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps that I have tried so far!</li>
            <li>I love that it is natural and saves me money!</li>
            <li>Item exactly as described!</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite thing is the label on the bottle with all the positive messages.</li>
            <li>It feels amazing, especially during the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it in a homemade dishwasher detergent and it is so effective in cleaning my family&#x27;s dishes that we will never go back to store bought.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell it&#x27;s much, MUCH better on my beard.</li>
            <li>Love this soap for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff is unbelievably useful.</li>
            <li>my regular every day clothes nice also.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s purity makes it powerful.</li>
            <li>So powerful, that one must remember to</li>
            <li>The peppermint is by far my favorite, and smells so fresh</li>
            <li>Trying to be more health conscious with products I use, I purchased Dr. Bronners to use as my shampoo.</li>
            <li>only need a few drops on a wash cloth to take an entire shower.&lt;br /&gt;Lathers very nicely and leaves a great clean minty</li>
            <li>The scent on this product is just right</li>
            <li>It appears to be doing a decent job for me as my body wash/shampoo combo, so that&#x27;s a huge plus</li>
            <li>I also bought the lavender and the almond, but mostly use those as hand soap and body wash as the peppermint can be a little overwhelming in the shower.</li>
            <li>Unlike many bar soaps, it does not dry out your skin at all.</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t get as clean as normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>Two drops in a whole facebowl of hot water !</li>
            <li>My new favorite natural cleaning product!</li>
            <li>Better to use regular hair shampoo for the hair.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s concentrated and will last almost forever.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely hooked!</li>
            <li>I use this in a spray bottle for multi-purpose cleaner and I mop the floors with it, works better than commercial chemical laden products I would buy at the store.</li>
            <li>This Product is Environment Friendly and All Natural.  </li>
            <li>These soaps work and feel great, though I would recommend using something a bit more delicate on your face if you&#x27;re prone to have dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is great....makes my skin feels clean and soft...</li>
            <li>So I wanted to get away from the more commercial brands of modern soaps because they are hell on my beard.  </li>
            <li>Modern commercial brands use chemicals which cause a rich full lather you come to expect from soap/shampoo.  </li>
            <li>and you certainly feel the tingle after use.</li>
            <li>But, one thing i noticed about the smell, it has a certain odor i can&#x27;t describe...</li>
            <li>, now for some real feedback...&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>I also prefer to smell like a dude and not so much like a perfume factory.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really lather much.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works really well</li>
            <li>I like the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t foam as much  as I would like.</li>
            <li>Its very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin moisturized after and it feels really smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Which is something I really appreciate.</li>
            <li>The soap is very runny or liquidy?</li>
            <li>Its not greasy and gross, but it looks more natural, and is easier to manage.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s mild enough for super sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li>This, as it turns out, isn&#x27;t necessary to get clean.  </li>
            <li>I wash my hands frequently and have noticed that my skin is not as dry and nails are looking much better.</li>
            <li>When you use enough of this magic soap, it&#x27;ll lather enough for you to know you&#x27;re getting your scrub-a-dub on.  </li>
            <li>When you use enough of this magic soap, it&#x27;ll lather enough for you to know you&#x27;re getting your scrub-a-dub on.  </li>
            <li>But then I received a bottle of baby mild 8oz from a different company here on Amazon, and it had a protective seal inside the cap.</li>
            <li>I have pretty thick hair though, and so it leaves it clean, smooth, and soft</li>
            <li>A little in the tub is refreshing, not overly tingly.</li>
            <li>also use this as a shampoo, and was shocked to realize that it is also the perfect shampoo for my hair.</li>
            <li>(I normally was my beard 1-2 times a week unless I get gunk in it).  </li>
            <li>Also make sure to wash your hands extra long with water if you come in contact with the soap.  </li>
            <li>They also thought the peppermint fragrance was refreshing, especially after a long day of pub crawls....</li>
            <li>Maybe it was normal.</li>
            <li>This stuff is rather concentrated, so don&#x27;t use as much as normal.</li>
            <li>I stopped washing my hair every day, and only rarely use conditioner now.</li>
            <li>use the citrus soap for pretty much everything from body wash and shaving cream to a household cleaner (when mixed with baking soda).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you mix it right, it will last forever.</li>
            <li>in all, a definite recommendation for this guy right here.</li>
            <li>But aren&#x27;t you a little old to be believing in magic?</li>
            <li>But aren&#x27;t you a little old to be believing in magic?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to castile soap, maybe i&#x27;ll just get used to it.</li>
            <li>Maybe my body just hated the chemicals, or maybe tea tree is just amazing (I also have lemon and notice that it also does a good job at keeping blemishes</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much either, so the stuff last along time.</li>
            <li>Just be super careful not to get soap in babies eyes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not into the whole &#x27;au natural&#x27; lifestyle, so I was initially concerned</li>
            <li>I also have the tea tree oil wash that I use to keep my face clear of breakouts.</li>
            <li>This causes all kinds of issues if you have sensitive skin, or want to keep your beard at Epic levels.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and NEVER had an issue with this product.</li>
            <li>Not for anywhere you don&#x27;t want to risk feeling like &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; It&#x27;s not really burning I suppose more like extremely vigorous tingling.</li>
            <li>well, let&#x27;s call it &#x27;unique&#x27; instead of &#x27;preachy&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>wipe down to get as clean as possible.</li>
            <li>I love this because i can use a little bit, and it last a long time.</li>
            <li>It can be uncomfortable on some body parts, and nice on others.</li>
            <li>the possibilities are pretty much endless!</li>
            <li>Also, the label is covered with really odd religious statements, they kind of sound like  the rantings of a crazy person</li>
            <li>You can use a little bit of the liquid with your regular soap, to clean the private regions.</li>
            <li>The mint tingle is weak at best, then disappears into a weird smell.  </li>
            <li>I think it is a better cleanser than any other product I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>If this is true for you, cut back on quantity and/or dilute a little in a different bottle with water</li>
            <li>If this is true for you, cut back on quantity and/or dilute a little in a different bottle with water</li>
            <li>Other people raved about this soap, me not so much.  </li>
            <li>I mean, I really cant say much except...</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much like other soaps, so i&#x27;m thinking it will last me a while.</li>
            <li>as far as I can tell doesn&#x27;t hang around long.  </li>
            <li>use it mostly to clean makeup brushes, but have found other everyday uses.</li>
            <li>I saw this brand of soap in the store a few times before buying it and each time I was a little hesitant to buy it because of all the unusual (albeit positive and uplifting) writing on the bottle.</li>

            <li> Its perfect for shaving.</li>

            <li> Unless of course you believe in the magic of The Interwebs, in which case you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> The peppermint smells really invigorating, which is perfect for a morning wake-me-up shower.</li>
            <li> And once again, keeps my going out clothes nice and</li>
            <li> But honestly, just wait 5 minutes after your shower</li>
            <li> But honestly, just wait 5 minutes after your shower</li>
            <li> so I decided to make my own cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I squeeze a dab onto a shower pouf, put some warm water on and lather, then wash with it.</li>
            <li> Also, it has no lathering agents, so you have to do that on your own.</li>
            <li> Cost effective much?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> and they both are nice too.</li>
            <li> Honestly I didn&#x27;t think the peppermint scent would carry over into it&#x27;s cleaning capacity.</li>
            <li> There is much more good things to say about this product</li>
            <li> Plus it smells nice and refreshing after cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Handy size of my favorite soap.</li>
            <li> Nothig makes this more evident than feeling a brilliant tingling sensation after a shower.</li>
            <li> It is better for the environment when camping, and the scent is nice and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Great for gifts or for refilling from a large bottle.</li>
            <li> It makes for a hilarious read if you&#x27;re not the type to drink</li>
            <li> If I have any more feedback</li>

            <li> So refreshing.</li>
            <li> :B00120VWJ0 Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap, 18-in-1 Hemp Peppermint, 8 oz bottle</li>

            <li> The peppermint is great for a pick me up during an early morning shower!</li>
            <li> Mix this stuff with water in a clean spray bottle...voila!  </li>
            <li> What I love most about the product is that it leaves your skin feeling squeaky clean and renewed.</li>

            <li> This is so nice and gentle on my skin - and the SCENT is fabulous!  </li>
            <li> Lightly towel off after a shower, and follow up with Peppermint oil and enjoy the magic of peppermint oil.  </li>
            <li> Very mild.</li>
            <li> Lathers nicely, has a mild scent and leaves your hands clean, without drying them out.</li>
            <li> But this one... STRONG.</li>
            <li> First off, I ordered Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint scented soap and I have to say that the smell is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> As a guy, I have to say this is hands down the best body soap I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is a Huge Bottle.</li>
            <li> I do, however, need to enjoy how I smell when exiting the shower/bath.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really that effective, and it isn&#x27;t abrasive on household materials or clothes (should you use it as detergent).&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Although the bottle is smaller than I normally purchase it makes perfect for traveling</li>
            <li> If you are car camping works great with the Triton instant hot water heater for warm or hot showers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soooo refreshing in the hot, humid weather.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave you with that &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27; feeling.</li>
            <li> The peppermint smell makes me feel clean.</li>
            <li> , I strictly use it as a body wash and to clean the shower.</li>
            <li> Love it even more for being all natural.</li>
            <li> Powerful fragrance,I thought it might be too strong for my coworkers</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best and most useful thing  for person hygene after a few days in the bush.</li>
            <li> I understand this is because modern soaps have a bunch of garbage additives, many of which strip your body/hair/skin of all oils.  </li>
            <li> I have used it full strength and also diluted and have not found it tingling or nondrying..</li>
            <li> True to the statements, my hair has stopped falling out in clumps.</li>
            <li> Similarly, unlike many traditional body washes, it does not leave you feeling like you have a lotion-like substance on your skin after rinsing or leaving you smelling incredibly fragrant.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and great product for dry hands with no harsh chemicals, fragrance, alcohol, etc!!</li>
            <li> It smells great, lathers great, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My beard is Epic, and I&#x27;d like it to stay that way, but the chemicals in modern products suck the moisture and oils out and really cause more harm than good</li>
            <li> And a great soap overall very pepper-minty.</li>
            <li> This was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> It has a clean scent, and it awakens your senses a little (in a great way).</li>
            <li> I love all the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps that I have tried so far!</li>
            <li> I love that it is natural and saves me money!</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described!</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite thing is the label on the bottle with all the positive messages.</li>
            <li> It feels amazing, especially during the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it in a homemade dishwasher detergent and it is so effective in cleaning my family&#x27;s dishes that we will never go back to store bought.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell it&#x27;s much, MUCH better on my beard.</li>
            <li> Love this soap for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is unbelievably useful.</li>
            <li> my regular every day clothes nice also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s purity makes it powerful.</li>
            <li> So powerful, that one must remember to</li>
            <li> The peppermint is by far my favorite, and smells so fresh</li>
            <li> Trying to be more health conscious with products I use, I purchased Dr. Bronners to use as my shampoo.</li>
            <li> only need a few drops on a wash cloth to take an entire shower.&lt;br /&gt;Lathers very nicely and leaves a great clean minty</li>
            <li> The scent on this product is just right</li>
            <li> It appears to be doing a decent job for me as my body wash/shampoo combo, so that&#x27;s a huge plus</li>
            <li> I also bought the lavender and the almond, but mostly use those as hand soap and body wash as the peppermint can be a little overwhelming in the shower.</li>
            <li> Unlike many bar soaps, it does not dry out your skin at all.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t get as clean as normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> Two drops in a whole facebowl of hot water !</li>
            <li> My new favorite natural cleaning product!</li>
            <li> Better to use regular hair shampoo for the hair.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s concentrated and will last almost forever.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely hooked!</li>
            <li> I use this in a spray bottle for multi-purpose cleaner and I mop the floors with it, works better than commercial chemical laden products I would buy at the store.</li>
            <li> This Product is Environment Friendly and All Natural.  </li>
            <li> These soaps work and feel great, though I would recommend using something a bit more delicate on your face if you&#x27;re prone to have dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is great....makes my skin feels clean and soft...</li>
            <li> So I wanted to get away from the more commercial brands of modern soaps because they are hell on my beard.  </li>
            <li> Modern commercial brands use chemicals which cause a rich full lather you come to expect from soap/shampoo.  </li>
            <li> and you certainly feel the tingle after use.</li>
            <li> But, one thing i noticed about the smell, it has a certain odor i can&#x27;t describe...</li>
            <li> , now for some real feedback...&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> I also prefer to smell like a dude and not so much like a perfume factory.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really lather much.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works really well</li>
            <li> I like the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t foam as much  as I would like.</li>
            <li> Its very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin moisturized after and it feels really smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which is something I really appreciate.</li>
            <li> The soap is very runny or liquidy?</li>
            <li> Its not greasy and gross, but it looks more natural, and is easier to manage.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s mild enough for super sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li> This, as it turns out, isn&#x27;t necessary to get clean.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hands frequently and have noticed that my skin is not as dry and nails are looking much better.</li>
            <li> When you use enough of this magic soap, it&#x27;ll lather enough for you to know you&#x27;re getting your scrub-a-dub on.  </li>

            <li> But then I received a bottle of baby mild 8oz from a different company here on Amazon, and it had a protective seal inside the cap.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair though, and so it leaves it clean, smooth, and soft</li>
            <li> A little in the tub is refreshing, not overly tingly.</li>
            <li> also use this as a shampoo, and was shocked to realize that it is also the perfect shampoo for my hair.</li>
            <li> (I normally was my beard 1-2 times a week unless I get gunk in it).  </li>
            <li> Also make sure to wash your hands extra long with water if you come in contact with the soap.  </li>
            <li> They also thought the peppermint fragrance was refreshing, especially after a long day of pub crawls....</li>
            <li> Maybe it was normal.</li>
            <li> This stuff is rather concentrated, so don&#x27;t use as much as normal.</li>
            <li> I stopped washing my hair every day, and only rarely use conditioner now.</li>
            <li> use the citrus soap for pretty much everything from body wash and shaving cream to a household cleaner (when mixed with baking soda).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you mix it right, it will last forever.</li>
            <li> in all, a definite recommendation for this guy right here.</li>
            <li> But aren&#x27;t you a little old to be believing in magic?</li>
            <li> But aren&#x27;t you a little old to be believing in magic?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to castile soap, maybe i&#x27;ll just get used to it.</li>
            <li> Maybe my body just hated the chemicals, or maybe tea tree is just amazing (I also have lemon and notice that it also does a good job at keeping blemishes</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need very much either, so the stuff last along time.</li>
            <li> Just be super careful not to get soap in babies eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into the whole &#x27;au natural&#x27; lifestyle, so I was initially concerned</li>
            <li> I also have the tea tree oil wash that I use to keep my face clear of breakouts.</li>
            <li> This causes all kinds of issues if you have sensitive skin, or want to keep your beard at Epic levels.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and NEVER had an issue with this product.</li>
            <li> Not for anywhere you don&#x27;t want to risk feeling like &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; It&#x27;s not really burning I suppose more like extremely vigorous tingling.</li>
            <li> well, let&#x27;s call it &#x27;unique&#x27; instead of &#x27;preachy&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> wipe down to get as clean as possible.</li>
            <li> I love this because i can use a little bit, and it last a long time.</li>
            <li> It can be uncomfortable on some body parts, and nice on others.</li>
            <li> the possibilities are pretty much endless!</li>
            <li> Also, the label is covered with really odd religious statements, they kind of sound like  the rantings of a crazy person</li>
            <li> You can use a little bit of the liquid with your regular soap, to clean the private regions.</li>
            <li> The mint tingle is weak at best, then disappears into a weird smell.  </li>
            <li> I think it is a better cleanser than any other product I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> If this is true for you, cut back on quantity and/or dilute a little in a different bottle with water</li>
            <li> If this is true for you, cut back on quantity and/or dilute a little in a different bottle with water</li>
            <li> Other people raved about this soap, me not so much.  </li>
            <li> I mean, I really cant say much except...</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much like other soaps, so i&#x27;m thinking it will last me a while.</li>
            <li> as far as I can tell doesn&#x27;t hang around long.  </li>
            <li> use it mostly to clean makeup brushes, but have found other everyday uses.</li>
            <li> I saw this brand of soap in the store a few times before buying it and each time I was a little hesitant to buy it because of all the unusual (albeit positive and uplifting) writing on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Its very concentrated a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> acne set for obviously acne, certain lotion to keep me moisturized, and certain lotion to rid me of random blemishes and stuff.</li>
            <li> If I use the peppermint soap on my face too often, the area outside of my nostrils gets a little sensitive and my skin dries out, but not excessively or painfully as it has in the past with other soaps.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I thought this would dry my skin out back at school in Indiana</li>
            <li> anyway, it&#x27;s the only negative about it really.</li>
            <li> I read that a small amount goes a long way from a reviewer and it really does if you use a shower \\&quot;poof\\&quot; or sponge.</li>
            <li> I do recommend getting the hair rinse because it does leave long hair somewhat tangled.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts on on my body for hours, almost all day long.</li>
            <li> Next time, I think I will order the big bottle, but a little does goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It does dry my skin out a lot though.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt dry out and fro</li>
            <li> It only takes a few drops to make a foam of white frothy bubbles on a loofah.</li>
            <li> personally do not like using Dr. B&#x27;s as a shampoo because it leaves my hair excessively greasy, coarse, and matted.</li>
            <li> I would buy different body washes but all of them just made my skin angry in certain areas</li>
            <li> It actually helps kill and repell fleas without having to use any harsh chemical flea repellents on them.</li>
            <li> If you plan on doing the same you have to keep a few things in mind.</li>
            <li> I dilute it 1 part soap to about 5 parts filtered water (rough guess) and use it in Method brand foaming hand soap dispensers.</li>
            <li> I have thick, natural African-American hair and this product leaves my hair softer than any other shampoo I have used.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little strange since i&#x27;m not used to it.</li>
            <li> invigorating feel when showering.might order other flavors.i recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d smell like one of those folks who take it to a militant extreme.  </li>
            <li> I use this product due to the cleaning properties of peppermint.</li>
            <li> I bought it to make dish soap but am not out of the other stuss yet</li>
            <li> will purchase again and a couple other scents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try other scents as we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> not like Dial or any other soap i&#x27;ve ever used before.</li>
            <li> The scent is refreshing,and it leaves my hair clean,not weighed down.</li>
            <li> By that, I mean when I took a shower with this, washed my hair with this, brushed my teeth</li>
            <li> USED, including the other &amp;#34;Flavors&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> A little of this stuff goes a looooooooong way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took me a little getting used to</li>
            <li> hair, put a little in your palm and lather it up, then put it in your hair.</li>
            <li> I like to leave it on for a few minutes</li>
            <li> It cleans well without drying the skin at all, and washes off with no residue left behind.</li>
            <li> I did not enjoy it at all.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for a few years now</li>
            <li> I used this stuff everyday but that was 40 years ago.</li>
            <li> This soap has a very odd after-smell.  </li>
            <li> It is in fact not magic as described.</li>

            <li> diluteI mean it :  </li>
            <li> Sadly, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference from this soap and a organic/natural black soap I used to use.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try some of the crazy uses for it other than in the shower!</li>
            <li> (Im a freak about my skin, and so ANY blemish is irritating to me).</li>
            <li> i use it as soap (an expensive soap)</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really weird...</li>
            <li> : I will say this, as soon as you wash your body with it, it kinda feels weird on your skin for like 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Well, lets just say it lathers horribly for someone with thick hair.</li>
            <li> The price ain&#x27;t too bad, all things considered.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nasty to brush your teeth with)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the smell and great product for dry hands with no harsh chemicals, fragrance, alcohol, etc!!</li>
            <li> Dr Bronner&#x27;s Castile soap is amazing! I used it in a homemade dishwasher detergent and it is so effective in cleaning my family&#x27;s dishes that we will never go back to store bought.</li>
            <li> This is really nice bath soap.  It leaves your skin feeling great.  Not too good for the hair, dries it out.  Better to use regular hair shampoo for the hair.</li>
            <li> The peppermint is great for a pick me up during an early morning shower! Works great, doesn&#x27;t leave as much soap residue as my other body wash and is the best shampoo I have ever used. I have thick, natural African-American hair and this product leaves my hair softer than any other shampoo I have used. I like to leave it on for a few minutes so I can feel the tingle on my scalp. Next time, I think I will order the big bottle, but a little does goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Powerful fragrance,I thought it might be too strong for my coworkers once I got to work but it wasn&#x27;t noticeable at all.&lt;br /&gt;Effervescent &amp; invigorating feel when showering.might order other flavors.i recommend</li>
            <li> i LOVE this product!!  it has so many uses and is pure and good for the environment and it smells absolutely wonderful!!  I use it as a hand wash, a pet shampoo,body wash...the possibilities are pretty much endless!</li>
            <li> This is a Huge Bottle. And a great soap overall very pepper-minty. Happy that its Organic and not to pricey. Will buy again. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> So I wanted to get away from the more commercial brands of modern soaps because they are hell on my beard.  My beard is Epic, and I&#x27;d like it to stay that way, but the chemicals in modern products suck the moisture and oils out and really cause more harm than good (I normally was my beard 1-2 times a week unless I get gunk in it).  So on a whim, and at the suggestion of the Internet, I am giving this stuff a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Impressions&lt;br /&gt;1) I&#x27;m worried I might start smelling like a hippie.&lt;br /&gt;2) I&#x27;m worried I might *become* a hippie because of my use of this&lt;br /&gt;3) The product label is...well, let&#x27;s call it &#x27;unique&#x27; instead of &#x27;preachy&#x27;.  It makes for a hilarious read if you&#x27;re not the type to drink the kool-aid.&lt;br /&gt;Okay, now for some real feedback...&lt;br /&gt;4) The peppermint sent isn&#x27;t overpowering and as far as I can tell doesn&#x27;t hang around long.  I&#x27;m not into the whole &#x27;au natural&#x27; lifestyle, so I was initially concerned I&#x27;d smell like one of those folks who take it to a militant extreme.  I also prefer to smell like a dude and not so much like a perfume factory.  I&#x27;m not a &#x27;Man&#x27;s Man&#x27;, but I do like to keep it simple.&lt;br /&gt;5) It appears to be doing a decent job for me as my body wash/shampoo combo, so that&#x27;s a huge plus (like I said, I like to keep things simple).&lt;br /&gt;6) As far as I can tell it&#x27;s much, MUCH better on my beard. Booyas.&lt;br /&gt;7) The price ain&#x27;t too bad, all things considered.  A little of this stuff goes a looooooooong way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things you may notice&lt;br /&gt;1) It doesn&#x27;t leave you with that &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27; feeling. I understand this is because modern soaps have a bunch of garbage additives, many of which strip your body/hair/skin of all oils.  This causes all kinds of issues if you have sensitive skin, or want to keep your beard at Epic levels.&lt;br /&gt;2) It doesn&#x27;t really lather much.  Modern commercial brands use chemicals which cause a rich full lather you come to expect from soap/shampoo.  This, as it turns out, isn&#x27;t necessary to get clean.  When you use enough of this magic soap, it&#x27;ll lather enough for you to know you&#x27;re getting your scrub-a-dub on.  So fret not my bearded brothers!&lt;br /&gt;3) You might begin to display hippie-tendencies. If this is true for you, cut back on quantity and/or dilute a little in a different bottle with water and you&#x27;ll find that urge fads quickly.&lt;br /&gt;4) It is in fact not magic as described. But aren&#x27;t you a little old to be believing in magic? Unless of course you believe in the magic of The Interwebs, in which case you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all seriousness, this stuff ain&#x27;t too bad so far.

            <li> This was delivered quickly. I have used this product in the past, and like it. It is better for the environment when camping, and the scent is nice and refreshing.</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well and is smells good. It does dry my skin out a lot though. I sue it mostly when I am away from showers to do a body wipe down to get as clean as possible.</li>
            <li> They should call this stuff Spearming BodyWash! It feels like your washing with the gum. It&#x27;s not as tingly as I thought it would be but then again I did dilute. But I still loved it. Looking forward to trying more scents!</li>
            <li> Well, I always read reviews people leave on something I am considering to buy..and I looked forward to this product..I have used it full strength and also diluted and have not found it tingling or nondrying..guess I have to do some more research on the best way to apply for shampoo and body soap..at this point would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do what i thought it would. i use it as soap (an expensive soap)</li>
            <li> I have never felt cleaner! I love the smell and the tingle. It isn&#x27;t over bearing and I have ordered it several times now. Each time I get a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Super good deal! This stuff works really well, the peppermint is really refreshing (just watch the eyes) and it&#x27;s mild enough for super sensitive skin too. My husband uses the Peppermint, my daughter uses the Baby and I am in love with the Lavender.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I can use it for any cleaning needs. I mostly use it for dishwashing and hand washing. The peppermint smell makes me feel clean.</li>
            <li> I use this product due to the cleaning properties of peppermint. It is excellent for skin conditions on your back for example. The scent on this product is just right, I support that it is organic and you certainly feel the tingle after use. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t foam as much  as I would like.</li>
            <li> This soap really cleans and there are many, many, uses for it! We love it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because of the reviews I read. True to the statements, my hair has stopped falling out in clumps. I do recommend getting the hair rinse because it does leave long hair somewhat tangled. The scent is refreshing,and it leaves my hair clean,not weighed down.</li>
            <li> This is great soap for removing cradle cap from my baby.  Just be super careful not to get soap in babies eyes.  Also make sure to wash your hands extra long with water if you come in contact with the soap.  I had some residue left on my hands and it made my eyes itching for two weeks!  I use it for cleaning my floors too.  You don&#x27;t need very much either, so the stuff last along time.</li>
            <li> Love this soap for my sensitive skin. It smells great, lathers great, and a little goes a long way. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> As a guy, I have to say this is hands down the best body soap I have ever used. Unlike many bar soaps, it does not dry out your skin at all. Similarly, unlike many traditional body washes, it does not leave you feeling like you have a lotion-like substance on your skin after rinsing or leaving you smelling incredibly fragrant. The peppermint scent is strong, really strong, but it feels great tingling the skin and smells great. I saw this brand of soap in the store a few times before buying it and each time I was a little hesitant to buy it because of all the unusual (albeit positive and uplifting) writing on the bottle. What a mistake though, this soap is great and I shouldn&#x27;t have waited.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet I bought it to make dish soap but am not out of the other stuss yet</li>
            <li> This is so nice and gentle on my skin - and the SCENT is fabulous!  It is a true Peppermint and lifts your spirits - I LOVE this product - and, as we all know - Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is an extremely reputable brand.  This is now my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; soap!</li>
            <li> What I love most about the product is that it leaves your skin feeling squeaky clean and renewed. I do, however, need to enjoy how I smell when exiting the shower/bath. I thought peppermint might be appealing but after trying it out I have reconsidered. It&#x27;s a great product but I would not recommend the fragrance.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t taken this camping you should. Absolutely the best and most useful thing  for person hygene after a few days in the bush. If you are car camping works great with the Triton instant hot water heater for warm or hot showers.</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid Castile soaps. It only takes a few drops to make a foam of white frothy bubbles on a loofah. It cleans well without drying the skin at all, and washes off with no residue left behind. The ingredients are safe and beneficial to skin health. The peppermint smells really invigorating, which is perfect for a morning wake-me-up shower. I also have the tea tree oil wash that I use to keep my face clear of breakouts. Three drops and my face is clean, so awesome! My absolute favorite thing is the label on the bottle with all the positive messages. I read the all-one messages over and over. It&#x27;s the perfect affirmation for cleansing and bath time relaxation. I love all the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps that I have tried so far!</li>
            <li> I love this because i can use a little bit, and it last a long time. It has a clean scent, and it awakens your senses a little (in a great way). You can use a little bit of the liquid with your regular soap, to clean the private regions. It lathers up great. The scent lasts on on my body for hours, almost all day long.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this , but it is fantastic! I love it, I strictly use it as a body wash and to clean the shower. If you mix it right, it will last forever.</li>
            <li> This soap has a very odd after-smell.  The mint tingle is weak at best, then disappears into a weird smell.  I did not enjoy it at all.  Also, the label is covered with really odd religious statements, they kind of sound like  the rantings of a crazy person, it&#x27;s really weird...</li>
            <li> I mean, I really cant say much except... oh wait, YES I CAN!! This stuff is unbelievably useful. As a male college student, I work with a very low budget but I still would buy the acne clinique system, lotions, and s*** for my body to treat individual things I didnt like. acne set for obviously acne, certain lotion to keep me moisturized, and certain lotion to rid me of random blemishes and stuff. I would buy different body washes but all of them just made my skin angry in certain areas (Im a freak about my skin, and so ANY blemish is irritating to me). I bought Dr. bronners tea tree, and guess what?? Literally does all of that stuff for me. 1.) Its the perfect face wash for guys, maybe not girls idk. My skin would get oily easily while Im home in Hawaii and this stuff does great at oil control plus moisture But when it got to winter time and I thought this would dry my skin out back at school in Indiana, IT DIDNT! I dont know why but it cleared up all my acne, and I have flawless skin, all over my body now. Maybe my body just hated the chemicals, or maybe tea tree is just amazing (I also have lemon and notice that it also does a good job at keeping blemishes away).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this as a shampoo, and was shocked to realize that it is also the perfect shampoo for my hair. I have pretty thick hair though, and so it leaves it clean, smooth, and soft but it doesnt dry out and fro up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this as a cleaner. I mix 1 part of tea tree, 1 part of lemon, and then 20 parts water in all. Cleans stuff like a boss, and people always comment how my place is so clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this as my laundry detergent. And once again, keeps my going out clothes nice and my regular every day clothes nice also. Its very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this for shaving!! Its perfect for shaving. It leaves your skin moisturized after and it feels really smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: I will say this, as soon as you wash your body with it, it kinda feels weird on your skin for like 5 minutes. Like you used a bar soap. But honestly, just wait 5 minutes after your shower and you will feel how good it is on your skin.sed a bar soap. But honestly, just wait 5 minutes after your shower and you will feel how good it is on your skin.</li>
            <li> very good organic product.&lt;br /&gt;You only need a few drops on a wash cloth to take an entire shower.&lt;br /&gt;Lathers very nicely and leaves a great clean minty, tingly feel without noticeable drying of skin&lt;br /&gt;I Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> With 2 teenagers and 5 pets I go through a lot of cleaners.  I want to save money and avoid chemicals so I decided to make my own cleaner.  Mix this stuff with water in a clean spray bottle...voila!  Smells good too!</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use it in the shower for shower gel. The peppermint made my tender parts burn a bit. A little in the tub is refreshing, not overly tingly.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! No complaints.</li>
            <li> I use this to make foaming handsoap. I love that it is natural and saves me money! And the peppermint smell is amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this soap.  I love that it&#x27;s concentrated and will last almost forever.  Also great that it&#x27;s all natural.  Can&#x27;t wait to try some of the crazy uses for it other than in the shower!</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for a few years now and I absolutely love it !!  It&#x27;s soooo refreshing in the hot, humid weather.</li>
            <li> My two sons used this while backpacking in Europe over the summer; the practical, all-in-one aspects of using it as a body wash, shampoo, and laundry soap worked well.  They also thought the peppermint fragrance was refreshing, especially after a long day of pub crawls....um, I mean  sightseeing...uh-huh.</li>
            <li> wanted to try something new and you immediately feel clean, refreshed and it smells great. will purchase again and a couple other scents.</li>
            <li> When I received my peppermint 8oz bottle, there was no seal. Maybe it was normal. But then I received a bottle of baby mild 8oz from a different company here on Amazon, and it had a protective seal inside the cap. If it doesn&#x27;t have a protective seal once it leaves the production line, then it will not get a perfect review from my opinion. If it was the retailer&#x27;s fault, well, who knows.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years Backpacking. Cleans my cooking pots/plates and me and it&#x27;s organic(OK it&#x27;s nasty to brush your teeth with) And these guys pack it great, no leakage!</li>
            <li> I squeeze a dab onto a shower pouf, put some warm water on and lather, then wash with it. I have sensitive skin and NEVER had an issue with this product. It does tingle so my only recommendation would be to not try to shave with it (if you have sensitive skin like me that is) scent does not really linger.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used! I&#x27;m absolutely hooked! It was more than a shower, it was an experience! Why haven&#x27;t I tried this stuff sooner!!!! I will never go without it!</li>
            <li> You feel like you fell in a vat of candy cane , you have a very cool sensation when leaving the shower... Amazing stuff</li>
            <li> Other people raved about this soap, me not so much.  It does have a great peppermint smell but its soap.</li>
            <li> My new favorite natural cleaning product! I use this in a spray bottle for multi-purpose cleaner and I mop the floors with it, works better than commercial chemical laden products I would buy at the store. Also this is not tested on animals:)</li>
            <li> Have the doctor&#x27;s bar soap too. This stuff is great. We use it and we shampoo our dogs with it too. It actually helps kill and repell fleas without having to use any harsh chemical flea repellents on them. Which is something I really appreciate. The labels on poisonous flea killing products always mention you&#x27;re not supposed to use it on domestic animals. What are our dogs if they&#x27;re not domestic animals? Those labels also warn you not to get or leave it on your skin. Glad the good doctor came up with this multi-purpose soap!</li>
            <li> Favorite soap/shampoo at home, work, and the gym.  Very refreshing on the skin, and it makes the bath smell great too.  Lightly towel off after a shower, and follow up with Peppermint oil and enjoy the magic of peppermint oil.  Refreshing and invigorating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not trying to hype this up, but this is honestly some of the best soap I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for hair, facewash, and bodywash. If you plan on doing the same you have to keep a few things in mind. This stuff is rather concentrated, so don&#x27;t use as much as normal. Also, it has no lathering agents, so you have to do that on your own. It took me a little getting used to but I am happy I made the switch. Also, I bought a 16 ounce for like 9 bucks and didnt have to get shampoo, body, or facewash again for about 3 months. Cost effective much?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For hair, put a little in your palm and lather it up, then put it in your hair. scrub as usual. If your hair is especially dirty, rinse and do it again. Once I started using this product I stopped washing my hair every day, and only rarely use conditioner now. You might want to do the same and see how it goes. A lot of people think that it will get greasy and gross, and maybe yours will, I dont know. For me however, a day or two after washing with this soap is when my hair looks its best. Its not greasy and gross, but it looks more natural, and is easier to manage. Honestly it awesome, try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For face and body, just toss a bit on a washcloth or scrubber and lather it, then wash away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peppermint feels great, and smells good too. I have tried the citrus and almond as well and they both are nice too.</li>
            <li> Ok, Dr Bronner soap is great. But this one... STRONG. Not for anywhere you don&#x27;t want to risk feeling like &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; It&#x27;s not really burning I suppose more like extremely vigorous tingling. It can be uncomfortable on some body parts, and nice on others.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Item exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I ordered this to freshen up my living quarters ~ kitchen, living room, and bathroom ~ while cleaning or dusting my entire household.</li>
            <li> Very mild. Love the smell..</li>
            <li> Love this soap. The peppermint is so refreshing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it mostly to clean makeup brushes, but have found other everyday uses. It is quickly becoming my go-to.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps I&#x27;ve tried and they are great if you&#x27;re looking to multitask or switch over to more natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peppermint soap leaves you with a bit of a chill, so it&#x27;s perfect for the summer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it to help with acne. If I use the peppermint soap on my face too often, the area outside of my nostrils gets a little sensitive and my skin dries out, but not excessively or painfully as it has in the past with other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;Pouring a few drops in the bath is very relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the citrus soap for pretty much everything from body wash and shaving cream to a household cleaner (when mixed with baking soda).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tea tree oil soap is also great for cleaning because it has antibacterial properties. It&#x27;s also great to use as a face wash, and I have not noticed any sensitivity with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally do not like using Dr. B&#x27;s as a shampoo because it leaves my hair excessively greasy, coarse, and matted. I prefer the no-poo method.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!  I have ended up replacing almost all my household cleaners with this.  Add some water to this soap and you are good to go.  Plus it smells nice and refreshing after cleaning.  I also bought the lavender and the almond, but mostly use those as hand soap and body wash as the peppermint can be a little overwhelming in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have been making several homemade soaps etc and this is in most of the recipes. Happy with the cost and shipping too.</li>
            <li> I like the aroma this soap gives off in the shower. Although the bottle is smaller than I normally purchase it makes perfect for traveling</li>
            <li> What a multi purpose product.it smells wonderful and refreshing. I&#x27;ll keep buying this product. I&#x27;m going to try other scents as we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> Working great for my purpose.  THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> Handy size of my favorite soap. Wonderful strong peppermint aroma. Great for gifts or for refilling from a large bottle.</li>
            <li> I have used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s for years and have never had any reason to complain. These soaps work and feel great, though I would recommend using something a bit more delicate on your face if you&#x27;re prone to have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I kinda like this soap. You don&#x27;t have to use much like other soaps, so i&#x27;m thinking it will last me a while. The soap is very runny or liquidy? not like Dial or any other soap i&#x27;ve ever used before. But it does a great job in cleaning me, my body feels refreshed and tingly in some areas (maybe an effect from the peppermint). But, one thing i noticed about the smell, it has a certain odor i can&#x27;t describe...i&#x27;m talking besides the peppermint smell, it&#x27;s a little strange since i&#x27;m not used to it. Possibly something to do with that fact that it&#x27;s organic? maybe it&#x27;s  the oils? anyway, it&#x27;s the only negative about it really. I&#x27;m new to castile soap, maybe i&#x27;ll just get used to it. Still, i&#x27;d buy this again it seems to work great.</li>
            <li> First off, I ordered Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint scented soap and I have to say that the smell is AMAZING. I read that a small amount goes a long way from a reviewer and it really does if you use a shower \\&quot;poof\\&quot; or sponge. Sadly, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference from this soap and a organic/natural black soap I used to use. And after being out of the shower for awhile, I didn&#x27;t smell like peppermint at all. That really sucks because I really do love that smell and find it to be quite pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;So I would only recommend this to someone who would want brief euphoria from a soap that will last them quite some time (which also saves money) but doesn&#x27;t provide any big changes in skin smoothness or softness..</li>
            <li> Awesome Stuff! Buy it!&lt;br /&gt;I have used alot of soaps over the years and this is the best I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Lather is incredible, smell is incredible, no film after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;I have already reordered.</li>
            <li> A Great, Great product. I think it is a better cleanser than any other product I&#x27;ve used in the past. I really like how it leaves my skin feeling afterwards, and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> I dilute it 1 part soap to about 5 parts filtered water (rough guess) and use it in Method brand foaming hand soap dispensers. Lathers nicely, has a mild scent and leaves your hands clean, without drying them out. I wash my hands frequently and have noticed that my skin is not as dry and nails are looking much better.</li>
            <li> Been using it for only two days and I am already using it for as a shampoo, hand, and body wash. The smell is pleasant and the tingling sensation for me was enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Being reminded about Dr. Brommer&#x27;s Peppermint Castile was a blast from the past. I used this stuff everyday but that was 40 years ago. Hasn&#x27;t changed a bit ! It&#x27;s purity makes it powerful. So powerful, that one must remember to diluteI mean it :  dilute dilute. Two drops in a whole facebowl of hot water ! So refreshing. Yes, I even brushed my teeth with it once or twice. I think it improved things in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00120VWJ0 Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap, 18-in-1 Hemp Peppermint, 8 oz bottle</li>
            <li> Honestly I didn&#x27;t think the peppermint scent would carry over into it&#x27;s cleaning capacity. By that, I mean when I took a shower with this, washed my hair with this, brushed my teeth, I could feel the cookin breeze of the peppermint in every application. Nothig makes this more evident than feeling a brilliant tingling sensation after a shower. It feels amazing, especially during the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is notorious for being applicable in many situations, and as this particular one smells great, I recommend using it for anything you&#x27;d use some minty cleaner on. It&#x27;s really that effective, and it isn&#x27;t abrasive on household materials or clothes (should you use it as detergent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a definite recommendation for this guy right here.</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Bronners.  I&#x27;ve been using it since I was a teen.  The peppermint is by far my favorite, and smells so fresh I use it for almost everything.  A fabulous organic product that also makes for interesting bathroom reading.</li>
            <li> Best soap I HAVE EVER USED, including the other &amp;#34;Flavors&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> MY hair loves this. The shine and bounce it restores to my hair is wonderful. Its very concentrated a little goes a long way. I love the peppermint, gives your scalp a tingle that stimulates growth. The peppermint isn&#x27;t overpowering. Just enough to let you know it&#x27;s there. VERY VERY Rich lather even on the dirtiest of hair. I love this stuff. Love it even more for being all natural. I have had mine for 3 months. I use this 3 x a week and my 50/50 other times and the balance is perfect. Love it.</li>
            <li> Smelled good. Worked well for washing my clothes on the go. My hair didn&#x27;t get as clean as normal shampoo. I used mostly for laundry and bodywash.</li>
            <li> Trying to be more health conscious with products I use, I purchased Dr. Bronners to use as my shampoo. Well, lets just say it lathers horribly for someone with thick hair. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the Best (in not the Best)  product on the market today. This is my second time I&#x27;ve ordered this Peppermint Castile Liquid Soap.  I have it in a Foaming Dispenser and I&#x27;ve always enjoyed the Peppermint scent after washing my hands.  This Product is Environment Friendly and All Natural.  There is much more good things to say about this product but you get the idea</li>
            <li> This is great....makes my skin feels clean and soft...I will continue using it. It is a must try. You will be happy you did...</li>
            <li> I use this from washing, cleaning and killing ants plus fleas. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law that uses the foam pump also uses this scent of soap &amp; I do love it so ordered it &amp; am using it now.  I would recommend it to anyone &amp; hope I have the chance to do so.</li>
