            <li>Quite enjoyed it!</li>
            <li>This soap smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Nice smell.</li>
            <li>my skin has a nice supple sheen to it.</li>
            <li>I really liked this smell a lot, the coconut and vanilla leaves a nice lingering scent on your skin.</li>
            <li>My daughter came to visit and LOVES the scent, will be ordering her own.</li>
            <li>an added bonus, the container that the wash comes in is sturdy and has a handy pump.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, works better.  </li>
            <li>I liked they shipped to Apo/DPO address.  </li>
            <li>Excellent all natural soap.</li>
            <li>This company makes excellent products using natural ingredients and this bath gel is no exception.  </li>
            <li>but I would have liked more coconut.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed... a natural product with a wonderful fragrance and texture.  </li>
            <li>Out of all the shower gel&#x27;s I&#x27;ve purchased (organic ones), this one is far best my favorite.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the scent, very refreshing.</li>
            <li>It is a more mild form of Sodium LS, however it is still a synthetic foam agent, which is not organic, or does anything good for your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love coconut</li>
            <li>and I love tangerine</li>
            <li>It is so soothing and lovely to shower with the shower gel.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>but to me it&#x27;s mostly Tangerine...</li>
            <li>which I don&#x27;t mind because I still love how it smells.</li>
            <li>Please take the time to like this comment, so I know my research and time was helpful! :)&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please take the time to like this comment, so I know my research and time was helpful! :)</li>
            <li>I am running out and I&#x27;ll have to get more.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this shower gel, and I also love that the scent doesn&#x27;t linger on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love EO shower gels</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite shower gels....</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The fragrance would be better described as just Tangerine.</li>
            <li>Smell is very unique.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser, which I love, but too much of a good thing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent moisturizing shower gel, but I find I have to use more than I expect to get a good lather.</li>
            <li>The soap has a great lather and makes my skin soft, but it smells tartly of tangerine.</li>
            <li>It smells just as amazing, not too coconutty, not too vanilla-y, but just right.  </li>
            <li>EO has other wonderful products as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin (even kids&#x27;) and has a fantastic light, almost tropical smell.</li>
            <li>Smells great, makes my skin soft, silky and clean.  </li>
            <li>love this, will be ordering another when I run out of my first one :)</li>
            <li>The coconut and vanilla with tangerine shower gel not only smells great</li>
            <li>The scents are amazing and made with real ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Love this natural product shower gel as it has a nice smell and leaves my skin hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>Smells good, came quick, doesn&#x27;t go far.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and love how it&#x27;s not harsh on the skin!  </li>
            <li>Using mainstream shower gels is out of the question for me because many of them cause me to break out into hives, but even many organic or natural body washes have given me rashes when I have tried them.  </li>
            <li>This body wash does not cause that type of reaction and leaves me feeling and smelling clean without drying out my skin too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and smells great, I didn&#x27;t like it didn&#x27;t lather much.</li>
            <li>Anyway I am trying to find subsitutes that are not overwhelming and this one is very nice, the scents are light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>and it really softens the skin unlike most soaps.</li>
            <li>Nice to have something so natural</li>
            <li>This product smells nice and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It is a very natural non-chemically laden formula that is great for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Had to find a new top for it.</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and mild.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this product and would certainly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>It is a nice, clean smelling, low sudsing gel and is very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell of this shower gel, and frequently pair it with the matching lotion afterwards.  </li>
            <li>My hubby and I both like the smell and feel of it, and that&#x27;s a rare find.</li>
            <li>For the price, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth it for a good body soap that&#x27;s more on the natural side.</li>
            <li>It is a great shower gel - safe ingredients, non drying, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>It really is stronger on the tangerine, not unpleasant</li>
            <li>I first fell in love with the body lotion with this same scent - so I decided to give the shower gel a try.  </li>
            <li>I have this shower gel to go with the lotion of the same scent, and I really love the coconut vanilla scent with a hint of tangerine.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I have those cool soap dispensers in my new house</li>
            <li>Thanks to these fellow reviewers for pushing me in the right direction.  </li>
            <li>Look for formulas with natural cleansers that work with your skin to clean and get rid of germs and bacteria, but that won’t contribute to premature aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[</li>
            <li>pretty much everything.</li>
            <li>This shower gel felt ok and had a decent lather but the smell left something to be desired.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten this product once before and really like the product itself.</li>
            <li>smells very lemony.</li>
            <li>Recommend to all, esp those who really prefer to use organic products.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and was what I ordered.</li>
            <li>Better for your body than soaps with &amp;#34;SLS&amp;#34; and all the other chemical that are added to soaps.</li>
            <li>I love EO products and do not use any other shampoo, conditioner or shower gels.  </li>
            <li>Yeast and other critters love to feed on that sugar residue and it can cause some people to develop rashes.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s paraben-free and does not irritate or dry my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Smells good and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other store</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a wash than a gel, and it takes several pumps to get enough lather to wash unless you use a nylon puff.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not a very good shaving gel, so you have to have a separate shaving gel unless you want to apply literally handfuls of this &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; to your legs in order to get enough for good razor glide.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive to heat, the sun, overly fragranced products...</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft!</li>
            <li>I always buy EO products because they use natural oils.</li>
            <li>The coconut and vanilla are completely lost.</li>
            <li>The body wash is fine, but I was disappointed that it did not smell more like coconut.  </li>
            <li>Half the contents had spilled out because the top was not secure.</li>
            <li>My skin is clearer, no dry spots and EO&#x27;s shower gel even keeps it</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and could only use dove even tried other natural products like Dr bronners</li>
            <li>And it lathers well for a natural item and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>

            <li> Wish the pump was a little taller and larger to make it easier to pump onto my scrubber.</li>
            <li> product was broken when i received it and just like my shampoo was the wrong kind...</li>

            <li> I often shower 2x/day due to mid-day workouts and rely on EO shower gel to keep my skin from drying out.  </li>
            <li> For the price, in my opinion, not worth it.</li>
            <li> but my skin isn&#x27;t dry like it was with common store-bought body washes.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment since I really like the product.</li>
            <li> I like to mix it with a pump of suave no scent soap to round it out.</li>

            <li> Excellent all natural soap. Better for your body than soaps with &amp;#34;SLS&amp;#34; and all the other chemical that are added to soaps.</li>
            <li> Smells good and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other store bought soaps have.</li>
            <li> I love coconut and I love tangerine but I do not love this shower gel.  This shower gel felt ok and had a decent lather but the smell left something to be desired.  It gets the job done but I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> lathers well, smells great, has lasted me a WHILE. you don&#x27;t need much to get it lathered so a small amount goes a long way. love this, will be ordering another when I run out of my first one :)</li>
            <li> This company makes excellent products using natural ingredients and this bath gel is no exception.  Great feel, smell which makes the shower experience exceptional.</li>
            <li> I love the way this shower gel smells! My skin feels soft!</li>
            <li> This is great shower gel.  It cleans thoroughly but does not strip or dry out your skin.  My son uses this because he has an extreme chemical sensitivity and has very dry skin.  This product did not irritate his skin.  I will continue to use EO products!</li>
            <li> I always buy EO products because they use natural oils. They&#x27;re a great company with a conscience as well. The scent is fresh and mild.</li>
            <li> The soap has a great lather and makes my skin soft, but it smells tartly of tangerine. The coconut and vanilla are completely lost. I like to mix it with a pump of suave no scent soap to round it out.</li>
            <li> The coconut and vanilla with tangerine shower gel not only smells great but it leaves your skin feeling well hydrated this product is great for everyone.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my mother and she loves it. The smell is so inviting and it really softens the skin unlike most soaps. I would definitely buy from this brand again.</li>
            <li> Smells pleasant, but it&#x27;s just another body wash. I advise buying based on price rather than fancy scents and extras.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of this shower gel, and frequently pair it with the matching lotion afterwards.  I often shower 2x/day due to mid-day workouts and rely on EO shower gel to keep my skin from drying out.  It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin (even kids&#x27;) and has a fantastic light, almost tropical smell. Love it!</li>
            <li> I first fell in love with the body lotion with this same scent - so I decided to give the shower gel a try.  It smells just as amazing, not too coconutty, not too vanilla-y, but just right.  And it lathers well for a natural item and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I have this shower gel to go with the lotion of the same scent, and I really love the coconut vanilla scent with a hint of tangerine.  It is so soothing and lovely to shower with the shower gel.  It is a very natural non-chemically laden formula that is great for my sensitive skin.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This soap smells AMAZING. IT&#x27;s a very nice, uplifting scent. My hubby and I both like the smell and feel of it, and that&#x27;s a rare find. A little pricey but worth it for a good body soap that&#x27;s more on the natural side.</li>
            <li> It lasts and lasts and is nice and soapy!</li>
            <li> I have gotten this product once before and really like the product itself. Nice smell. I ordered another time and was very disappointed in how it arrived. Half the contents had spilled out because the top was not secure. What a disappointment since I really like the product. I would only buy this product from a store again because it is not something I want to get only half of the contents when I purchase it.</li>
            <li> Definitely don&#x27;t smell coconut or vanilla, but I like the tangerine.  It is a nice, clean smelling, low sudsing gel and is very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> Smells great, makes my skin soft, silky and clean.  The only thing I wish, was that it was a bigger bottle so I could overly lather up in it every day.</li>
            <li> smells very lemony. but my skin isn&#x27;t dry like it was with common store-bought body washes.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel. Wish the pump was a little taller and larger to make it easier to pump onto my scrubber.</li>
            <li> Smell is very unique. Cleanses well and produces good suds.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I was on the hunt for new shower products that won&#x27;t dry out my skin. My skin is very sensitive to heat, the sun, overly fragranced products...pretty much everything. I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser, which I love, but too much of a good thing was drying out my skin. I found EO, ordered the shower gel (as well as a shampoo and conditioner) and I&#x27;m in love! It smells so great...I know it says Coconut and Vanilla with Tangerine, but to me it&#x27;s mostly Tangerine...which I don&#x27;t mind because I still love how it smells. My skin is clearer, no dry spots and EO&#x27;s shower gel even keeps it so hydrated my skin has a nice supple sheen to it. Plus, my boyfriend loves how it smells. ;)</li>
            <li> I have those cool soap dispensers in my new house so I thought I would fill it up with some yummy body wash.  The body wash is fine, but I was disappointed that it did not smell more like coconut.  It only smells like vanilla.</li>
            <li> Hate the little pump top...they need to redesign that thing. Otherwise the contents are excellent and I enjoy showering with the gel. Scent is very pleasant but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I wish the sent would last longer on your body. Also wish it would be sold in refills. But I like it over all</li>
            <li> This smelled weird and made my skin itchy. My family agreed that the scent was off, not as described.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and love how it&#x27;s not harsh on the skin!  I have sensitive skin and could only use dove even tried other natural products like Dr bronners but they all broke me out but not this!</li>
            <li> I really liked this smell a lot, the coconut and vanilla leaves a nice lingering scent on your skin. It doesn&#x27;t foam up a LOT, but it still cleanses well.</li>
            <li> Out of all the shower gel&#x27;s I&#x27;ve purchased (organic ones), this one is far best my favorite. Recommend to all, esp those who really prefer to use organic products.</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell, but tolerated it to the end of the bottle.  I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Please take the time to like this comment, so I know my research and time was helpful! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, can you even pronounce that? It is a more mild form of Sodium LS, however it is still a synthetic foam agent, which is not organic, or does anything good for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You deserve better! Look for formulas with natural cleansers that work with your skin to clean and get rid of germs and bacteria, but that won’t contribute to premature aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please take the time to like this comment, so I know my research and time was helpful! :)</li>
            <li> I got the coconut tangerine for a change from lavender. It really is stronger on the tangerine, not unpleasant but I would have liked more coconut. My daughter came to visit and LOVES the scent, will be ordering her own.</li>
            <li> I am running out and I&#x27;ll have to get more. This is so wonderful wonderful wonderful. Nice to have something so natural so good</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this shower gel, and I also love that the scent doesn&#x27;t linger on my skin. I also love that it&#x27;s paraben-free and does not irritate or dry my sensitive skin. But I do not love how thin the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; is. It&#x27;s more of a wash than a gel, and it takes several pumps to get enough lather to wash unless you use a nylon puff. It&#x27;s also not a very good shaving gel, so you have to have a separate shaving gel unless you want to apply literally handfuls of this &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; to your legs in order to get enough for good razor glide. Very annoying!</li>
            <li> Lasted me forever. Great scent without being overpowering. i will buy this product again</li>
            <li> I love EO products and do not use any other shampoo, conditioner or shower gels.  The scents are amazing and made with real ingredients.  Give them a try, you&#x27;ll be happy that you did!</li>
            <li> I love EO shower gels and I was so dissappointed when they discontinued the Lemon Verbena. Anyway I am trying to find subsitutes that are not overwhelming and this one is very nice, the scents are light and refreshing.Quite enjoyed it!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite shower gels.... the smell is heavenly and it suds up well.  FYI, I&#x27;ve seen this at TJ Maxx for $9.99 for a 32 oz bottle, so it pays to shop around.  However the convenience of Amazon is hard to beat....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great, smells great (not overpowering).... what else can I say?  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> Smells good, came quick, doesn&#x27;t go far. Need to use alot in 1 shower to get sudsing/lather. For the price, in my opinion, not worth it. Shipped fast and was what I ordered. Having not used it before I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. Won&#x27;t order this soap again, but would order from the vendor again without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Pump was broken on arrival. Had to find a new top for it. Not as moisturizing as I had hoped. I really enjoy the scent, very refreshing.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed... a natural product with a wonderful fragrance and texture.  Good price too.  Thanks to these fellow reviewers for pushing me in the right direction.  EO has other wonderful products as well.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product smells nice and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  Using mainstream shower gels is out of the question for me because many of them cause me to break out into hives, but even many organic or natural body washes have given me rashes when I have tried them.  My dermatologist said that was due to the fact that some of them, strangely enough, contain sugar as an ingredient.  Yeast and other critters love to feed on that sugar residue and it can cause some people to develop rashes.  This body wash does not cause that type of reaction and leaves me feeling and smelling clean without drying out my skin too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus, the container that the wash comes in is sturdy and has a handy pump.  I enjoy using this product and would certainly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Hated this wash - super thin and made my sensitive skin itch. Not a fan.</li>
            <li> Fragrances usually bother me, but not this one.  It is a great shower gel - safe ingredients, non drying, a little goes a long way.  Love it.</li>
            <li> product was broken when i received it and just like my shampoo was the wrong kind... just never had any time to say anything</li>
            <li> Love this natural product shower gel as it has a nice smell and leaves my skin hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li> Smells good, works better.  I have nothing bad to say about this product at all.  I recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> The fragrance would be better described as just Tangerine. I can&#x27;t detect even a hint of vanilla. It&#x27;s a decent moisturizing shower gel, but I find I have to use more than I expect to get a good lather. For the price, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I liked they shipped to Apo/DPO address.  It&#x27;s soft and smells great, I didn&#x27;t like it didn&#x27;t lather much. I had to use 4-5 pumps to get the lather I preferred.</li>
