            <li>/&gt;2 Stars because the soap smells reeeeally good. :)</li>
            <li>but in my own review im not that satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am quite pleased with having found this product and the generous reviews that helped me understand how to use it most effectively.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my skinðŸ˜„</li>
            <li>Maybe it requires more time.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy it again and again :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident that this and the gel will erase my hyper pigmentation.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Overall, great product!</li>
            <li>This worked better than the gel.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend swears that it makes her skin smoother and brighter, said that my mom would love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She hasn&#x27;t asked me to get her more, but she claimed &amp;#34;my</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>i tried this product because i been watching some youtube videos that most of the consumer are well satisfied.</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully on my skin; soften and brighten it instantly.</li>
            <li>Like what you expect with an exfoliating soap, i love how it feels after finishing your shower</li>
            <li>:) use it also with their brightening gel, and you&#x27;ll the result that u want. :)</li>
            <li>I definitely love this product....</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>it has a nice scent, light floral.</li>
            <li>Dries your skin more so than lighten it.</li>
            <li>so I think if I continue to use it, it will even it out even more.  </li>
            <li>btw, I am a male :D</li>
            <li>I love this soap I use it all the time for my underarms</li>
            <li>and I love how it exfoliates your skin</li>
            <li>Gets me nice and squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>so it lasts long and it exfoliates wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I love the smell its so strong, but i dont feel mutual about the results..</li>
            <li>This soap is  excellent for keeping the skin smooth, clean and and clear.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t seen any great change in my skin tone.</li>
            <li>It look more light after i used it for 1 month.</li>
            <li>just used it twice so far, but really happy with it.</li>
            <li>So far, my underarms are noticeably lighter which is great as I have a wedding to attend and a strapless dress to wear.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin brighter and softer and smell isn&#x27;t to strong...</li>
            <li>The Gel worked perfectly fine, but it took some time (about 4 weeks).</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it will clean you face and body from every thing and you will see that your skin is so clean</li>
            <li>the soap bar is huge and ruff on your skin</li>
            <li>and I have to say that not only does it work great in conjunction with the gel to lighten my underarms</li>
            <li>skin is so smooth now&amp;#34; so that could either be motherly appreciation or sincerity.</li>
            <li>my skin is sensitive and this soap feels really good on my skin, it removes a lot of the gunk deodorants leave on your skin.</li>
            <li>, if you want flawless skin, I&#x27;ve started using the black soap...love IT!</li>
            <li>I saw that; right away when I got out of my Shower after scrubbing my Body with this stunning soap.</li>
            <li>When I did use it at first, I noticed my skin was softer and the exfoliator grains in this soap really did a good job on that.  </li>
            <li>I use this before I use the Xtreme Bright Gel for my under arms  once a day and after a month and a half there was SIGNIFICANT change!!  </li>
            <li>so if you are looking for the complete bleaching pack i think trying all the xtreme brite products would have better results( based on the reviews)  however i would still recommend this product to replace the soap you currently use now because it is a good soap!</li>
            <li>i feel so clean</li>
            <li>My skin is clear &amp; I can see new improved cell growth (beautiful skin)</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that it&#x27;s due to this amazing product.</li>
            <li>It really gets you clean. :-)</li>
            <li>I love this soap so much.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I just need to use it more in order to see some real bleaching results.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t brighten my skin like I wanted it to, but the soap is good overall.</li>
            <li>I always feel so fresh and clean everytime</li>
            <li>Also I realize it has helped me maintain a fresh clean feeling all day.  </li>
            <li>I find my skin to be super sore after using this soap for 3days.</li>
            <li>Nice soap in general.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve notice that the couple of times I used it, it  looks brighter and nice, better than other soaps</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy   &amp; think if you have black underarms like me you may want to give this a try it will take time..</li>
            <li>I spent a few weeks searching for a good soap that would actually exfoliate my skin and this soap does the job perfectly :)  </li>
            <li>its very refreshing to my skin, i use it everyday, gets all the dead skin off of my skin, its so wonderful</li>
            <li>I really love this soap, it makes my skin feel and look great, the packing was poor but the soap stood up to the teat.</li>
            <li>but it is still useful to apply on the area to be lightened right before apply the gel.</li>
            <li>Recieved it really fast!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gritty, abrasive, lathers well, smells ok and you can feel it exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product :)</li>
            <li>I bought this after i used up my first tube of x-treme brite gel.</li>
            <li>I first purchased with the gel but the gel was out .</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the clean feeling it gave me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Polish, but tan pretty easily so I do get some pigment such as blemishes.</li>
            <li>I love this product however kind of expensive but well worth it....</li>
            <li>I tried many other expensive exfoliating soaps, but this one works best for me.</li>
            <li>is pure</li>
            <li>I think that if you&#x27;re looking to bleach certain parts of your skin, you may want to pick up the bleaching gel or cream to go with this product rather than using this soap alone.</li>
            <li>Especially those with sensitive skin! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>Good quality, burns a little tiny bit but works good seeing a little difference already</li>
            <li>I have even used it on my face when I felt like I needed a little extra scrub(VERY sparingly) and I didn&#x27;t break out or anything - which is really great.  </li>
            <li>and i havent seen much change</li>
            <li>and it really makes a difference</li>
            <li>It really exfoliates the skin</li>
            <li>It scrubs your skin very well but will not brighten it.</li>
            <li>THANKS XTREME</li>
            <li>I also notice under my arms when I use them I don&#x27;t need deodarant really.</li>
            <li>I like this soap, It really exfoliates well and leaves skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and i was sweating so much while at work.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this soap because it actually does what it says it is for!</li>
            <li>gently b/c</li>
            <li>but this soup is to much for me.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast thought.</li>
            <li>I notice my age spots are getting light but still visual.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin like me and can use it more often,  then this will definitely work for exfoliating and brightening.</li>
            <li>the packaging on the soap states that it has better results with there other products for this line,   </li>
            <li>Pretty pricey.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update my review in a month after using this for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>Simply a squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>However, I would say it is mainly the gel that help, not the soap.</li>
            <li>I use it daily along with the xtreme brite brightening gel, and its working REALLY well!!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to clean skin very well and exfoliate at the same time.</li>
            <li>I went old school and just decided to use real cocoa butter</li>
            <li>I saw an improvement on the darkened skin but it wasn&#x27;t much and didn&#x27;t completely go away.</li>
            <li>the soap bar is pretty big and the shipment came fast so thats y</li>
            <li>Having used this product for the past 4 weeks consistently, I can honestly say that I feel like I have my face back.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the soap the size is large but it was totally a waist of money didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li>I am a light brown skinned black american woman and it makes my skin look golden medium brown.</li>
            <li>My skin became very sensitive to the fragrance,  which wasn&#x27;t overpowering,  </li>
            <li>and it has helped me a lot to clear them up</li>
            <li>my skin is so sensitive...</li>
            <li>So far I like this product.</li>
            <li>Also leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I must say I am surprised.</li>
            <li>Has a soft smell to it, doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>Just a bar of soap with grit to scratch off old skin.</li>
            <li>Since I became sensitive to it, I&#x27;m probably going to try to use it 2x a week or so.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t mush up so far.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>And my skin is soft.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bought it for her, had trouble convincing her to use it, finally got her to use it</li>
            <li>Good soap, still feel it&#x27;s  too expensive.</li>
            <li>my skin became dark while i was pregnant</li>
            <li>it has left them clean and they no longer look dark and patchy.</li>
            <li>I also used it as a facial scrub once a week; it&#x27;s gentle enough to be used on the face.</li>
            <li>This soap helped me clear all of my back acne.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any brightening, I do use it daily in the shower, it is okay as regular soap but its not great..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s rough, and from there do my normal routine.</li>
            <li>It also has helped bring my bikini area back to a normal even color, and it hasn&#x27;t been like this in years (due to ingrown hair</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love the smell and it will clean you face and body from every thing and you will see that your skin is so clean</li>
            <li> the soap bar is huge and ruff on your skin</li>
            <li> and I have to say that not only does it work great in conjunction with the gel to lighten my underarms</li>
            <li> skin is so smooth now&amp;#34; so that could either be motherly appreciation or sincerity.</li>
            <li> my skin is sensitive and this soap feels really good on my skin, it removes a lot of the gunk deodorants leave on your skin.</li>
            <li> , if you want flawless skin, I&#x27;ve started using the black soap...love IT!</li>
            <li> I saw that; right away when I got out of my Shower after scrubbing my Body with this stunning soap.</li>
            <li> When I did use it at first, I noticed my skin was softer and the exfoliator grains in this soap really did a good job on that.  </li>
            <li> I use this before I use the Xtreme Bright Gel for my under arms  once a day and after a month and a half there was SIGNIFICANT change!!  </li>
            <li> so if you are looking for the complete bleaching pack i think trying all the xtreme brite products would have better results( based on the reviews)  however i would still recommend this product to replace the soap you currently use now because it is a good soap!</li>
            <li> i feel so clean</li>
            <li> My skin is clear &amp; I can see new improved cell growth (beautiful skin)</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that it&#x27;s due to this amazing product.</li>
            <li> It really gets you clean. :-)</li>
            <li> I love this soap so much.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I just need to use it more in order to see some real bleaching results.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t brighten my skin like I wanted it to, but the soap is good overall.</li>
            <li> I always feel so fresh and clean everytime</li>
            <li> Also I realize it has helped me maintain a fresh clean feeling all day.  </li>
            <li> I find my skin to be super sore after using this soap for 3days.</li>
            <li> Nice soap in general.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve notice that the couple of times I used it, it  looks brighter and nice, better than other soaps</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy   &amp; think if you have black underarms like me you may want to give this a try it will take time..</li>
            <li> I spent a few weeks searching for a good soap that would actually exfoliate my skin and this soap does the job perfectly :)  </li>
            <li> its very refreshing to my skin, i use it everyday, gets all the dead skin off of my skin, its so wonderful</li>
            <li> I really love this soap, it makes my skin feel and look great, the packing was poor but the soap stood up to the teat.</li>
            <li> but it is still useful to apply on the area to be lightened right before apply the gel.</li>
            <li> Recieved it really fast!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gritty, abrasive, lathers well, smells ok and you can feel it exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> I bought this after i used up my first tube of x-treme brite gel.</li>
            <li> I first purchased with the gel but the gel was out .</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the clean feeling it gave me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Polish, but tan pretty easily so I do get some pigment such as blemishes.</li>
            <li> I love this product however kind of expensive but well worth it....</li>
            <li> I tried many other expensive exfoliating soaps, but this one works best for me.</li>
            <li> is pure</li>
            <li> I think that if you&#x27;re looking to bleach certain parts of your skin, you may want to pick up the bleaching gel or cream to go with this product rather than using this soap alone.</li>
            <li> Especially those with sensitive skin! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Good quality, burns a little tiny bit but works good seeing a little difference already</li>
            <li> I have even used it on my face when I felt like I needed a little extra scrub(VERY sparingly) and I didn&#x27;t break out or anything - which is really great.  </li>
            <li> and i havent seen much change</li>
            <li> and it really makes a difference</li>
            <li> It really exfoliates the skin</li>
            <li> It scrubs your skin very well but will not brighten it.</li>
            <li> THANKS XTREME</li>
            <li> I also notice under my arms when I use them I don&#x27;t need deodarant really.</li>
            <li> I like this soap, It really exfoliates well and leaves skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and i was sweating so much while at work.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this soap because it actually does what it says it is for!</li>
            <li> gently b/c</li>
            <li> but this soup is to much for me.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast thought.</li>
            <li> I notice my age spots are getting light but still visual.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin like me and can use it more often,  then this will definitely work for exfoliating and brightening.</li>
            <li> the packaging on the soap states that it has better results with there other products for this line,   </li>
            <li> Pretty pricey.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update my review in a month after using this for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> Simply a squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> However, I would say it is mainly the gel that help, not the soap.</li>
            <li> I use it daily along with the xtreme brite brightening gel, and its working REALLY well!!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to clean skin very well and exfoliate at the same time.</li>
            <li> I went old school and just decided to use real cocoa butter</li>
            <li> I saw an improvement on the darkened skin but it wasn&#x27;t much and didn&#x27;t completely go away.</li>
            <li> the soap bar is pretty big and the shipment came fast so thats y</li>
            <li> Having used this product for the past 4 weeks consistently, I can honestly say that I feel like I have my face back.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the soap the size is large but it was totally a waist of money didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> I am a light brown skinned black american woman and it makes my skin look golden medium brown.</li>
            <li> My skin became very sensitive to the fragrance,  which wasn&#x27;t overpowering,  </li>
            <li> and it has helped me a lot to clear them up</li>
            <li> my skin is so sensitive...</li>
            <li> So far I like this product.</li>
            <li> Also leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I must say I am surprised.</li>
            <li> Has a soft smell to it, doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Just a bar of soap with grit to scratch off old skin.</li>
            <li> Since I became sensitive to it, I&#x27;m probably going to try to use it 2x a week or so.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mush up so far.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> And my skin is soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bought it for her, had trouble convincing her to use it, finally got her to use it</li>
            <li> Good soap, still feel it&#x27;s  too expensive.</li>
            <li> my skin became dark while i was pregnant</li>
            <li> it has left them clean and they no longer look dark and patchy.</li>
            <li> I also used it as a facial scrub once a week; it&#x27;s gentle enough to be used on the face.</li>
            <li> This soap helped me clear all of my back acne.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any brightening, I do use it daily in the shower, it is okay as regular soap but its not great..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s rough, and from there do my normal routine.</li>
            <li> It also has helped bring my bikini area back to a normal even color, and it hasn&#x27;t been like this in years (due to ingrown hair</li>
            <li> I hate when products have unnecessary fragrances that cause more harm than good.</li>
            <li> Very rough...left my skin red and raw.</li>
            <li> it may work, but it fell apart before I could use it long enough to find out if it did or not.</li>
            <li> the exfoliating parts work really well, but they take some getting use to , they are a little rough.</li>
            <li> I feel that it removes foundation very well which before it use to be hard to remove with a regular soap.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it smells like old potpourri, which I&#x27;m personally not a fan of.</li>
            <li> and the sun will make them darker, if wearing sandals long on a sunny day..</li>
            <li> However, it leaves a strange residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> The particles in the soap are rough enough to use on my legs, knees and elbows and yet not so tough that I can&#x27;t use it on more delicate areas of my body.</li>
            <li> IT SMELLS SO YUMMY AND KEEPS YOU DRY.</li>
            <li> IT KEEPS MY FACE DRY ALL DAY</li>
            <li> but if you have a dry skin try to use Vaseline lotion after that.</li>
            <li> I guess with a dry feeing.</li>
            <li> it worked back in the day, just can&#x27;t buy out store all water down none of that stuff</li>
            <li> Super rough consistency and smelled weird.</li>
            <li> All the soaps I&#x27;ve ever used have dried or left residue on my skin</li>
            <li> big waste of money.</li>
            <li> This soap had lots of small particles in it so if you have sensitive skin, it might be a bit too harsh.</li>
            <li> Not completely clear, because they are very dark, but I&#x27;m sticking with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap to go along with my brightening gel after reading other reviews.</li>
            <li> and I use this every other day in my shower.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that whenever I use this, my skin seems \\&quot;brighter\\&quot; but that just could be due to the exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for the past 8 months and this is my second order..</li>
            <li> but I take other measures to counteract it.  </li>
            <li> I used this soap for 2 weeks, almost every other day and then had to stop.</li>
            <li> This soap makes my skin feel softer then any other soap i have ever used, I have recommended it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Some scrub bits are very rough and scratches your face.</li>
            <li> That is of course a matter of personal taste - but just beware if you are sensitive to fake, floraly smells.  </li>
            <li> I had dark armpits due to my pregnancy and this cleared it up in two weeks.</li>
            <li> It smells weird to me and this soap last long too (if kept out if water when not using) I didn&#x27;t need to buy to gel thing to become white</li>
            <li> not as i expected it&#x27;s a little bit dark even i almost finish it.</li>
            <li> If I go a couple days without using it, my skin looks dull again but it actually works.</li>
            <li> I have dark toes from my shoes...really don&#x27;t like it...</li>
            <li> my toes look find and my toes are dark from corns....</li>
            <li> Work&#x27;s on acne scares dark marks just about anything.</li>
            <li> and it does lighten dark areas.</li>
            <li> I started noticing after a few days when other people in this review said a week.</li>
            <li> again any of these brightening creams...are not for black folk...</li>
            <li> I had an underarm infection which made my underarms terribly black</li>
            <li> and I noticed a slight lightening on my skin.</li>
            <li> Plus, it may lighten your skin slightly.</li>
            <li> I used it with brightening gel for over a month and a half.</li>
            <li> My skin felt less irritated and looks brighter.  </li>
            <li> it lighthens my armpit a little bit.</li>
            <li> but it did make me break out a little bit,</li>
            <li> I noticed a little bit of lightening on the darker parts on my body, like knees and elbows.</li>
            <li> It did help even my skin tone out a little bit,  </li>
            <li> The soup is so abrasive until it feel like little rocks are in it.</li>
            <li> Results are seen after a few days depending on the person.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I used it everyday 2 times a day and didn&#x27;t work out .</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I sometimes use it in the shower and i use almost everyday on my face.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates the skin and dead skin well.</li>
            <li> It gets deep in the skin to remove dead skin without irritating it.</li>
            <li> the least anything becomes permanent and dark...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave behind any residues and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry after I use it.</li>
            <li> Im still testing it so ill get back to yall with my results.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve been using these two products everyday for 3 weeks and nothing!</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy again, not a big deal especially for the price. :(</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Not good on my skin, pimple result</li>
            <li> At least for me it does!</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> but you can&#x27;t go wrong...</li>
            <li> Too expensive, will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> and, I&#x27;m sorry to say,</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money buying this crap</li>
            <li> This soap gave me a really bad rash and made my underarms look worse then</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really mad</li>
            <li> I hate it...</li>
            <li> AS I HATE THE OILY FACE.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> its very refreshing to my skin, i use it everyday, gets all the dead skin off of my skin, its so wonderful</li>
            <li> again any of these brightening creams...are not for black folk...I have dark toes from my shoes...really don&#x27;t like it...my toes look find and my toes are dark from corns....and the sun will make them darker, if wearing sandals long on a sunny day..my skin is so sensitive...I hate it...the least anything becomes permanent and dark...I went old school and just decided to use real cocoa butter no results yet, but you can&#x27;t go wrong...think about...it worked back in the day, just can&#x27;t buy out store all water down none of that stuff is pure must order off line, starting with African products, if you want flawless skin, I&#x27;ve started using the black soap...love IT!</li>
            <li> I love the smell its so strong, but i dont feel mutual about the results..havent seen any difference using this product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t take the noxious perfumey odor. Didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Recieved it really fast! Im still testing it so ill get back to yall with my results. I will say ive been using it for 2 weeks and i havent seen much change</li>
            <li> I bought this soap to go along with my brightening gel after reading other reviews. So far I haven&#x27;t seen any great change in my skin tone. It&#x27;s gritty, abrasive, lathers well, smells ok and you can feel it exfoliating. Nice soap in general. It has only been 3 weeks and I use this every other day in my shower. Gets me nice and squeaky clean. Pretty pricey.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update my review in a month after using this for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> So far I like this product. I just started using this soap a week ago and I love the smell!</li>
            <li> Works excellent!!! I had dark armpits due to my pregnancy and this cleared it up in two weeks. Work&#x27;s on acne scares dark marks just about anything. Also leaves my skin soft. Defiantly recommend it.I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my skinðŸ˜„</li>
            <li> This fancy soap is made in France and is probably the best soap I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and it really makes a difference, it makes me feel like I have a youthful glow to my skin now.  All the soaps I&#x27;ve ever used have dried or left residue on my skin but this one makes my skin feel \\&quot;exfoliated\\&quot;  the soap bar is huge and ruff on your skin cause it has some particles in it.  I know people who have been purchasing the \\&quot;Xteme brite\\&quot; products expect to have their skin bleached,and this doesn&#x27;t do it.  the packaging on the soap states that it has better results with there other products for this line,   so if you are looking for the complete bleaching pack i think trying all the xtreme brite products would have better results( based on the reviews)  however i would still recommend this product to replace the soap you currently use now because it is a good soap!</li>
            <li> I like that good good good what for me</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s a nice smelling soap. If it&#x27;s purpose is to simply exfoliate your skin, then it&#x27;s getting the job done. My skin feels smoother after each use. However, if the goal is to lighten the skin then it hasn&#x27;t done that for me in the entire month I have used it. Maybe it requires more time. I use it along with the Xtreme Brite Lightnening Cream (which I don&#x27;t recommend becuase it has not yielded any results either). Too expensive, will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This definitely worked! Results are seen after a few days depending on the person. I started noticing after a few days when other people in this review said a week.</li>
            <li> Hey every one  I saw a video of this product on you tube.. I was very skeptical at first so I tried it. It&#x27;s been a month already  And it&#x27;s amazing!! I have not achieved what I wanted but I will get there with continuos use. I&#x27;m so happy   &amp; think if you have black underarms like me you may want to give this a try it will take time.. I had an underarm infection which made my underarms terribly black I didnt think they will ever be the same but this product has changed my mind. I wish they were sold in bigger qauntities. Good luck</li>
            <li> I love this soap so much.  I have really sensitive skin and I use it on my underarms, my bikini area, and my butt and I have to say that not only does it work great in conjunction with the gel to lighten my underarms but it&#x27;s stopped all of my ingrown hairs. I haven&#x27;t had an ingrown hair in months and I can honestly say that it&#x27;s due to this amazing product. Nothing else has ever worked like this before for me (not chemical or regular exfoliators). It also has helped bring my bikini area back to a normal even color, and it hasn&#x27;t been like this in years (due to ingrown hair scars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It truly is a great product and I recommend it to everyone! Especially those with sensitive skin! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> love this soap will buy  again!</li>
            <li> I love it...it makes my skin brighter and softer and smell isn&#x27;t to strong...I&#x27;d buy it again and again :)</li>
            <li> This soap helped me clear all of my back acne. It&#x27;s really exfoliating, It removes the dead skin so I guess it also has a brightening effect. Would buy it again</li>
            <li> I saw this on a youtube video and opt to give it a try along with the cream for under arm discoloration...this bar of soap did nothing and the cream worked a tad bit. I will be ordering another tube and review the over all treatment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap since! Its a great exfoliating soap! I always feel so fresh and clean everytime i use it. The brightening effect is a bonus!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and I like the exfoliating qualities of it.  I have noticed a difference in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap in conjunction with the gel and I must say I am surprised. I&#x27;ve struggled with hyper pigmented armpits for yrs and finally something that works. I has a nice scent, doesn&#x27;t burn and after using it for just 2 weeks I saw results. Not completely clear, because they are very dark, but I&#x27;m sticking with this product. I&#x27;m confident that this and the gel will erase my hyper pigmentation.</li>
            <li> okay so i bought this cuz i got the Xtreme Brite Gel. and i&#x27;ve been using these two products everyday for 3 weeks and nothing! Neither product does anything for me. maybe i should use it longer. but i dont think i will repurchase again. the soap bar is pretty big and the shipment came fast so thats y it got 2 stars.</li>
            <li> IT SMELLS SO YUMMY AND KEEPS YOU DRY. YOU MAY NEED LOTION AFTER USING THIS SOAP IT KEEPS MY FACE DRY ALL DAY AS I HATE THE OILY FACE.</li>
            <li> I spent a few weeks searching for a good soap that would actually exfoliate my skin and this soap does the job perfectly :)  The particles in the soap are rough enough to use on my legs, knees and elbows and yet not so tough that I can&#x27;t use it on more delicate areas of my body. It doesn&#x27;t leave behind any residues and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry after I use it. I have even used it on my face when I felt like I needed a little extra scrub(VERY sparingly) and I didn&#x27;t break out or anything - which is really great.  I have also been using it on my underarms, thinking that maybe it&#x27;ll help lighten some discoloring. I&#x27;ve been using this soap daily for about a month now and, I&#x27;m sorry to say, I haven&#x27;t seen any results in that respect. I think that if you&#x27;re looking to bleach certain parts of your skin, you may want to pick up the bleaching gel or cream to go with this product rather than using this soap alone. I have noticed that whenever I use this, my skin seems \\&quot;brighter\\&quot; but that just could be due to the exfoliating. Maybe I just need to use it more in order to see some real bleaching results.  My only complaint is that it smells like old potpourri, which I&#x27;m personally not a fan of. That is of course a matter of personal taste - but just beware if you are sensitive to fake, floraly smells.  Overall, great product! I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> This worked better than the gel. It lasts a longggg time. I saw an improvement on the darkened skin but it wasn&#x27;t much and didn&#x27;t completely go away.</li>
            <li> Not good on my skin, pimple result</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom at the behest of my girlfriend.  My girlfriend swears that it makes her skin smoother and brighter, said that my mom would love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought it for her, had trouble convincing her to use it, finally got her to use it and she said the same thing.  She hasn&#x27;t asked me to get her more, but she claimed &amp;#34;my skin is so smooth now&amp;#34; so that could either be motherly appreciation or sincerity.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work out for me.  I used it everyday 2 times a day and didn&#x27;t work out . Just a regular bar of soup.</li>
            <li> This soap actually works (: it made me white but you have to stay out of the sun. It smells weird to me and this soap last long too (if kept out if water when not using) I didn&#x27;t need to buy to gel thing to become white it worked just how it was. The only bad thing is that it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> I really love this soap, it makes my skin feel and look great, the packing was poor but the soap stood up to the teat.</li>
            <li> This bar is great!  It really exfoliates the skin and I noticed a slight lightening on my skin. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to clean skin very well and exfoliate at the same time. Plus, it may lighten your skin slightly.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it will clean you face and body from every thing and you will see that your skin is so clean but if you have a dry skin try to use Vaseline lotion after that.</li>
            <li> dont buy it&lt;br /&gt;I saw this on a youtube video and want to give it a try but Didn&#x27;t work. At all. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for the past 8 months and this is my second order.. my skin is sensitive and this soap feels really good on my skin, it removes a lot of the gunk deodorants leave on your skin. It gets deep in the skin to remove dead skin without irritating it. Has a soft smell to it, doesn&#x27;t bother me. I would recommend it. I tried many other expensive exfoliating soaps, but this one works best for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any brightening, I do use it daily in the shower, it is okay as regular soap but its not great..</li>
            <li> Great exfoliant soap except it leaves your skin I guess with a dry feeing. I think everyone else is saying it leaves a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34;.  It scrubs your skin very well but will not brighten it. I use this before I use the Xtreme Bright Gel for my under arms  once a day and after a month and a half there was SIGNIFICANT change!!  I love this product!</li>
            <li> it work well for my  skin.It look more light after i used it for 1 month. but i just used it at night time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Big bar of soap so it lasts long and it exfoliates wonderfully. Didn&#x27;t brighten my skin like I wanted it to, but the soap is good overall. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Good quality, burns a little tiny bit but works good seeing a little difference already</li>
            <li> In my opinion it&#x27;s like a great smelling bar of soap. It really gets you clean. :-) Although it smells great, I probably won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This soap is  excellent for keeping the skin smooth, clean and and clear. if you have areas on your body that are discolored, constant use of this soap in that area will aid in clearing up, it might be all you may need.</li>
            <li> Start using about a week now. Already see improvement</li>
            <li> This soap along with the xtreme brite cream has worked wonders for me, I now have an even tone complextion in my face and neck. I&#x27;M very happy with this combination. THANKS XTREME BRITE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  lkm57@sbcglobal.net</li>
            <li> work great did what i need it to do</li>
            <li> Idk maybe it&#x27;s just me but I see no difference</li>
            <li> Very rough...left my skin red and raw.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about lightening the skin..but I use this combined with the gel and it does lighten dark areas. I also notice under my arms when I use them I don&#x27;t need deodarant really.</li>
            <li> i tried this product because i been watching some youtube videos that most of the consumer are well satisfied. in my case i rate this as 3 stars becaus it lighthens my armpit a little bit. not as i expected it&#x27;s a little bit dark even i almost finish it. maybe its just my skin but in my own review im not that satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works good as an exfoliant but doesn&#x27;t work as skin lightener. I used it with brightening gel for over a month and a half. Some scrub bits are very rough and scratches your face.</li>
            <li> Good as an exfoliator for under arms. I also used it as a facial scrub once a week; it&#x27;s gentle enough to be used on the face.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using this product in combination with the Xtreme brightening gel, it&#x27;s not absolutely necessary but it is still useful to apply on the area to be lightened right before apply the gel. It exfoliates and smells good. However, it leaves a strange residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> I like this soap, It really exfoliates well and leaves skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;I will definately order this item again. great scent too.</li>
            <li> Yes as it stated on this metallic fuchsia box \\&quot;Xtreme Bright\\&quot;. I saw that; right away when I got out of my Shower after scrubbing my Body with this stunning soap. It works wonderfully on my skin; soften and brighten it instantly.</li>
            <li> It burned the hell out of my under arms. It made them peel and burn like a bitch.</li>
            <li> Like what you expect with an exfoliating soap, i love how it feels after finishing your shower i feel so clean and i think it also help with my acne problem, it didn&#x27;t absolutely stop, but it helped a lot, since dead skin are being removed.. Simply a squeaky clean. :) use it also with their brightening gel, and you&#x27;ll the result that u want. :)</li>
            <li> So I have been using this soap for almost three weeks already and this soap is amazing I use it on my under arms twice a day along with the xtreme brite gel. This soap works so well in exfoliating my underarms... it has left them clean and they no longer look dark and patchy. I definitely love this product.... I also tried it on my face and I&#x27;ve notice that the couple of times I used it, it  looks brighter and nice, better than other soaps I feel that it removes foundation very well which before it use to be hard to remove with a regular soap. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This soap gave me a really bad rash and made my underarms look worse then what it was. I&#x27;m really mad</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It help clarify and brighten skin. Build in loofah exfoliates skin.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the clean feeling it gave me.  My skin felt less irritated and looks brighter.  Also I realize it has helped me maintain a fresh clean feeling all day.  Also, it also helps with the discomfort of sweating episodes.  I&#x27;m sold on this soap.</li>
            <li> I have this item 3 stars because it is a great exfoliating bar that leaves your skin with a very clean feeling after use, BUT I saw no change in skin clearance or an even tone.</li>
            <li> This soap does a wonderful job when it comes to exfoliation. I sometimes use it in the shower and i use almost everyday on my face. Does it brighten?? I dont think so. It smells really good too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap along with the gel.  I did not work for me.  This soap is just too scratchy for my skin...it actually was hurting my skin when I scrubbed with it.  I could not stand it...big waste of money.</li>
            <li> Just a bar of soap with grit to scratch off old skin. Good for exfoliating after a week at the beach.</li>
            <li> See review on the gel.  Having used this product for the past 4 weeks consistently, I can honestly say that I feel like I have my face back.  My husband and co-workers have also noticed the difference.  They have commented that my face is smoother and brighter.  It is a bit drying but I take other measures to counteract it.  I am quite pleased with having found this product and the generous reviews that helped me understand how to use it most effectively.</li>
            <li> Good soap, still feel it&#x27;s  too expensive. Won&#x27;t buy again, not a big deal especially for the price. :(</li>
            <li> Smells great and works good</li>
            <li> this works great! i bought it to lighten my under arms. my skin became dark while i was pregnant and i was using clinical strength deodorant because it was summer and i was sweating so much while at work. the bar lasts awhile, about 2 months. it has a nice scent, light floral. the exfoliating parts work really well, but they take some getting use to , they are a little rough.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money buying this crap</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. At all. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Super rough consistency and smelled weird. Also the cream made my skin darker.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for about a month and it brightens my skin! If I go a couple days without using it, my skin looks dull again but it actually works. It exfoliates the skin and dead skin well. My hubby loves it&#x27;s affect on me. I am a light brown skinned black american woman and it makes my skin look golden medium brown. You will see the difference after only the 1st 2-4 days...Very nice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this along with the bleaching cream for just 3 days and i can already see a difference. No irritation at all.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the soap the size is large but it was totally a waist of money didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> Dries your skin more so than lighten it. Save your money.</li>
            <li> for some reason i have a problem with my underarms they tend to be darker than the rest of my body...i did some research found out it has a lot to do with the deorant we use .... works really good</li>
            <li> I like it, but just as a soap, I have noticed no difference in my skin yet and its been a month</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this.....it may work, but it fell apart before I could use it long enough to find out if it did or not. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I used this soap for 2 weeks, almost every other day and then had to stop. My skin became very sensitive to the fragrance,  which wasn&#x27;t overpowering,  but it did make me break out a little bit, hence, I took off 1 star. When I did use it at first, I noticed my skin was softer and the exfoliator grains in this soap really did a good job on that.  I noticed a little bit of lightening on the darker parts on my body, like knees and elbows. I&#x27;m Polish, but tan pretty easily so I do get some pigment such as blemishes. It did help even my skin tone out a little bit,  so I think if I continue to use it, it will even it out even more.  Since I became sensitive to it, I&#x27;m probably going to try to use it 2x a week or so. I hate when products have unnecessary fragrances that cause more harm than good. If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin like me and can use it more often,  then this will definitely work for exfoliating and brightening.</li>
            <li> I purchased the brightening soap after I saw the awesome results many youtubers had. I use it daily along with the xtreme brite brightening gel, and its working REALLY well!! I would definitely recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> big bar, works well, lathers well. I use with exfoliating cloth and feels great.  doesn&#x27;t mush up so far. just used it twice so far, but really happy with it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this soap because it actually does what it says it is for! The problem with acne these days is that teens are not exfoliating because all of the exfoliating products are named &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; etc. Well they need to cut that out!! ... Anyway, I like to physically rub the soap across my face, gently b/c it&#x27;s rough, and from there do my normal routine. My skin is clear &amp; I can see new improved cell growth (beautiful skin) btw, I am a male :D</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t brighten but great exfoliating.</li>
            <li> This soap makes my skin feel softer then any other soap i have ever used, I have recommended it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> This product helps with lightning and acne too! At least for me it does! Lov it but you need a face lotion after  for  the dryness</li>
            <li> I bought this after i used up my first tube of x-treme brite gel. The Gel worked perfectly fine, but it took some time (about 4 weeks). I thought that by using this soap it might work faster or something...but to be honest it didnÂ´t make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested it by using the soap only under one armpit in combination with the gel. And there was no difference between the armpit without soap + gel and the one WITH soap + gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 Stars because the soap smells reeeeally good. :)</li>
            <li> I love this soap I use it all the time for my underarms and it has helped me a lot to clear them up it has a good smells and I love how it exfoliates your skin</li>
            <li> I find my skin to be super sore after using this soap for 3days. The soup is so abrasive until it feel like little rocks are in it. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but this soup is to much for me.</li>
            <li> This soap had lots of small particles in it so if you have sensitive skin, it might be a bit too harsh. I used this on my underarms and my neck in conjuncture with the gel. So far, my underarms are noticeably lighter which is great as I have a wedding to attend and a strapless dress to wear. However, I would say it is mainly the gel that help, not the soap. Good exfoliation, but I could have just got a scrub from St. Ives and called it a day. Shipping was fast thought.</li>
            <li> this soap does miracles mix this with the xtreme brite gel and you will see some amazing and statisfying results in  no time!!</li>
            <li> I first purchased with the gel but the gel was out . I decided to use by itself. The smell is very pleasant. And my skin is soft.  I notice my age spots are getting light but still visual. I love this product however kind of expensive but well worth it....</li>
