            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;d have to say the fragrence reminds me more of something my great grandmother might use rather than someone in their 40&#x27;s.  </li>

            <li>Love Blue Grass Products and very happy to find a supplier...</li>
            <li>I am so glad to find this on amazon.</li>
            <li>, if your mom/grandma doesn&#x27;t have a lot of arthritis in her hands and is okay with more of an &#x27;elderly&#x27; scent&lt;br /&gt;I wish more fragrances still made dusting powder  :*</li>
            <li>I love those memories as much as I love her.</li>
            <li>if i could give no star i would like to do that better ..</li>
            <li>I love the simplicity of the powder.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Great product, classic smell, very smooth and luxurious...</li>
            <li>This was a easy way to send her favorite fragrance without issue.</li>
            <li>I am glad it is available somewhere.</li>
            <li>Dusting powder is not that easy to find and at $11.98 compared to $38 elsewhere</li>
            <li>Clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is what I remembered, but it is 10x too strong.</li>
            <li>She likes the powder because it&#x27;s not as strong of a smell as the perfume.</li>
            <li>Its a light, clean smell.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is unique and the product luxurious.</li>
            <li>Makes you smell clean, not perfumey.</li>
            <li>SICKENLY SWEET SCENT, NOTHING LIKE THE COLOGNE</li>
            <li>It is clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I took a chance ordering this based on previous reviews and I am so happy I did.</li>
            <li>First smell it in the 50&#x27;s and loved it then, finally found it and am using it again.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;She&#x27;s thrilled with all the Blue Grass</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Always loved Blue Grass bath powder and cologne -- hard to find these days -- am very pleased with the product and the price.</li>
            <li>Sadly, it&#x27;s no longer carried at Department stores.  </li>
            <li>Next time I will order powder with a more feminine fragrance</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not possible to get this any more in Europe</li>
            <li>Love Blue Grass Powder.</li>
            <li>I bought it because of the cost to dust under &#x27;the girls&#x27;, but will likely use it inside my workout shoes to keep them smelling better instead&lt;</li>
            <li>My girlfriend smells just as she did 35 years ago when I married her.</li>
            <li>On a whim I checked with amazon, and sure enough there it was.</li>
            <li>This is a light sweet scent reminiscent of a spring day.  </li>
            <li>She was an ambitious gal and her first perfume was &amp;#34;Blue grass&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>THE FRAGRANCE LASTS A LONG TIME AND MAKES ONE FEEL CLEAN AND FRESH.  </li>
            <li>The dusting powder is very silky feeling that captures the light scent of Blue Grass.  </li>
            <li>SO MUCH ONE DAY</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>No longer carried in store cosmetic departments this product was a real find through Amazon, and at an extremely reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for carrying it.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember how it smells, I just remember how much she likes it.</li>
            <li>It has a nice big puff and the scent is terrific!  </li>
            <li>It was a nice big powder box for about 17 bucks (back in the day I paid around 45).</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Lid fits pretty tightly (which can be good) but takes a bit of muscle to open</li>
            <li>really likes the full size, gift box, powder puff, Elizabeth Arden Blue Grass dusting powder.</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time and has a very distinct smell, so many of today&#x27;s fragrances are carbon copies of each other, not this one.  </li>
            <li>MY LITTLE GRANDDAUGHTERS LOVE THIS POWDER AFTER THEIR BATHS.</li>
            <li>she was not at all willing to help she simply told me</li>
            <li>A little too strong in scent.</li>
            <li>THIS IS A VERY &#x27;HEAVY&#x27; FRAGRANCE, YET LOVELY TO WEAR.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased Blue Grass Bath powder a long time ago and until now had not been able to find it at my local cosmetic counter..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed this fragrance for year and am finding it harder and harder to find.  </li>
            <li>I bought the deodorant and when I saw Amazon also had the dusting powder I couldn&#x27;t order the powder fast enough.  </li>
            <li>I WAS SURPRISED</li>
            <li>Powder feels so soft and silky on my skin.</li>
            <li>That wasn&#x27;t her born name but her professional badge.</li>
            <li>I send this to Scotland where I have an older relative who loves it, as did my mother.&lt;br /&gt;Please</li>
            <li>applicator is too large for the container with strands that are too long.  </li>
            <li>strength of the fragrance isn&#x27;t over-powering - light enough that it&#x27;s not overwhelming</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve worn Blue Grass perfume and cologne for over 4 decades.  The dusting powder is very silky feeling that captures the light scent of Blue Grass.  This is the second one I&#x27;ve ordered and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and will order it again and again.</li>
            <li> I WAS MISSING MY GRANDMOTHER SO MUCH ONE DAY THAT I DECIDED TO ORDER BLUE GRASS WHICH  WAS MY GRANDMOTHER&#x27;S SCENT. IT BRINGS HER BACK TO ME AFTER 50 YEARS..MY LITTLE GRANDDAUGHTERS LOVE THIS POWDER AFTER THEIR BATHS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this lovely fragrance for years.  Sadly, it&#x27;s no longer carried at Department stores.  Only one mail order catalog carries it, and that catalog charges about double the amount as Amazon.  I was very pleased to discover that Amazon carries it and will purchase it there from now on.</li>
            <li> Next time I will order powder with a more feminine fragrance but I love Elizabeth Arden products and you cannot go wrong with any of them. This one has a beautiful large powder puff.</li>
            <li> I have been using this solely and still love it.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of bluegrass dusting powder by Elizabeth Arden.</li>
            <li> Love it, have used i for 60+ years.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this scent and it&#x27;s hard to find.  When you do - it is much more expensive than Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s thrilled with all the Blue Grass products.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you :)</li>
            <li> I have purchased Blue Grass Bath powder a long time ago and until now had not been able to find it at my local cosmetic counter.. I am glad it is available somewhere.</li>
            <li> Love Blue Grass Products and very happy to find a supplier...Powdere exactly&lt;br /&gt;as promised. Smells great and priced well.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> My mother is England really likes the full size, gift box, powder puff, Elizabeth Arden Blue Grass dusting powder. It&#x27;s not possible to get this any more in Europe so you have to ship to a US address and forward it. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I dearly love this dusting powder!  I bought the deodorant and when I saw Amazon also had the dusting powder I couldn&#x27;t order the powder fast enough.  It arrive on time, was well packaged, and the fragrance is wonderful!  Its a light, clean smell.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE this product!  It has a nice big puff and the scent is terrific!  I am so glad to find this on amazon.</li>
            <li> Love Blue Grass Powder. I have been using this powder since college. It is hard to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;find in a store, so I am very pleased to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li> SICKENLY SWEET SCENT, NOTHING LIKE THE COLOGNE I REMEMBER. I LOVED THE FRAGRANCE  I WAS SURPRISED THE PRICE OF $14 WAS VERY LOW, AND I THOUGHT I WOULD TRY IT AGAIN. DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Good amount of powder for the $$$&lt;br /&gt;-The strength of the fragrance isn&#x27;t over-powering - light enough that it&#x27;s not overwhelming&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Puff applicator is too large for the container with strands that are too long.  They tend to hang out of the sides of the container if not perfectly centered when putting the lid back on&lt;br /&gt;-Lid fits pretty tightly (which can be good) but takes a bit of muscle to open&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;d have to say the fragrence reminds me more of something my great grandmother might use rather than someone in their 40&#x27;s.  I bought it because of the cost to dust under &#x27;the girls&#x27;, but will likely use it inside my workout shoes to keep them smelling better instead&lt;br /&gt;Buy it?&lt;br /&gt;-Yes, if your mom/grandma doesn&#x27;t have a lot of arthritis in her hands and is okay with more of an &#x27;elderly&#x27; scent&lt;br /&gt;I wish more fragrances still made dusting powder  :*(</li>
            <li> My girlfriend smells just as she did 35 years ago when I married her. I love those memories as much as I love her.</li>
            <li> I used this fragrance when I was a teenager and loved it.  I was very happy to find it again and am really enjoying it.</li>
            <li> I send this to Scotland where I have an older relative who loves it, as did my mother.&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t stop making it!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is what I remembered, but it is 10x too strong. It just knocks you down when you open the canister.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Cannot send liquid or flammable products overseas to my mom. This was a easy way to send her favorite fragrance without issue. Smells amazing and is excellent quality.  Will repurchase when she is all out!</li>
            <li> i was told i would get this any where from th 23rd to the 27 on the 27th after not reciving it i called the shipper and was told to bad you can wait till the 4th of next month and if you dont like that you can send it back the person i spoke with was patricia she was not at all willing to help she simply told me i could just wait i will never buy from this seller and if i could give no star i would like to do that better ..</li>
            <li> A little too strong in scent.</li>
            <li> Ah, once a Blue Grass fan, always a fan.  Lightly scented and excellent quality powder.  Makes you smell clean, not perfumey.</li>
            <li> No longer carried in store cosmetic departments this product was a real find through Amazon, and at an extremely reasonable price.  It made the perfect Christmas gift for a long-time user who had given up trying to find it!  The fragrance is unique and the product luxurious.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Dusting powder is not that easy to find and at $11.98 compared to $38 elsewhere I&#x27;ll keep coming back.</li>
            <li> dusting powder is hard to find but this one is rather stale smelling. I probably would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I love the simplicity of the powder.  It is clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Have been using this fragrance for over 40 years. Powder feels so soft and silky on my skin. Love it.</li>
            <li> Great gift and the recipient loved it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this fragrance for year and am finding it harder and harder to find.  Thanks for carrying it.  It is a wonderful summer fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Lois Mc.</li>
            <li> The recipient of this gift was ecstatic... item is not easy to find.</li>
            <li> First smell it in the 50&#x27;s and loved it then, finally found it and am using it again.  Lasts a long time and has a very distinct smell, so many of today&#x27;s fragrances are carbon copies of each other, not this one.  Clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my grandma. She likes the powder because it&#x27;s not as strong of a smell as the perfume. I used to get it for her every year for Christmas, but then I couldn&#x27;t find it in the department stores anymore. On a whim I checked with amazon, and sure enough there it was. I can&#x27;t remember how it smells, I just remember how much she likes it. I think it&#x27;s a good value for the price. It was a nice big powder box for about 17 bucks (back in the day I paid around 45).</li>
            <li> THIS IS A VERY &#x27;HEAVY&#x27; FRAGRANCE, YET LOVELY TO WEAR.  THE FRAGRANCE LASTS A LONG TIME AND MAKES ONE FEEL CLEAN AND FRESH.  FOR ANYONE WHO HAS A &#x27;WHAT TO BUY HER&#x27; PROBLEM, HERE IT IS. PROBLEM SOLVED!</li>
            <li> This is a light sweet scent reminiscent of a spring day.  The powder is smooth and perfect for maintaining a fresh feeling over the course of the day.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely scented powder and the best price I was able to find anywhere. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this scent! Reminds me of a time gone by, a simpler time. I&#x27;m often complimented on this fragrance...only one I purchase.</li>
            <li> My mother is always asking for scented body powder for Christmas or her birthday. I took a chance ordering this based on previous reviews and I am so happy I did. The scent is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Recieved my talc today..I was doing research on the late Miss Elizabeth Arden. That wasn&#x27;t her born name but her professional badge. She was an ambitious gal and her first perfume was &amp;#34;Blue grass&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. It is very hard to find now...but not with amazon. Great product, classic smell, very smooth and luxurious...you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Always loved Blue Grass bath powder and cologne -- hard to find these days -- am very pleased with the product and the price.</li>
