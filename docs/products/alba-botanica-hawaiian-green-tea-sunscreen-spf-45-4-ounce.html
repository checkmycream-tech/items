            <li>Worked better than Hawaiian Tropic 70 block!</li>
            <li>It smells great, applies easily, and protects us all quite nicely.</li>
            <li>Amazon price is great which is fantastic!   :)</li>
            <li>Kind of pricey.  </li>
            <li>No, not because I don&#x27;t like the stuff, or it wasn&#x27;t effective, but because the ingredients are now in question.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t burn, I tan evenly, and it feels nice going on.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen has a good spf level, smells nice, and goes on easily.</li>
            <li>Hence the search for better sunscreen that is effective and an attempt for lower toxicity.  </li>
            <li>Really great cream; light and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I have many allergies and with this one I get protection</li>
            <li>Not terrible.</li>
            <li>and I love this stuff, you have to reapply it</li>
            <li>PABA free!</li>
            <li>then I use this alba botanica spf 45:)</li>
            <li>and I love how moisturizing it is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan! :)</li>
            <li>so I can keep one at home and keep one in the car since it&#x27;s now my favorite type of sunscreen.</li>
            <li>and I was more than pleased.</li>
            <li>As my skin is on the oily side, I prefer a product that is more on the creamy side.  </li>
            <li>I have been tanning for many many years (know one has to now how many).</li>
            <li>I do reapply throughout the day; if not, I am sure I would burn.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The sunscreen itself acts as a better moisturizer than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I love the smell as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought it many times now, but it isn&#x27;t easy to find in retail stores.  </li>
            <li>This is the best chemical free moisturizer everyone should be using especially now that the summer months are here.</li>
            <li>I will be buying one of the others that we tried again in the future, but this is still a very good sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Among the many, octocrylene produces free radicals and homosalate is a hormone disrupter which forms toxic metabolites.</li>
            <li>No problem sweating it off its not greasy and easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>Easy for my kids to apply on the go.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best sunscreen I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Is it as easy to apply and light as the sunscreens with chemicals I no longer put on mine or my families body...  </li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it&#x27;s super affordable.</li>
            <li>stuff has a pleasant scent but like most sunscreens it applies as a visible white cream.</li>
            <li>and I am worry free concerning allergies.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Goes on clear, which is good.  </li>
            <li>Lots of good natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>This is a great sunscreen that used to carry a top rating by EWG (Enviormental Working Group), I think over the last two years there have been changes to the formulation and it carries a much higher toxicity rating (6) on a 1 -10 scale.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a redhead I burn super easily</li>
            <li>It moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, and the scent is nice but soft and fades quickly, which I like.</li>
            <li>Great lotion, doesn&#x27;t have the overly oily feel of other brands.</li>
            <li>It applies well and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective and does the job in terms of providing broad spectrum UVA/UVB protection.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but worth not putting a bunch of mild toxins on your body 3 times a day while at the beach.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>: First I use a serum by avalon organics, then I put on Era organics &amp;#34;Complete&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I first chanced upon this when a colleague donated a spare tube to a clothing &amp; household exchange at work.</li>
            <li>I just love the scent and texture of this sunscreen, and it&#x27;s the only one that I consistently use on my face.  </li>
            <li>daughter is a cancer survivor, having gone through this experience makes gives me a broader perspective than I had in the past about what is effective and what is enviormentally and biologically friendly; I consider efficacy and toxicity in balance...</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen every summer for a few years now, and we love it!</li>
            <li>It works fine if you have the patience to smooth it on until it disappears which takes a little bit of time.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this sunscreen entirely because on the ingredients list that amazon provided (which they have since changed to reflect the accurate ingredients).</li>
            <li>This product is really oily.  </li>
            <li>I wanted all natural chemical free protection for him, but also didn&#x27;t want the zinc whitening issues you find in other chemical free products.</li>
            <li>easy to rub in, a dab goes a long way</li>
            <li>I love this brand, I think it goes on much easier than other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Smells better than other sunscreens too.</li>
            <li>There are many natural ingredients inside which make one feel safer, but really there are many less expensive varieties if your key concern is a good EWG</li>
            <li>I was instantly taken with the non-chemical smell (reminds me of lemon verbena) and how it gives you good coverage without feeling too heavy.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for use on face arms and hands.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like using sunscreen often, but I will apply it when I&#x27;m on a very long bike ride or will be outside for more than four hours straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>How can you call this product NATURAL!  </li>
            <li>This will be a frequent purchase for me.</li>
            <li>It contains natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural sunscreen for months.</li>
            <li>like that it includes organic certified natural plant extracts, but that doesn&#x27;t make it \\&quot;natural\\&quot;</li>
            <li>; could I put green tea in cool whip and call it \\&quot;natural\\&quot;?</li>
            <li>We hit on the efficacy, and the stuff feels luxurious, but the new formulation (which I didn&#x27;t check prior to ordering) brought it way up on the toxicity list...</li>

            <li> like that it includes organic certified natural plant extracts, but that doesn&#x27;t make it \\&quot;natural\\&quot;</li>

            <li> Isn&#x27;t full of nasty ingredients like many other sunscreens are, and isn&#x27;t tested on animals.</li>
            <li> But, in every other regard, it&#x27;s like everything else on the market--greasy, feels a little chalky, goes on streaky white,</li>
            <li> For the price, I like it--but it&#x27;s certainly not the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sunscreen I was looking for.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have used this body sunscreen since 4 years ago and I will not change it for any other.</li>
            <li> we want to protect her skin enough that she does develop secondary cancers which she is now prone to do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Worked swimming in a pool for about four hours with reapplication to face and chest about half way through&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sunscreen that you can wear everyday like I do.</li>
            <li> I have used about 30 tubes of this sunscreen over the past 4 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells great&lt;br /&gt;Applies well - thin coat,</li>
            <li> Ridiculous that companies get away with this!  </li>
            <li> Yes, it DOES have some nasty chemicals, but to its credit certainly not as many as other drugstore</li>
            <li> /&gt;Toxicity rating is way up&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients in use are questionable</li>
            <li> has &#x27;nasty synthetic chemicals&#x27;, etc.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent sunscreen moisturizer. I use it after I scrub my face with a facial scrub and apply retin A cream. highly recommend this product for use on face arms and hands.</li>
            <li> I have used this body sunscreen since 4 years ago and I will not change it for any other. I have many allergies and with this one I get protection and I am worry free concerning allergies. Amazon price is great which is fantastic!   :)</li>
            <li> Not terrible. Works.  Water resistant.  Have to use a lot to get coverage.  Goes on clear, which is good.  Kind of pricey.  I bought multiple types of sunscreen to use on our trip in Mexico last week so that we could test them out. I will be buying one of the others that we tried again in the future, but this is still a very good sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using sunscreen often, but I will apply it when I&#x27;m on a very long bike ride or will be outside for more than four hours straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff has a pleasant scent but like most sunscreens it applies as a visible white cream.</li>
            <li> Love it! Love that it&#x27;s natural. I&#x27;m a redhead I burn super easily and I love this stuff, you have to reapply it but obviously that&#x27;s with any sunscreen</li>
            <li> I wear it when I&#x27;m going to be outside for a while, and it works well.  It moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, and the scent is nice but soft and fades quickly, which I like.</li>
            <li> have used this product for about five years now.  does great job of blocking sun rays and has a wonderful aroma to it.</li>
            <li> Works well, easy to apply and smells great!  No burning!</li>
            <li> It does what its suppose to do protect my skin from the sun. No problem sweating it off its not greasy and easy to wash off. PABA free!</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen that used to carry a top rating by EWG (Enviormental Working Group), I think over the last two years there have been changes to the formulation and it carries a much higher toxicity rating (6) on a 1 -10 scale.

Hence the search for better sunscreen that is effective and an attempt for lower toxicity.  We hit on the efficacy, and the stuff feels luxurious, but the new formulation (which I didn&#x27;t check prior to ordering) brought it way up on the toxicity list...so we won&#x27;t order again next year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Effective&lt;br /&gt;Luxurious feeling&lt;br /&gt;Smells great&lt;br /&gt;Applies well - thin coat, easy to rub in, a dab goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;Worked swimming in a pool for about four hours with reapplication to face and chest about half way through&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Toxicity rating is way up&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients in use are questionable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy again? No, not because I don&#x27;t like the stuff, or it wasn&#x27;t effective, but because the ingredients are now in question.</li>

            <li> This is the best chemical free moisturizer everyone should be using especially now that the summer months are here. My morning routine: First I use a serum by avalon organics, then I put on Era organics &amp;#34;Complete&amp;#34; moisturizer,  then I use this alba botanica spf 45:)</li>
            <li> This product smells AMAZING! I have been using it for about a week and I love how moisturizing it is.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is amazing! It applies well and absorbs quickly. A little goes a long way. It contains natural ingredients. It&#x27;s effective and does the job in terms of providing broad spectrum UVA/UVB protection. It smells wonderful. I also love the fact that it&#x27;s super affordable. I&#x27;m a fan! :)</li>
            <li> Are you kidding me?!?!?  How can you call this product NATURAL!  Ridiculous that companies get away with this!  Just look at the ingredients!</li>
            <li> I first chanced upon this when a colleague donated a spare tube to a clothing &amp; household exchange at work. I was instantly taken with the non-chemical smell (reminds me of lemon verbena) and how it gives you good coverage without feeling too heavy. I got two so I can keep one at home and keep one in the car since it&#x27;s now my favorite type of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Really great cream; light and easy to apply. I will stock up on it for the next vacation and summer</li>
            <li> Great stuff. It&#x27;s pricey but worth not putting a bunch of mild toxins on your body 3 times a day while at the beach.</li>
            <li> I think I am on my third tube of this sunscreen.  It works fine if you have the patience to smooth it on until it disappears which takes a little bit of time.  The granddaughters all used it while we were in Hawaii and it prevented sunburns.</li>
            <li> I love this brand, I think it goes on much easier than other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Is it as easy to apply and light as the sunscreens with chemicals I no longer put on mine or my families body...  No but for a healthy alternative it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth.Easy for my kids to apply on the go. Smells nice. Lots of good natural ingredients. Great price for it.</li>
            <li> smells great, spread nicely and works</li>
            <li> Great lotion, doesn&#x27;t have the overly oily feel of other brands. Smells better than other sunscreens too.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. Sunscreen smells like tea. It&#x27;s not too cakey or gooey.</li>
            <li> Great smell and feel.  Great protection</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural sunscreen for months. I ordered this based on the reviews and I was more than pleased. It goes on like a light lotion and it smells wonderful. It&#x27;s a sunscreen that you can wear everyday like I do.</li>
            <li> Seems to work satisfactorily.  This product is really oily.  As my skin is on the oily side, I prefer a product that is more on the creamy side.  Also, it seems to separate in the tube requiring remixing before applying.  I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for many many years (know one has to now how many). This is hands down the best sunscreen I have ever used! I don&#x27;t burn, I tan evenly, and it feels nice going on. Easy to wash off and the smell is wonderful!! I do reapply throughout the day; if not, I am sure I would burn. I also ordered the face sunscreen and the kids&#x27;s spray sunscreen from Alba, can&#x27;t wait to get them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sunscreen entirely because on the ingredients list that amazon provided (which they have since changed to reflect the accurate ingredients). When I received the product, I noticed that the actual ingredients are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10% Homosalate&lt;br /&gt;10% Octocrylene&lt;br /&gt;7.5% Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate&lt;br /&gt;5% Ethylhexyl Salicylate&lt;br /&gt;2% Titatium Dioxide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Hexadecene Copolymer, Caprylic Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Hydrogenated Palm Kemel Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Calendula Officinali Flower Extract, Camelia Sinensis Leaf Etract, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract,Ginkgo Biloba Leaf Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia Leaf Etract, Cetearyl Olivate, Polysorbate 60, Silica, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Sorbitan Olivate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citronellol, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Limonene, Lialool, Fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it includes organic certified natural plant extracts, but that doesn&#x27;t make it \\&quot;natural\\&quot;; could I put green tea in cool whip and call it \\&quot;natural\\&quot;? Nope. So why call something loaded with synthetic compounds \\&quot;natural\\&quot;? Among the many, octocrylene produces free radicals and homosalate is a hormone disrupter which forms toxic metabolites. Yes, it DOES have some nasty chemicals, but to its credit certainly not as many as other drugstore brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen itself acts as a better moisturizer than others I&#x27;ve tried. But, in every other regard, it&#x27;s like everything else on the market--greasy, feels a little chalky, goes on streaky white,has &#x27;nasty synthetic chemicals&#x27;, etc. If you have oily skin, you might want to use something else on your face. For the price, I like it--but it&#x27;s certainly not the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sunscreen I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen for my son who went to Hawaii at the end of July.  I wanted all natural chemical free protection for him, but also didn&#x27;t want the zinc whitening issues you find in other chemical free products. He went snorkeling, hiking, swimming etc.. And never got burned.  Great price, Great product!</li>
            <li> Worked better than Hawaiian Tropic 70 block!</li>
            <li> Great long-lasting protection</li>
            <li> I have used about 30 tubes of this sunscreen over the past 4 years. Highly recommend. It is the only sunscreen that I have found that lasts all day and does not rub off. Living in Florida I need maximum protection and I have never once been burned wearing this sunscreen. Sprays just don&#x27;t work for me. I love the smell as well.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen every summer for a few years now, and we love it! It smells great, applies easily, and protects us all quite nicely. Get some!</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! IT WEARS SO WELL UNDER MAKEUP</li>
            <li> I just love the scent and texture of this sunscreen, and it&#x27;s the only one that I consistently use on my face.  I&#x27;ve bought it many times now, but it isn&#x27;t easy to find in retail stores.  I&#x27;m glad to find it here on Amazon.</li>
