    <ol>
            <li>AND THEY ARE PERFECT;</li>
            <li>more like 9x !!!  </li>
            <li>Good quality and perfect for needs</li>
            <li>Get a good shower going, and the mirror fogs up in record time.  </li>
            <li>I would imagine a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; product would have been nice.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;mirror&amp;#34; is not glass, probably some kind of plastic.  </li>
            <li>I have had many fog-free mirrors.  </li>
            <li>Have used others that were a better mirror.</li>
            <li>Truly NOT a fog free mirror.</li>
            <li>the only good thing about this mirror is the suction cups.</li>
            <li>Yeah, it was 10$, and it&#x27;s true that you get what you pay for, but you know what?</li>
            <li>Hope seller makes it right and sends me a TRUE fog-free mirror that genuinely works.</li>
            <li>And now I see that this thing wouldn&#x27;t be worth</li>
            <li>Worth trying another option.</li>
            <li>you have to have your face right on the mirror</li>
            <li>So, yeah, it mounts in your bathroom with the suction cups, and once it&#x27;s mounted, it stays put pretty well.  </li>
            <li>or it looks like you are standing by one of those funny distorted amusment park mirrors.</li>
            <li>Fogged up the first time in the shower.</li>
            <li>The first time I pulled the suction cups away from the mirror, one of them came out of its housing, and I wasn&#x27;t able to get it back in.</li>
            <li>It sticks to tile or another mirror very well if you do that.  </li>
            <li>I mounted this on glass blocks in our shower and it is very stable.  </li>
            <li>I attached it to my bathroom mirror ready to check it out.  </li>
            <li>When I had finished, I tried to get the suction cups to release, and the whole glass mirror crashed to the tile floor.  </li>
            <li>but it would cost almost as much in postage as I paid for it.</li>
            <li>Or if this is really what its supposed to look like?  </li>
            <li>it was the only one that was advertised as being 9in, and the recipient of this &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; is a big guy who wanted to be able to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>2/2 gifts I got for people have been SO MUCH MORE TROUBLE</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.  </li>
            <li>I give it a passing review, but be careful to clean the surface and wet the suction cups when hanging it.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is far enough from the wall that it very seldom has any trouble with fogging.</li>
            <li>The mirror is not flat and causes distortions that prevent it from being used as a shaving mirror.</li>

            <li> Mirror is a waste of your money.  </li>
            <li> So now I just gave someone a completely worthless gift that they were really excited to have gotten.</li>
            <li> An ordinary product that purpose may be faulty.  </li>
            <li> Splash some water on it, and you can see yourself for half a minute, but overall, this is a disappointment.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The item was what I was looking for, the problem was once I took it out of the packaging I realized the mirror caused anyone looking into it, distorted.</li>
            <li> The mirror met my expectations.  I give it a passing review, but be careful to clean the surface and wet the suction cups when hanging it.  It sticks to tile or another mirror very well if you do that.  If not...  ...it will take an unwelcome fall.</li>
            <li> I mounted this on glass blocks in our shower and it is very stable.  The mirror is far enough from the wall that it very seldom has any trouble with fogging.</li>
            <li> returning! mirror distorted!</li>
            <li> So, yeah, it mounts in your bathroom with the suction cups, and once it&#x27;s mounted, it stays put pretty well.  Unfortunately, it has so far never actually been \\&quot;fogless.\\&quot;  Get a good shower going, and the mirror fogs up in record time.  Splash some water on it, and you can see yourself for half a minute, but overall, this is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> This is the worst waste of money I have ever had. the only good thing about this mirror is the suction cups. 3x magnification??? more like 9x !!!  you have to have your face right on the mirror or it looks like you are standing by one of those funny distorted amusment park mirrors. &lt;br /&gt;My suggestion would be not to waste your money on it. its a joke.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment! The mirror was not attached to the base. The base had an impact mark. I took the mirror out of the package and right away it slipped off the base. There were finger prints on the mirror as if it had been sold before. I instantly sent it back!</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror to replace one I had for 8 years.  It came with 3 suction cups on the back.  I attached it to my bathroom mirror ready to check it out.  When I had finished, I tried to get the suction cups to release, and the whole glass mirror crashed to the tile floor.  The frame was still stuck, and the suction cups were too, but the mirror was in pieces on the floor.  If you buy this product, don&#x27;t use all the suction cups.  One will do.  I would send it back but it would cost almost as much in postage as I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I HAVE A 10X MAGNIFYING AND A 5X MAGNIFYING MIRROR WITH SUCTION CUPS BY ANOTHER MANUFACTURER AND THEY ARE PERFECT; BUT I NEED A 3X MAGNIFYING MIRROR SO I PURCHASED THIS ONE.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.  THIS IS USELESS AND EXTREMELY DISTORTED.  I WILL HAVE TO SEND IT BACK OR THROW IT OUT.  DO NOT PURCHASE A JERDON MIRROR.  YOU DO NOT EVEN LOOK LIKE YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR; THAT IS HOW DISTORTED IT IS.  I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE I PURCHASED THIS ONE.</li>
            <li> The diameter is actually 7 inches with a 2 inch border to make it the advertised 9 nine inches. The mirror fogs up as soon as steam develops in the shower. It took too long to arrive, and it turned out to be worthless. I am disgusted with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This thing should get 0 stars. DO NOT BUY THIS MIRROR. I am still trying to figure out why I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone else said, the glass is all distorted and looks like a funhouse mirror unless your 1 centimeter away from the stupid thing.  I got it for someone as a gift, and through the packaging I couldn&#x27;t notice how warped of a reflection it causes. So now I just gave someone a completely worthless gift that they were really excited to have gotten. I look like a freakin idiot, and this thing is not worth the postage to return it. I can&#x27;t tell if its damaged? Or if this is really what its supposed to look like?  I had another item mixed in with this shipment that was completed shattered and destroyed, and I was back and forth with Amazon for three days over it. Now I have someone telling me they can&#x27;t even make out their reflection in THIS. What the f* is with all this crap?  I&#x27;m at my wits end over this. If I had only gotten this mirror, I&#x27;d still be mad but not this mad. 2/2 gifts I got for people have been SO MUCH MORE TROUBLE THAN THEY ARE WORTTHH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel stupid giving someone a gift that was this bad, and they feel bad having to tell me how bad it is... I feel terrible that someone had to be put in that position. --- like this is ridiculous. Yeah, it was 10$, and it&#x27;s true that you get what you pay for, but you know what? I still paid for it. And now I see that this thing wouldn&#x27;t be worth STEALING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this mirror bc it was the only one that was advertised as being 9in, and the recipient of this &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; is a big guy who wanted to be able to shave in the shower. Another reviewer said this was actually 7inch with a 2 inch frame, and she/he is correct. So that  was actually disappointment #1.  The fact that the thing is worthless was disappointment #2.  Disappointment #3 is the fact that it isn&#x27;t worth returning and I just lost out on $10. I basically dropped $10 on the sidewalk, and had someone else pick it up and keep it.3 disappointments &#x3D; extremely dissatisfied customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do what I was too lazy to do and go to Bed Bath and Beyond and get yourself a real mirror for $20. Sometimes cutting corners wastes money instead of saving it, and seriously take all the 1 and 2 star reviews to heart bc this mirror really is terrible.</li>
            <li> This mirror defiantly reminds me of a amusement park mirror. Its hard to use with a very small focal point. Poor suction also,its been up for 15 minuets and 1 cup has let go. Amazon should be ashamed to sell such junk.</li>
            <li> The mirror is not flat and causes distortions that prevent it from being used as a shaving mirror. I had to open the plastic container to see the quality of the mirror. Now, I don&#x27;t know if the seller will allow a return/refund.</li>
            <li> Mirror is a waste of your money.  I have had many fog-free mirrors.  Truly NOT a fog free mirror. Fogged up the first time in the shower. Contacted the seller in hopes I received a defective one, but after reading reviews I am thinking this is not a defective product, but rather a scam product that is not as advertised.  Hope seller makes it right and sends me a TRUE fog-free mirror that genuinely works.</li>
            <li> I would imagine a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; product would have been nice. However, this was used, broken, and full of water and soap spots.I will be returning this item! This was not what I would have expected from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The first time I pulled the suction cups away from the mirror, one of them came out of its housing, and I wasn&#x27;t able to get it back in. It now has only two suction cups instead of three.</li>
            <li> It does project an image.</li>
            <li> An ordinary product that purpose may be faulty.  shaving in the shower, hard to rinse or keep soaped at the same time. waste h2o, hard to wear contacts or glasses while the h2o runs, do you have enough light without shadows to remove makeup, shave.  after you review these notes , they may impact your decisions .</li>
            <li> Good quality and perfect for needs</li>
            <li> The product had an unremovable streak left from the protective plastic shipping film.  Also, it did not stick well on the wall.</li>
            <li> Mirror does not meet expectations - will be returning it.  Not the products fault - it&#x27;s my mother&#x27;s eyes!!!  We&#x27;ll try again.</li>
            <li> not glass; returned item; refunded as promised.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;mirror&amp;#34; is not glass, probably some kind of plastic.  The distortion makes it impossible to use.  Buy something else.</li>
            <li> Mirror is a bit blurry. Have used others that were a better mirror. Worth trying another option.</li>
