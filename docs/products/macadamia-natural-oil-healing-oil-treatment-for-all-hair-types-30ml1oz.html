            <li>love it soooo much more than Moroccan Oil - it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair like Moroccan Oil does... and Moroccan Oil also seems to create build-up if you use it for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Was nervous buying thru here as I usually buy it from specialty hair store. I am glad I took the chance! It is the exact same quality and this is a product I already know and love!!  My hair thrives with it..</li>
            <li> Totally love it. The smell makes me feels fresh and when I apply it to my hair, it makes my hair smooth and silky, not oily as other kinds. The bottle is small and easy for me to carry to work or in business trip.</li>
            <li> the bottle was opened, I really don&#x27;t like that!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very silky without making it oily. Will be buying a larger amount next time. IT also seems to help my hair dry faster when i blow dry it.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser had given me a sample and I loved the product. What I received in the mail does not seem to be quite the same product. I applied more and the results were not as good.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair oil. I&#x27;ve tried other brands but always come back to this. It isn&#x27;t too greasy, leave my hair healthier, and lasts me a long time. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Arrived safe and sound and has been great with dealing with long thick hair in hot and humid weather.</li>
            <li> Item came on time but didn&#x27;t like the feeling of this oil.</li>
            <li> I love this product- it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp greasy like Moroccan oil does.</li>
            <li> awesome product, fast delivery ! thank you !</li>
            <li> Its ok, really is too little product to give a proper review. I will however buy the larger size to give it a try as their was no real negatives with the product expect the size. I guess it worth the try.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! The price is amazing and what it does for my hair makes me so happy!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Really great for dry hair. Helps a lot with frizz.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best ! It works well with the shampoo ! Overall I just love how it leaves my hair. It came on time, I just wish the bottle was bigger !</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product. My hair is super poofy but when I use this oil it tames it and makes it super soft.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not too heavy nor greasy. Washes off very easily. It healed my damaged hair and gave it a healthy shine in a very short period of time. It also smells great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Macadamia Oil for almost 4 years. A little bit seriously goes a looooong way. You just need to use a dime size amount. I have pretty long hair so I&#x27;ve been using a little more than that... but you don&#x27;t want to put too much in or it will get oily. So it may seem expensive for such a small bottle but it really isn&#x27;t because you get so many uses out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is amazing. I love it and really hope they don&#x27;t ever change it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it soooo much more than Moroccan Oil - it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair like Moroccan Oil does... and Moroccan Oil also seems to create build-up if you use it for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the 1 item I tell EVERYONE about... and I&#x27;ve never worked for this company, I&#x27;m not a blogger, and don&#x27;t get compensated in any way... it&#x27;s just THAT good.</li>
            <li> Somewhere I picked up a sample of this product and started using it on my damp washed hair. I love the way it smells and I love the manageable results. Amazing stuff! I&#x27;m sold on it! I even joined their Facebook page [...]</li>
            <li> This oil have a soft smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering, but just enough. Its smooth and weightless. Moisturizes very well. I like it.</li>
            <li> I love the product line. Do not be fooled the bottle was too small for the price.</li>
            <li> I used this on my  eyelashes....eyelashes are growing longer and thicker:)</li>
            <li> Excellent. I will buy it again</li>
            <li> is an excellent oil...your hair is going to be smoothie and health</li>
            <li> This is excellent for dry hair; I used it every day and it&#x27;s made a big improvement in the health of my hair.</li>
            <li> Very healing and smells great</li>
