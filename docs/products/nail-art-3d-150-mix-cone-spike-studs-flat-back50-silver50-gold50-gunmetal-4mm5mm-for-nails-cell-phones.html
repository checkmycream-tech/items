            <li>I love doing nails.</li>
            <li>So when I did my sister&#x27;s nail and put a spike accent, she got so many compliments.</li>
            <li>Super cute !</li>
            <li>that they came in three different colors and the best part that they are really cheap</li>
            <li>spikes on my nails count me in the product is as described and completely amazing and fun to use</li>
            <li>I will just make sure that when I use them, I secure them with nail glue.</li>
            <li>but in reality they are more like pyramids but still super cute</li>
            <li>Easy to us.</li>
            <li>They are deffinetly worth the price!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to order these</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great for fashion but so long they can cut you</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive these</li>
            <li>these are cool</li>
            <li>and wow are they strong... not coming off anytime soon!  </li>
            <li>these are perfect for doing nails very edgy</li>
            <li>They are nice, but they are way too big for nail decorations.</li>
            <li>They are nice but they are very big and not the size I thought they were which were the mini ones</li>
            <li>I like the style and color.it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Super cute spikes, not sharp at all.</li>
            <li>but if done with the right design, that won&#x27;t matter</li>
            <li>Just the right size for nails and whatever you want to do with it.</li>
            <li>Go them at the time I was supposed to and they look great :) they do however hurt a lil so be careful but other than that, I will definitely purchase more from you</li>
            <li>They are a lot bigger than expected, quality and looks are fine, and they&#x27;re so cheap it doesn&#x27;t really matter, but you would struggle to fit more than 3 or 4 on one nail, the picture made me think they were smaller, and I would have liked to have a row of them on one nail like in the pic, but like I said only 3 or 4 would fit.</li>
            <li>It comes exactly what it is and</li>
            <li>Most likely to order again .</li>
            <li>I love these they definitely aren&#x27;t a rip off!</li>
            <li>Its tiny and cute.  </li>
            <li>Not as big as I was hoping, luckily it wasn&#x27;t to big like most people say!</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>Very pointy.  </li>
            <li>Real metal.  </li>
            <li>These are deffinetly HIGH QUALITY !</li>
            <li>i really like them..</li>
            <li>A bit smaller than expected, but still good.</li>
            <li>they came fast and looked really sharp on my nails and got many compliments</li>
            <li>I got 61 gold, 62 silver, 57 gunmetal, so it was also more than i expected!</li>
            <li>Be aware that majority of the spikes are extremely sharp, i had to file mine down because they could puncture skin, other than that they are great!</li>
            <li>Definitely have to use super glue to keep them on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a normal decent size that I can work with.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any sharp ones yet, but if so its to easy to file it.</li>
            <li>but they are very cool and one or 2 here and there adds a very edgy, fun look!</li>
            <li>The spikes are bigger than I thought, but easy to apply &amp; definitely stand out</li>
            <li>Not just a clear coat</li>
            <li>Feel completely ripped off.</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s a little bigger then what I expected, but they&#x27;re a nice decoration for your nail design.</li>
            <li>lol other than that there&#x27;s nothing wrong with them</li>
    </ol>

            <li> lol other than that there&#x27;s nothing wrong with them</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t stay on long because they are so big</li>
            <li> Sanded an cleaned the flat bottom before glueing on</li>
            <li> And it takes an extremely long time to receive,  sellers states low profit item as the reason...</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t figure out how to pat a pic,  but i was petty enough to count the actual pieces,  and it was less than 150, total i received was 128pcs.</li>
            <li> they came 2 wks earlier than i expected.</li>
            <li> So,  extremely long wait time to received product</li>
            <li> And the came in earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> A little big</li>
            <li> so yeah be careful sometimes</li>
            <li> These arrived within the expected delivery dates.</li>
            <li> and they were just as expected.</li>
            <li> Came just as expected.</li>
            <li> and it take little to long to come to me also, little to big,  </li>
            <li> Maybe a little taller than expected.</li>
            <li> They are a little heavier than I expected</li>
            <li> I guess because I ordered them on a deal of paying $.01 plus $.99 pf shipping, i guess it was not worth their time to fulfill the order????</li>
            <li> Cons: there seems to be less than what was promised 50 of each.</li>
            <li> The shipping took a little bit longer than I though.</li>
            <li> Spikes are to sharp!!</li>
            <li> i paid for&amp;#34; but no these are not cheap quality .</li>
            <li> theyre not cheap at all</li>
            <li> I think I got these at least three weeks before the date it was suppose to come in, they&#x27;re a little sharp</li>
            <li> they are a little small though.</li>
            <li> I wish  that spike little small .</li>
            <li> they are small just like i wanted them to be.</li>
            <li> Brought all 150 , but these weird items counted towards that , making it actually only 144 .</li>
            <li> These studs are heavy!</li>
            <li> To late now</li>
            <li> Only bad thing is that some are unusable because there melted together.</li>
            <li> Oh duh!</li>
            <li> but Thats because I&#x27;m very clumsy</li>
            <li> came on time however it can with some random broken peaces</li>
            <li> BIG..HUGE.. DISAPPOINTMENT.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed.</li>

            <li> I bought these for nail arts and let me tell you I am in love with them! A little big but if done with the right design, that won&#x27;t matter</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed. This item was MUCH smaller than shown in the pictures. These spikes would be the perfect size for Barbie&#x27;s nail. Feel completely ripped off.</li>
            <li> It comes exactly what it is and their mix their realy nice with your Nails design</li>
            <li> I like these spikes, It&#x27;s a little bigger then what I expected, but they&#x27;re a nice decoration for your nail design.</li>
            <li> The shipping took a little bit longer than I though. But I like them</li>
            <li> I love using these on top of my acrylic claws. just superglue and you&#x27;re all set! they are a little small though.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved them. They stick perfectly. They don&#x27;t fall off. Definitely a must have. If you&#x27;re into spikes and studs on your nails, you HAVE to get these!</li>
            <li> They are nice, but they are way too big for nail decorations.They would be perfect for phone designs though.i recommend these to phone decorations only.</li>
            <li> Totally in love with these spikes! I purchased gold, silver, and chrome colored and they are sooooo fab and fierce!</li>
            <li> You get what you get! Be aware that majority of the spikes are extremely sharp, i had to file mine down because they could puncture skin, other than that they are great!</li>
            <li> They are nice but they are very big and not the size I thought they were which were the mini ones</li>
            <li> they came fast and looked really sharp on my nails and got many compliments but they didn&#x27;t stay on long because they are so big</li>
            <li> These are great just like the picture.  But Ebay has them cheeper for a lot more pieces. Will purchase from Ebay in the future</li>
            <li> these are perfect for doing nails very edgy I think I got these at least three weeks before the date it was suppose to come in, they&#x27;re a little sharp so yeah be careful sometimes but Thats because I&#x27;m very clumsy lol other than that there&#x27;s nothing wrong with them</li>

            <li> Jus LUV these!  So awesome!  Very pointy.  Real metal.  Sanded an cleaned the flat bottom before glueing on and wow are they strong... not coming off anytime soon!  Only bad thing is that some are unusable because there melted together.</li>

            <li> They are a lot bigger than expected, quality and looks are fine, and they&#x27;re so cheap it doesn&#x27;t really matter, but you would struggle to fit more than 3 or 4 on one nail, the picture made me think they were smaller, and I would have liked to have a row of them on one nail like in the pic, but like I said only 3 or 4 would fit.</li>
            <li> I love these they definitely aren&#x27;t a rip off! You should definitely choose these if you want skipes. You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> Pro: product is as advertised. Cons: there seems to be less than what was promised 50 of each. Looks like 25 at best -still an guest-a-mation. And it takes an extremely long time to receive,  sellers states low profit item as the reason...*shrugs shoulders*  i am going to try to post a pic of the product.  Update: can&#x27;t figure out how to pat a pic,  but i was petty enough to count the actual pieces,  and it was less than 150, total i received was 128pcs. So,  extremely long wait time to received product and you get cheated. Also some of the spikes are stuck together,  but i still counted then separate,  hopefully they will come apart..who knows. Rating went from 4 to 3...Oh duh! Now i see how to post a pic!!! To late now</li>
            <li> I like the style and color.it is worth the money. I really enjoyed this nail art and it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> Not as big as I was hoping, luckily it wasn&#x27;t to big like most people say! It&#x27;s a normal decent size that I can work with. I haven&#x27;t had any sharp ones yet, but if so its to easy to file it. A nice variety of the colors as well. Overall a great by and will buy again!</li>
            <li> I think that for the amount of money that these cost you could get a better deal elsewhere I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the amount that I received and I wish I would&#x27;ve kept looking</li>
            <li> The spikes are bigger than I thought, but easy to apply &amp; definitely stand out</li>
            <li> Super cute ! Brought all 150 , but these weird items counted towards that , making it actually only 144 .</li>
            <li> They are the perfect size. (I was worried from the picture they look bigger) I can&#x27;t wait to get my nails done again!</li>
            <li> These are deffinetly HIGH QUALITY ! I thought i was going to get &amp;#34;what i paid for&amp;#34; but no these are not cheap quality . They are deffinetly worth the price!</li>
            <li> These are not what i thought, I thought they would be like the picture but in reality they are more like pyramids but still super cute</li>
            <li> spike is ok and nice  and it take little to long to come to me also, little to big,  but I like it . I wish  that spike little small . it would more nicer.</li>
            <li> I sent the seller a message to see what was going on with my item. Asked if i was ever going to receive it. All i got as a response was that I would get a refund. No mention about it being shipped at all. I guess because I ordered them on a deal of paying $.01 plus $.99 pf shipping, i guess it was not worth their time to fulfill the order???? I don&#x27;t know. I was so excited to order these and now i just wont get them. BIG..HUGE.. DISAPPOINTMENT.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my acrylic nails and I like that they came in three different colors and the best part that they are really cheap</li>
            <li> Love!!!!! I had been searching for these spikes, couldn&#x27;t find then anywhere. So happy with my purchase. Just wish they came in a bigger size from you. I will order more more more</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great for fashion but so long they can cut you</li>
            <li> These arrived within the expected delivery dates. I was excited to receive these and they were just as expected. They are a little heavier than I expected but that&#x27;s ok. I will just make sure that when I use them, I secure them with nail glue. Not just a clear coat like I can do some of the lighter weight decals. I haven&#x27;t actually used them yet.</li>
            <li> Spikes are to sharp!!</li>
            <li> Its tiny and cute.  Just the right size for nails and whatever you want to do with it. Cant wait to try these out</li>
            <li> I love them and peoples reaction to my nail art was awesome. They never seen anything like it. Great product...</li>
            <li> Got these to do my daughter&#x27;s nails with. Fit perfectly on my oldest daughters nails and she loved them and got tons of compliments! Definitely have to use super glue to keep them on. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Awesome and I cannot wait to use them ! And the came in earlier than expected! Bonus points :) nice product</li>

            <li> I LOVE these!!!! It only took 4days to arrive. I can&#x27;t wait to use these on my nails!!</li>
            <li> these are cool i really like them.. theyre not cheap at all they have a nice weight to them. theyre all mixed together so you have to sort them yourself which isnt a problem for me</li>
            <li> These studs are heavy! I think if you put them on all your nails, your arms would stretch lol...but they are very cool and one or 2 here and there adds a very edgy, fun look!</li>
            <li> I love doing nails. So when I did my sister&#x27;s nail and put a spike accent, she got so many compliments. I felt like they were talking to me! Awesome!</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; received it fast! Will order again!</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp. A bit smaller than expected, but still good.</li>
            <li> spikes on my nails count me in the product is as described and completely amazing and fun to use</li>
            <li> Came just as expected. I would order again</li>
