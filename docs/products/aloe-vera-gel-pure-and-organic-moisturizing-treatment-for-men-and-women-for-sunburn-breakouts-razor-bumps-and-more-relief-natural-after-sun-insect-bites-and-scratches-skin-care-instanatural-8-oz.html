    <ol>
            <li>yes, the cooling effect was delightful!!  </li>
            <li>Well, they are wonderful!!!  </li>
            <li>I have aloe plants at times, but I&#x27;m not the best with houseplants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On another note...not impressed with using it in my hair...</li>
            <li>In this sweltering heat, it was a very welcome cooling everywhere</li>
            <li>but if it&#x27;s not convenient, this an excellent choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best healing aloe</li>
            <li>I am very happy  with this multipurpose gel.</li>

            <li>Awesome product</li>
            <li>so it has a wonderfully cooling sensation on my skin and helps the itching subside.</li>
            <li>I also like to mix it with bentonite to make an awesome clay mask for my face.</li>
            <li>The perfect summertime skin treat!</li>
            <li>Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>I’m impressed that they disclose their preservatives (citric acid and potassium sorbate) and that they are innocuous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but Aloe vera seems to be my best option.</li>
            <li>The InstaNatural Aloe Vera Gel is a wonderful addition to these homemade products.</li>

            <li>I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback.</li>

            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d recommend this product..</li>
            <li>AT  A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST OPINION.</li>
            <li>I  HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED FEEDBACK .</li>
            <li>Nice texture</li>
            <li>My job is to give an honest opinion, not help the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>and/or making their own homemade products as well.</li>
            <li>Very nice and light weight</li>
            <li>I originally bought it for my sunburn and it worked great.</li>
            <li>Really good for my growing pregnant belly too!</li>
            <li>Aloe vera is one of the best things you can put on or in your body, so I was pretty excited to get a discount for honestly reviewing this.  </li>
            <li>and it was a welcome sensation in the heat - applying it over my skin for a cooling sensation, but didn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue like lotions do during high temps - and did a good job hydrating my skin.  </li>
            <li>I thought to try this out, swiped it on her skin, but it didn&#x27;t irritate her skin and did the job of ameliorating her complaints; in fact, she said she liked it more because it didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Sure will be handy in Florida.  </li>
            <li>More on the liquid side than I am used to with Aloe Vera, but still works nice</li>
            <li>My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li>Got them along with instructions on how many uses they each have.  </li>
            <li>I just received this cooling healthy repairing gel.  </li>
            <li>most comforting.</li>
            <li>Love love love this aloe Vera gel.</li>
            <li>Much much much better than the pharmacy brand .</li>
            <li>Ok with that said..</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say for sure..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>-ok can&#x27;t think of anything else at the moment..  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Well, I guess most people.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Much better than many &amp;#34;aloe gel&amp;#34; products I have tried over the years.</li>
            <li>I love using it.</li>
            <li>My favorite use is on legs and bikini area after shaving.</li>
            <li>I must say that I am glad that have tried this gel.</li>
            <li>Love this Aloe Vera  Gel.</li>
            <li>love for my hair and my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love that this gel isn&#x27;t overpowering with the scent</li>
            <li>and it applies smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky!</li>
            <li>love this soothing aloe product</li>
            <li>Soothing and refreshing.</li>
            <li>This Aloe Vera Gel is very soothing and a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I recommend this Aloe gel for this purpose and many others.</li>
            <li>I should have read the reviews thoroughly because most of then are from people who have been sent the product, plus it was advertised so I should have known better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it and planning on telling friends and family about this product.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>, I just wanted to mention all the many uses I&#x27;ve read about</li>
            <li>This Aloe Vera Gel is very soothing and is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products to help maintain moisture</li>
            <li>It has so many uses.</li>
            <li>It is so light it just melts into you skin!</li>
            <li>easy to use soak right in, no flowery smell, very nice</li>
            <li>I do recommend this product because of its many uses and it&#x27;s a great addition to anyone who enjoys more natural products</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products to moisture my face but Aloe vera seems work the best .</li>
            <li>Makes my legs smooth and itch free after shaving!</li>
            <li>It’s very cooling and refreshing on a stifling hot summer day, and great for your skin too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe</li>
            <li>Easy to use pump bottle.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t worked like it did when I first used it...and honestly I&#x27;m wondering if maybe my skin had just cleared up because I had been in the sun--</li>
            <li>It is so light and absorbs so quickly!</li>
            <li>It comes in a huge bottle with a pump,</li>
            <li>They each are kind of watery, and one of the pumps &#x27;shot&#x27; the liquid straight out in the air.  </li>
            <li>I wish I liked it as much as its packaging...</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable using it.</li>
            <li>I used it after lightly exfoliating my skin when it didn&#x27;t hurt anymore.</li>
            <li>a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li>I also rubbed some over my hair in an attempt to smooth some of the fly-aways and it worked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really helpful.my honest review.</li>
            <li>Honestly, after trying this and reading all the reviews on similar products like this one..I&#x27;d rather just grow/buy my own aloe vera plant.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, after trying this and reading all the reviews on similar products like this one..I&#x27;d rather just grow/buy my own aloe vera plant.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easy, this is my first time using aloe vera gel &amp; honestly better than any lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>My new favorite aloe product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, it is really hot out right now (I&#x27;m in Texas), and I didn&#x27;t even think about how warm the gel would have gotten in shipping.  </li>
            <li>The gel itself is great for burns, itches, dry skin, etc.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t impressed with the watery feel (this is definitely not like any gel I&#x27;ve ever seen) and figured that I probably wouldn&#x27;t like them and could just give them to my neighbor, who likes everything that&#x27;s &#x27;natural&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Good for use in the summer when only light moisture is needed.  </li>
            <li>My face/skin was so soft &amp; smooth!!</li>
            <li>and I paid full price for both and had the option of returning.  </li>
            <li>I really do like aloe gel because it has so many uses.  </li>
            <li>All the five star reviews that other people have written are spot on, great product</li>
            <li>Overall, though, I think this is a good product - worth getting for your skin woes.</li>
            <li>It does soak in quickly..</li>
            <li>Only just recently did I learn of all the wonderful uses of this gel!</li>
            <li>That is fine by me because there is nothing more calming than this liquid (not a thick gooey gel, viscous and smooth, easy to apply and smooth) on skin that needs an instant boost of care.</li>
            <li>I took this with me while on vacation - where the climate was very hot and humid</li>
            <li>From what I&#x27;ve read and what others have told me, the plant/leaf/whatever it&#x27;s called, is far better than anything you can buy in a bottle.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this gel is made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I prefer fresh aloe</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I liked it</li>
            <li>so I just want to give back by sharing my honest feedback.</li>
            <li>and I love that it is all natural.  </li>
            <li>The aloe smells good and feels even better, no perfume added, so you can layer other fragranced products or stay natural.</li>
            <li>I especially love that it&#x27;s organic, and the only other ingredients are citric acid, potassium sorbate, and xanthan - which are basically preservatives to help extend the shelf life.  </li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the right word, but I&#x27;m not thinking of the right one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I trash them right after i used the first pump.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is light, but I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells, so I just can&#x27;t get fond of this one.</li>
            <li>, my skin is silky smooth and fabulously soft to the touch!  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much for the aloe gel.  </li>
            <li>I used this and at first it feels sticky.</li>
            <li>VERY watery!</li>
            <li>I was sketchy about this product when I first used it..</li>
            <li>Much much much better than the local pharmacy ones.</li>
            <li>~~ Does exactly as it says in listing</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s extra refreshing.</li>
            <li>From what I&#x27;ve read and what others have told me, the plant/leaf/whatever it&#x27;s called, is far better than anything you can buy in a bottle.ng if maybe my skin had just cleared up because I had been in the sun--not that I&#x27;m trying to promote sunbathing by any means--just saying that my skin does tend to clear up when I lay out.  </li>
            <li>I was not paid for my review, or given any incentive or reward for a positive review.</li>
            <li>This help my baby&#x27;s sunburn, my overall body lotion, and many many other use.</li>
            <li>My skin felt super soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>(I included pictures with a tube of lipstick so you could see how large it is).  </li>
            <li>This positive review is because I really like these products.</li>
            <li>I used it also for my  skin,which it made my skin very soft and moisturized,I also mixed this with some of my DIY  Hair recipes that I love.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the pump that comes with this.  </li>
            <li>I also rubbed the two together and used as a moisturizer, thinking that they probably wouldn&#x27;t have much staying power.  </li>
            <li>A much have household item.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>just comes out a tad bit FAST.  </li>
            <li>but this is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I really like the feel of the product.  </li>
            <li>product is very liquidy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been battling dermatits all summer and the aloe is very soothing.</li>
            <li>, I want to mention that InstaNatural really packages their products well</li>
            <li>it is very runny and water like</li>
            <li>I used it first on my hair after I shampoo my hair, upon rinsING it out ,my hair was very soft  silky manageable.</li>
            <li>My skin was glistening when I first put it on, the liquids were slowly absorbed and now,  a couple of hours later</li>
            <li>Like it very much  all natural</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure you can categorize this as a gel—it just kind of pours out when you use the pump.</li>
            <li>Now, I mainly use it on my legs and arms.</li>
            <li>I was looking for an organic aloe and had a coupon for this particular brand</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, Aloe Vera gel is a necessary ingredient in many DIY products such as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only as a stand alone, but I also make my own soaps, body scrubs, and other hygienic products for my family.</li>
            <li>update the review after using the product for a little while more.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft manageable &amp; very shiny.</li>
            <li>Aloe Vera Gel has so many uses,I have used this gel for a few.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely will be buying a few more of these and refrigerating.</li>
            <li>perhaps i got a bad batch, or maybe that people are more apt to be positive about something they received for next to nothing.</li>
            <li>When I received my sample for review, I was suprised to discover that they include the pump but also a squeeze top as well, no more hassle of traveling with a pump bottle.</li>
            <li>Got this for my sensitive  skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure which ingredient would cause the acne, but I have sensitive skin and most products break me out.</li>
            <li>This product really fits the bill as it moisturized my skin, but still left it feeling &amp;#34;breathable&amp;#34; even when I did begin to perspire - so this jumpstarted a new routine for Summer.  </li>
            <li>The Aloe gel  is light enough that I can use it before I dry my hair &amp; before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>It was completely absorbed and my skin was dry in a matter of seconds!</li>
            <li>A little watery but works well as a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>not that I&#x27;m trying to promote sunbathing by any means--just saying that my skin does tend to clear up when I lay out.  </li>
            <li>So, this is the closest I can get to utilizing the health benefits of this all natural healing balm</li>
            <li>skin is sensitive and it&#x27;s not always receptive to everything I try</li>
            <li>SO SHINY AND SOFT.  </li>
            <li>I like how it doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue and it leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like the product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for those who are looking for natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to receive a helpful email from InstaNatural describing how to use the gel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something I can deal with, but it&#x27;s definitely kind of annoying to keep making sure</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried its other uses for hair yet, but will post later - excited to try it as a &amp;#34;scalp treatment&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I have only used aloe vera before for burns or razor burn, so I didn&#x27;t actually realize how very cooling aloe vera is!  </li>
            <li>I also tried it as a general moisturizer, but the initial super soft skin didn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d thought it would.  </li>
            <li>Not wanting to waste it, I wiped as quickly as I could from the bottle, and put it on skin.  </li>
            <li>I was apparently just having a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; month when I wrote that review.  </li>
            <li>but this left my skin soft and helped to heal some irritated skin.</li>
            <li>Mine had leaked a bit down the side when it first arrived.</li>
            <li>needs preservatives as it’s a watery liquid, but many companies don’t disclose if their aloe has preservatives (dangerous without), or what the preservatives might be (some people prefer to avoid certain chemicals).</li>
            <li>it is seriously very watery..little thicker consistency than water..but definitely hard to make it to your face without it running down you arms first.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just going to list the good and bad</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just going to list the good and bad</li>

            <li> but if it&#x27;s not convenient, this an excellent choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The best healing aloe</li>
            <li> I am very happy  with this multipurpose gel.</li>
            <li> it works great!</li>
            <li> Awesome product</li>
            <li> so it has a wonderfully cooling sensation on my skin and helps the itching subside.</li>
            <li> I also like to mix it with bentonite to make an awesome clay mask for my face.</li>
            <li> The perfect summertime skin treat!</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I’m impressed that they disclose their preservatives (citric acid and potassium sorbate) and that they are innocuous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but Aloe vera seems to be my best option.</li>
            <li> The InstaNatural Aloe Vera Gel is a wonderful addition to these homemade products.</li>

            <li> AT  A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST OPINION.</li>
            <li> I  HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED FEEDBACK .</li>
            <li> Nice texture</li>
            <li> My job is to give an honest opinion, not help the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> and/or making their own homemade products as well.</li>
            <li> Very nice and light weight</li>
            <li> I originally bought it for my sunburn and it worked great.</li>
            <li> Really good for my growing pregnant belly too!</li>
            <li> Aloe vera is one of the best things you can put on or in your body, so I was pretty excited to get a discount for honestly reviewing this.  </li>
            <li> and it was a welcome sensation in the heat - applying it over my skin for a cooling sensation, but didn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue like lotions do during high temps - and did a good job hydrating my skin.  </li>
            <li> I thought to try this out, swiped it on her skin, but it didn&#x27;t irritate her skin and did the job of ameliorating her complaints; in fact, she said she liked it more because it didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Sure will be handy in Florida.  </li>
            <li> More on the liquid side than I am used to with Aloe Vera, but still works nice</li>
            <li> My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li> Got them along with instructions on how many uses they each have.  </li>
            <li> I just received this cooling healthy repairing gel.  </li>
            <li> most comforting.</li>
            <li> Love love love this aloe Vera gel.</li>
            <li> Much much much better than the pharmacy brand .</li>
            <li> Ok with that said..</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say for sure..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> -ok can&#x27;t think of anything else at the moment..  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> Well, I guess most people.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Much better than many &amp;#34;aloe gel&amp;#34; products I have tried over the years.</li>
            <li> I love using it.</li>
            <li> My favorite use is on legs and bikini area after shaving.</li>
            <li> I must say that I am glad that have tried this gel.</li>
            <li> Love this Aloe Vera  Gel.</li>
            <li> love for my hair and my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love that this gel isn&#x27;t overpowering with the scent</li>
            <li> and it applies smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky!</li>
            <li> love this soothing aloe product</li>
            <li> Soothing and refreshing.</li>
            <li> This Aloe Vera Gel is very soothing and a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I recommend this Aloe gel for this purpose and many others.</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews thoroughly because most of then are from people who have been sent the product, plus it was advertised so I should have known better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it and planning on telling friends and family about this product.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> , I just wanted to mention all the many uses I&#x27;ve read about</li>
            <li> This Aloe Vera Gel is very soothing and is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products to help maintain moisture</li>
            <li> It has so many uses.</li>
            <li> It is so light it just melts into you skin!</li>
            <li> easy to use soak right in, no flowery smell, very nice</li>
            <li> I do recommend this product because of its many uses and it&#x27;s a great addition to anyone who enjoys more natural products</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products to moisture my face but Aloe vera seems work the best .</li>
            <li> Makes my legs smooth and itch free after shaving!</li>
            <li> It’s very cooling and refreshing on a stifling hot summer day, and great for your skin too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe</li>
            <li> Easy to use pump bottle.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t worked like it did when I first used it...and honestly I&#x27;m wondering if maybe my skin had just cleared up because I had been in the sun--</li>
            <li> It is so light and absorbs so quickly!</li>
            <li> It comes in a huge bottle with a pump,</li>
            <li> They each are kind of watery, and one of the pumps &#x27;shot&#x27; the liquid straight out in the air.  </li>
            <li> I wish I liked it as much as its packaging...</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable using it.</li>
            <li> I used it after lightly exfoliating my skin when it didn&#x27;t hurt anymore.</li>
            <li> a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> I also rubbed some over my hair in an attempt to smooth some of the fly-aways and it worked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really helpful.my honest review.</li>
            <li> Honestly, after trying this and reading all the reviews on similar products like this one..I&#x27;d rather just grow/buy my own aloe vera plant.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, after trying this and reading all the reviews on similar products like this one..I&#x27;d rather just grow/buy my own aloe vera plant.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easy, this is my first time using aloe vera gel &amp; honestly better than any lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> My new favorite aloe product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, it is really hot out right now (I&#x27;m in Texas), and I didn&#x27;t even think about how warm the gel would have gotten in shipping.  </li>
            <li> The gel itself is great for burns, itches, dry skin, etc.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed with the watery feel (this is definitely not like any gel I&#x27;ve ever seen) and figured that I probably wouldn&#x27;t like them and could just give them to my neighbor, who likes everything that&#x27;s &#x27;natural&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Good for use in the summer when only light moisture is needed.  </li>
            <li> My face/skin was so soft &amp; smooth!!</li>
            <li> and I paid full price for both and had the option of returning.  </li>
            <li> I really do like aloe gel because it has so many uses.  </li>
            <li> All the five star reviews that other people have written are spot on, great product</li>
            <li> Overall, though, I think this is a good product - worth getting for your skin woes.</li>
            <li> It does soak in quickly..</li>
            <li> Only just recently did I learn of all the wonderful uses of this gel!</li>
            <li> That is fine by me because there is nothing more calming than this liquid (not a thick gooey gel, viscous and smooth, easy to apply and smooth) on skin that needs an instant boost of care.</li>
            <li> I took this with me while on vacation - where the climate was very hot and humid</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve read and what others have told me, the plant/leaf/whatever it&#x27;s called, is far better than anything you can buy in a bottle.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this gel is made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I prefer fresh aloe</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I liked it</li>
            <li> so I just want to give back by sharing my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> and I love that it is all natural.  </li>
            <li> The aloe smells good and feels even better, no perfume added, so you can layer other fragranced products or stay natural.</li>
            <li> I especially love that it&#x27;s organic, and the only other ingredients are citric acid, potassium sorbate, and xanthan - which are basically preservatives to help extend the shelf life.  </li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the right word, but I&#x27;m not thinking of the right one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I trash them right after i used the first pump.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is light, but I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells, so I just can&#x27;t get fond of this one.</li>
            <li> , my skin is silky smooth and fabulously soft to the touch!  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much for the aloe gel.  </li>
            <li> I used this and at first it feels sticky.</li>
            <li> VERY watery!</li>
            <li> I was sketchy about this product when I first used it..</li>
            <li> Much much much better than the local pharmacy ones.</li>
            <li> ~~ Does exactly as it says in listing</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s extra refreshing.</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve read and what others have told me, the plant/leaf/whatever it&#x27;s called, is far better than anything you can buy in a bottle.ng if maybe my skin had just cleared up because I had been in the sun--not that I&#x27;m trying to promote sunbathing by any means--just saying that my skin does tend to clear up when I lay out.  </li>
            <li> I was not paid for my review, or given any incentive or reward for a positive review.</li>
            <li> This help my baby&#x27;s sunburn, my overall body lotion, and many many other use.</li>
            <li> My skin felt super soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> (I included pictures with a tube of lipstick so you could see how large it is).  </li>
            <li> This positive review is because I really like these products.</li>
            <li> I used it also for my  skin,which it made my skin very soft and moisturized,I also mixed this with some of my DIY  Hair recipes that I love.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the pump that comes with this.  </li>
            <li> I also rubbed the two together and used as a moisturizer, thinking that they probably wouldn&#x27;t have much staying power.  </li>
            <li> A much have household item.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> just comes out a tad bit FAST.  </li>
            <li> but this is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I really like the feel of the product.  </li>
            <li> product is very liquidy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling dermatits all summer and the aloe is very soothing.</li>
            <li> , I want to mention that InstaNatural really packages their products well</li>
            <li> it is very runny and water like</li>
            <li> I used it first on my hair after I shampoo my hair, upon rinsING it out ,my hair was very soft  silky manageable.</li>
            <li> My skin was glistening when I first put it on, the liquids were slowly absorbed and now,  a couple of hours later</li>
            <li> Like it very much  all natural</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure you can categorize this as a gel—it just kind of pours out when you use the pump.</li>
            <li> Now, I mainly use it on my legs and arms.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an organic aloe and had a coupon for this particular brand</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, Aloe Vera gel is a necessary ingredient in many DIY products such as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only as a stand alone, but I also make my own soaps, body scrubs, and other hygienic products for my family.</li>
            <li> update the review after using the product for a little while more.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft manageable &amp; very shiny.</li>
            <li> Aloe Vera Gel has so many uses,I have used this gel for a few.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely will be buying a few more of these and refrigerating.</li>
            <li> perhaps i got a bad batch, or maybe that people are more apt to be positive about something they received for next to nothing.</li>
            <li> When I received my sample for review, I was suprised to discover that they include the pump but also a squeeze top as well, no more hassle of traveling with a pump bottle.</li>
            <li> Got this for my sensitive  skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which ingredient would cause the acne, but I have sensitive skin and most products break me out.</li>
            <li> This product really fits the bill as it moisturized my skin, but still left it feeling &amp;#34;breathable&amp;#34; even when I did begin to perspire - so this jumpstarted a new routine for Summer.  </li>
            <li> The Aloe gel  is light enough that I can use it before I dry my hair &amp; before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> It was completely absorbed and my skin was dry in a matter of seconds!</li>
            <li> A little watery but works well as a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> not that I&#x27;m trying to promote sunbathing by any means--just saying that my skin does tend to clear up when I lay out.  </li>
            <li> So, this is the closest I can get to utilizing the health benefits of this all natural healing balm</li>
            <li> skin is sensitive and it&#x27;s not always receptive to everything I try</li>
            <li> SO SHINY AND SOFT.  </li>
            <li> I like how it doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue and it leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like the product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for those who are looking for natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to receive a helpful email from InstaNatural describing how to use the gel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s something I can deal with, but it&#x27;s definitely kind of annoying to keep making sure</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried its other uses for hair yet, but will post later - excited to try it as a &amp;#34;scalp treatment&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have only used aloe vera before for burns or razor burn, so I didn&#x27;t actually realize how very cooling aloe vera is!  </li>
            <li> I also tried it as a general moisturizer, but the initial super soft skin didn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d thought it would.  </li>
            <li> Not wanting to waste it, I wiped as quickly as I could from the bottle, and put it on skin.  </li>
            <li> I was apparently just having a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; month when I wrote that review.  </li>
            <li> but this left my skin soft and helped to heal some irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Mine had leaked a bit down the side when it first arrived.</li>
            <li> needs preservatives as it’s a watery liquid, but many companies don’t disclose if their aloe has preservatives (dangerous without), or what the preservatives might be (some people prefer to avoid certain chemicals).</li>
            <li> it is seriously very watery..little thicker consistency than water..but definitely hard to make it to your face without it running down you arms first.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to list the good and bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to list the good and bad</li>
            <li> Again, usually during Summer, I skip moisturizers, even though I know better, but it&#x27;s hard finding one that doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34;, especially when you sweat.  </li>
            <li> I guess I had to tell you my negative impression first, because the consistency could potentially throw you off.  </li>
            <li> so great:&lt;br /&gt;-it leaves a weird film on your skin--at first I didn&#x27;t really notice, but</li>
            <li> -it leaves a weird film on your skin--at first I didn&#x27;t really notice, but once I went to put makeup on</li>
            <li> not sure if flakes is really the word I&#x27;m looking for...hard to describe...</li>
            <li> not sure if flakes is really the word I&#x27;m looking for...hard to describe...</li>
            <li> This is actually my second bottle of this strange watery stuff.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that i can say now is the texture is very watery and hard to stay on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> but we didn&#x27;t have any on hand during our trip and she was complaining of feeling dry and itchy on her back.  </li>
            <li> I have also used it on skin that felt like it had been in the sun a bit too long -</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll likely be buying some other brand of aloe vera gel when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> so I rinsed them off and put them on the kitchen counter to dry,</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for those with really dry hair or skin irritations.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It isn&#x27;t fake-gelled like that drug store crap, no extra crap.&lt;br /&gt;No sticky residue, amazing on burns and skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the thick gel-like consistency that you can buy at Walmart/Walgreens/etc., so that&#x27;s all I have to go off of as far as comparison goes.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has sensitive skin - we usually use lotions like Eucerin or Cetaphil -</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit confused as to what the intended purpose for this gel was.</li>
            <li> I use aloe vera for my scars and this seems to be working for my rough skin.</li>
            <li> Just got the product, so there is not much to say.</li>
            <li> No razor bumps that in the past no matter how expensive the product was, I got razor bumps more or less.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands and have found nothing that helped them, until this product!</li>
            <li> It hardly has a scent, that I can distinguish - maybe a slight aloe vera but not heavy (Now I&#x27;m wondering if those other aloe vera gels sold in stores are perfumed).</li>
            <li> Later, washed my hair as usual and took a shower.  </li>
            <li> I learned to squirt some in one hand and use the other hand to dab it on my face.  </li>
            <li> It spilled over quite a bit due to expansion.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tested the Aloe Vera gel for any of these purposes other than what I mentioned in the beginning of this review</li>
            <li> so you could see the product up close, but against white, it&#x27;s hard to see, and tried against a different color - but that shows how &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; (natural) it is - again, nothing like that artificial green you&#x27;d see from generic bottles of aloe vera gel.  </li>
            <li> I can smell a slight smell on my hands if I bring them to my nose, but other than that</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ve never used aloe from the actual plant itself..</li>
            <li> I get it on my face before it drips down my arms.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but considering it took me a month to realize slapping myself was not the answer to getting it on my face before it ran down my arms..</li>
            <li> My previous aloe vera gel had a thicker consistency and had no odor</li>
            <li> once I realized I was beating myself half to death..</li>
            <li> The gel itself is less viscous than your typical &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;; it&#x27;s not as thick as hair gel, but not completely watery</li>
            <li> This does NOT mean this is a fake review.</li>
            <li> i have been applying it like crazy and it really has helped!</li>
            <li> If you made the Gel thicker, there would be less waste.</li>
            <li> I mix in a little peppermint oil and lavender oil</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; and dried &amp;#34;superfast&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is like watery drug store green aloe.</li>
            <li> /&gt;that being said i happened to get a pretty bad sunburn the day before this came.</li>
            <li> I used this on a nasty canker sore, and it is very mild and soothing!  </li>
            <li> Aloe gel is a little tricky; it needs to be thickened so it doesn’t run out through your fingers, but get it too thick and it makes your skin sticky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this the past days after I shower</li>
            <li> I give this product 4 stars only because it smells weird</li>
            <li> The gel is rather thin in consistency, allowing it to soak into the skin in less than 60 seconds.</li>
            <li> This and the confusing marketing cost a star in my review.</li>
            <li> Made my thick curly hair softer.  </li>
            <li> This product has put a serious halt on all of those breakouts.  </li>
            <li> peeling, maybe)--anyways, its not pleasant if you use under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> peeling, maybe)--anyways, its not pleasant if you use under makeup.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have to decide what to wear based on where I was broken out that day.  </li>
            <li> This is a very watery gel, and smells horrible!!!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t believe me, click my profile and scroll down to see the poor reviews I&#x27;ve given bad products.</li>
            <li> it did horrible things to my hair, it does not moisturize my skin, and it leaves a gross tacky feeling unlike any aloe ive used (including squeezed from the leaf).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used it for aggravatingly painful spider bites -</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this and at first it feels sticky. Then I woke up the next morning and my legs are the softest they have ever been and my hair feels the same way. Will defiantly buy it again.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit confused as to what the intended purpose for this gel was. It comes with both a pump and a snap close lid. Mine had leaked a bit down the side when it first arrived. This and the confusing marketing cost a star in my review. The gel itself is great for burns, itches, dry skin, etc. The product claims it can be used in the shower as moisturizer and shampoo, though I am still a bit dubious about those claims. Overall, though, I think this is a good product - worth getting for your skin woes.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Made my thick curly hair softer.  If you made the Gel thicker, there would be less waste.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review on this before, but here I am again. This product is great. I have used it on my face and hair. All the five star reviews that other people have written are spot on, great product</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the pump that comes with this.  Seeing as it&#x27;s summer, we leave this downstairs in the cupboard so that it&#x27;s always on hand. I have used it for aggravatingly painful spider bites - it took that deep pain and topical sting away instantly (something that anti-itch products couldn&#x27;t help with).  I have also used it on skin that felt like it had been in the sun a bit too long - yes, the cooling effect was delightful!!  I also tried it as a general moisturizer, but the initial super soft skin didn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d thought it would.  That is fine by me because there is nothing more calming than this liquid (not a thick gooey gel, viscous and smooth, easy to apply and smooth) on skin that needs an instant boost of care. It hardly has a scent, that I can distinguish - maybe a slight aloe vera but not heavy (Now I&#x27;m wondering if those other aloe vera gels sold in stores are perfumed). Good product and great to have on hand!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this is the closest to getting aloe vera gel as naturally as possible without having an actual aloe vera plant on hand.  It&#x27;s not at all alike the &amp;#34;fluorescent green&amp;#34; gel you see at the stores.  I tried taking a picture of it so you could see the product up close, but against white, it&#x27;s hard to see, and tried against a different color - but that shows how &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; (natural) it is - again, nothing like that artificial green you&#x27;d see from generic bottles of aloe vera gel.  It comes in a huge bottle with a pump, (I included pictures with a tube of lipstick so you could see how large it is).  I took this with me while on vacation - where the climate was very hot and humid but I still needed to moisturize my body and it was a welcome sensation in the heat - applying it over my skin for a cooling sensation, but didn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue like lotions do during high temps - and did a good job hydrating my skin.  My daughter has sensitive skin - we usually use lotions like Eucerin or Cetaphil - but we didn&#x27;t have any on hand during our trip and she was complaining of feeling dry and itchy on her back.  I thought to try this out, swiped it on her skin, but it didn&#x27;t irritate her skin and did the job of ameliorating her complaints; in fact, she said she liked it more because it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; and dried &amp;#34;superfast&amp;#34;.  Again, usually during Summer, I skip moisturizers, even though I know better, but it&#x27;s hard finding one that doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34;, especially when you sweat.  This product really fits the bill as it moisturized my skin, but still left it feeling &amp;#34;breathable&amp;#34; even when I did begin to perspire - so this jumpstarted a new routine for Summer.  I haven&#x27;t tried its other uses for hair yet, but will post later - excited to try it as a &amp;#34;scalp treatment&amp;#34;.  I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this aloe vera gel along with the fractionated coconut oil.  Got them along with instructions on how many uses they each have.  One of them had leaked a bit so I rinsed them off and put them on the kitchen counter to dry, which was off-putting to me.  Put the pumps in and tried to use.  They each are kind of watery, and one of the pumps &#x27;shot&#x27; the liquid straight out in the air.  Tried it again and the same thing happened, so I decided to keep the caps on.  Wasn&#x27;t impressed with the watery feel (this is definitely not like any gel I&#x27;ve ever seen) and figured that I probably wouldn&#x27;t like them and could just give them to my neighbor, who likes everything that&#x27;s &#x27;natural&#x27;.  Was going to wash my hair later and decided to mix the two together and rub through my hair.  Threw a baseball cap on and ran some errands.  Later, washed my hair as usual and took a shower.  I figured I would try these watery things one last time before I took to my neighbor.  To my surprise, my hair felt silky, even after washing and rinsing!!  I also rubbed the two together and used as a moisturizer, thinking that they probably wouldn&#x27;t have much staying power.  Well, they are wonderful!!!  I guess I had to tell you my negative impression first, because the consistency could potentially throw you off.  My skin was glistening when I first put it on, the liquids were slowly absorbed and now,  a couple of hours later, my skin is silky smooth and fabulously soft to the touch!  I would definitely use these again and would recommend.  NOTE:  I did not receive a discount for my review and I paid full price for both and had the option of returning.  This positive review is because I really like these products.</li>
            <li> I just received this cooling healthy repairing gel.  Very nice and light weight and as my legs were starting to peel...most comforting. Sure will be handy in Florida.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for the aloe gel.  I am happy to give a review for exchange.  I really do like aloe gel because it has so many uses.  I had let myself run out and am so happy to have another bottle of aloe.  I have aloe plants at times, but I&#x27;m not the best with houseplants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again,&lt;br /&gt;Polly</li>
            <li> Love love love this aloe Vera gel. Much much much better than the pharmacy brand . This help my baby&#x27;s sunburn, my overall body lotion, and many many other use. A much have household item.&lt;br /&gt;I was offered  a chance to try this with discount, but my opinion is all mine, and unbiased.</li>
            <li> VERY watery! I&#x27;m not sure you can categorize this as a gel—it just kind of pours out when you use the pump. It&#x27;s something I can deal with, but it&#x27;s definitely kind of annoying to keep making sure I get it on my face before it drips down my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is light, but I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells, so I just can&#x27;t get fond of this one. My previous aloe vera gel had a thicker consistency and had no odor whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for functionality, it definitely does its job—my skin feels supple and hydrated. Still much more preferable to me than greasy lotion! But I&#x27;ll likely be buying some other brand of aloe vera gel when this one runs out. I wish I liked it as much as its packaging... but it&#x27;s not for me!</li>
            <li> ok..for starters..I did NOT receive this product for a &amp;#34;discounted&amp;#34; price or whatever 95% of the 5 star reviews said in their review.  I paid $19.95..no coupon, no nada.  This is actually my second bottle of this strange watery stuff.  Honestly, I&#x27;ve never used aloe from the actual plant itself..I&#x27;ve only used the thick gel-like consistency that you can buy at Walmart/Walgreens/etc., so that&#x27;s all I have to go off of as far as comparison goes.  I was sketchy about this product when I first used it..it literally shoots at you when you use the pump..pump is convenient though..just comes out a tad bit FAST.  This product confuses the heck out of me..it is seriously very watery..little thicker consistency than water..but definitely hard to make it to your face without it running down you arms first.  It got to the point where I was practically slapping myself just to try and get it to my face...once I realized I was beating myself half to death..I learned to squirt some in one hand and use the other hand to dab it on my face.  Ok with that said..this stuff is oddly amazing for my skin. I have tried (what feels like) millions of products to get my neck and arms to chill out so I didn&#x27;t have to decide what to wear based on where I was broken out that day.  This product has put a serious halt on all of those breakouts.  On another note...not impressed with using it in my hair...but considering it took me a month to realize slapping myself was not the answer to getting it on my face before it ran down my arms..I&#x27;m probably just not using it correctly in my hair!  It does soak in quickly..it&#x27;s only tacky/sticky feeling for maybe a minute or two after applying--ok maybe three or four minutes..I haven&#x27;t broke out my stopwatch so I can&#x27;t say for sure..but it does soak in..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;ok..so I retract my 5 star rating.. I was apparently just having a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; month when I wrote that review.  It hasn&#x27;t worked like it did when I first used it...and honestly I&#x27;m wondering if maybe my skin had just cleared up because I had been in the sun--not that I&#x27;m trying to promote sunbathing by any means--just saying that my skin does tend to clear up when I lay out.  I&#x27;m just going to list the good and bad I&#x27;ve experienced with this product..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;-reduces redness (acne...)&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m thinking....&lt;br /&gt;-ok can&#x27;t think of anything else at the moment..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so great:&lt;br /&gt;-it leaves a weird film on your skin--at first I didn&#x27;t really notice, but once I went to put makeup on I noticed these flakes (not sure if flakes is really the word I&#x27;m looking for...hard to describe...peeling, maybe)--anyways, its not pleasant if you use under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m questioning whether this stuff does actually soak in...or if it even moisturizes my skin in any way whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d recommend this product..it&#x27;s okay.  Honestly, after trying this and reading all the reviews on similar products like this one..I&#x27;d rather just grow/buy my own aloe vera plant.  From what I&#x27;ve read and what others have told me, the plant/leaf/whatever it&#x27;s called, is far better than anything you can buy in a bottle.ng if maybe my skin had just cleared up because I had been in the sun--not that I&#x27;m trying to promote sunbathing by any means--just saying that my skin does tend to clear up when I lay out.

            <li> “I immediately starting using the product as a moisturizer for my face and body and I LOVE IT!!! This company has FANTASTIC customer service and excellent products!!”</li>
            <li> Aloe vera is one of the best things you can put on or in your body, so I was pretty excited to get a discount for honestly reviewing this.  I can&#x27;t ever quite make myself drink aloe vera juice, like my husband can.  So, this is the closest I can get to utilizing the health benefits of this all natural healing balm (I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the right word, but I&#x27;m not thinking of the right one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it is really hot out right now (I&#x27;m in Texas), and I didn&#x27;t even think about how warm the gel would have gotten in shipping.  I opened the lid, to insert the pump, within minutes of the gel arriving at my door.  It spilled over quite a bit due to expansion.  Not wanting to waste it, I wiped as quickly as I could from the bottle, and put it on skin.  I have only used aloe vera before for burns or razor burn, so I didn&#x27;t actually realize how very cooling aloe vera is!  In this sweltering heat, it was a very welcome cooling everywhere I applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who knew?  Well, I guess most people.  But, I didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this gel is made with natural ingredients. I use aloe vera for my scars and this seems to be working for my rough skin. I&#x27;ve been using this the past days after I shower and I noticed my skin getting softer so it&#x27;s working! :) I give this product 4 stars only because it smells weird</li>
            <li> This is a must have in the summer. I take to the beach and camping. I use in my hair. Thus is great. I did receive for review.</li>
            <li> I prefer fresh aloe but if it&#x27;s not convenient, this an excellent choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is sensitive and it&#x27;s not always receptive to everything I try but this left my skin soft and helped to heal some irritated skin. When I received my sample for review, I was suprised to discover that they include the pump but also a squeeze top as well, no more hassle of traveling with a pump bottle. The aloe smells good and feels even better, no perfume added, so you can layer other fragranced products or stay natural. Much better than many &amp;#34;aloe gel&amp;#34; products I have tried over the years.</li>
            <li> I love using it. My favorite use is on legs and bikini area after shaving. No razor bumps that in the past no matter how expensive the product was, I got razor bumps more or less. None after using the aloe Vera gel!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. The best healing aloe</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  I USE IT ON MY HAIR AND IT MAKES IT SO SHINY AND SOFT.  I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT  A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST OPINION.</li>
            <li> Aloe Vera Gel has so many uses,I have used this gel for a few.I must say that I am glad that have tried this gel.I used it first on my hair after I shampoo my hair, upon rinsING it out ,my hair was very soft  silky manageable.I as used at as styling aid my hair loved this gel.I used it also for my  skin,which it made my skin very soft and moisturized,I also mixed this with some of my DIY  Hair recipes that I love.I am very happy  with this multipurpose gel.I  HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED FEEDBACK .</li>
            <li> i do not understand the glowing reviews about this stuff. perhaps i got a bad batch, or maybe that people are more apt to be positive about something they received for next to nothing. this stuff is like watery drug store green aloe. it did horrible things to my hair, it does not moisturize my skin, and it leaves a gross tacky feeling unlike any aloe ive used (including squeezed from the leaf).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product free/at a substantial discount for my opinions and review.</li>
            <li> Love this Aloe Vera  Gel. Much much much better than the local pharmacy ones. I use for  almost everything, from a basic moisturizer, to  healing the sun burn on my  kids. This will be a regular in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the watery gel.  In addition, the bottle has no manufactured/expiration date on it.  I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I liked it</li>
            <li> Amazing product. love for my hair and my skin.  Really good for my growing pregnant belly too!</li>
            <li> I love that this gel isn&#x27;t overpowering with the scent and it applies smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky! Great stuff.  I recieved this product at a reduced price in order to review it.</li>
            <li> love this soothing aloe product</li>
            <li> More on the liquid side than I am used to with Aloe Vera, but still works nice</li>
            <li> Soothing and refreshing. A bit different than what I have used before but this is the real deal.  Good for use in the summer when only light moisture is needed.  Received a discount for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  I originally bought it for my sunburn and it worked great. It calmed the burning and once I started peeling, it helped stop some areas. I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it until about 3 days after my sunburn, so I think if I had used it immediately, I wouldn&#x27;t have peeled at all. It helped even out my skin tone after it peeled and evened out the splotches in probably about a week. I used it after lightly exfoliating my skin when it didn&#x27;t hurt anymore. I like how it doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue and it leaves my skin soft. I also started to use it for razor burns and it does help those.  I tried to use it for all my body, including my face, but I&#x27;ve found that it breaks me out in acne prone areas. Now, I mainly use it on my legs and arms. I&#x27;m not sure which ingredient would cause the acne, but I have sensitive skin and most products break me out. The smell isn&#x27;t great, but after it dries, I can&#x27;t smell it at all. Overall, I really like the product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Nice texture and I use it for some DIY makeup recipes - it works great!</li>
            <li> This Aloe Vera Gel is very soothing and a great moisturizer. I have tried many other products to moisture my face but Aloe vera seems work the best . I would recommend this product for those who are looking for natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Yeah!  Aloe vera without all the stinky stuff in it!  I used this on a nasty canker sore, and it is very mild and soothing!  Love it!  Another 5 star product from Instanaturals!  LOVE them!!!</li>
            <li> Just got the product, so there is not much to say. The only thing that i can say now is the texture is very watery and hard to stay on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Will update the review after using the product for a little while more.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of the product.  I also like the pump that is provided.</li>
            <li> I was chosen to test this product and provide my unbiased product review. I bought this to use in my hair. The Aloe gel  is light enough that I can use it before I dry my hair &amp; before I go to bed. It leaves my hair soft manageable &amp; very shiny. I recommend this Aloe gel for this purpose and many others.</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews thoroughly because most of then are from people who have been sent the product, plus it was advertised so I should have known better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very liquidy. But, I received one that doesn&#x27;t smell. Will update this later.</li>
            <li> using for make lotion mix with lemon. It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> The gel has no smell. It goes on easy, this is my first time using aloe vera gel &amp; honestly better than any lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. My face/skin was so soft &amp; smooth!! I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> easy to use soak right in, no flowery smell, very nice</li>
            <li> Awesome product ~~ Does exactly as it says in listing ~~ I love it and planning on telling friends and family about this product.</li>
            <li> A little watery but works well as a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t handle the smell of this. I trash them right after i used the first pump.</li>
            <li> Wifey here. I&#x27;m very pleased with InstaNatural&#x27;s Aloe Vera Gel. I especially love that it&#x27;s organic, and the only other ingredients are citric acid, potassium sorbate, and xanthan - which are basically preservatives to help extend the shelf life.  The gel is rather thin in consistency, allowing it to soak into the skin in less than 60 seconds. It doesn&#x27;t feel tacky or greasy at all. I was looking for an organic aloe and had a coupon for this particular brand so I just want to give back by sharing my honest feedback. This stuff works! I&#x27;ve been battling dermatits all summer and the aloe is very soothing. I mix in a little peppermint oil and lavender oil so it has a wonderfully cooling sensation on my skin and helps the itching subside. I was surprised to receive a helpful email from InstaNatural describing how to use the gel. It can even be used as a hair conditioner and hair gel! I also like to mix it with bentonite to make an awesome clay mask for my face. I store my 16-oz bottle in the fridge so it&#x27;s extra refreshing. The perfect summertime skin treat!</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Have used this for a couple of weeks. Love it</li>
            <li> Got this for my sensitive  skin! Love it and would purxhase again!</li>
            <li> great product. Easy to use pump bottle.</li>
            <li> Works great and I love that it is all natural.  Smells good too!</li>
            <li> Great aloe product for use after a sunburn.</li>
            <li> Loving this as an aftershave!  Makes my legs smooth and itch free after shaving!</li>
            <li> My new favorite aloe product! Aloe gel is a little tricky; it needs to be thickened so it doesn’t run out through your fingers, but get it too thick and it makes your skin sticky. This is perfect, easy to apply, and leaves no film whatsoever. It’s very cooling and refreshing on a stifling hot summer day, and great for your skin too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe needs preservatives as it’s a watery liquid, but many companies don’t disclose if their aloe has preservatives (dangerous without), or what the preservatives might be (some people prefer to avoid certain chemicals). I’m impressed that they disclose their preservatives (citric acid and potassium sorbate) and that they are innocuous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review. This does NOT mean this is a fake review. I was not paid for my review, or given any incentive or reward for a positive review. If you don&#x27;t believe me, click my profile and scroll down to see the poor reviews I&#x27;ve given bad products. My job is to give an honest opinion, not help the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always thought Aloe Vera gel was only needed after a sunburn/long sun exposure or on scrapes/cuts. Only just recently did I learn of all the wonderful uses of this gel! The gel itself is less viscous than your typical &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;; it&#x27;s not as thick as hair gel, but not completely watery either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I squirted some into my hand and rubbed it on my arms, elbows, and shoulders. It was completely absorbed and my skin was dry in a matter of seconds! My skin felt super soft to the touch. I can smell a slight smell on my hands if I bring them to my nose, but other than that I notice no smell at all. I also rubbed some over my hair in an attempt to smooth some of the fly-aways and it worked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the uses I&#x27;ve read about:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Allover moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;- Makeup remover&lt;br /&gt;- Eyebrow gel&lt;br /&gt;- Conditioner/Hair softener&lt;br /&gt;- Mouthwash&lt;br /&gt;- For acid indigestion&lt;br /&gt;- For GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease)&lt;br /&gt;- For osteoarthritis&lt;br /&gt;- For ulcerative colitis&lt;br /&gt;- For psoriasis&lt;br /&gt;- To help regulate blood sugar&lt;br /&gt;- Speeds wound healing&lt;br /&gt;- Laxative&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, Aloe Vera gel is a necessary ingredient in many DIY products such as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;- Hand sanitizer&lt;br /&gt;- Face wash&lt;br /&gt;- Exfoliator&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also read about freezing it in ice cube trays and then placing the aloe ice on sunburns, bug bites, psoriasis, etc...Nifty idea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tested the Aloe Vera gel for any of these purposes other than what I mentioned in the beginning of this review, I just wanted to mention all the many uses I&#x27;ve read about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I want to mention that InstaNatural really packages their products well and they send an email with each purchase offering tips/information about the product. Really helpful.my honest review. I do recommend this product because of its many uses and it&#x27;s a great addition to anyone who enjoys more natural products and/or making their own homemade products as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item using a discount code to do a review of this product. This Aloe Vera Gel is very soothing and is a great moisturizer. Aloe Vera gel works great on my hair. I have tried many products to help maintain moisture but Aloe vera seems to be my best option. I recommend this product for those with really dry hair or skin irritations. It will definitely sooth your needs.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to using this</li>
            <li> Like it very much  all natural</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about the Aloe Vera gel from InstaNatural! It is so light and absorbs so quickly! I have very dry hands and have found nothing that helped them, until this product! It has so many uses. I use it for an all over moisturizer, for cuts, sunburn, as a facial moisturizer. It is so light it just melts into you skin! A must try!&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product at a reduced price to give my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Its no odor is a good conditional for the skin I like to used on my feet at nite</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer, also good for sunburn. I buy a bottle of Aloe Vera gel every year for sunburn, I didn&#x27;t known I could use it year around. This is a great product to have on hand year around.Disclosure: I have received a free or greatly discounted product for the purpose of this review.</li>
            <li> Loved the product. Not only as a stand alone, but I also make my own soaps, body scrubs, and other hygienic products for my family. The InstaNatural Aloe Vera Gel is a wonderful addition to these homemade products.</li>
            <li> This is a very watery gel, and smells horrible!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent Aloe!!&lt;br /&gt;As close to fresh-cut aloe leaves as you can get.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t fake-gelled like that drug store crap, no extra crap.&lt;br /&gt;No sticky residue, amazing on burns and skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will be buying a few more of these and refrigerating.</li>
            <li> i am giving this 4 stars for a couple reasons,&lt;br /&gt;1. it is not a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; at all. it is very runny and water like&lt;br /&gt;2. the pump is is not that great, maybe i got a faulty pump but any squeeze of the bottle and aloe is squirting out everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that being said i happened to get a pretty bad sunburn the day before this came. i have been applying it like crazy and it really has helped! so in a nut shell the product its self is great!</li>
