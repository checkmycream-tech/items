            <li>It is amazing</li>
            <li>so i could tell the whole world how awesome their products are . .  .</li>
            <li>Really awesome, foams up great and has helped my skin clear up while being gentle.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll fall in love.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s literally nothing better out there.</li>
            <li>eminence is such a wonderful line of skin care</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>The spas charge about $5-10 more.  </li>
            <li>I Love this stuff....</li>
            <li>and I personally love the eucalyptus scent :)</li>
            <li>it os amazing non drying, really cleansing and refreshing.</li>
            <li>but i feel like this is too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li>Sour whip cherry smells like Cherry Pie and is awesome for your face!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this product is good for all skin types, but Eminence is a great brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a HUGE Eminence User....</li>
            <li>Also I like going to the spas because they always give free samples of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Secondly, the product itself is great, I see improvements on my skin</li>
            <li>Fantastic in the morning for a clean feel and calming aroma.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you use good moisturizer as it tends to dry up your skin a bit.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel super clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>but then you&#x27;ll need to use it twice to get the full effects.</li>
            <li>This is such a good product.</li>
            <li>Tried and true, there is a noticeable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this brand so much that when i was hating my job as an Engineer I wanted to go work in their sales department</li>
            <li>It is very concentrated and makes your skin feel very clean.</li>
            <li>I was kind of bummed to see only 1 other review for this product because it is so amazing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Nice cleanser, a little goes a long way, but make sure you put enough on your hand to get it bubbly, makes my skin feel soft and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>and I like it well enough but don&#x27;t LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I probably buy it once every 10 months because.. let&#x27;s be honest, we&#x27;re not always 100% careful with our face washing routines.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product at a spa in Augusta, GA in 2004.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>All the other products in the Eminence line are also great, definitely would recommend trying!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about two weeks and almost can&#x27;t see much used up.</li>
            <li>Really like it.  </li>
            <li>I use it as a daily cleanser diluted with water and on its own for my weekly deep cleanse or before masks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, takes off my makeup, and makes my skin is left feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also super concentrated so one of these bottles easily lasts at least 6 months.</li>
            <li>my wife loves the way it works when she comes back from a run, it makes her feel fresh</li>
            <li>face wash will last you 4-6 months and is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to the eminence line then try this.</li>
            <li>Huge mess.</li>
            <li>you have problem skin or if you just like organic all natural products</li>
            <li>This cleanser lasts a really long time, you must only use a dime size - maybe even less to get a nice foamy lather.</li>

            <li> First off, don&#x27;t be alarmed by the small bottle as a little goes a long way especially when you add sufficient amount of water.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical thinking the eucalyptus would be too medicinal, but I love it and have been using it ever since.  </li>
            <li> but if your skin is sesitive it might over dry you.</li>
            <li> Long lasting supply as only small amount needed.  </li>
            <li> and I always have it on hand along with about 6 other Eminence products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve first discovered this product at a spa and have been obsessed with it ever since.</li>
            <li> Not a smart way to ship liquids!</li>
            <li> .. unfortunately for me Eminence seems like a small company and they only really distribute to spas.  </li>
            <li> It never leaves my skin feeling tight, which is a problem I always had with other cleansers.</li>
            <li> So no job :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you try it you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>

            <li> Smells great. Only wish the bottle was bigger for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> Fantastic in the morning for a clean feel and calming aroma.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a HUGE Eminence User....and I like this cleanser but I&#x27;ll be reinvesting back to Stone Crop...I bought it to try out and I like it well enough but don&#x27;t LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Best. Cleanser. In. The. World. If you&#x27;re new to the eminence line then try this. You&#x27;ll fall in love. There&#x27;s literally nothing better out there. It makes my face feel super clean and smooth. Works to take make up off as well but then you&#x27;ll need to use it twice to get the full effects. It&#x27;s worth every penny. It&#x27;s also super concentrated so one of these bottles easily lasts at least 6 months. I probably buy it once every 10 months because.. let&#x27;s be honest, we&#x27;re not always 100% careful with our face washing routines.</li>
            <li> This is such a good product. It is the only face wash I use now. Tried and true, there is a noticeable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> love eminence products! but i feel like this is too strong for my skin. it works for oily skin but if your skin is sesitive it might over dry you.</li>
            <li> Really awesome, foams up great and has helped my skin clear up while being gentle.</li>

            <li> eminence is such a wonderful line of skin care</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Long lasting supply as only small amount needed.  Smells amazing and wakes me up! Love it.</li>
            <li> love this cleanser! tried it at my spa it os amazing non drying, really cleansing and refreshing. I use it as a daily cleanser diluted with water and on its own for my weekly deep cleanse or before masks. LOVE IT another winner from Eminence.</li>
            <li> Nice cleanser, a little goes a long way, but make sure you put enough on your hand to get it bubbly, makes my skin feel soft and smells wonderful. Like you just got a facial. Leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. I would recommend anything organic!</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> This face wash is great for all skin types . .. . but is really good for oily \\&quot;that time of the month break outs\\&quot;.  It is amazing and I always have it on hand along with about 6 other Eminence products.  You have to try their moisturizers they are amazing and smell sooooo good!  Sour whip cherry smells like Cherry Pie and is awesome for your face!  Stone Crop and 8 Greens are also good ones.  I would say there are not a lot of their products I haven&#x27;t tried.  I love this brand so much that when i was hating my job as an Engineer I wanted to go work in their sales department so i could tell the whole world how awesome their products are . .  . .. unfortunately for me Eminence seems like a small company and they only really distribute to spas.  So no job :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face wash will last you 4-6 months and is worth every penny.  Here on Amazon is actually the cheapest you will find.  The spas charge about $5-10 more.  Also I like going to the spas because they always give free samples of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have problem skin or if you just like organic all natural products this Brand and wash are for you.  If you try it you will not be disappointed.  I was kind of bummed to see only 1 other review for this product because it is so amazing!</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff.... but this place sent it to me in a bag and the bottle had opened! So a bunch of it had leaked out into the bag. Huge mess. So disappointed. I had to return it and wait another three days for another one. Probably won&#x27;t buy from this place again. Not a smart way to ship liquids!</li>
            <li> First off, don&#x27;t be alarmed by the small bottle as a little goes a long way especially when you add sufficient amount of water. I have been using it for about two weeks and almost can&#x27;t see much used up. Secondly, the product itself is great, I see improvements on my skin and I personally love the eucalyptus scent :) Make sure that you use good moisturizer as it tends to dry up your skin a bit. Overall, once I use up the bottle I will definitelly buy another.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, takes off my makeup, and makes my skin is left feeling clean and soft. It never leaves my skin feeling tight, which is a problem I always had with other cleansers. This cleanser lasts a really long time, you must only use a dime size - maybe even less to get a nice foamy lather. I&#x27;ve first discovered this product at a spa and have been obsessed with it ever since. All the other products in the Eminence line are also great, definitely would recommend trying!</li>
            <li> Really like it.  It is very concentrated and makes your skin feel very clean.</li>
