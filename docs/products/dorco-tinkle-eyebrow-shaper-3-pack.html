            <li>Fast delivery, arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>This is the best thing I discovered thanks to a youtube video I found on AwesomenessTV</li>
            <li>nice product, will order again</li>
            <li>Easy to use, well designed to give a good angle of coverage, and works effectively.</li>
            <li>works very well and very good price.</li>
            <li>You get a really nice line, more like you&#x27;d get with threading than with waxing or plucking.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so thrilled to have listened to her advice because, honestly, I was able to get more of an arch using these than I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a salon.  </li>
            <li>So far they work great!!  </li>
            <li>I love the product itself was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>More like a scraper.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me by kandeej - google her, she&#x27;s a fantastic beauty blogger!</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Quality is just OK.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and will continue to purchase this brand.</li>
            <li>Safe.</li>
            <li>I bought these after seeing many recommendations online.</li>
            <li>It never hurt, I never cut myself, and my skin feels so smooth now!</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>These are my favorite eyebrow shapers and this is a better price than you can find them in stores</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>love it ..</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>So I tried these out on my skin and they worked, but after not being able to get these from Baja</li>
            <li>Perfect for facial and arm hair removal!</li>
            <li>cute, works well, like it</li>
            <li>That would surely nip it in the bud.)</li>
            <li>and I just love this product.</li>
            <li>Works better going with the grain rather than against.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Way better than waxing.</li>
            <li>perfect for facial hair</li>
            <li>(plus it would be much more convenient)</li>
            <li>Clean it up and feel more confidant!  </li>
            <li>Love the size, how easy to use.  </li>
            <li>But, it is worth every penny for sure!  </li>
            <li>but somehow these are more cheaply made.</li>
            <li>These razors are soooo easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am currently unemployed, so I can not afford to have my eyebrows threaded as I have done in the past....since I am now doing my eyebrows myself, this product makes doing-it-myself affordable &amp; beautiful...</li>
            <li>Quick, easy to use, safe and neat</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for anyone who needs a quick touch up at home or on the go!</li>
            <li>The Tinkle is great for eyebrows and face fuzz, easy to use even while watching TV but only for fine hairs in my opinion.</li>
            <li>These little razors are perfect.</li>
            <li>These little razors are great!  </li>
            <li>Works great for fine facial hair as well.  </li>
            <li>Blades are HUGE.  </li>
            <li>Tinkle razors work perfectly, after a few passes the hair is removed.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin extremely smooth after use.</li>
            <li>It might be gross, but it&#x27;s great for toe hair</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d get free shipping for the order.</li>
            <li>Cheap razors I bought 12.</li>
            <li>Made my skin feel so smooth and</li>
            <li>They are not even the Tinkle brand and they are cheaply made.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>They are also excellent for eyebrows, which really can&#x27;t be done with a regular razor.</li>
            <li>was just amazed how much hair there was on my face!!!</li>
            <li>quick, easy, affordable</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure they are a knock-off.  </li>
            <li>My makeup goes on super smooth after I shave with the Tinkle razor</li>
            <li>Leaves my face super smooth with no breakouts!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am well pleased with the Tinkle Eyebrow shapers and highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>Overall a good buy though.</li>
            <li>The final word for good grooming.</li>
            <li>I love it is was really helpful</li>
            <li>With 3 or 4 quick strokes of this &amp;#34;shaper,&amp;#34; she now can be mustache-free.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about shaving your facial hairs would be safe</li>
            <li>Quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>they are quick and efficient and get the job done every time.</li>
            <li>And my hair on face did not grow back thicker/darker...definite confident booster :)</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>This eyebrow razor is okay, but they can be easily found at the 99 cent store since they are  of equal quality.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way to use the large razor on these to get detailed areas.</li>
            <li>you like to borrow my tinkle?&amp;#34; Great product, and so worth the few bucks.</li>
            <li>Also, they were cheap and arrived fast.  </li>
            <li>My old razor that I used on my armpits works better than these.</li>
            <li>worth the price</li>
            <li>I found my skin was smooth, so when I later applied moisturizer and then foundation, it all applied so smoothly!</li>
            <li>Sharp enough to make it very easy to use and do a good job while not cutting yourself.</li>
            <li>I purchased as I wanted to try them right away.</li>
            <li>I have very light brown/dirty blonde hair and super baby thing/</li>
            <li>It was VERY mild though, and I have obnoxiously sensitive skin, so that shouldn&#x27;t be of major concern to most peeps.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used them much but for the one time I have used them, they seem to work fine.</li>
            <li>Worked OK, kind of dull.</li>
            <li>These were just okay.. not as sharp as I had wanted them to be but good enough.</li>
            <li>The blade is a bit shorter than what I had used previously but still does a good job</li>
            <li>Willing to pay a few more bucks for better instructions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so great for eyebrows as the blade is very large and hard to maneuver around the eyebrow area.</li>
            <li>These are great, take off the hair easily and extra dead skin as well.  </li>
            <li>but I love a smaller handle.</li>
            <li>I use it on my whole face to get all those pesky hairs off!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately no instructions at all, no cleaning tips.  </li>
            <li>I was scared at first that I would accidently cut myself because RAZOR</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I get a few good uses out of them</li>
            <li>It also works great for its intended use of eyebrows, no more waxing for me!</li>
            <li>They may be just as good, but I am a little hesitant to use them since they weren&#x27;t sealed in a package!</li>
            <li>Bought it on the pretense that it would shave fine facial hairs...not so much!</li>
            <li>But you should be careful when using it because it will remove your brows immediately and easily when you are not paying attention!</li>
            <li>But the blade is so large they should be called eye brow removers.</li>
            <li>I have to play with them a little more, but I was pretty satisfied with my initial trial (used on face).</li>
            <li>They get the fine hairs on my chin and upper lip.</li>
            <li>I suggest finding something that doesn&#x27;t have such a huge razor on it.</li>
            <li>Saw a review on youtube where women used them for facial hair and it makes your skin so smooth and makes your skin so much prettier when makeup applied.</li>
            <li>The razor is gentle on the skin</li>
            <li>no one wants to see hair on a woman&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li>These are the REAL TINKLE razors, not a knock-off.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li>They get the job done and are very close that I do not need to use them but a couple of times a week.</li>
            <li>I like how it takes off baby hairs on the face, but it really is microdermabrasion (sp?).</li>
            <li>Product arrived fast which is another plus</li>
            <li>The real tinkle razors have the name on them.</li>
            <li>So bought it for myself, and I really like them a lot.  </li>
            <li>or I just don&#x27;t have time to pluck my eyebrows and they work really well.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t work like the real thing.</li>
            <li>Much easier and faster than plucking.</li>
            <li>Good for lip and face hair, particularly that blonde baby fuzz but also the darker hairs that continue to plague my lip, despite all of the electrolysis I did back in the early 90s</li>
            <li>I normally spend $11 on an eyebrow waxing, but I never will again after finding these!  </li>
            <li>No more peach fuzz on my face, love it!</li>
            <li>But since it took me a few minutes to get the hang of it in the first place, I want to play around with it some more to see if I can figure out how to get &#x27;em.</li>
            <li>Compared to a fancy creme or wax at your local salon, these are a true bargain.</li>
            <li>the long blades are hard to find in the regular stores, so these are perfect.</li>
            <li>Nice eyebrow razors, they do their job pretty well and help me avoid paying someone to painfully rip out my eyebrow hair :3 will be re-ordering</li>
            <li>I wanted to try these out after watching Michelle Money highly recommended them.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a large amount of facial hair, but it was becoming more noticeable recently (at least to me!).</li>
            <li>It feels nothing more than a little scratch.</li>
            <li>The razors are not so sharp that they will cut your face, but it gets rid of the peach fuzz easily.  </li>
            <li>arrived quickly and were pretty sharp.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s gentle - no cuts or nicks to speak of thus far.</li>
            <li>I must start hot waxing again because that really works and with time they disappear as they did on my upper lip area.  </li>
            <li>Most of the methods I&#x27;ve tried made my face break out, took too long or still left hair on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was super self conscious of the peach fuzz on my upper lip and also my side burns.</li>
            <li>These little things are super sharp and easy to use!  </li>
            <li>It was pretty gross the first time seeing how much hair I actually had on my face.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live with out these.</li>
            <li>I found that holding the blade perpendicular to your skin doesn&#x27;t work well; you kind of have to hold it parallel to your face (like with the blade facing down instead of facing your skin directly).</li>
            <li>I realize that you can get them for less money elsewhere, but I do almost all of my shopping online - and I still think that these are a fantastic value.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light and small that it doesn&#x27;t even feel like a real razor, so in her mind, it&#x27;s not like she&#x27;s shaving her face.</li>
            <li>These are pure and utter junk.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear make up, but this makes my skin look clear.</li>
            <li>The product works very well at getting rid of the unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely purchase Tinkle razors in the future, and leave the off brand at the store.</li>
            <li>my eyebrows look professionally done...</li>
            <li>Having extremely sensitive skin I cannot use any type of razor on my legs.</li>
            <li>Have a professional do that or stick to just your tweezers.</li>
            <li>Old age brings chin whiskers  </li>
            <li>but it was so gentle I got used to it the second time around.</li>
            <li>These work very well on facial hair.</li>
            <li>Decided to try shaving the peach fuzz like she did in the video and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>They did become dull rather quickly using them this way, but they served their purpose well at first.</li>
            <li>These are too long to really get in there.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought tinkles directly in New York and these are not the same.</li>
            <li>I never had a &amp;#34;hairy&amp;#34; face, as I have light hair, but its crazy how smooth your face looks without any hair on it.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough for my delicate lady skin, but strong enough for my hairy face!</li>
            <li>It was a total waste of time, did not work at all, would like to be reimbursed if it wasn&#x27;t so cheap to start with</li>
            <li>Gets very close to the skin without a single nick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaply made, dull, and it just doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical at first but definitely worth buying for the cheap cost.</li>
            <li>Tip: for getting in the hard to reach areas of your eyebrows, like the inner corner of your eyes, just use the top 1/4 inch of the razor; don&#x27;t try and use the entire thing.</li>
            <li>So that was kind of weird and not intuitive, but</li>
            <li>My pretty 12-year-old daughter has black hair</li>
            <li>I broke out a little after I used them the first time</li>
            <li>Just be careful around the eyelash area since it&#x27;s a longer blade, you can easily take off a few lashes!</li>
            <li>a precise angle so very hard to use -</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Nice to get 3 at a time and the cover for them.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I discovered thanks to a youtube video I found on AwesomenessTV</li>
            <li> nice product, will order again</li>
            <li> Easy to use, well designed to give a good angle of coverage, and works effectively.</li>
            <li> works very well and very good price.</li>
            <li> You get a really nice line, more like you&#x27;d get with threading than with waxing or plucking.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thrilled to have listened to her advice because, honestly, I was able to get more of an arch using these than I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a salon.  </li>
            <li> So far they work great!!  </li>
            <li> I love the product itself was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> More like a scraper.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by kandeej - google her, she&#x27;s a fantastic beauty blogger!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Quality is just OK.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to purchase this brand.</li>
            <li> Safe.</li>
            <li> I bought these after seeing many recommendations online.</li>
            <li> It never hurt, I never cut myself, and my skin feels so smooth now!</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> These are my favorite eyebrow shapers and this is a better price than you can find them in stores</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> love it ..</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> So I tried these out on my skin and they worked, but after not being able to get these from Baja</li>
            <li> Perfect for facial and arm hair removal!</li>
            <li> cute, works well, like it</li>
            <li> That would surely nip it in the bud.)</li>
            <li> and I just love this product.</li>
            <li> Works better going with the grain rather than against.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Way better than waxing.</li>
            <li> perfect for facial hair</li>
            <li> (plus it would be much more convenient)</li>
            <li> Clean it up and feel more confidant!  </li>
            <li> Love the size, how easy to use.  </li>
            <li> But, it is worth every penny for sure!  </li>
            <li> but somehow these are more cheaply made.</li>
            <li> These razors are soooo easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am currently unemployed, so I can not afford to have my eyebrows threaded as I have done in the past....since I am now doing my eyebrows myself, this product makes doing-it-myself affordable &amp; beautiful...</li>
            <li> Quick, easy to use, safe and neat</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone who needs a quick touch up at home or on the go!</li>
            <li> The Tinkle is great for eyebrows and face fuzz, easy to use even while watching TV but only for fine hairs in my opinion.</li>
            <li> These little razors are perfect.</li>
            <li> These little razors are great!  </li>
            <li> Works great for fine facial hair as well.  </li>
            <li> Blades are HUGE.  </li>
            <li> Tinkle razors work perfectly, after a few passes the hair is removed.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin extremely smooth after use.</li>
            <li> It might be gross, but it&#x27;s great for toe hair</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d get free shipping for the order.</li>
            <li> Cheap razors I bought 12.</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel so smooth and</li>
            <li> They are not even the Tinkle brand and they are cheaply made.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> They are also excellent for eyebrows, which really can&#x27;t be done with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> was just amazed how much hair there was on my face!!!</li>
            <li> quick, easy, affordable</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure they are a knock-off.  </li>
            <li> My makeup goes on super smooth after I shave with the Tinkle razor</li>
            <li> Leaves my face super smooth with no breakouts!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am well pleased with the Tinkle Eyebrow shapers and highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Overall a good buy though.</li>
            <li> The final word for good grooming.</li>
            <li> I love it is was really helpful</li>
            <li> With 3 or 4 quick strokes of this &amp;#34;shaper,&amp;#34; she now can be mustache-free.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about shaving your facial hairs would be safe</li>
            <li> Quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> they are quick and efficient and get the job done every time.</li>
            <li> And my hair on face did not grow back thicker/darker...definite confident booster :)</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> This eyebrow razor is okay, but they can be easily found at the 99 cent store since they are  of equal quality.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way to use the large razor on these to get detailed areas.</li>
            <li> you like to borrow my tinkle?&amp;#34; Great product, and so worth the few bucks.</li>
            <li> Also, they were cheap and arrived fast.  </li>
            <li> My old razor that I used on my armpits works better than these.</li>
            <li> worth the price</li>
            <li> I found my skin was smooth, so when I later applied moisturizer and then foundation, it all applied so smoothly!</li>
            <li> Sharp enough to make it very easy to use and do a good job while not cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> I purchased as I wanted to try them right away.</li>
            <li> I have very light brown/dirty blonde hair and super baby thing/</li>
            <li> It was VERY mild though, and I have obnoxiously sensitive skin, so that shouldn&#x27;t be of major concern to most peeps.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used them much but for the one time I have used them, they seem to work fine.</li>
            <li> Worked OK, kind of dull.</li>
            <li> These were just okay.. not as sharp as I had wanted them to be but good enough.</li>
            <li> The blade is a bit shorter than what I had used previously but still does a good job</li>
            <li> Willing to pay a few more bucks for better instructions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so great for eyebrows as the blade is very large and hard to maneuver around the eyebrow area.</li>
            <li> These are great, take off the hair easily and extra dead skin as well.  </li>
            <li> but I love a smaller handle.</li>
            <li> I use it on my whole face to get all those pesky hairs off!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately no instructions at all, no cleaning tips.  </li>
            <li> I was scared at first that I would accidently cut myself because RAZOR</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I get a few good uses out of them</li>
            <li> It also works great for its intended use of eyebrows, no more waxing for me!</li>
            <li> They may be just as good, but I am a little hesitant to use them since they weren&#x27;t sealed in a package!</li>
            <li> Bought it on the pretense that it would shave fine facial hairs...not so much!</li>
            <li> But you should be careful when using it because it will remove your brows immediately and easily when you are not paying attention!</li>
            <li> But the blade is so large they should be called eye brow removers.</li>
            <li> I have to play with them a little more, but I was pretty satisfied with my initial trial (used on face).</li>
            <li> They get the fine hairs on my chin and upper lip.</li>
            <li> I suggest finding something that doesn&#x27;t have such a huge razor on it.</li>
            <li> Saw a review on youtube where women used them for facial hair and it makes your skin so smooth and makes your skin so much prettier when makeup applied.</li>
            <li> The razor is gentle on the skin</li>
            <li> no one wants to see hair on a woman&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> These are the REAL TINKLE razors, not a knock-off.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> They get the job done and are very close that I do not need to use them but a couple of times a week.</li>
            <li> I like how it takes off baby hairs on the face, but it really is microdermabrasion (sp?).</li>
            <li> Product arrived fast which is another plus</li>
            <li> The real tinkle razors have the name on them.</li>
            <li> So bought it for myself, and I really like them a lot.  </li>
            <li> or I just don&#x27;t have time to pluck my eyebrows and they work really well.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work like the real thing.</li>
            <li> Much easier and faster than plucking.</li>
            <li> Good for lip and face hair, particularly that blonde baby fuzz but also the darker hairs that continue to plague my lip, despite all of the electrolysis I did back in the early 90s</li>
            <li> I normally spend $11 on an eyebrow waxing, but I never will again after finding these!  </li>
            <li> No more peach fuzz on my face, love it!</li>
            <li> But since it took me a few minutes to get the hang of it in the first place, I want to play around with it some more to see if I can figure out how to get &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> Compared to a fancy creme or wax at your local salon, these are a true bargain.</li>
            <li> the long blades are hard to find in the regular stores, so these are perfect.</li>
            <li> Nice eyebrow razors, they do their job pretty well and help me avoid paying someone to painfully rip out my eyebrow hair :3 will be re-ordering</li>
            <li> I wanted to try these out after watching Michelle Money highly recommended them.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a large amount of facial hair, but it was becoming more noticeable recently (at least to me!).</li>
            <li> It feels nothing more than a little scratch.</li>
            <li> The razors are not so sharp that they will cut your face, but it gets rid of the peach fuzz easily.  </li>
            <li> arrived quickly and were pretty sharp.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s gentle - no cuts or nicks to speak of thus far.</li>
            <li> I must start hot waxing again because that really works and with time they disappear as they did on my upper lip area.  </li>
            <li> Most of the methods I&#x27;ve tried made my face break out, took too long or still left hair on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was super self conscious of the peach fuzz on my upper lip and also my side burns.</li>
            <li> These little things are super sharp and easy to use!  </li>
            <li> It was pretty gross the first time seeing how much hair I actually had on my face.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live with out these.</li>
            <li> I found that holding the blade perpendicular to your skin doesn&#x27;t work well; you kind of have to hold it parallel to your face (like with the blade facing down instead of facing your skin directly).</li>
            <li> I realize that you can get them for less money elsewhere, but I do almost all of my shopping online - and I still think that these are a fantastic value.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light and small that it doesn&#x27;t even feel like a real razor, so in her mind, it&#x27;s not like she&#x27;s shaving her face.</li>
            <li> These are pure and utter junk.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear make up, but this makes my skin look clear.</li>
            <li> The product works very well at getting rid of the unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely purchase Tinkle razors in the future, and leave the off brand at the store.</li>
            <li> my eyebrows look professionally done...</li>
            <li> Having extremely sensitive skin I cannot use any type of razor on my legs.</li>
            <li> Have a professional do that or stick to just your tweezers.</li>
            <li> Old age brings chin whiskers  </li>
            <li> but it was so gentle I got used to it the second time around.</li>
            <li> These work very well on facial hair.</li>
            <li> Decided to try shaving the peach fuzz like she did in the video and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> They did become dull rather quickly using them this way, but they served their purpose well at first.</li>
            <li> These are too long to really get in there.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought tinkles directly in New York and these are not the same.</li>
            <li> I never had a &amp;#34;hairy&amp;#34; face, as I have light hair, but its crazy how smooth your face looks without any hair on it.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough for my delicate lady skin, but strong enough for my hairy face!</li>
            <li> It was a total waste of time, did not work at all, would like to be reimbursed if it wasn&#x27;t so cheap to start with</li>
            <li> Gets very close to the skin without a single nick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaply made, dull, and it just doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first but definitely worth buying for the cheap cost.</li>
            <li> Tip: for getting in the hard to reach areas of your eyebrows, like the inner corner of your eyes, just use the top 1/4 inch of the razor; don&#x27;t try and use the entire thing.</li>
            <li> So that was kind of weird and not intuitive, but</li>
            <li> My pretty 12-year-old daughter has black hair</li>
            <li> I broke out a little after I used them the first time</li>
            <li> Just be careful around the eyelash area since it&#x27;s a longer blade, you can easily take off a few lashes!</li>
            <li> a precise angle so very hard to use -</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and most of them have been very dull.</li>
            <li> Flat out didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> they do not last as long as my wife thought</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the razors are sharp enough they seem pretty dull and are not performing the way I thought they would.  </li>
            <li> What a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Larger than I expected</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve stayed sharp and they haven&#x27;t rusted at even after I got them wet several times.</li>
            <li> Seller should be shut down for deceiving the public.</li>
            <li> Wish I knew about these a long time ago!!</li>
            <li> It irritated my skin and left small red marks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp but not so sharp that you constantly have to worry you are going to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not a razor.</li>
            <li> The off brand feels rough and scratchy.</li>
            <li> Just be careful of the tip when using on your face... can cut you.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The blades are rough.  </li>
            <li> Was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> REALLY WIDE FOR BROWNS, I HAVE FOUND NARROWER ONES.  </li>
            <li> Since I have absolutely no experience with eyebrow shapers I&#x27;m going to assume it works.</li>
            <li> Turns out that the razors on these things are so long that unless you want to shave off your entire eyebrow, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for eyebrows or any other small areas.</li>
            <li> The razors are sharp, be careful.  </li>
            <li> Used these to clean up a cat&#x27;s fur clumps without cutting her or freaking her out with electric clippers.</li>
            <li> You have seen it, you look at other women and see hair on their face glistening in the sun.</li>
            <li> Heard about these reading other reviews on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Sharp objects and eyes just don&#x27;t go together.  </li>
            <li> The directions say you can put shaving cream on your face first, but that would just feel weird to me haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This are imitation Tinkle.</li>
            <li> Razors felt dull and not the actual name brand product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it four stars because it&#x27;s hard to find an angle to do it.</li>
            <li> The secret to avoiding razor burn is to just use them softly.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no need to push down, just let them glide over the area you want hair removal.  </li>
            <li> I have to shave up and down, side ways, and every which way, and keep going over it 20 times before the hair is gone.</li>
            <li> The heads are small enough to get into small places.  </li>
            <li> So your safe!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and a half now</li>
            <li> but since the handle is so long they can be hard to maneuver.</li>
            <li> and yes, a little black mustache.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I feel a little pull when I have thicker hair</li>
            <li> The razors I received were not as sharp as the usual product.</li>
            <li> Once you use the little shavers you will not be without them.</li>
            <li> I did try it on the brow area but that made me a little nervous (MM did not recommend this).</li>
            <li> I use these little shapers whenever I&#x27;m out and about</li>
            <li> Not too sharp!!</li>
            <li> Are not good for trim eyebrow, too long and cut my skin.</li>
            <li> Now I just do it every couple of days to get dead skin off.</li>
            <li> Waxing is way too messy and time consuming.</li>
            <li> and so it&#x27;s not so harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> It slightly dried out/irritated my skin, but putting moisturizer on before/</li>
            <li> I usually pull the razor out once a week, put a little moisturizer on my face before for a little lubrication</li>
            <li> I threw on a little coconut oil and voila! -</li>
            <li> they nick my skin and instead of gently shaping them they painfully pull out the hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because Walmart stopped carrying the small ones that I used to use for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Useless - only works if your holding it</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using this wrong but didn&#x27;t work for me in removing facial hair.</li>
            <li> i usually just use a bik &amp; i</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m scared to do the laser there - not sure why.</li>
            <li> No more tweezers.</li>
            <li> Too hard to get into the small spaces.  </li>
            <li> I was buying the crappy ones from walmart, and they are just too dull, and have a small surface for the razor.</li>
            <li> i am having a hard time with these.</li>
            <li> i find them hard to work with.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Results were satisfactory, although there were some spots that were some stragglers and some places that were hard to get.</li>
            <li> sorry i spent the money</li>
            <li> We all, as we age, get hair where we least want it.  </li>
            <li> Creams always seem to irritate my delicate skin.</li>
            <li> I have thick brows, and I have been using these razors for almost a year now, so I am used to working with them.</li>
            <li> Slow going, but did not pose a risk of nicking her skin.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, so waxing is a no-go because of ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> And this is with a brand new razor :(</li>
            <li> No more visible peach fuzz everywhere!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to give her the message that she needs something painful, time-consuming and complicated like bleaching, waxing or tweezing but on the other hand, it&#x27;s hard to be self-conscious in middle school.</li>
            <li> , also it wasn&#x27;t bad enough to where it made me not want to keep trying.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of waxing and didn&#x27;t like the pulling on my delicate skin.</li>
            <li> No name on the handles, no packaging, and very dull.</li>
            <li> It gave me shave bumps, didn&#x27;t like the blade &amp; handle too long :(</li>
            <li> I am addicted.  </li>
            <li> Unable to find them anywhere.</li>
            <li> Hair removing cremes are equally messy and time consuming, plus the smell is really annoying.</li>
            <li> Not impressed, not upset.</li>
            <li> a little bit terrible smell</li>
            <li> It was impossible to control what got trimmed.</li>
            <li> I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed</li>
            <li> I literally hate plucking my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product - it scraped my skin, but did not remove any hairs!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product. Saved me a trip to Sally&#x27;s. The blade is a bit shorter than what I had used previously but still does a good job</li>
            <li> Saw a piece on the news about women shaving their face with these for exfoliation and facial hair removal and I have to say I&#x27;m hooked. I don&#x27;t wear make up, but this makes my skin look clear. It was pretty gross the first time seeing how much hair I actually had on my face. Now I just do it every couple of days to get dead skin off. It also works great for its intended use of eyebrows, no more waxing for me!</li>
            <li> Nothing to rave about. It&#x27;s really not a razor. More like a scraper. Too hard to get into the small spaces.  It irritated my skin and left small red marks.  Going back to wax</li>
            <li> These work so great for eyebrow shaping.  You get a really nice line, more like you&#x27;d get with threading than with waxing or plucking.  The secret to avoiding razor burn is to just use them softly.  There&#x27;s no need to push down, just let them glide over the area you want hair removal.  This product was recommended to me by kandeej - google her, she&#x27;s a fantastic beauty blogger! I&#x27;m so thrilled to have listened to her advice because, honestly, I was able to get more of an arch using these than I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a salon.  I normally spend $11 on an eyebrow waxing, but I never will again after finding these!  I realize that you can get them for less money elsewhere, but I do almost all of my shopping online - and I still think that these are a fantastic value.  Tip: for getting in the hard to reach areas of your eyebrows, like the inner corner of your eyes, just use the top 1/4 inch of the razor; don&#x27;t try and use the entire thing.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a very short razor to use on the outer 1/3 of my eyebrows.  These are too long to really get in there.  And they are not proper razors.  You can still feel the stubble even after going over the skin several times.  My old razor that I used on my armpits works better than these.</li>
            <li> There are great eyebrow shapers but I love a smaller handle. Nice to get 3 at a time and the cover for them.</li>
            <li> My pretty 12-year-old daughter has black hair and yes, a little black mustache. She was starting to feel self-conscious about it. I didn&#x27;t want to give her the message that she needs something painful, time-consuming and complicated like bleaching, waxing or tweezing but on the other hand, it&#x27;s hard to be self-conscious in middle school. With 3 or 4 quick strokes of this &amp;#34;shaper,&amp;#34; she now can be mustache-free. It&#x27;s so light and small that it doesn&#x27;t even feel like a real razor, so in her mind, it&#x27;s not like she&#x27;s shaving her face. She&#x27;s &amp;#34;derma-planning.&amp;#34; Plus, I can get rid of the peach fuzz on my cheeks!</li>
            <li> I bought these to trim my eyebrows. They are called eye brow shapers, no? But the blade is so large they should be called eye brow removers. It was impossible to control what got trimmed.</li>
            <li> I learned about this eyebrow shaper from a YouTube video. (User is Uppiesbeads59 )The beauty blogger showed how this razor could be used to get rid of the peach fuzz we ladies sometimes have. The product works very well at getting rid of the unwanted facial hair. It was easy to use and the results are fantastic. The razor is gentle on the skin and I didn&#x27;t suffer any nicks or skin irritation. I haven&#x27;t used it on my eyebrows as it seems a bit too big for use in that area. I am well pleased with the Tinkle Eyebrow shapers and highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I tried these after watching Michelle Money&#x27;s youtube video. I ordered from Amazon but found eyebrow shapers at my local store. I purchased as I wanted to try them right away. The local purchase was NOT Tinkle brand. The quality difference is day and night. The off brand feels rough and scratchy. I bought the razors to shave my upper lip. Tinkle razors work perfectly, after a few passes the hair is removed. I will absolutely purchase Tinkle razors in the future, and leave the off brand at the store. Amazon, you owe Michelle Money big for her recommendation!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I was buying the crappy ones from walmart, and they are just too dull, and have a small surface for the razor. This product is perfect.  I use it on my whole face to get all those pesky hairs off! no one wants to see hair on a woman&#x27;s face.  I will be buying more! great price too!!! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Works great for fine facial hair as well.  Quality is just OK.  Broke one (blade came off) when cleaning it.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and product as described.</li>
            <li> I have very light brown/dirty blonde hair and super baby thing/peach fuzz hairs on my face. These don&#x27;t always seem to get all the hair off. I have to shave up and down, side ways, and every which way, and keep going over it 20 times before the hair is gone. And this is with a brand new razor :(</li>
            <li> Exactly as described! Quick shipping! Thank You!</li>
            <li> These are the REAL TINKLE razors, not a knock-off. Purchased this specific brand over others after watching a video with Michelle Money using this product. I have tried other brands and most of them have been very dull. This one is great!! It&#x27;s sharp but not so sharp that you constantly have to worry you are going to cut yourself. It&#x27;s great for shaving the vellus hair on face. It&#x27;s not so great for eyebrows as the blade is very large and hard to maneuver around the eyebrow area. I would suggest the Personna Eyebrow Shapers for eyebrows and Tinkle for face. I love this product and will continue to purchase this brand. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because Walmart stopped carrying the small ones that I used to use for my eyebrows. I thought these would probably work somewhat the same. Turns out that the razors on these things are so long that unless you want to shave off your entire eyebrow, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for eyebrows or any other small areas. There&#x27;s no way to use the large razor on these to get detailed areas. I suggest finding something that doesn&#x27;t have such a huge razor on it.</li>
            <li> These came unpackaged and don&#x27;t say &amp;#34;Tinkle&amp;#34; on them.  I am pretty sure they are a knock-off.  They may be just as good, but I am a little hesitant to use them since they weren&#x27;t sealed in a package!</li>
            <li> These came on time and they work with perfect precision. Great to hide away in my purse or in bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> quick, easy, affordable</li>
            <li> These razors are really amazing. I was a little skeptical at first but definitely worth buying for the cheap cost. I wasn&#x27;t sure about shaving your facial hairs would be safe but it totally is, just use with precaution.</li>
            <li> I am currently unemployed, so I can not afford to have my eyebrows threaded as I have done in the past....since I am now doing my eyebrows myself, this product makes doing-it-myself affordable &amp; beautiful...my eyebrows look professionally done...awesome product &amp; great value.</li>
            <li> Ugh! These things don&#x27;t work at all! All it did was irritate my skin. It didn&#x27;t remove any hair at all!</li>
            <li> So glad I found this product! Sharp enough to make it very easy to use and do a good job while not cutting yourself. Leaves skin extremely smooth after use.</li>
            <li> love it!!!  I keep one in my car, just in case.  It might be gross, but it&#x27;s great for toe hair</li>
            <li> I cant comment on about them since I bought them for my mom. I needed an item to make a purchase to $25 so I&#x27;d get free shipping for the order.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Just be careful of the tip when using on your face... can cut you.</li>
            <li> Not something I will use...</li>
            <li> Flat out didn&#x27;t work. They didn&#x27;t remove the hair.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  The blades are rough.  Does not feel good on face.  I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough for my delicate lady skin, but strong enough for my hairy face!</li>
            <li> Useless - only works if your holding it a precise angle so very hard to use - sorry i spent the money</li>
            <li> Safe. I didn&#x27;t cut myself. Quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I bought these after seeing many recommendations online. I don&#x27;t have a large amount of facial hair, but it was becoming more noticeable recently (at least to me!). These razors are soooo easy to use. It never hurt, I never cut myself, and my skin feels so smooth now! This has become a regular part of my weekly beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it no stars if I could this sucked .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the razors are sharp enough they seem pretty dull and are not performing the way I thought they would.  But service was good and on time.</li>
            <li> They work well. Sometimes I feel a little pull when I have thicker hair I&#x27;m trying to remove. Overall a good buy though.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it.  We all, as we age, get hair where we least want it.  For me it is my upper lip.  I can grow quite the mustache if I wanted to (although some may disagree).  I tried an epilator (OUCH), wax (OUCH AGAIN), and battery operated facial hair removers which worked okay but were a bit cumbersome.  These little razors are perfect. They get the job done and are very close that I do not need to use them but a couple of times a week.</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected.  I would not order again.  It pulled at the skin and made it red.  I would recommend a regular razor versus that one.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used them much but for the one time I have used them, they seem to work fine.</li>
            <li> These little razors are great!  I use them for my chin hairs and my eyebrows.  The razors are sharp, be careful.  The heads are small enough to get into small places.  I just love these things!</li>
            <li> Cheap razors I bought 12. Unfortunately no instructions at all, no cleaning tips.  Willing to pay a few more bucks for better instructions.&lt;br /&gt;As received, I would never purchase again.</li>
            <li> These are great and easy. worth the price</li>
            <li> It does not cut as well as I would like. Bought it on the pretense that it would shave fine facial hairs...not so much!</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot! I like how it takes off baby hairs on the face, but it really is microdermabrasion (sp?). I found my skin was smooth, so when I later applied moisturizer and then foundation, it all applied so smoothly! Need more of these beauties in my corner!</li>
            <li> These are great, take off the hair easily and extra dead skin as well.  I broke out a little after I used them the first time but i think it&#x27;s because my skin isn&#x27;t used to it yet, also it wasn&#x27;t bad enough to where it made me not want to keep trying.  Made my skin feel so smooth and my  makeup looked great!</li>
            <li> I have thick brows, and I have been using these razors for almost a year now, so I am used to working with them. The razors I received were not as sharp as the usual product. I don&#x27;t know if they were a knock off or what. But I now have a bump in the middle of my forehead. I reordered from a different seller and got the quality I wanted from that purchase.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite eyebrow shapers and this is a better price than you can find them in stores (if you can even find them).</li>
            <li> perfect, just as pictured</li>
            <li> I received the razors today. They came in a bag and were wrapped in bubble wrap. They are not even the Tinkle brand and they are cheaply made. I have yet to see if they even work!</li>
            <li> arrived quickly and were pretty sharp. (a good thing!)</li>
            <li> These little things are super sharp and easy to use!  Just be careful around the eyelash area since it&#x27;s a longer blade, you can easily take off a few lashes!</li>
            <li> It was a total waste of time, did not work at all, would like to be reimbursed if it wasn&#x27;t so cheap to start with</li>
            <li> These are amazing, The difference they make in the texture and look of my face is awesome. I never had a &amp;#34;hairy&amp;#34; face, as I have light hair, but its crazy how smooth your face looks without any hair on it. I am constantly wanting to ask hairy faced women &amp;#34;would you like to borrow my tinkle?&amp;#34; Great product, and so worth the few bucks.</li>
            <li> the long blades are hard to find in the regular stores, so these are perfect. I will reorder in the future</li>
            <li> I have looked all over for these since discovering them once in a store. Unable to find them anywhere. So glad I thought of giving Amazon a try! Once you use the little shavers you will not be without them. They are invaluable!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing. works very well and very good price. i recommend this product. love it. love it .. love it.</li>
            <li> The final word for good grooming.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, arrived in perfect condition. Great for close shave of light hair.</li>
            <li> It gave me shave bumps, didn&#x27;t like the blade &amp; handle too long :(</li>
            <li> These are my go to shapers they are quick and efficient and get the job done every time. I recommend this product for anyone who needs a quick touch up at home or on the go!</li>
            <li> I love the product itself was very easy to use.  Product arrived fast which is another plus aND the price was great.  What I didn&#x27;t like was the product didn&#x27;t come in the cardboard package that shows in the pictures. It was 3 razors rolled up in bubble wrap this made me wonder if they were used before ? Besides that issue these are a great product.</li>
            <li> Excellent,  fast service!  Arrived way earlier than anticipated.  Thank you! !</li>
            <li> I get a few good uses out of them but since the handle is so long they can be hard to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, well designed to give a good angle of coverage, and works effectively.</li>
            <li> These are pure and utter junk. You might as well grab a steak knife and run it along your face. It&#x27;s cheaply made, dull, and it just doesn&#x27;t work.  What a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using this wrong but didn&#x27;t work for me in removing facial hair.</li>
            <li> Good quality. But you should be careful when using it because it will remove your brows immediately and easily when you are not paying attention!</li>
            <li> I used to get these from my cousin in Baja as an alternative to razors to shave my legs. Having extremely sensitive skin I cannot use any type of razor on my legs. Waxing is way too messy and time consuming. Hair removing cremes are equally messy and time consuming, plus the smell is really annoying. So I tried these out on my skin and they worked, but after not being able to get these from Baja I looked for them on Amazon. They&#x27;re from the same company as the ones I used to get but somehow these are more cheaply made. I find that even when using them on my eyebrows they nick my skin and instead of gently shaping them they painfully pull out the hair. I&#x27;m going to look for different ones because these aren&#x27;t working for me and are leaving scrapes and cuts on my legs.</li>
            <li> Love the size, how easy to use.  Does the job without making you feel like you are shaving.  Doesn&#x27;t cause scrapes or cuts.</li>
            <li> Works great!! Love em!! Not too sharp!!</li>
            <li> Good for shaping eyebrows, etc.</li>
            <li> Quick, easy to use, safe and neat</li>
            <li> Larger than I expected but I love these razors!!!</li>
            <li> Used these to clean up a cat&#x27;s fur clumps without cutting her or freaking her out with electric clippers. Slow going, but did not pose a risk of nicking her skin. They did become dull rather quickly using them this way, but they served their purpose well at first.</li>
            <li> Blades are HUGE.  My skin went into a downward spiral of breakouts galore after using this to shave my face.  Not using these again.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try these out after watching Michelle Money highly recommended them.  They are great!  The razors are not so sharp that they will cut your face, but it gets rid of the peach fuzz easily.  My makeup goes on super smooth after I shave with the Tinkle razor which I do every couple of weeks now.  I am addicted.  Also, they were cheap and arrived fast.  I would purchase from this seller again.  But do not use to shape your eyebrows!  Have a professional do that or stick to just your tweezers.</li>
            <li> REALLY WIDE FOR BROWNS, I HAVE FOUND NARROWER ONES.  HOWEVER, IT&#x27;S GREAT FOR SHAVING THE PEACH FUZZ OFF YOUR FACE....MICHELLE MONEY RECOMMENDS THEM FOR THAT PURPOSE</li>
            <li> Perfect for facial and arm hair removal!</li>
            <li> I found this is good for fuzz but not chin whiskers.  Old age brings chin whiskers  and I couldn&#x27;t get it to cut them at all.  Tried and tried and finally  just went to razor.  Plucking works too.  I must start hot waxing again because that really works and with time they disappear as they did on my upper lip area.  The Tinkle is great for eyebrows and face fuzz, easy to use even while watching TV but only for fine hairs in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Ehhhh. Not impressed, not upset. Just ehhh.</li>
            <li> Razors felt dull and not the actual name brand product. The real tinkle razors have the name on them.</li>
            <li> Watched a video on Youtube about women shaving their &amp;#34;fuzz&amp;#34; off their faces. You have seen it, you look at other women and see hair on their face glistening in the sun. Chin hair, you got them, side burns, you have them too.  Clean it up and feel more confidant!  This product is amazing! Give it a shot!  Once a week.</li>
            <li> cute, works well, like it</li>
            <li> Heard about these reading other reviews on Amazon.  So bought it for myself, and I really like them a lot.  I&#x27;m still figuring out to use them.  I think I will re-watch a video to make sure I&#x27;m using it correctly!  But, it is worth every penny for sure!  THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> i am having a hard time with these. i don&#x27;t find they give me a close enough shave. i find them hard to work with. i usually just use a bik &amp; i find that gives me a closer shave for my face &amp; easier to use.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I was tired of waxing and didn&#x27;t like the pulling on my delicate skin. After reading a NYT article about women shaving their faces and watching a you tube video referenced in the article (Michelle Money&#x27;s, The Money Look - this woman should do stand-up; she&#x27;s a riot.) I threw on a little coconut oil and voila! - the hair was gone. And it doesn&#x27;t grow back thicker. Once a week and I&#x27;m good. I did try it on the brow area but that made me a little nervous (MM did not recommend this). Sharp objects and eyes just don&#x27;t go together.  Good for lip and face hair, particularly that blonde baby fuzz but also the darker hairs that continue to plague my lip, despite all of the electrolysis I did back in the early 90s (I&#x27;m scared to do the laser there - not sure why. That would surely nip it in the bud.) Bottom line: it does the trick and literally takes minutes! And it&#x27;s gentle - no cuts or nicks to speak of thus far.</li>
            <li> Since I have absolutely no experience with eyebrow shapers I&#x27;m going to assume it works. I&#x27;m only giving it four stars because it&#x27;s hard to find an angle to do it.</li>
            <li> Worked OK, kind of dull.</li>
            <li> I love it is was really helpful and it had the brand name.</li>
            <li> What a great find. No more tweezers. It actually is so simple to use and no cuts. Helps avoid ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I was super self conscious of the peach fuzz on my upper lip and also my side burns. This is the best thing I discovered thanks to a youtube video I found on AwesomenessTV and Michelle from the Bachelor. I&#x27;ve tried waxing, epliating, tweezing and those coil/spring hair removal devices. Most of the methods I&#x27;ve tried made my face break out, took too long or still left hair on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I was just amazed how much hair there was on my face!!! I was scared at first that I would accidently cut myself because RAZOR but it was so gentle I got used to it the second time around. It feels nothing more than a little scratch. I tried it on my arm and it totally removed the hair there too so it definitely removes thicker hair. I usually pull the razor out once a week, put a little moisturizer on my face before for a little lubrication and so it&#x27;s not so harsh on my skin. Then after, I just wash my face to get rid of the excess hair. Leaves my face super smooth with no breakouts!&lt;br /&gt;Oh! and for those who have darker hair it didn&#x27;t grow back darker or thicker (thank god!) So your safe!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and a half now and I just love this product. For sure repurchasing it!</li>
            <li> These are great!!! Wish I knew about these a long time ago!!</li>
            <li> These were just okay.. not as sharp as I had wanted them to be but good enough. But will try another brand next time! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know. I have to play with them a little more, but I was pretty satisfied with my initial trial (used on face). It slightly dried out/irritated my skin, but putting moisturizer on before/after would probably help. It was VERY mild though, and I have obnoxiously sensitive skin, so that shouldn&#x27;t be of major concern to most peeps. The directions say you can put shaving cream on your face first, but that would just feel weird to me haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me a minute to get the hang of it. I found that holding the blade perpendicular to your skin doesn&#x27;t work well; you kind of have to hold it parallel to your face (like with the blade facing down instead of facing your skin directly). So that was kind of weird and not intuitive, but whatever. Works better going with the grain rather than against.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results were satisfactory, although there were some spots that were some stragglers and some places that were hard to get. But since it took me a few minutes to get the hang of it in the first place, I want to play around with it some more to see if I can figure out how to get &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> a little bit terrible smell</li>
            <li> nice product, will order again</li>
            <li> So far they work great!!  Great deal!</li>
            <li> They took a bit of time (3wks) to arrive to Australia, but they work like a charm!</li>
            <li> I use these little shapers whenever I&#x27;m out and about or I just don&#x27;t have time to pluck my eyebrows and they work really well. They&#x27;ve stayed sharp and they haven&#x27;t rusted at even after I got them wet several times. Highly satisfied!</li>
            <li> Omggeee they work so gooodd 😍😍</li>
            <li> These must be a generic version. They don&#x27;t work like the real thing. I would not buy. I&#x27;ve bought tinkles directly in New York and these are not the same.</li>
            <li> They work just as they said. I will use again!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product - it scraped my skin, but did not remove any hairs!</li>
            <li> Nice eyebrow razors, they do their job pretty well and help me avoid paying someone to painfully rip out my eyebrow hair :3 will be re-ordering</li>
            <li> These are the best razors ever!!! I won&#x27;t use anything else for my eyebrows or chin area and the upper lip ever again.</li>
            <li> These work very well on facial hair. They are also excellent for eyebrows, which really can&#x27;t be done with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live with out these. YouTube it if you need a tutorial on how to use them. No more peach fuzz on my face, love it!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great. No more visible peach fuzz everywhere! And my hair on face did not grow back thicker/darker...definite confident booster :)</li>
            <li> These are great. I def recommend them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a solution to the pesky facial hair that seems to be a gift of hitting my thirties. I have thick hair, so waxing is a no-go because of ingrown hairs. Creams always seem to irritate my delicate skin. Until I found this product, I thought I was doomed to a life of peach fuzz or one with an irritated, ingrown look. These are amazing. They get the fine hairs on my chin and upper lip. Gets very close to the skin without a single nick. Also? The price is AMAZING. Compared to a fancy creme or wax at your local salon, these are a true bargain. My beauty bag will never be without them again. I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Found out about these from watching a YouTube video from that bachelor tv show chick that shaves her face. Decided to try them cause I literally hate plucking my eyebrows. They are amazing once you get used to the awkwardness. Much easier and faster than plucking. Decided to try shaving the peach fuzz like she did in the video and was pleasantly surprised. Google the video. Way better than waxing.</li>
            <li> Are not good for trim eyebrow, too long and cut my skin. perfect for facial hair</li>
            <li> NOT the item pictured.  These are misrepresented as being Twinkle - they are not.  Seller should be shut down for deceiving the public.</li>
            <li> This are imitation Tinkle. No name on the handles, no packaging, and very dull. Extremely disappointed</li>
            <li> The package was opened when I received it and I don&#x27;t think they work well.</li>
            <li> didnt work quite like I thought it would. Just a razer with a different shape.</li>
            <li> I did not buy these for my eyebrows, I bought them for shaving the peach fuzz off my face. But they work perfectly.</li>
            <li> These babies are amazing! Will def. be repurchasing backups</li>
            <li> This eyebrow razor is okay, but they can be easily found at the 99 cent store since they are  of equal quality. (plus it would be much more convenient)</li>
            <li> on time. as promised.  works great!</li>
            <li> Product works great - as advertised. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> they do not last as long as my wife thought</li>
            <li> had these for a couple years.</li>
            <li> Saw a review on youtube where women used them for facial hair and it makes your skin so smooth and makes your skin so much prettier when makeup applied. Great Price! Will buy again!</li>
