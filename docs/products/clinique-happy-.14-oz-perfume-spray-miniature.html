            <li>Love this perfume.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always enjoyed this smell, so refreshing</li>
            <li>The price was ok.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume...</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light fragrance, but sort of warm if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite fragrances.  </li>
            <li>My favorite all time fragrance</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Wasnt sure if she was going to like it</li>
            <li>Love the product, not the packing.</li>
            <li>I interpreted the size to be 1.4 oz, more appropriate as a travel size or in my case a stocking stuffer.  </li>
            <li>This is more like a sample size at 0.14 oz and therefore not acceptable to give as any sort of gift.</li>
            <li>I always were Happy by Clinique, and I can tell the really thing from a knock-off.  </li>
            <li>lasts for hour :)</li>
            <li>Clinique product has ever had that issue, so it&#x27;s a safe purchase.</li>
            <li>Has been my favorite perfume for 20yrs.  </li>
            <li>Love this size for traveling.  </li>
            <li>Smell is okay not for me</li>
            <li>It smells lovely on me.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance,thank you.</li>
            <li>Love the size but the cap doesn&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li>so you are probably paying more for the packaging then the product.</li>
            <li>but he wanted to make sure that i gave this product a top notch review.</li>
            <li>if he could give it more</li>
            <li>im sure he would.</li>
            <li>I know how the perfume is supposed to smell like, since I have worn this fragrance for many years.  </li>
            <li>This one of my favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li>This tiny size is perfect for sliding into my purse.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorites, will purchase more.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a sample of Happy before purchasing - I had to give it 5 stars because it&#x27;s such a refreshing scent!</li>
            <li>This smelled just like it always does, arrived in good shape and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Well worth it!!</li>
            <li>This fresh scent is as lovely as I remember from 15 years ago!</li>
            <li>Smells so fresh, I love clinique!</li>
            <li>BUT THE LID COULD BE MORE SECURE</li>
            <li>Smells great, good size for the money ordered 2 at first then ordered 3 more then ordered a big bottle</li>
            <li>and I know Happy is clear in color.  </li>
            <li>LOVE that this is available.</li>
            <li>A light and refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>But other than that, happy with the service!</li>
            <li>Clinique Happy is a refreshing scent - wish I&#x27;d ordered a larger bottle.</li>
            <li>LOVE this so much, I kept it for myself!!</li>
            <li>It was the perfect little container.</li>
            <li>Perfect little gift for any girl for any reason.</li>
            <li>The smell is light but lingering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same happy</li>
            <li>Great smell, will buy a larger bottle.</li>

            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume, and was able to find it a lot cheaper than I did at a local store.</li>
            <li>quickly</li>
            <li>The bottle is much smaller than I expected but perfect for your purse or travels.</li>
            <li>something I&#x27;ll rarely use.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;ll be buying regularly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty scent, but I&#x27;m glad I bought a small version of it, for I don&#x27;t think it will be an every day scent, but it is nice.</li>
            <li>This spray mini is just the right size to carry in your purse, evening bag, or pocket.  </li>
            <li>Just right for purse or office</li>
            <li>I gave this as a Christmas gift and the person receiving it had had it before and thought it was all right.</li>
            <li>Yet I didn&#x27;t know it was going to be that small lol.</li>
            <li>Have never seen a bottle so SMALL lol, about the size fo a tube of Carmex lip balm.....</li>
            <li>Fresh, pretty and feminine.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to apply a nice bit of smell before you go out.  </li>
            <li>It smelled like a bug spray at first then faded away to nothing.</li>
            <li>wish i had ten more of these.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Very feminine and springy!</li>
            <li>The very thing for vacation!</li>
            <li>If you love a fragrance then get the larger bottle.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume, although I wish I would of bought a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li>I love it and definitely will be buying again</li>
            <li>many of these tiny bottle seem to have defective spritzer</li>
            <li>Totally recommend this perfume and the cute size.</li>
            <li>This was the first gift my fiance gave me for our first Valentine&#x27;s Day together.</li>
            <li>It is a strong, fresh scent that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Smaller than I expected for $7 but my favorite scent!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what it said and got it really fast.</li>
            <li>It smell soft and sweet.</li>
            <li>smells good but to small for the money</li>
            <li>Seems pretty light in scent and re-application necessary to hold onto the scent.</li>
            <li>and I wish I bought a few more!</li>
            <li>(I have done this on several occasions to test a new fragrance; sometimes what smells good at the time doesn&#x27;t necessarily \\&quot;wear\\&quot; well.  </li>
            <li>This tiny  bottle is only 2\\&quot; tall, and most of that is the lid!  </li>
            <li>No false counterfeit aroma.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading this</li>
            <li>This was the real thing, just what I paid for; .14 oz.</li>
            <li>The scent is very distinctive.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything I can think of but it absolutely WILL NOT SPRAY</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Im very satisified with the price and packageing.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and I couldn&#x27;t be happier that I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>fast shipping..thank you...</li>
            <li>Smells very citrus-like.</li>
            <li>thanks Amazon for making suggstion</li>
            <li>this is a soft scented perfume it is nice to wear to work, or out on the town, or even having a romantic eve being a soft scent it serves the purpose</li>
            <li>That is a very flattering compliment, and I proudly tell them my secret.</li>
            <li>I  will order a new one pretty soon.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this perfume, lasts all day long!!!!  </li>
            <li>(you&#x27;ll notice the description says the original price is $25.00) is a  TOTAL crock!!  </li>
            <li>it is a little to small but smell good !!</li>
            <li>exactly what i was expecting it to smell i love it... will definitely be wearing it as often as possible</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a downer when you spend $50-$100 for a new perfume, only to find out later</li>
            <li>It makes a great gift, its small enough to travel with and goes well with a clinique gift set.</li>
            <li>nice smell but too small quantity...</li>
            <li>Fun for daytime outside activities because the scent is lasting and stays clean.</li>
            <li>My daughter wanted this particular perfume for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this cute little bottle to everyone.</li>
            <li>Cute little bottles to carry in purse.</li>
            <li>my friend like it very much and want me to buy her again but this this time she wants the big one...</li>
            <li>very pleasing and soft smell</li>
            <li>..also love the smell not to heavy..</li>
            <li>This was perfect and the bottle was not old or stale.</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance and really appreciate the opportunity to buy a small size.</li>
            <li>however the bottle is smaller than I thought it would be; it made me laugh.  </li>
            <li>love the smell, scent doesnt last very long</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without perfume every morning.  </li>
            <li>So far the only stuff that stays to its smell no changes easy to spot and look the same.</li>
            <li>This perfume is so small and does not smell like clinique happy, not worth it at all for what they charge for shipping.</li>
            <li>I love this little bottle!</li>
            <li>I believe this cologne was very old.  </li>
            <li>While I LOVE this perfume, this miniscule sample is usually what is included in a Gift-With-Purchase.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually never without some.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care for this scent very much, glad I purchased a small version.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I personally would go to store and try them out first.</li>
            <li>I bought this tiny size, after I accidentally left my bottle in a hotel room, to hold me over until my original 3.4 oz size bottle could be returned to me.</li>
            <li>Package arrived early, and in new condition.  </li>
            <li>right out of the box wouldn&#x27;t work, took too long to show up.</li>
            <li>It is amazing that such a small bottle is even offered for sale.</li>
            <li>The size is ok for my purse though I wish they came a little bit bigger.</li>
            <li>Little smaller than I thought but nice all the same</li>
            <li>I order this on a Friday and got it the next Wednesday (a day early), so I am very &amp;#34;Happy&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely not the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Obviously I didn&#x27;t order much considering the size</li>
            <li>I think they sent me two old bottles.</li>
            <li>I always liked the smell of Clinique&#x27;s Happy, but this mini spray bottle is very poorly made and it is difficult to even get the perfume to come out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, I didnt realize it was going to be so small!</li>
            <li>This arrived very quickly in an envelope because it is just that small.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is fresh and not overpowering, while lasting a long time.</li>
            <li>and now it is available in a small size that fits into the quart-size bag that TSA requires for carry on baggage.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected to get.</li>
            <li>very small; ,but fine.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I always seem to see the bottom of the bottle too quickly!</li>
            <li>I gave it to her as a little surprise  ;-)</li>
            <li>I usually buy this product from the Clinique counter and just decided to buy from Amazon since the price was right.  </li>
            <li>I was very dissatified with the size not to mention this fragrance only last for about 15 minutes or less.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this perfume.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always enjoyed this smell, so refreshing</li>
            <li> The price was ok.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume...</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light fragrance, but sort of warm if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances.  </li>
            <li> My favorite all time fragrance</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Wasnt sure if she was going to like it</li>
            <li> Love the product, not the packing.</li>
            <li> I interpreted the size to be 1.4 oz, more appropriate as a travel size or in my case a stocking stuffer.  </li>
            <li> This is more like a sample size at 0.14 oz and therefore not acceptable to give as any sort of gift.</li>
            <li> I always were Happy by Clinique, and I can tell the really thing from a knock-off.  </li>
            <li> lasts for hour :)</li>
            <li> Clinique product has ever had that issue, so it&#x27;s a safe purchase.</li>
            <li> Has been my favorite perfume for 20yrs.  </li>
            <li> Love this size for traveling.  </li>
            <li> Smell is okay not for me</li>
            <li> It smells lovely on me.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance,thank you.</li>
            <li> Love the size but the cap doesn&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li> so you are probably paying more for the packaging then the product.</li>
            <li> but he wanted to make sure that i gave this product a top notch review.</li>
            <li> if he could give it more</li>
            <li> im sure he would.</li>
            <li> I know how the perfume is supposed to smell like, since I have worn this fragrance for many years.  </li>
            <li> This one of my favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li> This tiny size is perfect for sliding into my purse.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites, will purchase more.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a sample of Happy before purchasing - I had to give it 5 stars because it&#x27;s such a refreshing scent!</li>
            <li> This smelled just like it always does, arrived in good shape and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Well worth it!!</li>
            <li> This fresh scent is as lovely as I remember from 15 years ago!</li>
            <li> Smells so fresh, I love clinique!</li>
            <li> BUT THE LID COULD BE MORE SECURE</li>
            <li> Smells great, good size for the money ordered 2 at first then ordered 3 more then ordered a big bottle</li>
            <li> and I know Happy is clear in color.  </li>
            <li> LOVE that this is available.</li>
            <li> A light and refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> But other than that, happy with the service!</li>
            <li> Clinique Happy is a refreshing scent - wish I&#x27;d ordered a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> LOVE this so much, I kept it for myself!!</li>
            <li> It was the perfect little container.</li>
            <li> Perfect little gift for any girl for any reason.</li>
            <li> The smell is light but lingering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same happy</li>
            <li> Great smell, will buy a larger bottle.</li>

            <li> Love this perfume, and was able to find it a lot cheaper than I did at a local store.</li>
            <li> quickly</li>
            <li> The bottle is much smaller than I expected but perfect for your purse or travels.</li>
            <li> something I&#x27;ll rarely use.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ll be buying regularly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty scent, but I&#x27;m glad I bought a small version of it, for I don&#x27;t think it will be an every day scent, but it is nice.</li>
            <li> This spray mini is just the right size to carry in your purse, evening bag, or pocket.  </li>
            <li> Just right for purse or office</li>
            <li> I gave this as a Christmas gift and the person receiving it had had it before and thought it was all right.</li>
            <li> Yet I didn&#x27;t know it was going to be that small lol.</li>
            <li> Have never seen a bottle so SMALL lol, about the size fo a tube of Carmex lip balm.....</li>
            <li> Fresh, pretty and feminine.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to apply a nice bit of smell before you go out.  </li>
            <li> It smelled like a bug spray at first then faded away to nothing.</li>
            <li> wish i had ten more of these.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Very feminine and springy!</li>
            <li> The very thing for vacation!</li>
            <li> If you love a fragrance then get the larger bottle.  </li>
            <li> I love this perfume, although I wish I would of bought a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> I love it and definitely will be buying again</li>
            <li> many of these tiny bottle seem to have defective spritzer</li>
            <li> Totally recommend this perfume and the cute size.</li>
            <li> This was the first gift my fiance gave me for our first Valentine&#x27;s Day together.</li>
            <li> It is a strong, fresh scent that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected for $7 but my favorite scent!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what it said and got it really fast.</li>
            <li> It smell soft and sweet.</li>
            <li> smells good but to small for the money</li>
            <li> Seems pretty light in scent and re-application necessary to hold onto the scent.</li>
            <li> and I wish I bought a few more!</li>
            <li> (I have done this on several occasions to test a new fragrance; sometimes what smells good at the time doesn&#x27;t necessarily \\&quot;wear\\&quot; well.  </li>
            <li> This tiny  bottle is only 2\\&quot; tall, and most of that is the lid!  </li>
            <li> No false counterfeit aroma.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading this</li>
            <li> This was the real thing, just what I paid for; .14 oz.</li>
            <li> The scent is very distinctive.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything I can think of but it absolutely WILL NOT SPRAY</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Im very satisified with the price and packageing.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and I couldn&#x27;t be happier that I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> fast shipping..thank you...</li>
            <li> Smells very citrus-like.</li>
            <li> thanks Amazon for making suggstion</li>
            <li> this is a soft scented perfume it is nice to wear to work, or out on the town, or even having a romantic eve being a soft scent it serves the purpose</li>
            <li> That is a very flattering compliment, and I proudly tell them my secret.</li>
            <li> I  will order a new one pretty soon.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this perfume, lasts all day long!!!!  </li>
            <li> (you&#x27;ll notice the description says the original price is $25.00) is a  TOTAL crock!!  </li>
            <li> it is a little to small but smell good !!</li>
            <li> exactly what i was expecting it to smell i love it... will definitely be wearing it as often as possible</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of a downer when you spend $50-$100 for a new perfume, only to find out later</li>
            <li> It makes a great gift, its small enough to travel with and goes well with a clinique gift set.</li>
            <li> nice smell but too small quantity...</li>
            <li> Fun for daytime outside activities because the scent is lasting and stays clean.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this particular perfume for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this cute little bottle to everyone.</li>
            <li> Cute little bottles to carry in purse.</li>
            <li> my friend like it very much and want me to buy her again but this this time she wants the big one...</li>
            <li> very pleasing and soft smell</li>
            <li> ..also love the smell not to heavy..</li>
            <li> This was perfect and the bottle was not old or stale.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance and really appreciate the opportunity to buy a small size.</li>
            <li> however the bottle is smaller than I thought it would be; it made me laugh.  </li>
            <li> love the smell, scent doesnt last very long</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without perfume every morning.  </li>
            <li> So far the only stuff that stays to its smell no changes easy to spot and look the same.</li>
            <li> This perfume is so small and does not smell like clinique happy, not worth it at all for what they charge for shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this little bottle!</li>
            <li> I believe this cologne was very old.  </li>
            <li> While I LOVE this perfume, this miniscule sample is usually what is included in a Gift-With-Purchase.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually never without some.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this scent very much, glad I purchased a small version.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I personally would go to store and try them out first.</li>
            <li> I bought this tiny size, after I accidentally left my bottle in a hotel room, to hold me over until my original 3.4 oz size bottle could be returned to me.</li>
            <li> Package arrived early, and in new condition.  </li>
            <li> right out of the box wouldn&#x27;t work, took too long to show up.</li>
            <li> It is amazing that such a small bottle is even offered for sale.</li>
            <li> The size is ok for my purse though I wish they came a little bit bigger.</li>
            <li> Little smaller than I thought but nice all the same</li>
            <li> I order this on a Friday and got it the next Wednesday (a day early), so I am very &amp;#34;Happy&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely not the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Obviously I didn&#x27;t order much considering the size</li>
            <li> I think they sent me two old bottles.</li>
            <li> I always liked the smell of Clinique&#x27;s Happy, but this mini spray bottle is very poorly made and it is difficult to even get the perfume to come out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, I didnt realize it was going to be so small!</li>
            <li> This arrived very quickly in an envelope because it is just that small.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is fresh and not overpowering, while lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> and now it is available in a small size that fits into the quart-size bag that TSA requires for carry on baggage.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected to get.</li>
            <li> very small; ,but fine.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I always seem to see the bottom of the bottle too quickly!</li>
            <li> I gave it to her as a little surprise  ;-)</li>
            <li> I usually buy this product from the Clinique counter and just decided to buy from Amazon since the price was right.  </li>
            <li> I was very dissatified with the size not to mention this fragrance only last for about 15 minutes or less.  </li>
            <li> but it goes by fast in such a small container</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear perfume often, so this tiny bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> and i live the small size</li>
            <li> You would think that with the bottle being so small it would be the real deal, but not true.  </li>
            <li> Only need a little as its alcohol based</li>
            <li> but the sprayer doesn&#x27;t work, it only comes out in little streams.</li>
            <li> It was as expected, however I did not make out because of the shipping costs</li>
            <li> it makes you smell like \\&quot;Eau de Wet</li>
            <li> And since you probably KNOW how small 1 ounce is, this only contains .14 of an ounce!!  </li>
            <li> My only criticism is that it is sooooo small.</li>
            <li> Other suppliers were asking obscene amounts for this itty-bity thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Always love Clinique, my bad for ordering such a small amount!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little expensive for the size, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Something is not right with this.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was a bit bigger for at least 10 dollars..</li>
            <li> Not a special as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> when i first push the little tip started to leak to a side, plase dont buy sorry and thank for at least shipping.</li>
            <li> This perfume is really expensive, that&#x27;s why I got the smally one, but in another hand you have to know that using a little tiny bit you have it on you all day long.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just so little.</li>
            <li> The cap is not secure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway.......this situation  of selling samples really makes me angry (as I always get when trusting and unsuspecting  people are taken advantage of)!  </li>
            <li> And the size was extremely small for the price.</li>
            <li> I had a completely wrong idea as to how small this bottle actually is.  </li>
            <li> it would be so small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all of it as it was so small.  </li>
            <li> Not pleased with what I received</li>
            <li> Needed the small size for carry on luggage and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who travels and needs a small, compact, portable size.  </li>
            <li> I was kinda upset it was so small</li>
            <li> - I was not sure if I was going to like it.  </li>
            <li> Should have bought a few because this bottle is sooo small!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall for this; it is outrageous for someone to sell these when you  get them for FREE; if you ask for this sample at Nordstrom or Macy&#x27;s, they will just GIVE you one</li>
            <li> (I thought it would be at least twice the size)  </li>
            <li> It is very small</li>
            <li> Very very small.</li>
            <li> The size was very small</li>
            <li> and you can hardly tell ive used it!</li>
            <li> Not  a great recommendation for the price.</li>
            <li> it was so expensive that I could not</li>
            <li> ; I just wanted to give people a heads-up about this rip-off!  </li>
            <li> please sorry my ignorance</li>
            <li> Perfume is always expensive.</li>
            <li> it was obviously a sample out of a gift bag and smelled awful</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying it.</li>
            <li> This small version smelled terrible.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the smell.</li>
            <li> but I try today and after hour do not smell&#x3D;( maybe for baby perfium ...</li>
            <li> Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> crap&#x3D;</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed because I was going to take this size when I travel.</li>
            <li> this was crazy!!!  </li>
            <li> It smells terrible.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this perfume!  Yet I didn&#x27;t know it was going to be that small lol.</li>
            <li> Love it. Should have bought larger bottle</li>
            <li> I luv that perfume....</li>
            <li> right out of the box wouldn&#x27;t work, took too long to show up. price is the saving grace.</li>
            <li> It was as expected, however I did not make out because of the shipping costs</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter as a stocking stuffer and she loves it. She will probably purchase the full size.</li>
            <li> Never smelled before but thought I would try it since I heard great things about it. I was disappointed in the smell. Its more of something a grandmother would wear. And the size was extremely small for the price. Lesson learned!</li>
            <li> LOVE this so much, I kept it for myself!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to purchase this at a store it was so expensive that I could not but I could afford this one and when I run out I plan on buying it again</li>
            <li> I order this on a Friday and got it the next Wednesday (a day early), so I am very &amp;#34;Happy&amp;#34;... Get it?&lt;br /&gt;Smells just as good as I remembered. Sweet and clean.</li>
            <li> Smells good! Kinda sweet</li>
            <li> Perfect size for traveling and smells fabulous as always</li>
            <li> My colleague is happy</li>
            <li> This fresh scent is as lovely as I remember from 15 years ago!</li>
            <li> WHO KNEW! Saving this for Daughter&#x27;s Birthday, as her Daughter bought her the cologne for Christmas!&lt;br /&gt;what a deal!</li>
            <li> Is very good this perfun I like .</li>
            <li> Nice and fresh very happy with it</li>
            <li> I gave these as presents,they loved them</li>
            <li> While I LOVE this perfume, this miniscule sample is usually what is included in a Gift-With-Purchase.  This tiny  bottle is only 2\\&quot; tall, and most of that is the lid!  It MIGHT have a total of 10-15 sprays in it, and for someone to charge $6.45 for a SAMPLE (you&#x27;ll notice the description says the original price is $25.00) is a  TOTAL crock!!  And since you probably KNOW how small 1 ounce is, this only contains .14 of an ounce!!  Don&#x27;t fall for this; it is outrageous for someone to sell these when you  get them for FREE; if you ask for this sample at Nordstrom or Macy&#x27;s, they will just GIVE you one (I have done this on several occasions to test a new fragrance; sometimes what smells good at the time doesn&#x27;t necessarily \\&quot;wear\\&quot; well.  It&#x27;s kind of a downer when you spend $50-$100 for a new perfume, only to find out later it makes you smell like \\&quot;Eau de Wet Dog\\&quot;)!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway.......this situation  of selling samples really makes me angry (as I always get when trusting and unsuspecting  people are taken advantage of)!  Thanks for reading this; I just wanted to give people a heads-up about this rip-off!  It is my hope that I have helped at least ONE person.&lt;br /&gt;Namaste and Happy Holidays to you!</li>
            <li> i like this,very good</li>
            <li> Smells good light and awesome good for daily use. Only need a little as its alcohol based</li>
            <li> love it.. i would order it again.. smells awesome...  it is little and cute but it smells great... im very happy with it</li>
            <li> Little smaller than I thought but nice all the same</li>
            <li> I bought this tiny size to sample the perfume - I love it! It is a really good scent for daytime at the office.</li>
            <li> please sorry my ignorance but i think this is a sample and they are selling it, besides when i first push the little tip started to leak to a side, plase dont buy sorry and thank for at least shipping.</li>
            <li> Clinique Happy has been my favorite perfume for years now. This smelled just like it always does, arrived in good shape and was exactly as described. My only complaint is that I always seem to see the bottom of the bottle too quickly!</li>
            <li> Not so &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34; with it. It smelled like a bug spray at first then faded away to nothing.I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> GOOD VALUE  BUT THE LID COULD BE MORE SECURE</li>
            <li> It is a strong, fresh scent that lasts a long time. My only criticism is that it is sooooo small. Perfume is always expensive.</li>
            <li> Really cute bottle. It is very small so it works great for my carry on bag when I travel.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t that I don&#x27;t&#x27; like the product.  I had a completely wrong idea as to how small this bottle actually is.  (I thought it would be at least twice the size)  For that reason, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making my favorite scent affordable. Your selection of sizes is great for my budget. Many many thanks to you.</li>
            <li> I suspect this is a knockoff.  To the untrained nose, it may smell like happy.  I threw the bottle out after 6 months.  6 months later....it didn&#x27;t smell like happy</li>
            <li> I baught this for my wife&#x27;s stocking stuffer. She loves the Happy perfume, I baught this size so she can use it from her purse.she loves it!</li>
            <li> great to take on the plane because it is nice and small..also love the smell not to heavy..clinque has nice products</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a sample of Happy before purchasing - I had to give it 5 stars because it&#x27;s such a refreshing scent!</li>
            <li> Worked for me.  This got me a date with a chick and then her mom!</li>
            <li> This is the best! Really fresh and not too strong.</li>
            <li> I love this.  I don&#x27;t wear perfume often, so this tiny bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Smells real good my boyfriend loves it ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I liked the compact nature of the perfume so it is great for your purse.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> It was just what i needed to carry on the plane. Lol love my happy and was leaving the state with out</li>
            <li> Have never seen a bottle so SMALL lol, about the size fo a tube of Carmex lip balm.....this was crazy!!!  So basically the ad should have stated this item to be a sample product.  I was very dissatified with the size not to mention this fragrance only last for about 15 minutes or less.  I usually buy this product from the Clinique counter and just decided to buy from Amazon since the price was right.  However, I will not make any perfume purchases online again because it seems to probably be a knock off.  You would think that with the bottle being so small it would be the real deal, but not true.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Happy perfume makes me happy when I wear it. It smell soft and sweet. You feel like it sunny when you puy it on.</li>
            <li> I love Clinique&#x27;s original Happy fragrance. I&#x27;m usually never without some.</li>
            <li> love the smell! Wish it was a bit bigger for at least 10 dollars.. But other than that, happy with the service!</li>
            <li> smells great. fits almost anywhere (pocket, makeup bag purse). wish i had ten more of these. love love love! :)</li>
            <li> just arrive today, that was soon....but I try today and after hour do not smell&#x3D;( maybe for baby perfium ...</li>
            <li> I love this perfume it smells fresh, and wonderful. I also liked the price. Not a bad deal!!! I would buy more!!</li>
            <li> This is great for a test of what you want to try and at a great value.  Very very small.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Happy. I just wish the scent lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this perfume, lasts all day long!!!!  Love love love cannot wait to get  a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. My cousin use to wear it and I just love the menthol like under tones smells fresh and sweet. Just like me ;) I recommend this cute little bottle to everyone.</li>
            <li> Love this product. So far the only stuff that stays to its smell no changes easy to spot and look the same.</li>
            <li> Smells great, good size for the money ordered 2 at first then ordered 3 more then ordered a big bottle I luv this stuff</li>
            <li> Very feminine and springy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always enjoyed this smell, so refreshing, it&#x27;s just so little.</li>
            <li> This adds to the smell of having the perfume stick it is a must for those who like a light fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t legit Clinique happy</li>
            <li> When this arrived I had no Idea it would be so small. I purchased the 3.4 oz. bottle as a back up.  Thank goodness.  The price was ok. Other suppliers were asking obscene amounts for this itty-bity thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, the perfume was excellent.  No false counterfeit aroma. This was the real thing, just what I paid for; .14 oz. bottle</li>
            <li> for women. not the same smell as the one you get at the mall</li>
            <li> I always liked the smell of Clinique&#x27;s Happy, but this mini spray bottle is very poorly made and it is difficult to even get the perfume to come out of the bottle. Definitely would not buy this again!</li>
            <li> Clinique Happy is a lovely, clean, light fragrance.  This spray mini is just the right size to carry in your purse, evening bag, or pocket.  Nice!  :)</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size to put in your purse! The very thing for vacation! The smell is light but lingering. Love it!</li>
            <li> Oh I it&#x27;s a good cologne and I used to use it along time ago and I decided to try it againand I love it smells so pretty!!!&lt;br /&gt;Package arrived when it was supposed to and it was packed  great</li>
            <li> I know it was only about $7.00; but this picture looks larger than what I received.  It&#x27;s smaller than my baby finger.  I&#x27;ve used all of it as it was so small.  I definitely won&#x27;t buy this size again.  If you love a fragrance then get the larger bottle.  I&#x27;ve learned a lesson here.</li>
            <li> This perfume is so small and does not smell like clinique happy, not worth it at all for what they charge for shipping.</li>
            <li> Great price perfect size</li>
            <li> This product can be packed for trips.  The scent is very distinctive.</li>
            <li> The bottle is much smaller than I expected but perfect for your purse or travels. My favorite perfume...It sprays perfect</li>
            <li> Maybe the concentration is different when it&#x27;s smaller. But this is NOT the scent I remembered at Sephora. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this perfume. It&#x27;s a light fragrance, but sort of warm if that makes sense. Makes me feel happy:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same happy I used to always wear but the sprayer doesn&#x27;t work, it only comes out in little streams.</li>
            <li> Happy is my favorite fragrance, however the bottle I received did not smell like  Happy.  The cologne appeared yellow in color and I know Happy is clear in color.  I believe this cologne was very old.  Not pleased with what I received</li>
            <li> it is a little to small but smell good !!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use it!!! I have tried everything I can think of but it absolutely WILL NOT SPRAY</li>
            <li> The smell is so freash and clean. It makes a great gift, its small enough to travel with and goes well with a clinique gift set.</li>
            <li> Package arrived early, and in new condition.  It&#x27;s a very pretty scent, but I&#x27;m glad I bought a small version of it, for I don&#x27;t think it will be an every day scent, but it is nice.</li>
            <li> LOVE that this is available. As an experienced and regular business traveler, I hate checking bags just because I can&#x27;t get travel size grooming materials.     Happy by Clinique is a lovely perfume for every day - light, upbeat...happy! - and now it is available in a small size that fits into the quart-size bag that TSA requires for carry on baggage. Wonderful!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances.  A great value for the size and I wish I bought a few more!</li>
            <li> My favorite all time fragrance</li>
            <li> The size is ok for my purse though I wish they came a little bit bigger. I love the smell of it but it goes by fast in such a small container and it&#x27;s a little expensive for the size, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, although I wish I would of bought a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> Love it! Pleasure doing business with your company.</li>
            <li> its a happy smell love it</li>
            <li> Fits just perfect to go in your purse!smells great love it!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.  Product as described.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Something is not right with this.  It has a hint of the scent but it&#x27;s definitely not the real thing.  After an hour of spraying on my arm, then scent is gone.  The sprays from Bath and Body Works stay on longer than this stuff.  I think it&#x27;s total bunk.</li>
            <li> Got mine today! Smells so fresh, I love clinique!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Great way to try out a fragrance.</li>
            <li> Always loved it and always will.. A light and refreshing scent. Needed the small size for carry on luggage and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. It just makes you happy!! I would recommend this to anyone. The fragrance is fresh and not overpowering, while lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought this perfume before or knew what it smelled like. I am very happy with my purchase and the smell is amazing I love it and definitely will be buying again</li>
            <li> very pleasing and soft smell</li>
            <li> crap&#x3D; it was obviously a sample out of a gift bag and smelled awful I threw it out. I would never purchase anything from this reseller again</li>
            <li> Perfect purse size...arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying it. Seemed like too good of a deal. Got it today. It was the perfect little container. I use Happy a lot and just could not afford a big bottle right now... This was perfect and the bottle was not old or stale. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I love mini&#x27;s! They are great. Perfect to try before spending a ton of money for perfume that doesn&#x27;t complement your natural scent. I really love Clinique! This smells great!</li>
            <li> I bought it for a christmas gift for my neice. Wasnt sure if she was going to like it, shes 14. She did and Im very satisified with the price and packageing. Thank you</li>
            <li> always loved this smell</li>
            <li> Clinique Happy has always been my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> Great seller. Item as.expected .</li>
            <li> Just right for purse or office</li>
            <li> I ordered these because of their size for stocking stuffers. They are the perfect size for it! The shipping was fast and I couldn&#x27;t be happier that I made this purchase. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance and really appreciate the opportunity to buy a small size. Don&#x27;t use fragrance that often and cannot justify spending big $$$$$&lt;br /&gt;on something I&#x27;ll rarely use. Perfect solution. Shipped separately and timely.</li>
            <li> NICE TO HAVE A TINY BOTTLE TO KEEP IN MY PURSE! :)</li>
            <li> Excellent product fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Fast service. Cute little bottles to carry in purse. Smells great.</li>
            <li> Good smell for all ages</li>
            <li> Great item. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> great smelling and i live the small size</li>
            <li> Not a special as I was hoping for. Seems pretty light in scent and re-application necessary to hold onto the scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who travels and needs a small, compact, portable size.  Perfect for airplane carry on size.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without perfume every morning.  This is the perfect size for weekend getaways.  I can now take it everywhere!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this scent very much, glad I purchased a small version.</li>
            <li> Fresh, pretty and feminine.</li>
            <li> This spray is awesome. When my boos told me that he liked the smell of my perfume, I knew that I made a very good choice of buying Happy de Clinique. I  will order a new one pretty soon. Thank you Une Place de Beaute!</li>
            <li> I love Clinique Happy, this perfume spray just the way they described it MINIATURE, is certainly true, LOL! but worth it!</li>
            <li> Very fun and girly. Fun for daytime outside activities because the scent is lasting and stays clean.</li>
            <li> This arrived very quickly in an envelope because it is just that small.  Obviously I didn&#x27;t order much considering the size however the bottle is smaller than I thought it would be; it made me laugh.  The scent isn&#x27;t all that great to me which makes me very happy that I bought this size.</li>
            <li> I love the Clinique Happy product and have been searching for a replacement for my flight-friendly size.  The bottle design, however, is a problem with the product.  The cap is not secure. without help of tape or rubber band, so it&#x27;s constantly coming off in my purse and losing spray.  Love the product, not the packing.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this particular perfume for Christmas.  A full-sized bottle was a bit pricey, so this &amp;#34;stocking-stuffer&amp;#34; size worked out perfectly, even though the postage was more than the item.  :)</li>
            <li> PERFECT SIZE FOR THE PURSE.  PLUS THE COST ONLY A COUPLE OF DOLLARS INSTEAD OF $40 PLUS AT A CLIP.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this perfume- I gave it to her as a little surprise  ;-)</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product. I interpreted the size to be 1.4 oz, more appropriate as a travel size or in my case a stocking stuffer.  This is more like a sample size at 0.14 oz and therefore not acceptable to give as any sort of gift. Next time I order perfume I will pay closer attention to the posted size.  It is amazing that such a small bottle is even offered for sale.</li>
            <li> Cute little perfume , good for travel...</li>
            <li> I just received this product.  Wow!  I am really disappointed!  This product is a knock-off.  It smells terrible.  I always were Happy by Clinique, and I can tell the really thing from a knock-off.  If I could rate this a 0, I would.  Please do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> I love this little bottle! I was kinda upset it was so small but i have learned it only takes one spray! and it lasts all day I have had this for a week and you can hardly tell ive used it! so Im a happy shopper!&lt;br /&gt;the smell is so nice my hubby loves it!!  lasts for hour :)</li>
            <li> this is a soft scented perfume it is nice to wear to work, or out on the town, or even having a romantic eve being a soft scent it serves the purpose</li>
            <li> Nice smell. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly and I get so many compliments! Doesn&#x27;t wear off, stays on all day! I have one in my purse, in my car, and one at work.</li>
            <li> Perfect travel size!&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned- many of these tiny bottle seem to have defective spritzer pumps.&lt;br /&gt;No Clinique product has ever had that issue, so it&#x27;s a safe purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, and was able to find it a lot cheaper than I did at a local store. Well worth it!!</li>
            <li> Has been my favorite perfume for 20yrs.  Love this size for traveling.  Wish it were just a bit bigger, but I&#x27;ll take what I can get.</li>
            <li> Smell is okay not for me I personally would go to store and try them out first.</li>
            <li> very small; ,but fine.</li>
            <li> Great purse size.  Good value.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a Christmas gift and the person receiving it had had it before and thought it was all right. Not  a great recommendation for the price.</li>
            <li> BEST SMELLING PERFUME EVER. PREFECT FOR YOUR PURSE</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!!! Have been wearing it for years. My mother buys me a bottle for my birthday or Christmas every year and I ran out so I thought I&#x27;d buy this one to use until then. Should have bought a few because this bottle is sooo small! But it smells amazing and got here in 2 days!!!</li>
            <li> My sister received this as a sample and gave it to me to try. It smells lovely on me. All perfumes smell differently on different people, and I like how this one reacts. :)</li>
            <li> fast shipping..thank you... my friend like it very much and want me to buy her again but this this time she wants the big one...lol</li>
            <li> i love this perfume,smell soft and sweet  is one of my favorite ,is refreshing just right for a summer time!</li>
            <li> Great light/airy fragrance...perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> This item was not in good condition when I received it.  It did not smell like Happy at all.  I think they sent me two old bottles. Very unhappy. I want to give it 0 stars.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance,thank you.</li>
            <li> Hice la compra de 2 perfumes y uno llego por la mitad.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift. She was, well...HAPPY to get it!</li>
            <li> Great smell, will buy a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> This perfume is really expensive, that&#x27;s why I got the smally one, but in another hand you have to know that using a little tiny bit you have it on you all day long.</li>
            <li> Love love love happy!!!</li>
            <li> Love the size but the cap doesn&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li> smells good but to small for the money</li>
            <li> Same beautiful, slightly sweet smell as always.</li>
            <li> Clinique Happy is a refreshing scent - wish I&#x27;d ordered a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, I didnt realize it was going to be so small! But great scent for the suummer!</li>
            <li> I love Clinique happy perfume... exactly what i was expecting it to smell i love it... will definitely be wearing it as often as possible it smells great not over powering at all... nice and light flowery smell.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected for $7 but my favorite scent!!</li>
            <li> As a sample, good price.</li>
            <li> Just like the sample size you get with the make up. Smells very citrus-like. You get a good amount of perfume for a sample size.</li>
            <li> Always love Clinique, my bad for ordering such a small amount!</li>
            <li> Exactly what it said and got it really fast. Honestly, I&#x27;ll be buying regularly. Perfect little gift for any girl for any reason.</li>
            <li> Was purchased as a small &amp;#34;stocking stuffer&amp;#34; gift for this it was excellent. The size was very small so you are probably paying more for the packaging then the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this from Belk and it was not the same</li>
            <li> i personally did not buy this for myself. i ordered it for my dad who wanted it. but he wanted to make sure that i gave this product a top notch review. he was very impressed by how neatly wrapped the cologne was and how nice it all was. my father gives this product 5 stars. if he could give it more im sure he would.</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume and very beautiful size.</li>
            <li> Smells great but it didn&#x27;t squirt out!</li>
            <li> This small version smelled terrible.  Nothing like the 3.4oz Happy  I ordered with it.  I know how the perfume is supposed to smell like, since I have worn this fragrance for many years.  I was very disappointed because I was going to take this size when I travel.</li>
            <li> This one of my favorite perfumes. This tiny size is perfect for sliding into my purse. Totally recommend this perfume and the cute size.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for traveling!</li>
            <li> Smells great but very tiny</li>
            <li> Smells great!!&lt;br /&gt;Came quickly</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected to get.</li>
            <li> Happy that it came today this my absolute favorite it came in good condition and smelled as it should...</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE, brand new, FAST SHIPPING..perfect purse size... I will buy from this seller again. A+</li>
            <li> What a wonderful size for your purse and great way to try a new fragrance on you without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> Smaller bottle them what I thought. Would not of paid $5.00 for this size,,</li>
            <li> she loved it.  great stocking stuffer.  thanks Amazon for making suggstion</li>
            <li> This was the first gift my fiance gave me for our first Valentine&#x27;s Day together. I just feel prettier when I put it on, and have had several men ask me what is the name of the fragrance that I am wearing so they can purchase it for the woman in their life. That is a very flattering compliment, and I proudly tell them my secret. I bought this tiny size, after I accidentally left my bottle in a hotel room, to hold me over until my original 3.4 oz size bottle could be returned to me.</li>
            <li> nice smell but too small quantity...</li>
            <li> love the smell, scent doesnt last very long</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites, will purchase more.</li>
            <li> My only regret is that I ordered the smallest size - I was not sure if I was going to like it.  But I have now realize that I love it, the smell is very pleasant.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to apply a nice bit of smell before you go out.  Really nice, pleasant.</li>
