    <ol>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a really nice color!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The best lipliner to use with these two would be MAC Spice, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Perfect shade for Latino women</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful shade and quality lipstick.</li>
            <li>Anything MAC is a going to be great.</li>
            <li>item was very nice as I expected&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>The color is awesome and probably has become my favorite daytime lipstick...</li>
            <li>I loved the product of great quality would buy again . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing and looks good on all skin tones.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see this looking good on anybody</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful and will match many skin tones.</li>
            <li>I would have liked for intensity.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Angel looks good by itself, but looks better when Nars \\&quot;Turkish Delight\\&quot; lip gloss is applied on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a lovely shade I probably wouldn&#x27;t have chosen for myself had it not been made famous by Kim K.  </li>
            <li>I have already gone through it, but will be buying more.</li>
            <li>So smooth!</li>
            <li>I love the shade but it is cheaper at Mac</li>
            <li>as pretty and beautiful as expected and more, color is exact to whats written and it looks awesome on me .</li>
            <li>creamy, not dry and looks beautiful with the MAC lip pencil in the brownish color.</li>
            <li>truly unique apiece and flattering, as a makeup artist i would recommend this color for day use</li>
            <li>Was so excited to get this</li>
            <li>Granddaughter is loving her new lipstick said it was one of her fav&#x27;s</li>
            <li>This is a true MAC product.  </li>
            <li>Like nearly all MAC lip products, it has a nice texture and has plenty of pigment.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s case quickly, it dries up and your lips looked cracked within an hour of wearing.&lt;br /&gt;Worst</li>
            <li>You can get the real thing from Mac for 16 dollars and shipping is always free.</li>
            <li>nice but to sheer.</li>
            <li>Very pretty color and very pigmented.</li>
            <li>Glides on smoothly and lasting rich color.</li>
            <li>The color is one you can wear everyday and good for any skin type.</li>
            <li>It does NOT look like that in real life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a phony, it doesn&#x27;t look or feel like a real MAC lipstick does.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t deposit color very evenly and wears off.</li>
            <li>I love this color for when I do a smokier eye and need to tone down the lips.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know the actual color was a light light pink a little too light for what I was going for</li>
            <li>It is only sort of opaque and your natural lip color will come through</li>
            <li>It came in a reasonable amount of time but the color was not what she expected.  </li>

            <li> This is a pale, soft pink, almost milky looking matte lipstick.</li>
            <li> but this was not the color I expected and they wouldn&#x27;t let me return for health/sanitary reasons.</li>
            <li> it was very pink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pale pink frosted color.  </li>
            <li> or they put the wrong color</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> This is a true MAC product.  Very pretty color and very pigmented. The color is one you can wear everyday and good for any skin type.</li>

            <li> as pretty and beautiful as expected and more, color is exact to whats written and it looks awesome on me . truly unique apiece and flattering, as a makeup artist i would recommend this color for day use</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the actual color was a light light pink a little too light for what I was going for but it&#x27;s a really nice color!!!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful shade and quality lipstick. I have already gone through it, but will be buying more. I would recommend this lipstick to all. Glides on smoothly and lasting rich color. So smooth!</li>
            <li> Please do not buy ladies. You can get the real thing from Mac for 16 dollars and shipping is always free. You have been warned ladies.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;The item was very nice as I expected&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Anything MAC is a going to be great. The color is beautiful and will match many skin tones. I love this color for when I do a smokier eye and need to tone down the lips.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. .It&#x27;s not the same as the picture at all. It&#x27;s a very pale pink frosted color.  Not at all what is described. . I can&#x27;t see this looking good on anybody</li>
            <li> This is a pale, soft pink, almost milky looking matte lipstick. It is only sort of opaque and your natural lip color will come through somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pay no attention to the photo of the lipstick here. It does NOT look like that in real life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angel looks good by itself, but looks better when Nars \\&quot;Turkish Delight\\&quot; lip gloss is applied on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAC Angel and Nars Turkish Delight together are Kim Kardashian&#x27;s supposedly signature lip color, if you want an idea of what they look like. (They do look like her lip color.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best lipliner to use with these two would be MAC Spice, in my opinion. You can change how Angel looks on you depending on what lip liner you use.</li>
            <li> This is a phony, it doesn&#x27;t look or feel like a real MAC lipstick does. The lipstick broke and smudged in side it&#x27;s case quickly, it dries up and your lips looked cracked within an hour of wearing.&lt;br /&gt;Worst product I&#x27;ve ever purchased!</li>
            <li> nice but to sheer. I would have liked for intensity.</li>
            <li> The color is awesome and probably has become my favorite daytime lipstick...creamy, not dry and looks beautiful with the MAC lip pencil in the brownish color.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was my mistake or they put the wrong color but this was not the color I expected and they wouldn&#x27;t let me return for health/sanitary reasons.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife.  It came in a reasonable amount of time but the color was not what she expected.  Instead of a nude, pale, natural looking color it was very pink.</li>
            <li> Perfect shade for Latino women</li>
            <li> Was so excited to get this but it doesn&#x27;t deposit color very evenly and wears off. Tried everything and is just a no go.</li>
            <li> I love the shade but it is cheaper at Mac I bought it there for $16</li>
            <li> I loved the product of great quality would buy again . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> Granddaughter is loving her new lipstick said it was one of her fav&#x27;s</li>
