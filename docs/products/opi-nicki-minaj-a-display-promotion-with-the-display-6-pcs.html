            <li> I have been wanting this collection for a long time and now I finally have them!!  </li>
            <li> The shipping actually was quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li> Im also intrigued with the detail of save me and metallic for life, each one has 3 different glitters in different sizes and shapes with at least 2 colors each in the polish.</li>
            <li> Pink Friday (baby pink).  </li>
            <li> know the other colors will be just as FAB</li>
            <li> I just received my polish the other day</li>
            <li> There is no cute display case thing, but rather the set comes in a white box.</li>
            <li> [Which I knew from reading a previous post] Trust me</li>
            <li> is that the glitterly black color, metallic for life, is hard to remove form your nails even with acetone polish remover</li>
            <li> My order got to me within a few days of placing it, even before the estimated arrival date!</li>
            <li> The waiting made me anxious and it temporarily screwed up my excitement...</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t have them for Mardi Gras in new Orleans, and that would have been tragic..</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that it did not come in a nicer package that indicated it was a Nicki Minaj collection.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with glitter ...</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with doing my nails over the weekend--it is one of my at-college Sunday afternoon rituals.  </li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with this set!!!</li>

            <li> All of these colors are perfect, the pics do them no justice.  I.M.O. this is the best set that OPI has put out yet!  This is the second time that I have purchased from Beauty911 and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> i love it!!!!!!my first color i tried was Pink Friday.the color is so smooth so girly i love it.i know the other colors will be just as FAB :) thank you Nicki Minaj &amp; OPI xoxo</li>
            <li> Are you kidding me?....this is the best set hands down for 2012....#1 you can&#x27;t go wrong with glitter ...#2 there are so many combinations you can create with the set alone in addition to whatever polishes you have already..#3 shipping was DYNOMITE.... I placed my order and it was at my door within 48 hrs..just in time for my New Years manicure!!!!!........UNDOUBTEDLY....... \\&quot;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\\&quot;....</li>
            <li> [Received it today] It came in the mail TWO days after I got the confirmation of it being shipped. Which was great! It came in a nice protected packaging, nothing beautiful but that&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s all going in the garbage anyways, Lol. It didn&#x27;t come with the Display, if you&#x27;re expecting that, but I didn&#x27;t care about that either. [Which I knew from reading a previous post] Trust me, I don&#x27;t need any more unneeded or unused stuff in my room, Hahha. It came with all 6 Nail Polishes as promised. This is great, absolutely awesome. And I got it at the limited time deal which was even better! I&#x27;ll definitely buy from this person again. So happy with it. You will not regret this set!!</li>
            <li> This is a great price for the nail polish....BUT if you are looking for the display as well then do not buy. They really need to change the listing to POLISH SET not Polish with display.</li>
            <li> My order got to me within a few days of placing it, even before the estimated arrival date! All the bottles were wrapped up nice and safe. I couldn&#x27;t ask for better service. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be buying from VIPolish again.</li>
            <li> I just received my polish the other day and I am so ready to hit the nail salon! The shipping actually was quicker than I expected. The seller needs to change the fact that it doesn&#x27;t come with a display!!! But I didn&#x27;t want the display anyways I just wanted the polish! Very cute colors for the spring and summer time.</li>
            <li> I ordered the nicki minaj nail polish set for my girlfriend which clearly said comes with display. No display at All just the polish. They are a misleading company and I will Never order from them again Period.......................................................................................................................................................</li>
            <li> SUPER QUICK DELIVERY!!  No stand, so beware if you are looking for that.  I am 100% pleased! Awesome!!  All of the colors are authentic and so gorgeous!  A Nicki Lover&#x27;s MUST-HAVE!!</li>
            <li> Soooo.. My collection is absolutly awesome! Although, it would have been nice to own that display offered in its description.. Also, I&#x27;m so happy that every review is stating how quickly they received their stuff.. It took abt a month to receive my nicki collection! I almost didn&#x27;t have them for Mardi Gras in new Orleans, and that would have been tragic.. Anywho, I&#x27;m finally creating all sorts of combinations and I love this product! The waiting made me anxious and it temporarily screwed up my excitement... I&#x27;m good now :) definitely a must have for all the Barbs!!!</li>
            <li> The colors in this collection are amazing! They also last long. Would definitely recommend any one of these colors to a friend!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I love that it last longer and dries quicker than regular nail polish, no chipping, I love the colors.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with doing my nails over the weekend--it is one of my at-college Sunday afternoon rituals.  I cannot get enough of any of these colors, especially Fly (turquoise) and Pink Friday (baby pink).  The eggplant colored Super Bass Shatter is so much fun too.  Great over plain white (or light, neutral colored) nails!  BUY THIS SET!!!</li>
            <li> One of the Nail Polish was crack #LikeReally</li>
            <li> these colors are great! they&#x27;re bright, and go well with the shatter. love the glitter colors too. I definetly recommend this!</li>
            <li> The nail polish colors were fantastic!!  I have been wanting this collection for a long time and now I finally have them!!  Fast shipment and arrived ahead of schedule!!  Great job amazon!!!  always a pleasure to do business with you!!</li>
            <li> So excited that I was able to find these a lot of the salons I went to didn&#x27;t have these colors. They&#x27;re perfect, I love them! I love all the colors, I love sparkles,I  love Nicki Minaj! Fabulous!</li>
            <li> Awesome selection of beautiful OPI colors, and crackle and sparkle top coats. My daughter loved receiving this for her birthday along with a set of nail art brushes. Everything you need to get started. Great price too for OPI.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my granddaughter.  I was a little disappointed that it did not come in a nicer package that indicated it was a Nicki Minaj collection.</li>
            <li> Im very picky with products but this is a smash hit! So many combinations as others have noted. Im also impressed with the smooth thick high quality of the nailpolish the fast shipping and it was well packaged. Im also intrigued with the detail of save me and metallic for life, each one has 3 different glitters in different sizes and shapes with at least 2 colors each in the polish. You cant go wrong with this set!!!</li>
            <li> full sized bottles of polish, the entire Nicki Minaj collection, all colors are vibrant and beautiful the only draw back is that the glitterly black color, metallic for life, is hard to remove form your nails even with acetone polish remover-I was scrubbing forever and a day! Tip: pour it in a bowl then dip fingers in for a minute or more then wipe!</li>
            <li> VERY nice colors...a gift for my daughter and she was so pleased! There is no cute display case thing, but rather the set comes in a white box. This set of colors has been discontinued so get it while you can!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived early and in perfect condition. This collection is amazing. Couldnt have picked a better one to buy. i am completely happy with this purchase</li>
