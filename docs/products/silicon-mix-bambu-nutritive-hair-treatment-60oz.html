            <li> but I can&#x27;t always pay attention to what people say is good or bad based on some scientific research.  </li>
            <li> In the summertime, I wear my hair naturally curly and use this as a leave in styling aid to tame my natural curls.</li>
            <li> The original formula, however, leaves white flakes, so I&#x27;m unable to use it as a leave-in.</li>
            <li> Let this sit for 5 minutes (10) if your hair is really dry.  </li>
            <li> the length is in part due to this product.  </li>
            <li> My hair was shedding with knots coming down everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t overdo it because it will weigh down the hair</li>
            <li> The product was slightly leaking from the Lid.</li>
            <li> Immediately upon washing this Kinky curly weave purchased from Mane Depot, my water started turning black and the hair change</li>
            <li> I am an AA with waist length hair in tight curls that fall about MBL with the shrinkage and</li>
            <li> but I could not let this conditioner go unnoticed.</li>
            <li> I know some people would never do this, but I sometimes leave a small amount in my hair as a leave-in.</li>
            <li> This stops my hair from shedding and I mean shedding from the roots.  </li>
            <li> Seriously life changing.</li>
            <li> I have read that silicon is a temporary fix and not good for the scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and curly and since moving to  Texas can get frizzy.</li>
            <li> Got the saloon secret  ..</li>
            <li> I received the product today and was a little disappointed that it leaked during shipping.</li>
            <li> it would matt and tangle very badly.  </li>

After I read that I stopped using it for a minute.  Yet, I put it on my hair and it feels like butter.  I am an AA with waist length hair in tight curls that fall about MBL with the shrinkage and the length is in part due to this product.  My hair was shedding with knots coming down everywhere.  I tried the Alter Ego Garlic Conditioner raved about on Amazon for shedding which was a good product but it did not stop shedding in the manner hoped for and did not detangle like this product.  I now use creme of nature detangling, conditioning shampoo normal hair (what did they do with the original CoN for dry damaged hair?)  with the Silicon Mix as a deep conditioner.  I have mixed it with Kanechom Karite butter but mostly I use it alone.  Sometimes I sleep in this and at times I sleep in a preconditioner like coconut or olive oil.  I read that 30 minutes is all you need but I see a difference in softness when it is longer.  Lately, I only have 3 minutes in it and it is good enough to detangle after using CoN shampoo. I plan to try it with my dryer one day.  I read alot of things but I can&#x27;t always pay attention to what people say is good or bad based on some scientific research.  I like reading people&#x27;s personal experiences better.  I experiment and in the end I just go with what works for me over time.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, my hair is much softer right now. It smells great. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Product is excellent however, the Saler did not secure the lid very well. The product was slightly leaking from the Lid.</li>
            <li> I must say I am very impressed with this product. I used it with Kanechom Goats Milk and it really moisturizes the hair. The results were amazing. My hair was easy to comb and manage. I will be purchasibg these products in the future.</li>
            <li> Completely hydrates the hair, leaving it soft, silky and shiny.  Strongly recommend use of this product after every wash.  Let this sit for 5 minutes (10) if your hair is really dry.  Wash out and style.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Always wondering how &amp; why many women have soft shiny bouncy hair. Got the saloon secret  .. Made a lot of reserch before making a purchase, Bought 60 oz, to mix with Kanechom masks as recomended by other reviewers, THNX to all good reviews helped me to make my decision to buy this &amp; kanechom.,, Great reviews helps..!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner and detangler.  I use it as both a regular conditioner and also a deep conditioner.  I use it on myself (3b/3c) and my daughter (4a).</li>
            <li> I received the product today and was a little disappointed that it leaked during shipping. The lid does not have a plastic seal to prevent this from happening. On another note, I am looking  forward to trying the product tonight.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that leaves my hair soft and shiny, finally i found it!!&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to complain about!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great and it really does what it promises.</li>

            <li> fairly decent conditioner. I swap this out with another to change it up. Good for deep conditioning overnight.</li>
            <li> My daughters have different hair texture one has a head full of thick curls while the other has straight hair. This is the only conditioner that works magic for both of them and mine. This conditioner makes it so much easier to detangle the hair and it doesn&#x27;t dry out the hair.</li>
            <li> the best hair treatment</li>
            <li> wonderful, let the silky soft hair.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing . I had came across this product while looking for products for my natural hair. I’ve been using this product for well over 4 weeks now and I have no complaints whatsoever. It left my hair feeling silky, soft , and smooth.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a moisturizing and nourishing conditioner.</li>
            <li> too big. large Big. very very big</li>
            <li> Bambu is one the best conditoners out there. I am pleased with the quick shipment and just as I expected..thanks will do business again.</li>
            <li> I been using this treatment for years! I love how smooth and and shiny it makes my hair. It especially works well as leave in conditioner for  people with curly hair.</li>
            <li> The really good product,  but i prefer the silicon mix pearl&#x27;s protein</li>
            <li> Great products,fast shipping</li>
            <li> I use this to restore the wigs that I make. I like the other one better. It just seems to work better with curling the hair back up. But it is fine. I like the smell a lot better for sure.</li>
            <li> I have super dry curly hair, when I found this product, I read the reviews and have absolutely NO REGRETS!  Seriously the best conditioner I have ever used!</li>
            <li> it helps with frizzyness, it softens my hair, i am transitioning its been 19 months since my last relaxer, it helps with hair growth!! perfect deep condtioner</li>
            <li> Does wonders for damaged hair!</li>
            <li> I had purchased some curly weave that was suppose to be virgin and only steam processed for curl pattern.  Immediately upon washing this Kinky curly weave purchased from Mane Depot, my water started turning black and the hair change it would matt and tangle very badly.  I used this product to deep condition the hair and it help to restore it back to a state that I could manage.  It made it soft and left a pleasant smell on the hair.  I recommend this on weave.  I have not used this product on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> Because is an excellent product, it fills all my expectations and the size is amazing. The price wonderful. I will recommend this products to all my family and friends and I will buy more. I am so happy. Thanks</li>
            <li> Seriously life changing.</li>
            <li> Love this on my dry, processed hair. It leaves it soft and conditioned, as well as sweet smelling. I originally bought the 16oz and after running out so quickly, I purchased the 60oz. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it smells great ,use it on my daughter and my hair it made it sooooo soft defiantly a must buy.</li>
            <li> This is so much better for my hair than the original formula. This has a strong fragrance that is pleasant. After deep conditioning my hair with this, my hair feels like silk and has NO tangles. I know some people would never do this, but I sometimes leave a small amount in my hair as a leave-in. It works perfectly and protects my hair from heat styling. The original formula, however, leaves white flakes, so I&#x27;m unable to use it as a leave-in. In the summertime, I wear my hair naturally curly and use this as a leave in styling aid to tame my natural curls. I have no complaints about this conditioner and will continue to purchase and use it faithfully.</li>
            <li> Excellent as usual. I have been using this product for a while now, and it nevers disappoints. It leaves my hair soft and silky, and smells wonderful. I fully recommended.</li>
            <li> This product will make your hair feel soft and supple and hydrated  Great for any kind of hair type but, really helps with damaged hair...great smell!!  I will definitely buy this product again and again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mixed chick. My hair is very thick and curly and since moving to  Texas can get frizzy. This conditioner adds moisture , shine and makes my hair feel so smooth and keeps the frizz at bay.</li>
            <li> they is product is great for African American hair but you must go under the hair dryer for 30 mins ladies to really see the benefits!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my best friend and she loves it. She said, &amp;#34;this is by far one of the best things she ever used on her hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great to use on hair. Really softens it up. Just don&#x27;t overdo it because it will weigh down the hair so you need to wash it out really well. I use the on natural hair and weaves. Works great on both.</li>
