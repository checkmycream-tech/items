            <li>Absolutely great.</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>Although, the pumice stone attachment would need a bit more power, I would think - however, I didn&#x27;t buy it for my feet, I got it for my face, and for that, it does seem to be working perfectly.</li>
            <li>after using this product my skin is so nice!</li>
            <li>Is it as good as the clarisonic, probably not, but I feel like it does a great job cleaning, exfoliating, and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I bought it, but this time I took a good look at the packaging and handled it myself.  </li>
            <li>so I use a fair amount of pressure).</li>
            <li>Good brush</li>
            <li>This is a good substitute for the price.</li>
            <li>When it did work it Was good.</li>
            <li>This product is a good product</li>
            <li>It does not have a good speed.....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really good, my friend recommended it to me</li>
            <li>The rotating motor is no stronger and it does just as good a job as the lower priced scrubber without the case.</li>
            <li>My face feels good after each use.</li>
            <li>Good product,good services</li>

            <li>The speed is pretty much perfect.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>The pumice is perfect for callouses on feet while taking a bath in hot water.  </li>
            <li>and I am happy to know that once the batteries go, I can easily replace them without having to worry about the brush not keeping a charge.  </li>
            <li>The large scrub brush feels wonderful on my skin with body wash or a sugar scrub.  </li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>i liked that price and how works.</li>
            <li>Nice  product.</li>
            <li>The way the batteries go into this machine is kind of a pain</li>
            <li>The face and body brushes are nice.</li>
            <li>Easy to assemble, works great in the shower as advertised, and helps to keep my face very clean.</li>
            <li>Great customer service- top of the line quick responses to questions</li>
            <li>Strongly suggest these to anyone with acne problems!</li>
            <li>It is a great product, tad bit noisy which isn&#x27;t bothersome, just beware if you have skin issues, be prepared and have your products ready!</li>
            <li>Large hand held with variety of brushes - great price and would recommend</li>
            <li>and I love it with my face scrub.</li>
            <li>I love that it is waterproof and can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li>I love that it is waterproof</li>
            <li>and I can leave it in the shower, where it is needed the most often.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It does encourage you to pay more attention to what you are doing, and by doing so, probably wash better.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love to use a self tanner</li>
            <li>I love the pumice stone for foot calluses.</li>
            <li>I also like it a lot more than the olay version which I have tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to say how well the product worked, but no matter what, it never turned on.</li>
            <li>I  never thought  i&#x27;d be in love with  </li>
            <li>bought these as gifts, everyone more than pleased</li>
            <li>but so glad I did not.</li>
            <li>I cant imagine it working any better than this one.</li>
            <li>I wish it had a lot more power...</li>
            <li>Love this product and for 1/2 the cost of others, works well.</li>
            <li>Also the sponge is ok</li>
            <li>but I fear it will harbor many germs and rapidly if not cleaned with soap and water after each use.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a man who is trying to keep his skin healthy</li>
            <li>I love the rubber holder it sits inðŸ˜€</li>
            <li>This facial brush is awesome.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it is battery operated and not rechargeable.  </li>
            <li>so far so good!</li>
            <li>Its good fair enough in its work and price</li>
            <li>It was a nice try but you should just invest in something worth your money.</li>
            <li>I love this my face was clean</li>
            <li>The device is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love love love the large brush.</li>
            <li>just fine-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice but doesn&#x27;t have much power</li>
            <li>Out of all similar products, I&#x27;m glad I chose this one!!</li>
            <li>I can assure you this brush is worth it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  so excited.</li>
            <li>At first I wished it had more power but after using it I could tell it does the job</li>
            <li>Fun, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, when using on face or body a light pressure is all that is needed anyway.</li>
            <li>great price, product is as expected.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my husband and his feelings are that the lower priced facial scrubber is just as good and comes with a traveling case.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>For good results, do make sure you clean the brushes and sponges after use, and allow them to air dry completely, or you are apt to accomplish the opposite effect and end up spreading more bacteria/impurities onto your skin rather than removing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My cheeks feel so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>First of all it takes 4 AA batteries, which would be fine if it acted like it had 4 batteries in it.</li>
            <li>Meh...the facial brush is perfect but the pumice and body brush don&#x27;t get enough speed to work.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of a decent priced all in one scrubber.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The large body brush is great for rough and bumpy skin on the backs of arms.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought it was going to be no different, but</li>
            <li>which is kind  of  low.</li>
            <li>to  hurt their  face by using  something  that is too powerful.</li>
            <li>This brush is worth maybe 10 bucks, I regret paying twice that.</li>
            <li>All things considered - it is worth the $ imo.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin, so, perhaps after I buy a better cleanser</li>
            <li>How else would it work right?</li>
            <li>Speed seems just right</li>
            <li>It is just the right size and works well for me.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin super clean &amp; smoothe, the brushes are soft so when your washing your face</li>
            <li>So far so good, only had it a couple of months</li>
            <li>People you get what you pay for exactly however</li>
            <li>and I could tell the difference the first tim</li>
            <li>and I was able to put it back together</li>
            <li>I  wish it had a higher setting  for using  with  the body and pumice  </li>
            <li>Of course with anything you must be consistent to see results.</li>
            <li>I so much clearer!</li>
            <li>I love the different attachments.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face soft and clean</li>
            <li>this item shipped fast, i love how it comes with different attachments.</li>
            <li>I have not used the little sponge attachment yet, but I am sure that it would work great with cleanser on acne that the scrub brush may be too harsh for.</li>
            <li>The motor also needs a decent battery to have much in terms of power, and while I haven&#x27;t used it enough to accurately gauge its power consumption, I am guessing it will eat batteries fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Tried it, put fresh new batteries in still wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I have had this for a couple of months and it is still going strong on the same batteries</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on the face and really gives you a deep clean.</li>
            <li>Great product for everyday use or just occasional.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this brush, it makes a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li>So much so, I&#x27;ll probably buy another.</li>
            <li>Works fabulous as a facial tool too.  </li>
            <li>but didnt really do anything for me.</li>
            <li>bristles are very, scratch your skin</li>
            <li>Maybe I expected more umph...</li>
            <li>THIS WAS BETTER THAN EXPECTED.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed!&lt;br</li>
            <li>so glad  that I ordered  this because  of all the other attachments  that comes with  it.</li>
            <li>It may also encourage a teen to spend more time on their daily routine.  </li>
            <li>After viewing several similar items for a much greater price, I decided to go with this one.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if companies are too lazy/cheap to hire a good translator or if they are that rare to find, but we see a lot of very poorly translated instructions on imported goods.  </li>
            <li>My daughter really likes how soft but durable the brushes bristles are.</li>
            <li>Tonight I decided to use the Facial and Ultra Brush right out the gate I had to purchase batteries .  </li>
            <li>He says I shouldn&#x27;t of spent the extra money in hopes this one was better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure that it actually does a better job than the not-so-technical and battery free traditional ways of washing your face and body.  </li>
            <li>Wish the bristles were a little softer but overall good facial brush for the price.</li>
            <li>Automated translation programs will never replace fluent human translators since language is seldom going to translate exactly.  </li>
            <li>My 17 year old daughter never likes anything I buy for her, but she LOVES this device!  </li>
            <li>It is not harsh at all!  </li>
            <li>With the same high quality rechargeable batteries we use for our electronic devices, it has reasonable power and speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it for a little while longer, but definitely plan to upgrade to something better quality before this one breaks on me.</li>
            <li>and it completely broke.</li>
            <li>After a few months, using the brush does seem to smooth out my skin texture and reduce blackheads.</li>
            <li>Myself, however, the face brush has completely ripped off my cheek skin.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin, but I have used the oil of olay brand before without this problem.</li>
            <li>I have bought five other facial brushes, all of which were more expensive and the rechargeable kind.  </li>
            <li>I was a little leery at first that this was really waterproof, but I have used mine in both the shower AND the bathtub</li>
            <li>Not powerful enough, but for the price its ok, only one speed not 2</li>
            <li>/&gt;Outside of that, this particular model is also sold under numerous brand names, but the machines appear identical.  </li>
            <li>Not even the body brush is abrasive enough to abrade facial skin to the point of peeling and pain unless someone obsessively used it for long periods of time (and with plenty of fresh batteries!)  </li>
            <li>They are not too stiff and clean and exfoliate well.</li>
            <li>the first time!I also used the pumice stone part because I have some rough spots, like &#x27;computer elbow&#x27;and on my feet</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll laugh, especially if you translate something into Simplified Chinese and then back into English, and you will totally get what I&#x27;m saying here!)</li>
            <li>At first I thought that the power was a bit slow, but then I came to the conclusion that I&#x27;d probably scrub my skin off if it were too much stronger.</li>
            <li>The motor isn&#x27;t very powerful, though, so pressing hard isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li>At least these were low on the giggle factor and fairly easy to figure out, even if the illustrations they referred to were not on the trifold brochure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helped me knock the dry skin off my face that I was having an issue with but the bristles are not as soft as I would prefer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very similar to a machine like this that I had gotten for my daughter when she was a teen, so it&#x27;s apparently one that has been around some time.  </li>

            <li> I also love that it is battery operated and not rechargeable.  </li>
            <li> so far so good!</li>
            <li> Its good fair enough in its work and price</li>
            <li> It was a nice try but you should just invest in something worth your money.</li>
            <li> I love this my face was clean</li>
            <li> The device is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love love love the large brush.</li>
            <li> just fine-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but doesn&#x27;t have much power</li>
            <li> Out of all similar products, I&#x27;m glad I chose this one!!</li>
            <li> I can assure you this brush is worth it!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  so excited.</li>
            <li> At first I wished it had more power but after using it I could tell it does the job</li>
            <li> Fun, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, when using on face or body a light pressure is all that is needed anyway.</li>
            <li> great price, product is as expected.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband and his feelings are that the lower priced facial scrubber is just as good and comes with a traveling case.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> For good results, do make sure you clean the brushes and sponges after use, and allow them to air dry completely, or you are apt to accomplish the opposite effect and end up spreading more bacteria/impurities onto your skin rather than removing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My cheeks feel so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> First of all it takes 4 AA batteries, which would be fine if it acted like it had 4 batteries in it.</li>
            <li> Meh...the facial brush is perfect but the pumice and body brush don&#x27;t get enough speed to work.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of a decent priced all in one scrubber.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty cheaply made.</li>
            <li> The large body brush is great for rough and bumpy skin on the backs of arms.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought it was going to be no different, but</li>
            <li> which is kind  of  low.</li>
            <li> to  hurt their  face by using  something  that is too powerful.</li>
            <li> This brush is worth maybe 10 bucks, I regret paying twice that.</li>
            <li> All things considered - it is worth the $ imo.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin, so, perhaps after I buy a better cleanser</li>
            <li> How else would it work right?</li>
            <li> Speed seems just right</li>
            <li> It is just the right size and works well for me.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin super clean &amp; smoothe, the brushes are soft so when your washing your face</li>
            <li> So far so good, only had it a couple of months</li>
            <li> People you get what you pay for exactly however</li>
            <li> and I could tell the difference the first tim</li>
            <li> and I was able to put it back together</li>
            <li> I  wish it had a higher setting  for using  with  the body and pumice  </li>
            <li> Of course with anything you must be consistent to see results.</li>
            <li> I so much clearer!</li>
            <li> I love the different attachments.  </li>
            <li> It makes my face soft and clean</li>
            <li> this item shipped fast, i love how it comes with different attachments.</li>
            <li> I have not used the little sponge attachment yet, but I am sure that it would work great with cleanser on acne that the scrub brush may be too harsh for.</li>
            <li> The motor also needs a decent battery to have much in terms of power, and while I haven&#x27;t used it enough to accurately gauge its power consumption, I am guessing it will eat batteries fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> Tried it, put fresh new batteries in still wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a couple of months and it is still going strong on the same batteries</li>
            <li> It is very gentle on the face and really gives you a deep clean.</li>
            <li> Great product for everyday use or just occasional.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this brush, it makes a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li> So much so, I&#x27;ll probably buy another.</li>
            <li> Works fabulous as a facial tool too.  </li>
            <li> but didnt really do anything for me.</li>
            <li> bristles are very, scratch your skin</li>
            <li> Maybe I expected more umph...</li>
            <li> THIS WAS BETTER THAN EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed!&lt;br</li>
            <li> so glad  that I ordered  this because  of all the other attachments  that comes with  it.</li>
            <li> It may also encourage a teen to spend more time on their daily routine.  </li>
            <li> After viewing several similar items for a much greater price, I decided to go with this one.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if companies are too lazy/cheap to hire a good translator or if they are that rare to find, but we see a lot of very poorly translated instructions on imported goods.  </li>
            <li> My daughter really likes how soft but durable the brushes bristles are.</li>
            <li> Tonight I decided to use the Facial and Ultra Brush right out the gate I had to purchase batteries .  </li>
            <li> He says I shouldn&#x27;t of spent the extra money in hopes this one was better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure that it actually does a better job than the not-so-technical and battery free traditional ways of washing your face and body.  </li>
            <li> Wish the bristles were a little softer but overall good facial brush for the price.</li>
            <li> Automated translation programs will never replace fluent human translators since language is seldom going to translate exactly.  </li>
            <li> My 17 year old daughter never likes anything I buy for her, but she LOVES this device!  </li>
            <li> It is not harsh at all!  </li>
            <li> With the same high quality rechargeable batteries we use for our electronic devices, it has reasonable power and speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it for a little while longer, but definitely plan to upgrade to something better quality before this one breaks on me.</li>
            <li> and it completely broke.</li>
            <li> After a few months, using the brush does seem to smooth out my skin texture and reduce blackheads.</li>
            <li> Myself, however, the face brush has completely ripped off my cheek skin.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin, but I have used the oil of olay brand before without this problem.</li>
            <li> I have bought five other facial brushes, all of which were more expensive and the rechargeable kind.  </li>
            <li> I was a little leery at first that this was really waterproof, but I have used mine in both the shower AND the bathtub</li>
            <li> Not powerful enough, but for the price its ok, only one speed not 2</li>
            <li> /&gt;Outside of that, this particular model is also sold under numerous brand names, but the machines appear identical.  </li>
            <li> Not even the body brush is abrasive enough to abrade facial skin to the point of peeling and pain unless someone obsessively used it for long periods of time (and with plenty of fresh batteries!)  </li>
            <li> They are not too stiff and clean and exfoliate well.</li>
            <li> the first time!I also used the pumice stone part because I have some rough spots, like &#x27;computer elbow&#x27;and on my feet</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll laugh, especially if you translate something into Simplified Chinese and then back into English, and you will totally get what I&#x27;m saying here!)</li>
            <li> At first I thought that the power was a bit slow, but then I came to the conclusion that I&#x27;d probably scrub my skin off if it were too much stronger.</li>
            <li> The motor isn&#x27;t very powerful, though, so pressing hard isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li> At least these were low on the giggle factor and fairly easy to figure out, even if the illustrations they referred to were not on the trifold brochure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helped me knock the dry skin off my face that I was having an issue with but the bristles are not as soft as I would prefer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very similar to a machine like this that I had gotten for my daughter when she was a teen, so it&#x27;s apparently one that has been around some time.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know what its long term durability will be.  </li>
            <li> The casing came off and the internal wiring came a loose.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the pumice stone attachment as the unit itself does not have the power necessary to make the pumice stone do its job (not enough revolutions per second and motor not strong enough to allow any pressure at all).</li>
            <li> I suspect that it won&#x27;t be a long lived product.  </li>
            <li> The brushes spin fairly slowly and it does not take much pressure to stop them from spinning at all.</li>
            <li> I mean you don&#x27;t really want something with the power of a 20 volt cordless drill for cleaning your skin.</li>
            <li> Helps me with my oily skin due to my big pores!</li>
            <li> If you press hard it slows down the motor (and with the large brush I like to exfoliate my arms and legs</li>
            <li> A good fail safe for the face, bad for tough foot calluses.</li>
            <li> CVS has a similar product all the bells and whistles 20 something odd dollar</li>
            <li> Too much pressure makes the brush stop so the bristles should be a little firmer for a cleaner feel and the brush spins slowly.</li>
            <li> Since I have a lot of other things to do during the course of a day, I doubt that will ever be a concern of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For my skin it&#x27;s a little too rough, but may not be for others.</li>
            <li> man...this one beats the 3 others I bought in the past by a long shot!  </li>
            <li> Wish brushes were a little stiffer, a lot of sun toughened skin on my face.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money and time.</li>
            <li> All of them stopped charging after a few months.  </li>
            <li> I feel that it exfoliates my skin but its not too harsh.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t going to cause a miracle--it&#x27;s just a device that spins small brushes, sponge or pumice stone around in circles.</li>
            <li> it suck , my first time using , when the brush touch my face it stop rolling :(</li>
            <li> I use the small scrub brush to cleanse and exfoliate my face AND to apply my serums to my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Bargain brand batteries are going to deliver a slow, wimpy scrub.  </li>
            <li> Extremely slow</li>
            <li> A little difficult when using in the shower.</li>
            <li> The bottom was very hard to get off not a lot pressure on the brush.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re thinking this review is a fake...</li>
            <li> So my husband said maybe you put the batteries in wrong</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> may be i have bad luck .</li>
            <li> Made my skin break out really bad after using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it, but disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it!! Great in the shower</li>
            <li> Use it on my face. Wish brushes were a little stiffer, a lot of sun toughened skin on my face. Do not drop. A little difficult when using in the shower.</li>
            <li> Tonight I decided to use the Facial and Ultra Brush right out the gate I had to purchase batteries .  How else would it work right? WRONG! I got batteries only to discover my device is a dud. People you get what you pay for exactly however,I got nothing. DON&#x27;T WAIST YOUR MONEY CVS has a similar product all the bells and whistles 20 something odd dollar and it works. Do not email me regarding this situation I stated the problem I had with my device.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li> My daughter really likes how soft but durable the brushes bristles are. She says they are cleaning her face to the point of immediately feeling her pores tightening after each use. She wanted another one for backup. So, (because she has me wrapped around her pinky) I bought it, but this time I took a good look at the packaging and handled it myself.  I honestly thought it was going to be no different, but man...this one beats the 3 others I bought in the past by a long shot!  After only about 2 weeks, I can see her complexion clearing up tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you&#x27;re thinking this review is a fake...please understand I don&#x27;t have time for that.  I can assure you this brush is worth it!  So much so, I&#x27;ll probably buy another.</li>
            <li> Fun, and easy to use.  Speed seems just right</li>
            <li> Quality product for a cheaper price. It met my expectations!</li>
            <li> For my skin it&#x27;s a little too rough, but may not be for others. Not bad.</li>
            <li> I love this my face was clean and I love it with my face scrub.</li>
            <li> great price, product is as expected.  I love love love the large brush.</li>
            <li> This is amazing!!! I can&#x27;t believe the difference in the way my face has felt just after using it the first time!I also used the pumice stone part because I have some rough spots, like &#x27;computer elbow&#x27;and on my feet and I could tell the difference the first tim I love that it is waterproof and can be used in the shower. Out of all similar products, I&#x27;m glad I chose this one!!</li>
            <li> so far so good! I love that it is waterproof and I can leave it in the shower, where it is needed the most often. At first I thought that the power was a bit slow, but then I came to the conclusion that I&#x27;d probably scrub my skin off if it were too much stronger. Although, the pumice stone attachment would need a bit more power, I would think - however, I didn&#x27;t buy it for my feet, I got it for my face, and for that, it does seem to be working perfectly.</li>
            <li> Tried it, put fresh new batteries in still wouldn&#x27;t work. So my husband said maybe you put the batteries in wrong, he couldn&#x27;t get the thing working. So went to the store and bought a different one and guess what it works.</li>
            <li> Did not work when I received it.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> My son loves this and uses it in the shower for his face and back (acne).</li>
            <li> Meh...the facial brush is perfect but the pumice and body brush don&#x27;t get enough speed to work.</li>
            <li> I love it. It makes my face soft and clean</li>
            <li> Great product for everyday use or just occasional. Large hand held with variety of brushes - great price and would recommend</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift.  I doubt I would have bought it for myself.  With that said, we started off with the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are awful.  They read like the non-English speaking writer used Google translate to write the directions.  (If you have not ever played with Google translate, try it some time.  You&#x27;ll laugh, especially if you translate something into Simplified Chinese and then back into English, and you will totally get what I&#x27;m saying here!) Automated translation programs will never replace fluent human translators since language is seldom going to translate exactly.  I don&#x27;t know if companies are too lazy/cheap to hire a good translator or if they are that rare to find, but we see a lot of very poorly translated instructions on imported goods.  At least these were low on the giggle factor and fairly easy to figure out, even if the illustrations they referred to were not on the trifold brochure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, it&#x27;s not overpowered in terms of the motor, which requires 4 AA batteries (not included.)  The motor also needs a decent battery to have much in terms of power, and while I haven&#x27;t used it enough to accurately gauge its power consumption, I am guessing it will eat batteries fairly quickly.  Bargain brand batteries are going to deliver a slow, wimpy scrub.  With the same high quality rechargeable batteries we use for our electronic devices, it has reasonable power and speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know what its long term durability will be.  I suspect that it won&#x27;t be a long lived product.  Either the motor will give out or the plastic connectors for the brushes will strip out and start spinning the brushes off into the air, as they simply pop on and off.  The directions refer to replacement brushes, but I doubt that they will ever be needed.  When these brushes wear out, I suspect the entire unit will also be wearing out and it will be time to get another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another review mentioned that their face was peeling and burning after using this product.  Unless it was a reaction to the cleanser itself, I can&#x27;t imagine what would cause it unless they felt a need to use the pumice stone on their face.  The facial brush and sponge are just not that abrasive.  Not even the body brush is abrasive enough to abrade facial skin to the point of peeling and pain unless someone obsessively used it for long periods of time (and with plenty of fresh batteries!)  Since I have a lot of other things to do during the course of a day, I doubt that will ever be a concern of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure that it actually does a better job than the not-so-technical and battery free traditional ways of washing your face and body.  It does encourage you to pay more attention to what you are doing, and by doing so, probably wash better.  It may also encourage a teen to spend more time on their daily routine.  For good results, do make sure you clean the brushes and sponges after use, and allow them to air dry completely, or you are apt to accomplish the opposite effect and end up spreading more bacteria/impurities onto your skin rather than removing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside of that, this particular model is also sold under numerous brand names, but the machines appear identical.  It appears that the only differences are the brand, seller, and price--not the machine &amp; accessories in the box.  It&#x27;s also very similar to a machine like this that I had gotten for my daughter when she was a teen, so it&#x27;s apparently one that has been around some time.  It isn&#x27;t going to cause a miracle--it&#x27;s just a device that spins small brushes, sponge or pumice stone around in circles.</li>
            <li> I like the brush as I have dropped it twice and I was able to put it back together and it works....Furthermore after I cleanse my skin with the brush I must use a cotton ball with a astringent to get rid of excess dirt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but doesn&#x27;t have much power</li>
            <li> Love this. Great value.</li>
            <li> wife says she likes it</li>
            <li> Its good fair enough in its work and price</li>
            <li> It was gread purchase. i liked that price and how works. after using this product my skin is so nice!</li>
            <li> This was ordered to use on my face. But I have discovered it works great in the shower TOO. I love to use a self tanner and this is great to prep arms.  Works fabulous as a facial tool too.  Very Happy for this purchase.</li>
            <li> It doesnt work.&lt;br /&gt;I got this in the mail. The next day i tried to use it. I followed instructions and put in batteries. It doesnt work. Waste of my money and time.</li>
            <li> We only had the product one day. Girlfriend accidentally dropped it while showering and it completely broke. The casing came off and the internal wiring came a loose. If I remember, I will add the photo later.</li>
            <li> Nice  product. I  bought  an oil of Olay battery operated  facial  brush at the same  time  that  I  purchased  this set. I&#x27;m  so glad  that I ordered  this because  of all the other attachments  that comes with  it. I  wish it had a higher setting  for using  with  the body and pumice  attachments  but it only  has one speed  which is kind  of  low. I  still  recommend  this  product  for those  who don&#x27;t  want  to  hurt their  face by using  something  that is too powerful. I  like using Organic extra  virgin  coconut oil  along  with  this  to deep  cleanse  my face and  body.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. Has definitely increased the clarity in my skin. Of course with anything you must be consistent to see results. The face wash you use will also play a part in your skin. After over 6 month using this ultra brush, I have convinced others to buy it too.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty cheaply made. If you press hard it slows down the motor (and with the large brush I like to exfoliate my arms and legs so I use a fair amount of pressure). Battery compartment seems a bit lose- sometimes I have to shake the device to get it working. This brush is worth maybe 10 bucks, I regret paying twice that. I will continue to use it for a little while longer, but definitely plan to upgrade to something better quality before this one breaks on me.</li>
            <li> Good brush but didnt really do anything for me.</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble, works great in the shower as advertised, and helps to keep my face very clean.</li>
            <li> After a few months, using the brush does seem to smooth out my skin texture and reduce blackheads. I love the pumice stone for foot calluses. I&#x27;ve never used to makeup sponge attachment and can&#x27;t see how I would use it. The large body brush is great for rough and bumpy skin on the backs of arms. The motor isn&#x27;t very powerful, though, so pressing hard isn&#x27;t an option. A good fail safe for the face, bad for tough foot calluses.</li>
            <li> this is so great! I never want to be without one of these facial brushes. I also ordered one for my daughter in law.</li>
            <li> This is a good substitute for the price. I just can&#x27;t spend the money for the clarisonic. For the money I feel like this is a really great alternative. Is it as good as the clarisonic, probably not, but I feel like it does a great job cleaning, exfoliating, and moisturizing. I also like it a lot more than the olay version which I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to say how well the product worked, but no matter what, it never turned on. I had to send it back and it was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  so excited. I  never thought  i&#x27;d be in love with  a battery operated  machine. But  this&lt;br /&gt;Facial  and Body Ultra Brush Exfoliation  Kit&lt;br /&gt;is Amazing. I&#x27;m  so happy that  it&#x27;s helping me&lt;br /&gt;to improve  my skin.  I feel  and look so much&lt;br /&gt;better</li>
            <li> I use this with a microderm abrasion body wash in the shower. It is just the right size and works well for me. At first I wished it had more power but after using it I could tell it does the job just fine- I mean you don&#x27;t really want something with the power of a 20 volt cordless drill for cleaning your skin. I use a neutrogena microdermabrasion face cleanser machine for my face but this machine has attachments that look like they would work well for your face and feet. The way the batteries go into this machine is kind of a pain but hopefully the batteries will last a couple months. All things considered - it is worth the $ imo.</li>
            <li> Head did not attach so it just feel off. I sent it back.</li>
            <li> I bought this for Christmas for my boyfriend and I. He loves it! Myself, however, the face brush has completely ripped off my cheek skin. His face after a couple uses looks great, while I&#x27;m all whiny with my skin peeling and burning. I have incredibly sensitive skin, so, perhaps after I buy a better cleanser it&#x27;ll work for me also. It is a great product, tad bit noisy which isn&#x27;t bothersome, just beware if you have skin issues, be prepared and have your products ready! Shouldn&#x27;t be used daily.</li>
            <li> bought these as gifts, everyone more than pleased</li>
            <li> Very good product for the price, works fine have no problem recommending this. Great customer service- top of the line quick responses to questions and they go the extra mile.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Thought about buying one that is more expensive but so glad I did not. I cant imagine it working any better than this one.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Great price and quality</li>
            <li> Had it for a couple weeks now and no longer works. When it did work it Was good.</li>
            <li> Wish the bristles were a little softer but overall good facial brush for the price.</li>
            <li> this item shipped fast, i love how it comes with different attachments. It is very gentle on the face and really gives you a deep clean.</li>
            <li> bristles are very, scratch your skin</li>
            <li> Great product for the money!  All attachments work well on the face.</li>
            <li> The bottom was very hard to get off not a lot pressure on the brush.</li>
            <li> This product is a good product but it didn&#x27;t have the power&lt;br /&gt;I wanted. I still use it though.</li>
            <li> Maybe I expected more umph... I wish it had a lot more power... I&#x27;ll use it, but disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this product and for 1/2 the cost of others, works well.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS BETTER THAN EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  My husband and I both use it at the sink and in the shower!</li>
            <li> It does not have a good speed..... Extremely slow</li>
            <li> Great  product for doing what was intended to do.  Ordered a second one for a friend.  Price is great too!  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister and she loves these brushes! Her face I so much clearer! Strongly suggest these to anyone with acne problems!</li>
            <li> The face and body brushes are nice. They are not too stiff and clean and exfoliate well. The brushes spin fairly slowly and it does not take much pressure to stop them from spinning at all. Luckily, when using on face or body a light pressure is all that is needed anyway. Do not force it as you will damage the skin.  I am not a fan of the pumice stone attachment as the unit itself does not have the power necessary to make the pumice stone do its job (not enough revolutions per second and motor not strong enough to allow any pressure at all). Also the sponge is ok but I fear it will harbor many germs and rapidly if not cleaned with soap and water after each use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really good, my friend recommended it to me and I don&#x27;t regret following her.</li>
            <li> Not powerful enough, but for the price its ok, only one speed not 2</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband and his feelings are that the lower priced facial scrubber is just as good and comes with a traveling case. He says I shouldn&#x27;t of spent the extra money in hopes this one was better. The rotating motor is no stronger and it does just as good a job as the lower priced scrubber without the case.</li>
            <li> Great power and great price and I&#x27;m a man who is trying to keep his skin healthy</li>
            <li> it suck , my first time using , when the brush touch my face it stop rolling :( may be i have bad luck .</li>
            <li> This is my fifth brush!  I use it every morning in the shower on my face.  My cheeks feel so fresh and clean.  I love the rubber holder it sits inðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> Great product and did not have to spend a fortune, thank you. I will buy again when this one is worn out!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely great. Helps me with my oily skin due to my big pores! Leaves my skin super clean &amp; smoothe, the brushes are soft so when your washing your face it&#x27;s not hurting you or damaging your skin. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase...</li>
            <li> Made my skin break out really bad after using. I do have sensitive skin, but I have used the oil of olay brand before without this problem.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of a decent priced all in one scrubber. It helped me knock the dry skin off my face that I was having an issue with but the bristles are not as soft as I would prefer.</li>
            <li> This is not what I thought it would be at all. First of all it takes 4 AA batteries, which would be fine if it acted like it had 4 batteries in it. Too much pressure makes the brush stop so the bristles should be a little firmer for a cleaner feel and the brush spins slowly. It was a nice try but you should just invest in something worth your money.</li>
            <li> The product arrive on time but it didn&#x27;t work.  I send it back until now without any feedback of what they are going to do.  Very dissapointed!&lt;br /&gt;They should test the product before leave their facilities....very frustating and time consuming. .</li>
            <li> This facial brush is awesome.  I love the different attachments.  I also love that it is battery operated and not rechargeable.  I have bought five other facial brushes, all of which were more expensive and the rechargeable kind.  All of them stopped charging after a few months.  I have had this for a couple of months and it is still going strong on the same batteries and I am happy to know that once the batteries go, I can easily replace them without having to worry about the brush not keeping a charge.  At first I didn&#x27;t like that it only has one speed, but on the other brushes that I have had, I have never used any of the other speeds anyway so it has ended up not being a big deal at all.  The speed is pretty much perfect.  I feel that it exfoliates my skin but its not too harsh.  I would definitely recommend this brush, it makes a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have only used the facial head.  My face feels good after each use. The device is easy to use.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!  After viewing several similar items for a much greater price, I decided to go with this one.  I purchased 3 of these.  One for myself and 2 as gifts for my daughters!  My 17 year old daughter never likes anything I buy for her, but she LOVES this device!  I was a little leery at first that this was really waterproof, but I have used mine in both the shower AND the bathtub and it is truly waterproof!  The large scrub brush feels wonderful on my skin with body wash or a sugar scrub.  It is not harsh at all!  I use the small scrub brush to cleanse and exfoliate my face AND to apply my serums to my face and neck.  The pumice is perfect for callouses on feet while taking a bath in hot water.  I have not used the little sponge attachment yet, but I am sure that it would work great with cleanser on acne that the scrub brush may be too harsh for.</li>
            <li> So far so good, only had it a couple of months</li>
            <li> Good product,good services</li>
            <li> The wife loves it... Made the wife happy!!!  ;o)&amp;#62;</li>
