    <ol>
            <li>My experience with this razor is bittersweet, it is probably the best razor on the market</li>
            <li>IT IS THE BEST RAZOR</li>
            <li>/&gt;He&#x27;s very happy with it and likes the shave.  </li>
            <li>Mach 3 is the best razor on the market</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m still looking for the perfect razor, the Gillette Mach3 Turbo comes close.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My opinion, this is prabably the best bang for buck on the market.</li>
            <li>Of all the Gillette shavers, this is the best.</li>
            <li>Best razor ever, well for girls anyway...</li>
            <li>It shaves incredibly close, and does an excellent job, going againest the grain!</li>
            <li>It is very good one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s good, though, and in my opinion, it&#x27;s the best safety razor on the market.</li>
            <li>Pros:  Great, close shave.  </li>
            <li>Looks great.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I would have been happy with the Mack 3 Turbo&#x27;s shave</li>
            <li>The Mach3 Turbo is a great shaver ...</li>
            <li>Great shave...</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great product at a fair price.</li>
            <li>well, too good of a razor.</li>
            <li>this thing hit my face, I was impressed by the smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li>And most of the time, if I shave slower I got a great shave after lathering up again and shaving against the grain.  </li>
            <li>For that purpose it works great and would probably work OK if you did not have a beard.</li>
            <li>the price was the best one out there, i recommend it, I use it all the time, the blades are a bit costly but the product is worth it</li>
            <li>This is a really great shaving experience〜The price is good and the appearence is cool.</li>
            <li>Amazon had a great sale once, 25% off and free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Very functional and great value as well!</li>
            <li>Kind of like an oversensitive Ferrari sport steering system.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>the blade is nice</li>
            <li>but the Stahley (which wound up, and had a great balance) and this Gillette both gave more comfortable shaves compared with their contemporaries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far this is probably the best blade I&#x27;ve used to date to shave.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable to use, does a good job of shaving, and each blade lasts for 9 - 10</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Mach 3 Turbo for years, and when I discovered I could easily order them via amazon, I was thrilled...</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t imagine getting a better shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this razor and I have tried others to save money.  </li>
            <li>I love a good, comfortable, gash free shave.</li>
            <li>And the Mach 3 is a terrific razor to get this wonderful shave</li>
            <li>Okay, so that&#x27;s an A- shave, and not an A+.</li>
            <li>I found if I try to shave closer, I got to many nicks.  </li>
            <li>I think the Sensor 3 shaves just as close at the Mach 3 Turbo and does ever better in the problem areas under the edge of my jaw and chin.  </li>
            <li>I can get 5 shaves more before</li>
            <li>I can get 5 shaves more before</li>
            <li>This is the best razor ever made, I had a 2 inch beard growing outward and this razor shaved off my ENTIRE beard with ease.</li>
            <li>I never use my electric shaver anymore, believe it or not it is faster to shave with this razor and cuts alot better.</li>
            <li>Price was comparable to stores,but always turn to Amazon for most things.</li>
            <li>Excellant product, couldnt ask for anything better.</li>
            <li>Competition is better, so stop complaining</li>
            <li>However, I bought it because there were reviews from women who said it was better than the Venus.</li>
            <li>B0001LQGFG Gillette for Women Venus Divine Razor]]and thought somehow the Mach would be better.</li>
            <li>Why do I have to write more than 15 words for my review?</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m used to using Gillette Pro Glide, and therefore i&#x27;m used to the nice, smooth feeling of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>and I was able to proceed.  </li>
            <li>I opened the package, made sure the head was attached and tapped the handle against the clerk&#x27;s computer monitor like I was dislodging stuck hair stubble.  </li>
            <li>I feel I get a much better shave than I was getting with some store brand 5 blade razors.  </li>
            <li>The handle on this thing has much more style, and is a lot more attractive than the sensor 3 and really has a nice precise feel, in your hand.</li>
            <li>I love and will keep using i他.</li>
            <li>It worked flawlessly, as has every other Mach 3 unit I own.  </li>
            <li>It worked flawlessly, as has every other Mach 3 unit I own.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s great looks, and I really love the new handle.  </li>
            <li>Provides a very clean shave, without any irriration.</li>
            <li>This Turbo brand of Mach 3 is actually much better; his shave lasts longer, the blades last longer, and it leaves a very attractive smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>The blades seem (I&#x27;m a shaver, not an engineer) more comfortable and smoother, perhaps more so than the newt 5-blade</li>
            <li>Mach 3 is fine, and I&#x27;m sure it provides a rapid shave:</li>
            <li>And one more good thing, I can use both Sensor Excel Blade and Sensor 3 Blade with both my Sensor Excel and new Sensor 3!  </li>
            <li>The Sensor Excel seems to huge the surface of my face much better, and the Mack 3 Turbo seems not to keep all 3 blade in contact with my skins surface when going over my jaw and chin.  </li>
            <li>It is the cleanest smoothest most comfortable shave that you can imagine.  </li>
            <li>So instead I wet the razor as best</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially good on the head because of the fact that it has less blades and allows you to rinse it out better than a 5 blade razor.  </li>
            <li>The blades do last, but a fresh razor is always best.  </li>
            <li>this gave a fine shave.  </li>
            <li>The Mach 3 Turbo shaves fine, just like the Mach 3.  </li>
            <li>The Mach 3 Turbo shaves fine, just like the Mach 3.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, remember those days, just about, say, four years ago, when the mighty &#x27;Mach 3&#x27; Razor came out?</li>
            <li>And speaking about money, if the shave and blades last longer than before, it&#x27;s a great value!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The important thing to me is that if I shave in the morning I don&#x27;t want a shadow in the evening.</li>
            <li>close smooth shave.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s smooth but not as close</li>
            <li>Overall.. a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like that it had the free shipping.</li>
            <li>Had great success with it for a long time.</li>
            <li>These turbo blades combined with a good shaving gel last me around 2-3 months before I HAVE to replace it.</li>
            <li>After all, good products cost money, and plus, what do u expect, that every product that ever comes out will be like the next?</li>
            <li>I bought this for myself after reading only good reviews here, on amazon.</li>
            <li>you are better off buying the whole razor &amp; cartridges included.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good shave, but the plastic housing for the replaceable head is far too fragile, They fall apart very easily.</li>
            <li>But to be honest with you theres no way your blue strip goes away that quick to where it would require 10 times a month!  </li>
            <li>i would really encourage people to opt for the turbo vs the original or even the vibrating one!  </li>
            <li>The best results are usually the first 4 shaves.  </li>
            <li>Mach3 Turbo is the first blade that lets me comfortably shave against the grain, which is what I need to do to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The very first time I used it to shave at the gym I had a showing stopping problem.  </li>
            <li>I used my new Mack 3 Turbo for about 6 months and went through a lot of new blades to be fair in my judgement.  </li>
            <li>I now own two MACH3 Turbo razors (given as gifts), but am less than satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Having the no-slip grip is fine with me, and a more cylindrical handle for me makes it easier to control the shaver through all the different angles and directions it takes to shave a face.</li>
            <li>All this wasted money spent to find a razor that&#x27;s a good price and gives you a great shave.</li>
            <li>Now after a couple of weeks they don&#x27;t shave as effortlessly as fresh out of the box</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s either someone who&#x27;s starving for attention or someone who&#x27;s been cut too many times by the cheap, generic meat cleavers they sell in all the drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as a review on price and how another razor provided a near as good shave, I think thats BS.</li>
            <li>I shave right after I shower</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many freshly laundered shirts went right back in the closet because collar stains showed up even before leaving the house in the morning.  </li>
            <li>This razor gives a clean smooth shave and the cartridges usually last for a couple weeks without replacement.</li>
            <li>you must be shaving your whole body, legs, arms and face!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s two blades did a much better job with only one stroke.  </li>
            <li>I got my first at my Canadian drug store to see how I could get a less-precise faster shave.</li>
            <li>used Sensor from the first day I started to shave, and I updated to Mach3 when that came out.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different razors and aside from a Shicks 5 blade nothing compares.</li>
            <li>and i personally think they do a better job.</li>
            <li>I lathered up after a hot shower and made the first couple of passes.  </li>
            <li>Got my first handle years ago as a freebie in the mail.</li>
            <li>And 3 blades is more than enough to do what I need.</li>
            <li>she claims the mach 3 works a lot better than any of the womens razors on the market, and now we only have to buy 1 brand of replacement blades</li>
            <li>He seems to be happy with it and hasn&#x27;t complained.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep the new Sensor 3 at home, and keep my old Sensor Excel in my travel bag to use on my many camping and fishing trips, vacation or when ever away from home.  </li>
            <li>The cartridges are easy to replace and don&#x27;t generally clog when using a foam shaving cream, but they can clog when using a gel.</li>
            <li>Funny because I had a mach 3 for a long time, and I love it to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The cartridges usually clean up very easily when rinsed often with hot water and I&#x27;ve received very few nicks with these razors.</li>
            <li>I know, I was never good at jokes.ou a great shave.</li>
            <li>original is cheap  yes, but the turbo feels better on sensitive skin, and the virbrating one i think its a waste of money!</li>
            <li>Yes, a woman uses a man&#x27;s razor because, well, it&#x27;s far superior than the pink ones made for us!</li>
            <li>the blades are new, the shave is great, but they don&#x27;t last that long.  </li>
            <li>After the 6 months of use, I found that it shaved very well until I had to shave over the edge of my jaw and chin where it failed to give a good clean shave right under my jaw-line and chin with the first stroke.  </li>
            <li>Disregarding what you will read as the first of two cons, the price is decent.</li>
            <li>After using the Gilette Sensor for years, I didn&#x27;t think they could improve much on the razor.  </li>
            <li>Very dashing.</li>
            <li>Well, if they get us to spend the money on their stuff, then we&#x27;ll make them look richer than real estate dumbbell Tom Vu and Sly Stallone put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do we really need a review for this?  </li>
            <li>hahahahaha..</li>
            <li>I just want to let people know that I was one of them, but mine are definitely real.</li>
            <li>Haha...</li>
            <li>(the only difference is a free flashlight, G-Force &#x3D; Flashlight).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Schick&#x27;s 4-bladed razor and it was unweildy and dangerous - stick with the best a man can get: The Mach 3 Turbo.</li>
            <li>as I would like, that&#x27;s a bit much.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>The original finally is starting to show its age</li>
            <li>I know that sounds ridiculous as it&#x27;s just a razor, but the Venus does feel a lot less slippery and just more viscerally pleasant and easier to hold.</li>
            <li>And now, just a couple of years back, we were introduced to the Mach 3 TURBO, the special edition of a Mach 3 razor.</li>
            <li>The price differance is not much worse, if you buy the new razors online at Amazon.</li>
            <li>Highly suggested</li>
            <li>I just place the older blades in the case and reuse them for weekend and normal work days.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with product, thought it was a little over priced for the package I received</li>
            <li>It is a great razor, but the blades are expensive.  </li>
            <li>Still, the &#x27;Extreme&#x27; is a terrific razor, cuts the hairs well without leaving me the feeling that I have to be &#x27;so&#x27; careful with it, and is a much more reasonable price for both the razor and blade cartridges than the mighty Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>decided to go ahead and try the new razor.</li>
            <li>no dings or cuts even with brand new blades.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe it is for all of these reasons that stubble has become the new style and macho, taking over for \\&quot;slob.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe it is for all of these reasons that stubble has become the new style and macho, taking over for \\&quot;slob.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Works very well, blades are super sharp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously though, the Mach 3 is an inexpensive and high quality razor that will not cut and burn (even someone as uncoordinated as myself) and provides far smoother and closer results than almost any of the electrical products out there.  </li>
            <li>I use the blades as long as possible and change them for dates and important events.  </li>
            <li>Wow.....</li>
            <li>even with it&#x27;s three blades, it gives me a shave nearly as close as the Mach 3.</li>
            <li>I BOUGHT THIS RAZOR FOR MY 15 YEAR OLD GRANDSON BECAUSE,  ACCORDING TO HIS  FATHER AND HIS 2 UNCLES</li>
            <li>so my beard is soft.</li>
            <li>With out question, my old Gillette Sensor Excel with</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband because he had to shave too frequently</li>
            <li>I bought a mach 3 turbo shaving system because, I could no longer find the replacement sensor 3 heads (that worked well) and was tired of not being able to get a new razor handle with a newer style for the sensor 3.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; does not mean battery like the earlier version (Gillette Mach3 Power).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also the reason I went back to my Sensor Excel until I got my new Gillette Sensor 3.  </li>
            <li>I gave the brand new kit back to her</li>
            <li>yes i have seen the blue strip completely disappear as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does shave very close, but not closer the other 3 bladed razors I have used.  </li>
            <li>Both yield a nice shave, however the 3 blades are slightly heavier than the 5 blades, and therefore tend to get bent less when inside my luggage when other stuff presses against them.  </li>
            <li>First, it may be a clever marketing ploy with the strip turning white long before the blades are dull.</li>
            <li>There simply is no better razor than this one, it is a worthwhile investment because the razor will last a long time and provide an extremely close shave, if you get a razor pack with this it should last you months.</li>
            <li>The Sensor 3 blades are about $1.00 less per pack and last much longer then the Mach 3 Turbo Blades.  </li>
            <li>The 4 blade razors are a bit to big for my upper lip and don&#x27;t seem to  provide any particular benefit other than &amp;</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Okay, so that&#x27;s an A- shave, and not an A+.</li>
            <li> I found if I try to shave closer, I got to many nicks.  </li>
            <li> I think the Sensor 3 shaves just as close at the Mach 3 Turbo and does ever better in the problem areas under the edge of my jaw and chin.  </li>
            <li> I can get 5 shaves more before</li>
            <li> I can get 5 shaves more before</li>
            <li> This is the best razor ever made, I had a 2 inch beard growing outward and this razor shaved off my ENTIRE beard with ease.</li>
            <li> I never use my electric shaver anymore, believe it or not it is faster to shave with this razor and cuts alot better.</li>
            <li> Price was comparable to stores,but always turn to Amazon for most things.</li>
            <li> Excellant product, couldnt ask for anything better.</li>
            <li> Competition is better, so stop complaining</li>
            <li> However, I bought it because there were reviews from women who said it was better than the Venus.</li>
            <li> B0001LQGFG Gillette for Women Venus Divine Razor]]and thought somehow the Mach would be better.</li>
            <li> Why do I have to write more than 15 words for my review?</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m used to using Gillette Pro Glide, and therefore i&#x27;m used to the nice, smooth feeling of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and I was able to proceed.  </li>
            <li> I opened the package, made sure the head was attached and tapped the handle against the clerk&#x27;s computer monitor like I was dislodging stuck hair stubble.  </li>
            <li> I feel I get a much better shave than I was getting with some store brand 5 blade razors.  </li>
            <li> The handle on this thing has much more style, and is a lot more attractive than the sensor 3 and really has a nice precise feel, in your hand.</li>
            <li> I love and will keep using i他.</li>
            <li> It worked flawlessly, as has every other Mach 3 unit I own.  </li>
            <li> It worked flawlessly, as has every other Mach 3 unit I own.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s great looks, and I really love the new handle.  </li>
            <li> Provides a very clean shave, without any irriration.</li>
            <li> This Turbo brand of Mach 3 is actually much better; his shave lasts longer, the blades last longer, and it leaves a very attractive smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> The blades seem (I&#x27;m a shaver, not an engineer) more comfortable and smoother, perhaps more so than the newt 5-blade</li>
            <li> Mach 3 is fine, and I&#x27;m sure it provides a rapid shave:</li>
            <li> And one more good thing, I can use both Sensor Excel Blade and Sensor 3 Blade with both my Sensor Excel and new Sensor 3!  </li>
            <li> The Sensor Excel seems to huge the surface of my face much better, and the Mack 3 Turbo seems not to keep all 3 blade in contact with my skins surface when going over my jaw and chin.  </li>
            <li> It is the cleanest smoothest most comfortable shave that you can imagine.  </li>
            <li> So instead I wet the razor as best</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially good on the head because of the fact that it has less blades and allows you to rinse it out better than a 5 blade razor.  </li>
            <li> The blades do last, but a fresh razor is always best.  </li>
            <li> this gave a fine shave.  </li>
            <li> The Mach 3 Turbo shaves fine, just like the Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> The Mach 3 Turbo shaves fine, just like the Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, remember those days, just about, say, four years ago, when the mighty &#x27;Mach 3&#x27; Razor came out?</li>
            <li> And speaking about money, if the shave and blades last longer than before, it&#x27;s a great value!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The important thing to me is that if I shave in the morning I don&#x27;t want a shadow in the evening.</li>
            <li> close smooth shave.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s smooth but not as close</li>
            <li> Overall.. a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that it had the free shipping.</li>
            <li> Had great success with it for a long time.</li>
            <li> These turbo blades combined with a good shaving gel last me around 2-3 months before I HAVE to replace it.</li>
            <li> After all, good products cost money, and plus, what do u expect, that every product that ever comes out will be like the next?</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself after reading only good reviews here, on amazon.</li>
            <li> you are better off buying the whole razor &amp; cartridges included.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good shave, but the plastic housing for the replaceable head is far too fragile, They fall apart very easily.</li>
            <li> But to be honest with you theres no way your blue strip goes away that quick to where it would require 10 times a month!  </li>
            <li> i would really encourage people to opt for the turbo vs the original or even the vibrating one!  </li>
            <li> The best results are usually the first 4 shaves.  </li>
            <li> Mach3 Turbo is the first blade that lets me comfortably shave against the grain, which is what I need to do to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The very first time I used it to shave at the gym I had a showing stopping problem.  </li>
            <li> I used my new Mack 3 Turbo for about 6 months and went through a lot of new blades to be fair in my judgement.  </li>
            <li> I now own two MACH3 Turbo razors (given as gifts), but am less than satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Having the no-slip grip is fine with me, and a more cylindrical handle for me makes it easier to control the shaver through all the different angles and directions it takes to shave a face.</li>
            <li> All this wasted money spent to find a razor that&#x27;s a good price and gives you a great shave.</li>
            <li> Now after a couple of weeks they don&#x27;t shave as effortlessly as fresh out of the box</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s either someone who&#x27;s starving for attention or someone who&#x27;s been cut too many times by the cheap, generic meat cleavers they sell in all the drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as a review on price and how another razor provided a near as good shave, I think thats BS.</li>
            <li> I shave right after I shower</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many freshly laundered shirts went right back in the closet because collar stains showed up even before leaving the house in the morning.  </li>
            <li> This razor gives a clean smooth shave and the cartridges usually last for a couple weeks without replacement.</li>
            <li> you must be shaving your whole body, legs, arms and face!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s two blades did a much better job with only one stroke.  </li>
            <li> I got my first at my Canadian drug store to see how I could get a less-precise faster shave.</li>
            <li> used Sensor from the first day I started to shave, and I updated to Mach3 when that came out.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different razors and aside from a Shicks 5 blade nothing compares.</li>
            <li> and i personally think they do a better job.</li>
            <li> I lathered up after a hot shower and made the first couple of passes.  </li>
            <li> Got my first handle years ago as a freebie in the mail.</li>
            <li> And 3 blades is more than enough to do what I need.</li>
            <li> she claims the mach 3 works a lot better than any of the womens razors on the market, and now we only have to buy 1 brand of replacement blades</li>
            <li> He seems to be happy with it and hasn&#x27;t complained.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep the new Sensor 3 at home, and keep my old Sensor Excel in my travel bag to use on my many camping and fishing trips, vacation or when ever away from home.  </li>
            <li> The cartridges are easy to replace and don&#x27;t generally clog when using a foam shaving cream, but they can clog when using a gel.</li>
            <li> Funny because I had a mach 3 for a long time, and I love it to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The cartridges usually clean up very easily when rinsed often with hot water and I&#x27;ve received very few nicks with these razors.</li>
            <li> I know, I was never good at jokes.ou a great shave.</li>
            <li> original is cheap  yes, but the turbo feels better on sensitive skin, and the virbrating one i think its a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Yes, a woman uses a man&#x27;s razor because, well, it&#x27;s far superior than the pink ones made for us!</li>
            <li> the blades are new, the shave is great, but they don&#x27;t last that long.  </li>
            <li> After the 6 months of use, I found that it shaved very well until I had to shave over the edge of my jaw and chin where it failed to give a good clean shave right under my jaw-line and chin with the first stroke.  </li>
            <li> Disregarding what you will read as the first of two cons, the price is decent.</li>
            <li> After using the Gilette Sensor for years, I didn&#x27;t think they could improve much on the razor.  </li>
            <li> Very dashing.</li>
            <li> Well, if they get us to spend the money on their stuff, then we&#x27;ll make them look richer than real estate dumbbell Tom Vu and Sly Stallone put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do we really need a review for this?  </li>
            <li> hahahahaha..</li>
            <li> I just want to let people know that I was one of them, but mine are definitely real.</li>
            <li> Haha...</li>
            <li> (the only difference is a free flashlight, G-Force &#x3D; Flashlight).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Schick&#x27;s 4-bladed razor and it was unweildy and dangerous - stick with the best a man can get: The Mach 3 Turbo.</li>
            <li> as I would like, that&#x27;s a bit much.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> The original finally is starting to show its age</li>
            <li> I know that sounds ridiculous as it&#x27;s just a razor, but the Venus does feel a lot less slippery and just more viscerally pleasant and easier to hold.</li>
            <li> And now, just a couple of years back, we were introduced to the Mach 3 TURBO, the special edition of a Mach 3 razor.</li>
            <li> The price differance is not much worse, if you buy the new razors online at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Highly suggested</li>
            <li> I just place the older blades in the case and reuse them for weekend and normal work days.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with product, thought it was a little over priced for the package I received</li>
            <li> It is a great razor, but the blades are expensive.  </li>
            <li> Still, the &#x27;Extreme&#x27; is a terrific razor, cuts the hairs well without leaving me the feeling that I have to be &#x27;so&#x27; careful with it, and is a much more reasonable price for both the razor and blade cartridges than the mighty Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> decided to go ahead and try the new razor.</li>
            <li> no dings or cuts even with brand new blades.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it is for all of these reasons that stubble has become the new style and macho, taking over for \\&quot;slob.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it is for all of these reasons that stubble has become the new style and macho, taking over for \\&quot;slob.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Works very well, blades are super sharp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously though, the Mach 3 is an inexpensive and high quality razor that will not cut and burn (even someone as uncoordinated as myself) and provides far smoother and closer results than almost any of the electrical products out there.  </li>
            <li> I use the blades as long as possible and change them for dates and important events.  </li>
            <li> Wow.....</li>
            <li> even with it&#x27;s three blades, it gives me a shave nearly as close as the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS RAZOR FOR MY 15 YEAR OLD GRANDSON BECAUSE,  ACCORDING TO HIS  FATHER AND HIS 2 UNCLES</li>
            <li> so my beard is soft.</li>
            <li> With out question, my old Gillette Sensor Excel with</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband because he had to shave too frequently</li>
            <li> I bought a mach 3 turbo shaving system because, I could no longer find the replacement sensor 3 heads (that worked well) and was tired of not being able to get a new razor handle with a newer style for the sensor 3.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; does not mean battery like the earlier version (Gillette Mach3 Power).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also the reason I went back to my Sensor Excel until I got my new Gillette Sensor 3.  </li>
            <li> I gave the brand new kit back to her</li>
            <li> yes i have seen the blue strip completely disappear as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does shave very close, but not closer the other 3 bladed razors I have used.  </li>
            <li> Both yield a nice shave, however the 3 blades are slightly heavier than the 5 blades, and therefore tend to get bent less when inside my luggage when other stuff presses against them.  </li>
            <li> First, it may be a clever marketing ploy with the strip turning white long before the blades are dull.</li>
            <li> There simply is no better razor than this one, it is a worthwhile investment because the razor will last a long time and provide an extremely close shave, if you get a razor pack with this it should last you months.</li>
            <li> The Sensor 3 blades are about $1.00 less per pack and last much longer then the Mach 3 Turbo Blades.  </li>
            <li> The 4 blade razors are a bit to big for my upper lip and don&#x27;t seem to  provide any particular benefit other than &amp;</li>
            <li> It took a little while to feel normal, but I now shave with total confidence ...</li>
            <li> Each new iteration of this series promises an even closer shave than the previous one.  </li>
            <li> With it&#x27;s pivoting head, I&#x27;ve noticed that it takes less effort to get a smooth shave underneath the nose and chin with this razor, areas that are typically hard to reach for me without getting nicked.</li>
            <li> The triple blade action really makes shaving a lot easier and I seem less prone to skin irritation and cutting myself than with the cheap disposable razor blades or single blade razors.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The caveat to the cost pro is that I have a son-in-law whose beard is so tough that he has to shave twice a day (and is thankful that he&#x27;s got a job which allows him to go for a week without shaving (but a wife who will accept 3 days), and would be lucky to get 3 shaves from a blade.</li>
            <li> I guess the Gillette head honchos needed a new fleet of &#x27;Porsche Boxter&#x27; convertibles and a few yachts.</li>
            <li> maybe they used dull blades so people can shave fast without cuts?</li>
            <li> Basically don&#x27;t believe the advertising -- a shave that close will probably only happen once with a fresh blade, and if you have thick hair it may also give you a little nick to get it.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time</li>
            <li> The water pressure at the sinks was kept low so the water wouldn&#x27;t splash.  </li>
            <li> Even with the average face with average curves, I find that I have to go over my chin and under my nose at least twice and against the grain before I&#x27;m clean</li>
            <li> Even with the average face with average curves, I find that I have to go over my chin and under my nose at least twice and against the grain before I&#x27;m clean</li>
            <li> I bought a Mach 3 Turbo several years ago as a replacement for my razor and other items tossed by my local YMCA who mistakenly thought my locker was supposed to be vacant (this was the 3rd time this happened in less than 6 months).  </li>
            <li> The clerk tried the same thing with the other head.  </li>
            <li> Very strange, indeed.</li>
            <li> At 78¢ a shave, that doesn&#x27;t SEEM bad, but if you have to shave daily under those circumstances, you&#x27;re looking at almost $30 a month on an activity that most of us would rather do without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have a very difficult time finding something better.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t want to take a half hour to shave my face.</li>
            <li> I have already ordered a champion one with the red and black color scheme, because I&#x27;m a Chicago Bulls fan.</li>
            <li> The other systems with more blades and even fancier designs are WAY to expensive, unless you are just looking to toss money away!</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave on a fairly tough beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Arrived exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not cheap to buy extra&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> What kind of a moron writes a review about a razor?  </li>
            <li> It too suffered the same issue and it too was returned and exchanged for a plain Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> It too suffered the same issue and it too was returned and exchanged for a plain Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would have to disagree with some of the other reveiwers on this.  </li>
            <li> The vibration does make a difference, a small difference (and the AAA battery actually lasts longer than the newer Gillettes with AAs).</li>
            <li> these are too sharp not made well and a horror to use..</li>
            <li> My shaving cream - Absolute Comfort Shave Cream - is a cream, not an aerosol with several ingredients which slightly numb the face.</li>
            <li> My shaving cream - Absolute Comfort Shave Cream - is a cream, not an aerosol with several ingredients which slightly numb the face.</li>
            <li> It does not irritate even though that tough beard is combined with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One banker explained that stubble doesn&#x27;t make you look trustworthy, and they&#x27;ve got enough problems with trust nowadays.the blades are dull.</li>
            <li> Too bad that model is no longer available.  </li>
            <li> Even knowing this, I feel cheated or maybe even talked down to as just an ignorant consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even knowing this, I feel cheated or maybe even talked down to as just an ignorant consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I choose this one over that Mach3 power vibrating blade because, I don&#x27;t know, a sharp blade the vibrates is asking for trouble in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the biggest disappointment with the Mach 3 Turbo and the reason I give it only 3 stars.  </li>
            <li> I also have a slight preference for the straighter handle on the Mach 3 vs. the fusion.  </li>
            <li> However, I was not happy at all with the way the blade got dull so very fast, and there not cheap!  </li>
            <li> I have a heavy dark beard</li>
            <li> Thinking that it just wasn&#x27;t on quite tight</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll still get a bit of irritation, but nothing a little aftershave won&#x27;t fix.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You should not have to filled this stupid box out.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> From Gem* to Eversharp Shick to Gillette Blue Blade to the Stahley vibrating razor of the 1950s using Gillette Thin Blades, I&#x27;ve tried everything to make shaving \\&quot;enjoyable,\\</li>
            <li> but I am a frugal person and don&#x27;t like to waste money.</li>
            <li> The picture pointing to the \\&quot;Low Battery Indicator Light\\&quot; and \\&quot;Automatic Shut-off\\&quot; is false.</li>
            <li> and I exchanged it for a plain Mach 3 unit.  </li>
            <li> Small head.  </li>
            <li> As a result I usually get about 15 to 20 shaves per blade.</li>
            <li> no more blood stains in the morning.</li>
            <li> By the time I&#x27;d make it to my other cheek I&#x27;d grown weary of the game and had switched to the spare head in the kit, thinking I just had a defective head.  </li>
            <li> Yesterday, I went and bought the less expensive Schick Extreme 3, and</li>
            <li> I chose to get a Mach 3 due to the replacement blades being less expensive than Fusion.</li>
            <li> Buy the plain Mach 3 instead!  </li>
            <li> Buy the plain Mach 3 instead!  </li>
            <li> Is the Mach 3 supposed to be dull for a faster shape?</li>
            <li> decided to go ahead and do this review for amazon because I saw there were a lot of reports of dull blades upon purchase.</li>
            <li> at least they don&#x27;t work that well in the tropics.  </li>
            <li> Just because you didn&#x27;t think so, doesn&#x27;t mean mine weren&#x27;t dull.</li>
            <li> The cartridges are expensive, but I have not found any other brand that are cheaper and work just as well.</li>
            <li> So, anti-friction coating or not, it&#x27;s a serious blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i shave my face daily, and if i went off of the blue strips then i would be stupid!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very functional and great value as well!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with product, thought it was a little over priced for the package I received</li>
            <li> After using the Gilette Sensor for years, I didn&#x27;t think they could improve much on the razor.  But with the MACH3 Turbo, they definitely have.  It is the cleanest smoothest most comfortable shave that you can imagine.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the three blades or the lubricant strip, or what, but I can&#x27;t imagine getting a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback to this razor is the replacement blades are a bit pricey, but then, I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It is a great razor, but the blades are expensive.  I love this razor and I have tried others to save money.  But I always come back.  The blades do last, but a fresh razor is always best.  I use the blades as long as possible and change them for dates and important events.  You can get away with about 25 shaves, but for the closest shave, change after a week of use. The best results are usually the first 4 shaves.  I just place the older blades in the case and reuse them for weekend and normal work days. I have gone up to 30 days with one razor.  Try and buy the blades in bulk and on sale.  Amazon had a great sale once, 25% off and free shipping.  That helps reduce the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suckered into the Gillette series since Sensor then Sensor Excel unto MACH3 and then the Turbo.  Each new iteration of this series promises an even closer shave than the previous one.  I now own two MACH3 Turbo razors (given as gifts), but am less than satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;When the blades are new, the shave is great, but they don&#x27;t last that long.  Don&#x27;t even think about buying blades and storing them -- at least they don&#x27;t work that well in the tropics.  I&#x27;ve found the conditioning strips began melting on my unused blades and sometimes even causing rust on the blade.  My experience with this razor is bittersweet, it is probably the best razor on the market but cost of blades will do you in quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait for the next iteration of this series, although by then I might move on to an electric shaver.  Basically don&#x27;t believe the advertising -- a shave that close will probably only happen once with a fresh blade, and if you have thick hair it may also give you a little nick to get it.</li>
            <li> Yeah, remember those days, just about, say, four years ago, when the mighty &#x27;Mach 3&#x27; Razor came out? Yeah, I remember. What a sensation! What a shave! What a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The expensive Mach 3 line has practically surpassed every razor out there in quality shaving and design. But it will never surpass the meaning of the word &#x27;deal&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; And now, just a couple of years back, we were introduced to the Mach 3 TURBO, the special edition of a Mach 3 razor. Hmmm, silver all the way through. Shiny! Very dashing. Wow.....shaves well too, now that the three blades are coated to reduce friction. That&#x27;s a relief!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The razor has an evil price tag of about $11 canadian, and the razor cartridges go for about $10 for 4, or $19 for 8. I guess the Gillette head honchos needed a new fleet of &#x27;Porsche Boxter&#x27; convertibles and a few yachts. Well, if they get us to spend the money on their stuff, then we&#x27;ll make them look richer than real estate dumbbell Tom Vu and Sly Stallone put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I love a good, comfortable, gash free shave. And the Mach 3 is a terrific razor to get this wonderful shave I look forward to every morning. Mind you, the Mach 3 Turbo is just....well, too good of a razor. Kind of like an oversensitive Ferrari sport steering system. It&#x27;ll get to every corner and turn...with scary precision. So, anti-friction coating or not, it&#x27;s a serious blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Yesterday, I went and bought the less expensive Schick Extreme 3, and even with it&#x27;s three blades, it gives me a shave nearly as close as the Mach 3. Okay, so that&#x27;s an A- shave, and not an A+. Still, the &#x27;Extreme&#x27; is a terrific razor, cuts the hairs well without leaving me the feeling that I have to be &#x27;so&#x27; careful with it, and is a much more reasonable price for both the razor and blade cartridges than the mighty Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sigh. What&#x27;s this world coming to? All this wasted money spent to find a razor that&#x27;s a good price and gives you a great shave. Yeah....guess you could say that recently, I went to extremes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; (groan) I know, I was never good at jokes.ou a great shave. Yeah....guess you could say that recently, I went to extremes. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; (groan) I know, I was never good at jokes. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I am tired of replacing bathroom windows and plastering holes in the walls each time one of these babies decides to take flight. Mach 3 is fine, and I&#x27;m sure it provides a rapid shave: I just don&#x27;t like the sonic booms.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS RAZOR FOR MY 15 YEAR OLD GRANDSON BECAUSE,  ACCORDING TO HIS  FATHER AND HIS 2 UNCLES IT IS THE BEST RAZOR OUT THERE.. MY GRANDSON AGREES</li>
            <li> Do we really need a review for this?  It&#x27;s a shaving system, it shaves hair, what else do you need to know?  hahahahaha..I&#x27;m just kidding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have to disagree with some of the other reveiwers on this.  Yes it does state you need to change blades every time the blue strip goes away.  But to be honest with you theres no way your blue strip goes away that quick to where it would require 10 times a month!  you must be shaving your whole body, legs, arms and face!  i shave my face daily, and if i went off of the blue strips then i would be stupid!  because my blue strips last longer then what i feel is the life span of one of these blades.  i go through about 2 blades a month and each blade ive thrown out has the blue strip still but it was faded some what.  yes i have seen the blue strip completely disappear as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;back to the review though.  i would really encourage people to opt for the turbo vs the original or even the vibrating one!  original is cheap  yes, but the turbo feels better on sensitive skin, and the virbrating one i think its a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Funny because I had a mach 3 for a long time, and I love it to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go ahead and try the new razor. I bought this from Walmart. Very strange, indeed. This has never happened before. Is the Mach 3 supposed to be dull for a faster shape? maybe they used dull blades so people can shave fast without cuts? Or I just got a bad package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go ahead and do this review for amazon because I saw there were a lot of reports of dull blades upon purchase. I just want to let people know that I was one of them, but mine are definitely real. It seems possible that Gillette may be letting go of some of their quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry all but the blades suck. Just because you didn&#x27;t think so, doesn&#x27;t mean mine weren&#x27;t dull. This is a crappy A razor. You can go you know what.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Great, close shave.  Small head.  Ultimate lubrication in the strip, it&#x27;s like shaving cream.  Looks great.  Turbo handle and 2 turbo blades for cents extra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  pffttsss...  \\&quot;cons\\&quot;</li>
            <li> So far this is probably the best blade I&#x27;ve used to date to shave.  The triple blade action really makes shaving a lot easier and I seem less prone to skin irritation and cutting myself than with the cheap disposable razor blades or single blade razors.  If you haven&#x27;t tried it once, you should give it shot.  You might finding shaving not such an odious task.</li>
            <li> Actually, I prefer the extream handle over the turbo. But I like the way the head floats on the Turbo system. I shave right after I shower so my beard is soft. As a result I usually get about 15 to 20 shaves per blade. With the one and two blades systems I use to get 15 to 16 shaves per blade. Before they start to pull and get uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> The vibrating, battery-powered razor is the Gillette M3 Power Razor.  The picture pointing to the \\&quot;Low Battery Indicator Light\\&quot; and \\&quot;Automatic Shut-off\\&quot; is false.</li>
            <li> I used my new Mack 3 Turbo for about 6 months and went through a lot of new blades to be fair in my judgement.  It does shave very close, but not closer the other 3 bladed razors I have used.  After the 6 months of use, I found that it shaved very well until I had to shave over the edge of my jaw and chin where it failed to give a good clean shave right under my jaw-line and chin with the first stroke.  I found if I try to shave closer, I got to many nicks.  I only got a close shave in those areas after I lathered up again and shave agaist the grain, but at times I did get razor burn doing that.  With out question, my old Gillette Sensor Excel with it&#x27;s two blades did a much better job with only one stroke.  The Sensor Excel seems to huge the surface of my face much better, and the Mack 3 Turbo seems not to keep all 3 blade in contact with my skins surface when going over my jaw and chin.  All in all, I would have been happy with the Mack 3 Turbo&#x27;s shave, it&#x27;s great looks, and I really love the new handle.  And most of the time, if I shave slower I got a great shave after lathering up again and shaving against the grain.  However, I was not happy at all with the way the blade got dull so very fast, and there not cheap!  This is by far the biggest disappointment with the Mach 3 Turbo and the reason I give it only 3 stars.  It&#x27;s also the reason I went back to my Sensor Excel until I got my new Gillette Sensor 3.  I think the Sensor 3 shaves just as close at the Mach 3 Turbo and does ever better in the problem areas under the edge of my jaw and chin.  The Sensor 3 blades are about $1.00 less per pack and last much longer then the Mach 3 Turbo Blades.  And one more good thing, I can use both Sensor Excel Blade and Sensor 3 Blade with both my Sensor Excel and new Sensor 3!  I&#x27;ll keep the new Sensor 3 at home, and keep my old Sensor Excel in my travel bag to use on my many camping and fishing trips, vacation or when ever away from home.  I would recommend the Gillette Sensor 3 over the Mack 3 Turbo because of these reasons.sor 3 over the Mack 3 Turbo because of these reasons.</li>
            <li> The Mach3 Turbo is a great shaver ... no dings or cuts even with brand new blades.  I was weary ... reluctant to try it.  After all, it&#x27;s got three blades ... who needs all those blades.  All that steel ... what about the environment(?)  But now I wish I had tried this shaver sooner and dropped my two-blade shaver from another manufacturer.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many freshly laundered shirts went right back in the closet because collar stains showed up even before leaving the house in the morning.  It took a little while to feel normal, but I now shave with total confidence ... what a feeling! ... no more blood stains in the morning.</li>
            <li> Name a blade razor, and in the 50+ years I&#x27;ve been shaving, I&#x27;ve had one. From Gem* to Eversharp Shick to Gillette Blue Blade to the Stahley vibrating razor of the 1950s using Gillette Thin Blades, I&#x27;ve tried everything to make shaving \\&quot;enjoyable,\\&quot; In several words, this razor has come as close to \\&quot;perfection\\&quot; as any have or could have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It gives a very close shave on a fairly tough beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It does not irritate even though that tough beard is combined with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The vibration does make a difference, a small difference (and the AAA battery actually lasts longer than the newer Gillettes with AAs). I&#x27;ve never figured it out but the Stahley (which wound up, and had a great balance) and this Gillette both gave more comfortable shaves compared with their contemporaries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The blades seem (I&#x27;m a shaver, not an engineer) more comfortable and smoother, perhaps more so than the newt 5-blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. COST: Disregarding what you will read as the first of two cons, the price is decent. I can save $6 over retail by getting them through Amazon, but we&#x27;re still looking at $35 (give or take) for 15 blades. $2.33 a blade, and if you get 7 shaves per blade, that&#x27;s 33¢ a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caveat to the cost pro is that I have a son-in-law whose beard is so tough that he has to shave twice a day (and is thankful that he&#x27;s got a job which allows him to go for a week without shaving (but a wife who will accept 3 days), and would be lucky to get 3 shaves from a blade. That is no exaggeration. At 78¢ a shave, that doesn&#x27;t SEEM bad, but if you have to shave daily under those circumstances, you&#x27;re looking at almost $30 a month on an activity that most of us would rather do without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The blades are supposed to be changed when the blue strip turns white. There are two problems with this. First, it may be a clever marketing ploy with the strip turning white long before the blades are dull. My shaving cream - Absolute Comfort Shave Cream - is a cream, not an aerosol with several ingredients which slightly numb the face. A friend of mine who is a chemist says that the ingredients will act in such a way to bleach the blue strip. I can get 5 shaves more before an inspection of the strip shows that it is \\&quot;worn.\\&quot; Even knowing this, I feel cheated or maybe even talked down to as just an ignorant consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Even with the average face with average curves, I find that I have to go over my chin and under my nose at least twice and against the grain before I&#x27;m clean shaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it is for all of these reasons that stubble has become the new style and macho, taking over for \\&quot;slob.\\&quot; Unfortunately, I still have many clients in the financial industry where stubble is still a no-no. One banker explained that stubble doesn&#x27;t make you look trustworthy, and they&#x27;ve got enough problems with trust nowadays.the blades are dull.

            <li> I got this for my husband because he had to shave too frequently and I thought they&#x27;d improve upon the Mach3.  Well they did!  This Turbo brand of Mach 3 is actually much better; his shave lasts longer, the blades last longer, and it leaves a very attractive smooth shave.  I choose this one over that Mach3 power vibrating blade because, I don&#x27;t know, a sharp blade the vibrates is asking for trouble in my opinion.  Haha...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s very happy with it and likes the shave.  And speaking about money, if the shave and blades last longer than before, it&#x27;s a great value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly suggested!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good shave, but the plastic housing for the replaceable head is far too fragile, They fall apart very easily. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> I have a heavy dark beard and I need to shave every day. These turbo blades combined with a good shaving gel last me around 2-3 months before I HAVE to replace it. Now after a couple of weeks they don&#x27;t shave as effortlessly as fresh out of the box but I am a frugal person and don&#x27;t like to waste money. The important thing to me is that if I shave in the morning I don&#x27;t want a shadow in the evening. These blades do that. I often go the weekend without shaving so on Monday the blade has alot of work to do and after 2-3 months it can still handle it. With this schedule this shaving system isn&#x27;t expensive at all-less than $1/month.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor ever made, I had a 2 inch beard growing outward and this razor shaved off my ENTIRE beard with ease. Even after that I used the same blade for 2 weeks and it was the closest shave I have ever felt. There simply is no better razor than this one, it is a worthwhile investment because the razor will last a long time and provide an extremely close shave, if you get a razor pack with this it should last you months. I never use my electric shaver anymore, believe it or not it is faster to shave with this razor and cuts alot better.</li>
            <li> I got my first at my Canadian drug store to see how I could get a less-precise faster shave. Regular MACH 3 didn&#x60;t do this but these cut me to- pieces. these are too sharp not made well and a horror to use..</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife as,she ismalwaysnusing mine. Nice. close smooth shave. Price was comparable to stores,but always turn to Amazon for most things.</li>
            <li> While I was dissapointed that no jets came flying into my room at the instant this thing hit my face, I was impressed by the smooth and close shave. The Mach 3 Turbo is a solid razor - but I recommend the Mach 3 Turbo G-Force if you can find it (the only difference is a free flashlight, G-Force &#x3D; Flashlight). I&#x27;ve tried Schick&#x27;s 4-bladed razor and it was unweildy and dangerous - stick with the best a man can get: The Mach 3 Turbo.</li>
            <li> What kind of a moron writes a review about a razor?  Well, it&#x27;s either someone who&#x27;s starving for attention or someone who&#x27;s been cut too many times by the cheap, generic meat cleavers they sell in all the drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, the Mach 3 is an inexpensive and high quality razor that will not cut and burn (even someone as uncoordinated as myself) and provides far smoother and closer results than almost any of the electrical products out there.  I don&#x27;t even feel the \\&quot;aftershave burn\\&quot; after using this product.  You&#x27;ll have a very difficult time finding something better.</li>
            <li> Provides a very clean shave, without any irriration. Excellant product, couldnt ask for anything better. As far as a review on price and how another razor provided a near as good shave, I think thats BS. After all, good products cost money, and plus, what do u expect, that every product that ever comes out will be like the next? Competition is better, so stop complaining</li>
            <li> I bought this from Amazon because I lost my years-old shaver and still had replacement blades left.  I&#x27;ve also got the Gillette Fusion 5-blade shaver, and I definitely prefer 3 blades, especially for travel.  Both yield a nice shave, however the 3 blades are slightly heavier than the 5 blades, and therefore tend to get bent less when inside my luggage when other stuff presses against them.  I also have a slight preference for the straighter handle on the Mach 3 vs. the fusion.  Having the no-slip grip is fine with me, and a more cylindrical handle for me makes it easier to control the shaver through all the different angles and directions it takes to shave a face.</li>
            <li> Mach 3 is the best razor on the market</li>
            <li> The problem I&#x27;ve encountered is that the Mach 3 Turbo System gets quite expensive. It is suggested by the manufacturer that you change blades when the blue strip is gone. If I follow this guideline, I end up changing blades about ten times a month. At $15 for 8 blades, that comes to almost $20 per month just in blades! For a shave that&#x27;s smooth but not as close as I would like, that&#x27;s a bit much.</li>
            <li> I have a bear and just use this for trim up work. For that purpose it works great and would probably work OK if you did not have a beard.</li>
            <li> Arrived exactly as expected. The razor received was the one listed in the description. It came with a blade attached to the razor, an extra blade, and the plastic to store the razor on. I think it gives a cleaner and smoother shave than the razors with 5 blades.</li>
            <li> Been using this razor system for years; this was a stocking stuffer for our son..... This product is a winner!</li>
            <li> I gave this razor two stars because it does work sort of. However, I bought it because there were reviews from women who said it was better than the Venus. I had the Venus [[ASIN:B0001LQGFG Gillette for Women Venus Divine Razor]]and thought somehow the Mach would be better. But it feels awful in my hands. I know that sounds ridiculous as it&#x27;s just a razor, but the Venus does feel a lot less slippery and just more viscerally pleasant and easier to hold. I felt like I could cut myself easier with the Mach. It just felt creepy to me. I gave it to my husband.</li>
            <li> i did not shave alot when i used it, I used it once every week or once every two weeks. the blade is nice and I really like it.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m still looking for the perfect razor, the Gillette Mach3 Turbo comes close.&lt;br /&gt;I used Sensor from the first day I started to shave, and I updated to Mach3 when that came out. The Turbo is truly an improvement on both of them. Mach3 Turbo is the first blade that lets me comfortably shave against the grain, which is what I need to do to get a close shave. It&#x27;ll still nick you, but not often. You&#x27;ll still get a bit of irritation, but nothing a little aftershave won&#x27;t fix.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good, though, and in my opinion, it&#x27;s the best safety razor on the market. If only it were easier to afford.</li>
            <li> Works well. What can I say? Its a razor.</li>
            <li> After trying disposables and electric razors, I&#x27;ve used the Gillette Mach3 Turbo Razor for several years. This razor gives a clean smooth shave and the cartridges usually last for a couple weeks without replacement. People who have heavier beards may receive fewer shaves from each cartridge. With it&#x27;s pivoting head, I&#x27;ve noticed that it takes less effort to get a smooth shave underneath the nose and chin with this razor, areas that are typically hard to reach for me without getting nicked. The cartridges are easy to replace and don&#x27;t generally clog when using a foam shaving cream, but they can clog when using a gel. The cartridges usually clean up very easily when rinsed often with hot water and I&#x27;ve received very few nicks with these razors. Overall.. a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please rate this review if you found it helpful.</li>
            <li> like it. It is very good one. Why do I have to write more than 15 words for my review?</li>
            <li> the price was the best one out there, i recommend it, I use it all the time, the blades are a bit costly but the product is worth it</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for years, and would recommend it. The cartridges are expensive, but I have not found any other brand that are cheaper and work just as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself after reading only good reviews here, on amazon. I was so disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to using Gillette Pro Glide, and therefore i&#x27;m used to the nice, smooth feeling of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;This felt like i was dropped in a pool or razorblades from an airplane. Just scratching my skin and cutting it all over.&lt;br /&gt;I dumped this thing ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time Gillette user and will be for years to come. I have tried many different razors and aside from a Shicks 5 blade nothing compares. I find that Gillette blades last longer and i personally think they do a better job.</li>
            <li> This prodoct says it comes with a razor and two cartridges but when I got it it only had one cartridge !!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought a Mach 3 Turbo several years ago as a replacement for my razor and other items tossed by my local YMCA who mistakenly thought my locker was supposed to be vacant (this was the 3rd time this happened in less than 6 months).  This time they were paying for my replacement items.  The store I was at was out of the Mach 3 so I bought a Mach 3 Turbo instead (I didn&#x27;t realize that the blade weren&#x27;t interchangeable at the time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very first time I used it to shave at the gym I had a showing stopping problem.  I lathered up after a hot shower and made the first couple of passes.  Like the Mach 3 this gave a fine shave.  The water pressure at the sinks was kept low so the water wouldn&#x27;t splash.  So instead I wet the razor as best I could and tapped the handle on the side of the sink.  This caused the head to pop off!  Thinking that it just wasn&#x27;t on quite tight I reattached the head and tried again.  Again it popped off.  There mere act of the head popping off the razor and either rattling around in the sink or flying onto the counter achieved the desired goal at least and I was able to proceed.  By the time I&#x27;d make it to my other cheek I&#x27;d grown weary of the game and had switched to the spare head in the kit, thinking I just had a defective head.  No dice.  It did the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That night I returned the kit to the store I bought it at and exchanged it for another Mach 3 Turbo; I assumed that the handle was defective.  Their in the store at the Returns counter I opened the package, made sure the head was attached and tapped the handle against the clerk&#x27;s computer monitor like I was dislodging stuck hair stubble.  The head flew off and flew across the floor.  The clerk tried the same thing with the other head.  It too flew off the handle, this time across the counter at me.  I gave the brand new kit back to her and I exchanged it for a plain Mach 3 unit.  I demonstrated for her that it worked properly, tapping, pulling and tugging on the head to try and dislodge it.  It worked flawlessly, as has every other Mach 3 unit I own.  I&#x27;ve been using my replacement Mach 3 at the gym ever since.  My father ran into a similar when my mother, upon seeing my razor bought my father a Mach 3 Turbo.  It too suffered the same issue and it too was returned and exchanged for a plain Mach 3.  I&#x27;m posting this review because I find myself once again buying another shaving kit, this time for my girlfriend&#x27;s house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware of this usability problem with the Mach 3 Turbo.  Buy the plain Mach 3 instead!  The Mach 3 Turbo shaves fine, just like the Mach 3.  But the Mach 3&#x27;s head will stay on whereas the Mach 3 Turbo will not.ad to try and dislodge it.

            <li> For the last 10 or so years I have been using whatever razor was on sale at the grocery store, often generic store brand ones.  I decided to give the Mach3 a try again since I had used one back in the day.  I use it to shave both my face and head.  I feel I get a much better shave than I was getting with some store brand 5 blade razors.  It&#x27;s especially good on the head because of the fact that it has less blades and allows you to rinse it out better than a 5 blade razor.  The only downside is the expense of the cartridges, but I guess you gotta pay if you don&#x27;t want to go DE.  I personally don&#x27;t want to take a half hour to shave my face.</li>
            <li> I bought a mach 3 turbo shaving system because, I could no longer find the replacement sensor 3 heads (that worked well) and was tired of not being able to get a new razor handle with a newer style for the sensor 3. I put off buying the mach 3 for some time, because it is a bit pricer. But let me tell you what. I wish I would have got one A LOT SOONER!! The price differance is not much worse, if you buy the new razors online at Amazon. The handle on this thing has much more style, and is a lot more attractive than the sensor 3 and really has a nice precise feel, in your hand. It shaves incredibly close, and does an excellent job, going againest the grain! You look forward to shaving, which is something that never happened before. And you feel like a million bucks when you are done! I have already ordered a champion one with the red and black color scheme, because I&#x27;m a Chicago Bulls fan. My opinion, this is prabably the best bang for buck on the market. The other systems with more blades and even fancier designs are WAY to expensive, unless you are just looking to toss money away! Try this system!!</li>
            <li> Great shave... but you do have to change cartridges way to soon... and believe me it&#x27;s not cheap to buy extra&#x27;s... you are better off buying the whole razor &amp; cartridges included.</li>
            <li> Of all the Gillette shavers, this is the best. It is comfortable to use, does a good job of shaving, and each blade lasts for 9 - 10 days.[[ASIN:B000065AB0 Gillette, Mach3 Turbo Shaving System, 1 system]]</li>
            <li> This is a really great shaving experience〜The price is good and the appearence is cool. I love and will keep using i他.</li>
            <li> Gillette Mach3 Turbo Razor name is misleading.  \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; does not mean battery like the earlier version (Gillette Mach3 Power).  Too bad that model is no longer available.  Had great success with it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Never can go wrong with this</li>
            <li> Works very well, blades are super sharp. I chose to get a Mach 3 due to the replacement blades being less expensive than Fusion. I actually prefer the Mach 3 to the 5 blade Fusion, it is lighter and seems easier to get into close spots. Great product. Comes with two cartridges (one on the razor, one extra). Highly suggested</li>
            <li> I purchase blades at Costco in multi packs. Got my first handle years ago as a freebie in the mail. I guess they were trying to hook me on their blades like some sort of drug dealer. It worked! The original finally is starting to show its age so I  needed another. And 3 blades is more than enough to do what I need. The 4 blade razors are a bit to big for my upper lip and don&#x27;t seem to  provide any particular benefit other than &amp;#34;more is better&amp;#34;, sort of how the V8 engine came into being. But that is another story. This is a great product at a fair price.</li>
            <li> You should not have to filled this stupid box out.  Thanks in advance for removing this stupid and senseless requirements!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife to keep her from stealing my razor constantly to shave her legs. she claims the mach 3 works a lot better than any of the womens razors on the market, and now we only have to buy 1 brand of replacement blades</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Mach 3 Turbo for years, and when I discovered I could easily order them via amazon, I was thrilled... especially since I had just left my in a hotel room and needed to replace it. Best razor ever, well for girls anyway... Yes, a woman uses a man&#x27;s razor because, well, it&#x27;s far superior than the pink ones made for us!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage son. He seems to be happy with it and hasn&#x27;t complained. I like that it had the free shipping.</li>
            <li> When I received this product, the back was opened and one of the cartridges was gone. I am shocked by such outrageous act of dishonesty.</li>
