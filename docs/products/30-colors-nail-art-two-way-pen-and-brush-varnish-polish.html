            <li>Polish is ok though.</li>
            <li>so I was sure that I had one that was busted</li>
            <li>I have not been able to squeeze any color out of 20 of them.</li>
            <li>but this was cheaper and had more colors</li>
            <li>/&gt;they seem more like a gel then a polish</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>To BuY Better stuff</li>
            <li>I got to get more.</li>

            <li>Love them</li>
            <li>I love the variety of colors and glitters.</li>
            <li>The polish itself seems to be good quality and worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love it because any color of clothes i wear i can match my polish with the outfit.</li>
            <li>Still haven&#x27;t been able to use the pen side on any of them, they seem clogged.</li>
            <li>The polish is more like a latex material</li>
            <li>Spend a bit more $ to get better quality.</li>
            <li>and we are satisfied with the service</li>
            <li>I am having the product tested before I give it to my grand daughter.</li>
            <li>You might want to shop for a better quality rather than quantity set.</li>
            <li>They are ok to play around with.</li>
            <li>its dileverd on tim easy to remove it .</li>
            <li>/&gt;the smell is a bit too strong however</li>
            <li>Strong odor use in a well ventilated room.</li>
            <li>The ones that did arrive are ok, nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Such a strong smell!!!  </li>
            <li>I Finally got them and pretty and easy to create designs LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This product is super cheap!</li>
            <li>and it was really cheap for what I got.</li>
            <li>Details lines were my brush wont fit</li>
            <li>so they come out way too light.</li>
            <li>They are cheap in price and cheap in quality</li>
            <li>The fumes were fairly strong when we opened the package but dissipated quickly.</li>
            <li>When I got them I was really excited  about using them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that it&#x27;s a scam.</li>
            <li>it was all over them and had to clean them up.</li>
            <li>If something&#x27;s too good to be true, it probably is.&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty bummed that I never actually got these because they look extremely cool, and I hope that if anyone chooses to buy these that they will have a better experience than I did.</li>
            <li>the bottom there was a needle taped to the bottom which was supposed to be a special tool</li>
            <li>I found these and was super excited about the price, but when i looked at my orders and it said &#x27;Shipped&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I really like the variety of colors however, many of the pens were leaking upon arrival.  </li>
            <li>My daughter Simona thinks that this is cool.</li>
            <li>I love these so much</li>
            <li>really cool designs with them and not have to worry about smudging the nail polish</li>
            <li>I like that the bottles are soft plastic because when I used the pen tip it was easy to control and the polished came out even, I was able to write letters without skip.</li>
            <li>polish is super watery and the brushes do not work</li>
            <li>The colors are varied and very pretty.</li>
            <li>I was really excited for it at first.</li>
            <li>The pen itself is a great idea until you try to write with it and the paint comes out uneven and clumpy.</li>
            <li>I was lucky to find a decent size plastic container with snal close, attached lid that the bottles just fit in.</li>
            <li>it was sort of worth it because of the offer of $30 off my order (for 2).</li>
            <li>all beautiful vibrant colors for endless creations.</li>
            <li>Yes this time they did me right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;that part is great and if you have a steady enough hand you can do designs with the dotter but as far as the nail brush goes...</li>
            <li>The came exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I got these for my daughter for her birthday, as she has become interested in nail art.</li>
            <li>I think the picture is very mis-leading!</li>
            <li>, too many greens, not enough pinks, was hoping for a brown</li>
            <li>but if you work out better I will definitely order these again and tell everyone I know that they really work</li>
            <li>They are vibrant and beautiful and only a few of the pens had to be cleaned out in order for them to work and the glitters won&#x27;t work through the pens but it doesn&#x27;t bug me at all.</li>
            <li>well this was  a huge mistake because when I got them I noticed  there was some white nail polish on some of the bottles</li>
            <li>and it was really watery and didn&#x27;t  apply an even coat.</li>
            <li>Now, not so much.</li>
            <li>but i wouldn&#x27;t use it for my whole nail</li>
            <li>Very upsetting</li>
            <li>Fast response when you have any questions.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;The package did arrive fast.</li>
            <li>Some do the job done don&#x27;t some ooze out of the pen too fast</li>
            <li>But the nail Polish itself was very watery and didn&#x27;t apply well to the nail.  </li>
            <li>the discrption was very clear its hve much choises of color</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t figure out how the pen part works because the polish won&#x27;t come out, but i use it as a normal nail polish and make do.</li>
            <li>but they are fine other then that</li>
            <li>but then I put a second coat on and it was all right.</li>
            <li>Most of the brushes are curved instead of straight making it hard to make lines.</li>
            <li>about 5 bottles were opened in the bag when I got it, and got all over several other bottles, and there are about 5-8 colors that have gliter in the, and therefore the detailed pen won&#x27;t work because the glitter is too big to fit in the tip.</li>
            <li>They dry out quickly and are just crappy.</li>
            <li>I love the tips for small details.</li>
            <li>They are exactly as pictured, only issue one leaked.</li>
            <li>This product reminds me of the cheap nail polish you would buy from the discount store when I was little.</li>
            <li>came one day early</li>
            <li>But the colors are thin and don&#x27;t show up as good as american polish.</li>
            <li>They came earlier than expected,they where package securely,none of the bottles where crushed,I open each one and the polish was the right consistency</li>
            <li>No mess, no leaks,beautiful colors.</li>
            <li>These nail polishes are runny, very watered down.</li>
            <li>I just got these and they are cute if a little small.</li>
            <li>these clog easily and the polish blobs out, not happy at all</li>

            <li> They came earlier than expected,they where package securely,none of the bottles where crushed,I open each one and the polish was the right consistency</li>
            <li> No mess, no leaks,beautiful colors.</li>
            <li> These nail polishes are runny, very watered down.</li>
            <li> I just got these and they are cute if a little small.</li>
            <li> these clog easily and the polish blobs out, not happy at all</li>
            <li> These were a little smaller than what I expected but arrived early.</li>
            <li> Got here earlier than expected, although 2 of the nail polishes had their brushes buried inside of the container.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> The majority of the brushes in the bottles were all bent and frayed out, impossible to actually use for painting lines or fine work.</li>
            <li> Somewhere during packing or in the factory a bottle had been spilled on the outside of the packaging bag, but it had dried long since and was NOT one of the bottles in our package, so no harm done.</li>
            <li> The polish arrived in a zip lock bag with half of them broke open.</li>
            <li> Only slightly.</li>
            <li> Hated it doesn&#x27;t work right brushes easily break I would rate it a half a star DONT BUY IT</li>
            <li> not What I expected</li>
            <li> Just as expected</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Bottles are about an inch in height and 1/2 inch wide.</li>
            <li> Just not much in there</li>
            <li> so it was a total waste.</li>
            <li> I have mine stored in  a closed container to prevent drying.</li>
            <li> I feel I wasted my money big time.</li>
            <li> i also like the tip in which you can do any design whether it being small or big</li>
            <li> Other then that I got all colors</li>
            <li> the pens don&#x27;t want to work, the polish brushes aren&#x27;t good to  polish with, I was just very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but they arrived leaking so half of them were half empty by the time my daughter received them.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve read the previous reviews before purchasing.  </li>
            <li> It made it to me in less then 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> so the mess was contained.</li>
            <li> It was a mess.  </li>
            <li> The polish is so thin and translucent, especially in the lighter colors, you can barely see it - the smell is horrible and about of half came with half of the bottle filled.</li>
            <li> Two leaked a little in the box they came in</li>
            <li> And some of the colors seem a little watery.</li>
            <li> For me i used them for the smallest little.</li>
            <li> Also the lids weren&#x27;t on tight and the green sparkle one leaked.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> wasted money on this.</li>
            <li> I dont recommend them to any one.what a waste of money and space.</li>
            <li> I had a few bottles leak during shipping and when I opened the box</li>
            <li> some were dried or too wateree</li>
            <li> When they first came I was a little disappointed that they went plastic</li>
            <li> The pen part of all thirty hat busted or leaked very bad in the pen part cap and the color rubs off easily</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even order another product from this seller considering their shady business practices.  </li>
            <li> Just not sure what the pins are for or how to use that way.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the problem is.</li>
            <li> very sloppy made looks like it was a regular nail brush and was just cut.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed they were so small and cheap nail polishes and came with needles stuck on the bottom of them like what the hell</li>
            <li> Nail polish To Thick.  </li>
            <li> If I had not, my wife would have had thirty very small bottle all over the place in her nursing room</li>
            <li> I would not recommend buying this product if you are a serious nail artist.</li>
            <li> Packing is not good.  </li>
            <li> as shown and dotter works well comes with a thin needle in the bottom in case of clogging. ..</li>
            <li> Poorly made plastic bottles that arrived leaking.</li>
            <li> I mean nothing went wrong.</li>
            <li> Also, it is extremely difficult to squeeze any polish out of the pen side even after clearing the line with the metal pins provided.  </li>
            <li> Useless product.</li>
            <li> Smells bad</li>
            <li> Not too bad.  </li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> This kinda disappointed me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely disappointed in this set for the amount of money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Would Not Recommend ToAnyone TerriblE Quality.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible.</li>
            <li> Three of the tubes leaked all over the bag, which came as no surprise, considering the horrible packaging.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> :( not What I expected</li>
            <li> Such a strong smell!!!  They dry out quickly and are just crappy.</li>
            <li> Love these. Just as expected</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed they were so small and cheap nail polishes and came with needles stuck on the bottom of them like what the hell</li>
            <li> Great value and product</li>
            <li> My daughter bugged me for these</li>
            <li> These work okay but they arrived leaking so half of them were half empty by the time my daughter received them.</li>
            <li> Add says 30 colors, I only received 29. Also the lids weren&#x27;t on tight and the green sparkle one leaked.</li>
            <li> These nail polishes are runny, very watered down. The pin was a needle taped to the bottom of the bottle. I contacted the company about this and never heard from them. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. I wouldn&#x27;t even order another product from this seller considering their shady business practices.  I should&#x27;ve read the previous reviews before purchasing.  Boo to this seller!</li>
            <li> This product is super cheap! The bottles were leaking and it&#x27;s made from a very cheap material.&lt;br /&gt;The polish is super watery and the brushes do not work whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this if you wish to make excellent nail art.&lt;br /&gt;I wasted money on this.It does not work.</li>
            <li> Out of 30, only 1 pen works and the content comes out in blobs. The polish is so thin and translucent, especially in the lighter colors, you can barely see it - the smell is horrible and about of half came with half of the bottle filled. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Took 3 months to arrive. Bottles are about an inch in height and 1/2 inch wide. Polish is ok though. Just not much in there</li>
            <li> Two leaked a little in the box they came in but they are fine other then that</li>
            <li> I just got these and they are cute if a little small. The smell of nail polish when I opened the box was massive and gave me an immediate headache so I was sure that I had one that was busted but it wasn&#x27;t. I love the tips for small details. The colors are varied and very pretty.</li>
            <li> I really like the variety of colors however, many of the pens were leaking upon arrival.  Also, it is extremely difficult to squeeze any polish out of the pen side even after clearing the line with the metal pins provided.  I have not been able to squeeze any color out of 20 of them.</li>
            <li> I thought that this would  be a nice product to have because the colors looked nice in the picture and it was really cheap for what I got. When I got them I was really excited  about using them. I was going to get the shany nail polish but this was cheaper and had more colors so I bought  this kind well this was  a huge mistake because when I got them I noticed  there was some white nail polish on some of the bottles and it didn&#x27;t even come with white nail polish.on the bottom there was a needle taped to the bottom which was supposed to be a special tool but it wasn&#x27;t helpful at all u couldn&#x27;t use it for sewing either so it was a total waste. I opened a bottle and applied one coat and it was really watery and didn&#x27;t  apply an even coat. This kinda disappointed me but then I put a second coat on and it was all right. So then I started trying to make designs and things and it</li>
            <li> The came exactly as described. We didn&#x27;t have any issues with breakage during shipping (though customs held up the order). They are easy to apply, and my daughter is having a great time using them to practice cool nail art designs.</li>
            <li> When they first came I was a little disappointed that they went plastic but it but if you work out better I will definitely order these again and tell everyone I know that they really work</li>
            <li> These are great for nail designs. The only thing is that the odor is stronger than an actual polish. And some of the colors seem a little watery.</li>
            <li> the discrption was very clear its hve much choises of color its dileverd on tim easy to remove it .</li>
            <li> Although I did not get any leaks, and all the pen tips do work. Once you get the pen tip to work it wont stop flowing. Even after you put the cap on. I take the cap off and find that they all leaked inside the cap. Useless product. I was really excited for it at first. Now, not so much. garbage.</li>
            <li> so i just got this today came one day early which is good.&lt;br /&gt; but i wouldn&#x27;t use it for my whole nail i would just use the dotter.&lt;br /&gt;that part is great and if you have a steady enough hand you can do designs with the dotter but as far as the nail brush goes... not so good.&lt;br /&gt;i got this for practice purposes and its great for that.&lt;br /&gt;they seem more like a gel then a polish so keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product. I would recommend it. Great price. I will buy again. The colours were great.</li>
            <li> Very cheap!!!! I dont recommend them to any one.what a waste of money and space. Dont spend your money pen side don&#x27;t work at all.....</li>
            <li> I found these and was super excited about the price, but when i looked at my orders and it said &#x27;Shipped&#x27;. I contacted the seller and they told me that they had a &amp;#34;Server malfunction&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I never got a replacement or my money back. (My opinion) I&#x27;m pretty sure that it&#x27;s a scam. If something&#x27;s too good to be true, it probably is.&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty bummed that I never actually got these because they look extremely cool, and I hope that if anyone chooses to buy these that they will have a better experience than I did.</li>
            <li> Awesome colors however the packaging could be better. I had a few bottles leak during shipping and when I opened the box it was all over them and had to clean them up.</li>
            <li> Would Not Recommend ToAnyone TerriblE Quality. Pen Part Does Not Work Well.  Nail polish To Thick.  Pay The Extra Money To BuY Better stuff</li>
            <li> I purchased these because my daughter and I like to try different things on our nails and I was glade I did. They came earlier than expected,they where package securely,none of the bottles where crushed,I open each one and the polish was the right consistency all beautiful vibrant colors for endless creations. I like that the bottles are soft plastic because when I used the pen tip it was easy to control and the polished came out even, I was able to write letters without skip. I got to get more. I have mine stored in  a closed container to prevent drying.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the nail polish... i also like the tip in which you can do any design whether it being small or big... really recommend it to creative artists out there!!!!</li>
            <li> My colors nail art two eay pen cam in perfect condition. No mess, no leaks,beautiful colors. It made it to me in less then 2 weeks. Yes this time they did me right. I mean nothing went wrong. Soooo happy to own them .l check every one of them and it was fair.of course there are colors that are not favorable and you wish they would off given you a better one. But hey! No ones perfect. For me i used them for the smallest little. Details lines were my brush wont fit in.and these pen do ,do justice. Love them</li>
            <li> I love the variety of colors and glitters. They are vibrant and beautiful and only a few of the pens had to be cleaned out in order for them to work and the glitters won&#x27;t work through the pens but it doesn&#x27;t bug me at all.</li>
            <li> They are exactly as pictured, only issue one leaked. A lot of good colors.. Just not sure what the pins are for or how to use that way.</li>
            <li> several of the polishes had opened en-route. They were packaged well so the mess was contained. The polish itself seems to be good quality and worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love it because any color of clothes i wear i can match my polish with the outfit. I just cannot explain the beauty of my nails every time someone stops me and ask where did you get that polish i just try Amazon.</li>
            <li> Got here earlier than expected, although 2 of the nail polishes had their brushes buried inside of the container. Very upsetting</li>
            <li> lots of colors, but was not please the bottles were plastic as they puncture easily, but these are a wonderful assortment of color.</li>
            <li> Fast response when you have any questions.....I Finally got them and pretty and easy to create designs LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Hated it doesn&#x27;t work right brushes easily break I would rate it a half a star DONT BUY IT</li>
            <li> great product great price</li>
            <li> sent as Birthday Gift ,my nice is very pleased with it</li>
            <li> Daughter loves nail art really nice colors</li>
            <li> The nail Art was good, it seemed to be some leaks, do not know if it was from the shipping, and I thought the case would look like it was on the picture.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you anyway&lt;br /&gt;The package did arrive fast.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t work.  just that simple</li>
            <li> my mom said the color quiality was great and she enjoyed it and still have some colors today ( its been a year lol )</li>
            <li> My daughter Simona thinks that this is cool.</li>
            <li> The majority of the brushes in the bottles were all bent and frayed out, impossible to actually use for painting lines or fine work. Colors were watery as others have said. Still haven&#x27;t been able to use the pen side on any of them, they seem clogged. Not sure what the problem is.</li>
            <li> Smells bad but they work great for nail art</li>
            <li> This item arrived from overseas in a bag that had leaked in transit.  It was a mess.  The polish is more like a latex material so it peels off in sheets and there was no &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; (the reason I bought it) in all 30 colors.  Spend a bit more $ to get better quality.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for young growing girls.</li>
            <li> Got the item in perfect timing. I haven&#x27;t used all the colors yet but the ones I have the detailing brush us very sloppy made looks like it was a regular nail brush and was just cut. Other then that I got all colors as shown and dotter works well comes with a thin needle in the bottom in case of clogging. ..</li>
            <li> Some do the job done don&#x27;t some ooze out of the pen too fast and some don&#x27;t even come out of the pen.</li>
            <li> These were a little smaller than what I expected but arrived early. Can&#x27;t wait to do some designs.</li>
            <li> I got these for my daughter for her birthday, as she has become interested in nail art. Man, you open the bag and start taking stuff out and it just keeps coming—30 colors is A LOT of nail polish! The fumes were fairly strong when we opened the package but dissipated quickly. Somewhere during packing or in the factory a bottle had been spilled on the outside of the packaging bag, but it had dried long since and was NOT one of the bottles in our package, so no harm done.</li>
            <li> The polish arrived in a zip lock bag with half of them broke open.</li>
            <li> this company was very kind to me and my girfriend and we are satisfied with the service and the company was polite and helpful toward us</li>
            <li> the polishes are so cheapified. the pens don&#x27;t want to work, the polish brushes aren&#x27;t good to  polish with, I was just very disappointed. I feel I wasted my money big time.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors in bottle. But the colors are thin and don&#x27;t show up as good as american polish. What I meant by American is this package comes from China. And takes longer to get.</li>
            <li> Colors are watery and not white based so they come out way too light. The pen itself is a great idea until you try to write with it and the paint comes out uneven and clumpy. Most of the brushes are curved instead of straight making it hard to make lines. I would not recommend buying this product if you are a serious nail artist. But would be great for kids. They are cheap in price and cheap in quality I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Colors don&#x27;t stay on to good</li>
            <li> about 5 bottles were opened in the bag when I got it, and got all over several other bottles, and there are about 5-8 colors that have gliter in the, and therefore the detailed pen won&#x27;t work because the glitter is too big to fit in the tip.</li>
            <li> The polish showed up in a bag.  When I contacted the company ETOP regarding the products materials, ie toxins or lead, I was simply answered without any reference to my email.  I am having the product tested before I give it to my grand daughter.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible. This product reminds me of the cheap nail polish you would buy from the discount store when I was little. Poorly made plastic bottles that arrived leaking. Runny watery colors that don&#x27;t show up on your nails. Complete waste of time and money. Garbage.</li>
            <li> Some of the nail polishes were damaged and were leaking.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful.  But the nail Polish itself was very watery and didn&#x27;t apply well to the nail.  I&#x27;m definitely disappointed in this set for the amount of money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Really nice color selection and great price</li>
            <li> I think the picture is very mis-leading! I was expecing the bottles to arrive in a circular carry/storage case. No instruction or suggestion sheet was enclosed, either. I was lucky to find a decent size plastic container with snal close, attached lid that the bottles just fit in. If I had not, my wife would have had thirty very small bottle all over the place in her nursing room space!&lt;br /&gt;But it was sort of worth it because of the offer of $30 off my order (for 2). Would I recommend it? Only slightly. You might want to shop for a better quality rather than quantity set.</li>
            <li> I love these so much I&#x27;m sooo happy with them I can do really cool designs with them and not have to worry about smudging the nail polish or I do t have to worry about having a lot of control of the skinny brush</li>
            <li> these clog easily and the polish blobs out, not happy at all, too many greens, not enough pinks, was hoping for a brown</li>
            <li> came by the date it said, dries fast and a perfect gift&lt;br /&gt;the smell is a bit too strong however</li>
            <li> Packing is not good.  Lot of the bottle got leaked. No use of buying.</li>
            <li> 30 tubes arrived, not 30 colors though...there were 13 colors in total, including 6 identical silver sparkles.  Three of the tubes leaked all over the bag, which came as no surprise, considering the horrible packaging.  The ones that did arrive are ok, nothing special.  Rather than being asked to write a review someone should be offering me a refund.  Save yourself the time and aggravation - buy something else.</li>
            <li> They are ok to play around with. White was not included.  Instead I got a glitter that is too big for the pen. Some leaks in shipping.  Not too bad.  Strong odor use in a well ventilated room.</li>
            <li> some were dried or too wateree</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!! MADE PAITTING YOUR NAIL ART SO EASY!</li>
            <li> They have a awful smell and they clog</li>
            <li> The pens took a while to get here, but it&#x27;s understandable. The colors are good, some colors had duplicates but it&#x27;s not like they won&#x27;t be used. Can&#x27;t figure out how the pen part works because the polish won&#x27;t come out, but i use it as a normal nail polish and make do. Great colors! That I will say</li>
            <li> The pen part of all thirty hat busted or leaked very bad in the pen part cap and the color rubs off easily</li>
    </ol>
